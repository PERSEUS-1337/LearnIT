    "content": "In June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense. The decision declared three provisions of the District of Columbia's Firearms Control Regulation Act unconstitutional, marking the first time in 70 years the Court addressed the Second Amendment's nature. However, the ruling left unanswered questions about the standard of scrutiny for gun laws. The report discusses the Second Amendment and its historical treatment by the courts, including the Heller decision. It also addresses the issue of incorporation in the McDonald case. The analysis focuses on the potential impact of these decisions on firearm legislation at various levels of government. The Second Amendment has sparked debates for years, with two main interpretations: the \"individual right model\" sees it as a personal right to bear arms, while the \"collective right model\" views it as protecting state militias. The \"sophisticated collective right model\" suggests individuals have a right to own firearms under the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is debated between the \"individual right model\" and the \"collective right model.\" The individual right model argues for personal firearm ownership tied to state militia service. It emphasizes the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\" as granting individual rights. This interpretation is supported by the distinction between \"the states\" and \"the people\" in the Tenth Amendment. The Second Amendment debate revolves around the individual right model versus the collective right model. The collective right model argues that the right to bear arms is tied to state militia service, limiting individual rights. This view is supported by the clause referring to a \"well regulated militia.\" Individual right theorists argue that the militia of the Founders' era included every citizen and that modern warfare does not negate the need for an armed citizenry. The debate over the Second Amendment revolves around the individual right model versus the collective right model. Proponents of the individual right model argue that every able-bodied male was part of the militia in the Founders' era and that technological advancements or societal changes should not diminish the individual right to bear arms. Federal appellate courts contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the Second Amendment interpretation before the Heller decision. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Miller prior to Heller touched upon the Second Amendment's scope. While commonly cited as supporting a collective right to bear arms, the Court's discussion suggested an individual right limited to militia context. The decision upheld a provision of the National Firearms Act requiring registration of sawed-off firearms. The Court upheld a provision of the National Firearms Act requiring registration of sawed-off shotguns. The Court discussed the meaning of \"militia\" in the Second Amendment, noting it referred to all males capable of acting for defense. Despite language supporting a collective right interpretation, the Court held that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms limited to militia context. The Court in Miller held that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear arms only if the weapon has a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia. The decision in Miller connected the right to bear arms with the militia but did not explore the implications further. Subsequent cases veered away from Miller's test, leading to the conclusion that the Second Amendment only protects a collective right to bear arms. This shift began with the 1942 Cases v. United States decision. The First Circuit in Cases v. United States departed from the Miller decision, questioning the Founders' intent for citizens to possess weapons like machine guns. The court introduced a new test focusing on the relationship of weapons to a well-regulated militia, suggesting that the Second Amendment may not protect individual possession of military-style weapons. The First Circuit in Cases v. United States introduced a new test focusing on whether an individual possessed a prohibited weapon as a militiaman. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Federal Firearms Act, stating that the government can regulate individuals from possessing weapons not used in their capacity as a militiaman. The court in Cases v. United States ruled that individuals cannot possess prohibited weapons unless used in their capacity as a militiaman. The Second Amendment does not confer an individual right to bear arms, but rather serves as a protection against federal government infringement. The Third Circuit's decision in United States v. Tot declared that the right to keep and bear arms was not adopted with individual rights in mind. This type of holding became the norm in cases addressing the Second Amendment, with courts increasingly referring to others' holdings without engaging in substantive legal analysis. The balance among federal appellate courts changed with the 2001 decision in United States v. Emerson. In United States v. Emerson, the Fifth Circuit Court held that the Second Amendment grants an individual right to bear arms, specifically addressing the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8) regarding domestic violence restraining orders. The court agreed with the district court's ruling that this provision could deprive citizens of their Second Amendment rights without specific evidence of future violence. The Fifth Circuit Court in United States v. Emerson affirmed that the Second Amendment protects individual Americans' right to keep and bear arms, regardless of militia membership or military service. The court rejected the collective rights interpretation of the Second Amendment, diverging from other circuit courts' views. The Fifth Circuit Court in United States v. Emerson affirmed the individual right model for interpreting the Second Amendment, protecting the rights of individuals to privately possess and bear firearms suitable for personal use. The court also acknowledged that these rights can be subject to reasonable restrictions. The Fifth Circuit Court in United States v. Emerson affirmed the individual right model for interpreting the Second Amendment, protecting the rights of individuals to privately possess and bear firearms suitable for personal use. The court also acknowledged that reasonable restrictions can be placed on particular cases, such as felons, infants, and those of unsound mind, from possessing firearms. The Emerson court found that the nexus between firearm possession by an enjoined party and the threat of violence was sufficient to establish the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8). The decision in Emerson affirmed the individual right model for interpreting the Second Amendment, marking the first time a circuit court adopted this interpretation. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit in Silveira rejected a Second Amendment challenge, adopting the collective rights model interpretation. The Ninth Circuit in Silveira rejected the individual rights view of the Second Amendment, contrary to the Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Emerson. Silveira acknowledged the need for a more thorough examination of the Second Amendment's meaning and addressed historical and textual arguments to support its collective rights model interpretation. The court in Silveira rejected the individual rights view of the Second Amendment, stating that it protects the people's right to maintain an effective state militia, not an individual right to own firearms. The historical record shows that the Second Amendment was adopted to ensure effective state militias, critical for preserving state integrity and freedom from federal tyranny. The Ninth Circuit held that the Second Amendment does not limit California's ability to regulate firearms, including assault weapons. The court's decision in Silveira, like Emerson, was based on the collective rights theory. Despite dissent from six judges, a rehearing en banc was denied. This presented the Supreme Court with two conflicting rulings for the first time. The Supreme Court faced conflicting circuit court decisions in Emerson and Silveira regarding the Second Amendment. Despite speculation, the Court denied certiorari in Silveira as no firearms laws were invalidated. This set the stage for a potential conflict in the 2007 case Parker v. District of Columbia. In Parker v. District of Columbia, a federal appellate court struck down a law regulating firearms based on the Second Amendment. The case involved six residents challenging provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including a ban on handgun registration and requirements for firearms to be kept unloaded or secured. The court dismissed claims of five plaintiffs for lack of standing, but allowed Dick Heller's claim as he was denied a handgun license. Heller's challenge to certain gun control laws was upheld as they imposed further restrictions on his rights. The court upheld Dick Heller's challenge to certain gun control laws, stating that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. The court emphasized the importance of the phrase \"the people\" in the amendment, similar to other constitutional provisions designed to protect individual rights. The court interpreted the Second Amendment's operative clause, affirming an individual's right to bear arms regardless of state organization requirements for a militia. The Parker court affirmed an individual's right to bear arms, stating that the popular nature of the militia is consistent with this right. The court rejected the District's argument that it was not subject to the Second Amendment, emphasizing that the Constitution and Bill of Rights apply to all entities. The Parker court affirmed the individual's right to bear arms, stating that the Constitution and Bill of Rights apply in the District. The court determined that modern handguns are descendants of pistols used in the Founding era and have a reasonable relationship to a well-regulated militia. The court affirmed the individual's right to bear arms, stating that the Second Amendment protects modern handguns as descendants of colonial pistols. The court emphasized that the government can still regulate gun ownership within reasonable limits, similar to restrictions on free speech under the First Amendment. The court upheld the individual's right to bear arms, stating that regulations such as prohibiting concealed carry or restricting convicted felons from owning guns do not violate the Second Amendment. Reasonable regulations like firearm registration and proficiency testing were deemed consistent with a 'well regulated Militia.' The court ruled that restrictions on handgun registration and carrying without a license violated Second Amendment protections. Handguns are considered 'Arms' under the Second Amendment, and restrictions on their use for self-defense are not permissible. Additionally, requirements for firearms to be kept unloaded and disassembled were also deemed unconstitutional. The court ruled restrictions on handgun registration and carrying without a license violated Second Amendment protections. Firearms must not be kept unloaded and disassembled. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if certain provisions violated Second Amendment rights. Oral arguments for Heller were heard on March 18, 2008. The Supreme Court Justices indicated support for an individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment during oral arguments for Heller. Chief Justice Roberts questioned why the amendment would mention \"the right of the people\" if it was limited to State militias. Justice Scalia saw no contradiction in interpreting the amendment as a personal guarantee. The framers intended for the Second Amendment to protect the right of the people to keep and bear arms in order to maintain a militia. Justice Kennedy supported an individual right interpretation, reaffirming the right to have a militia while establishing the right to bear arms. The Supreme Court held by a 5-4 vote that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm for self-defense, unconnected to militia service. Justice Kennedy suggested the Framers aimed to ensure the ability to defend against various threats. Justice Thomas also supported an individual right interpretation. The opinion extensively analyzed the text of the amendment. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense, separate from militia service. The Court analyzed the text of the amendment, focusing on the operative and prefatory clauses to determine the individual right to possess and carry weapons. The Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense, separate from militia service. The Court declared that the prefatory and operative clauses \"fit[] perfectly\" in light of historical concerns about the federal government disarming the people to disable the citizens' militia. The amendment was designed to prevent Congress from abridging the \"ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms\" to preserve the citizens' militia. The Court examined prior decisions related to the Second Amendment to determine if they foreclosed the conclusion that the right to bear arms is an individual right. The Court found that the decision in United States v. Cruikshank actually supports the individual-rights interpretation of the Second Amendment. The Court in Heller referenced the decision in Cruikshank, which described the Second Amendment right as \"bearing arms for a lawful purpose\" and emphasized protection against violations by fellow citizens. The Court also discussed the ruling in Presser v. Illinois, stating that it did not refute the individual-rights interpretation of the Amendment. The Heller Court rejected the assertion that the decision in United States v. Miller established that the Second Amendment only protects the right to keep and bear arms for certain military purposes. Miller did not hold that, as it was based on the type of weapon not being eligible for Second Amendment protection. The Heller Court suggested that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-preservation or efficiency. The Court in Heller determined that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to certain types of weapons, not just those serving in the militia. The right is not unlimited and does not allow for the keeping and carrying of any weapons for any purpose. The Court in Heller determined that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to certain types of weapons, not unlimited, and does not allow for the keeping and carrying of any weapons for any purpose. The Court's opinion indicates that current federal firearm laws are constitutionally tenable, including prohibitions on possession by felons and the mentally ill, carrying in sensitive places, and regulations on commercial sale of arms. The Court also recognizes limitations on the right to keep and carry arms. The Court in Heller affirmed the Second Amendment right to self-defense and ruled unconstitutional the DC handgun ban, stating it violated the historical tradition of prohibiting \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\" The Court did not specify a standard of review for Second Amendment issues but emphasized the importance of the right to keep and carry arms. The Supreme Court in Heller ruled that the DC handgun ban violated constitutional rights and the requirement for firearms to be disassembled or locked was also unconstitutional. The Court did not address the licensing requirement but noted it could be permissible if enforced fairly. The District of Columbia amended its firearms laws to comply with the ruling, but there have been ongoing legislative changes. For more information on DC gun laws, refer to CRS Report R40474, DC Gun Laws and Proposed Amendments. The Supreme Court's decision in Heller addressed the individual right to possess a firearm but left many constitutional questions unanswered. The Court acknowledged criticism for not providing historical justification for regulations on the right. The Supreme Court's decision in Heller did not clarify the entire field of the Second Amendment, leaving open questions on the standard of scrutiny for laws regulating firearms possession. The Court rejected a rational basis scrutiny test but did not establish a specific standard. The Supreme Court in Heller rejected a rational basis scrutiny test for laws regulating firearms possession, stating that the Second Amendment would be redundant with separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws. The Court also dismissed the idea of an \"interest-balancing inquiry\" for assessing the core protection of enumerated constitutional rights. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago settled the issue of whether the Second Amendment applies to the states. The Court analyzed incorporation and the application of the Bill of Rights to state governments. The Supreme Court is inquiring about the application of the first eight amendments to the states, the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporating protections from the Bill of Rights. Initially, the Court ruled in Barron v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore that the Bill of Rights only applied to the federal government, not state or local governments. The Supreme Court initially ruled in Barron v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore that the Bill of Rights only applied to the federal government, not state or local governments. Chief Justice Marshall observed that each state established its own constitution with limitations on government power. The Court rejected the argument that the Bill of Rights applied directly to the states until after the Civil War when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, allowing for judicial protection through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The Supreme Court, in the Slaughter-House Cases, narrowly construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating it was not meant to protect individuals from state government actions or invalidate state laws. The Supreme Court in the Slaughter-House Cases distinguished between citizenship of the United States and citizenship of a state, stating that privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States are protected by the Federal Constitution, while those of citizens of a state are left to state governments for protection. The Supreme Court in the Slaughter-House Cases distinguished between citizenship of the United States and citizenship of a state, stating that privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States are protected by the Federal Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates provisions of the Bill of Rights, making them applicable to state and local governments. The Supreme Court established that certain personal rights protected by the first eight Amendments could also be safeguarded against state action under the Due Process Clause. This selective incorporation doctrine incorporates specific provisions of the Bill of Rights into state and local government actions. In Gitlow v. New York, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court found incorporation of fundamental personal rights, including freedom of speech and press, into state actions. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments provide protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and cruel and unusual punishment. The Court has established tests to determine if a provision of the Bill of Rights is incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Various tests determine if a provision of the Bill of Rights is incorporated through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court in Duncan v. Louisiana summarized these formulations, emphasizing the importance of fundamental principles of liberty and justice. The Court also discussed whether a particular procedure is fundamental to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty. Over 100 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Cruikshank that the Second Amendment does not constrain state law. The Supreme Court in Cruikshank stated that the Second Amendment does not act as a constraint on state law, reaffirmed in Presser v. Illinois. The Court believed that states cannot prohibit citizens from bearing arms, as it is necessary for maintaining public security and fulfilling duties to the government. The Supreme Court decisions in Cruikshank and Presser v. Illinois affirmed that states cannot prohibit citizens from owning firearms as it would interfere with the United States' reliance on its reserved military force. Heller commented on incorporation issues related to the Second Amendment. After the Heller decision, three courts of appeals addressed whether the Second Amendment applies to the states. The Second Circuit and Seventh Circuit held that it does not, while the Ninth Circuit in Nordyke v. King held that it is applicable to the states. The Ninth Circuit in Nordyke v. King held that the Second Amendment applies to the states, but later vacated its decision in light of McDonald. The Second Circuit addressed a similar issue in Maloney v. Rice, where a plaintiff challenged a New York law on nunchukas. The court ruled that the state law did not violate the Second Amendment, citing Presser. Despite potential questions raised by Heller, the court followed Presser as Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court precedent in Presser directs lower courts to follow it when it has direct application, even if it conflicts with other decisions. In National Rifle Association v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit held that the Second Amendment does not apply to states. The NRA appealed the dismissal of its suits against two municipalities, arguing that Heller only applies to laws enacted by the national government. The Seventh Circuit's decision contradicted the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Nordyke v. King. The Seventh Circuit referenced Supreme Court decisions in Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller, stating that they still control the case despite Heller questioning Cruikshank. The Ninth Circuit's decision in Nordyke v. King incorporated the Second Amendment against states and local governments, leading to a rehearing en banc. The Ninth Circuit vacated a panel decision in April 2009 and remanded the case for further consideration following the McDonald decision. The court examined the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, considering three doctrinal ways it could apply to the states. Incorporation through the first two options was precluded, leading to an analysis under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court analyzed selective incorporation and substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. It considered whether a right is fundamental and protected by substantive due process, applying a standard used by the Supreme Court outside of incorporation contexts. The Ninth Circuit examined whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental and deeply rooted in American history and tradition, referencing Moore v. City of East Cleveland. The court in Nordyke applied the standard from Moore to determine the incorporation of this right under substantive due process. The Ninth Circuit conducted a substantive due process analysis on the incorporation of the Second Amendment, concluding that the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental and applies against state and local governments. This decision was based on historical analysis and the importance of the right to ordered liberty. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Second Amendment is a fundamental right but did not apply strict scrutiny to a county ordinance prohibiting firearms on county property. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago affirmed the right to keep handguns. The Chicago and Oak Park ordinances prohibited handgun possession, leading to a ban on private citizens owning handguns. Petitioners argued for Second Amendment incorporation under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court case involved arguments for Second Amendment incorporation via the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Alito's opinion, joined by four other Justices, concluded that the Second Amendment is incorporated through the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court case addressed the incorporation of the Second Amendment through the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Alito's opinion, supported by four other Justices, concluded that the Second Amendment is incorporated through the Due Process Clause. Dissenting opinions by Justices Stevens and Breyer, along with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor, raised concerns about the uncertainty of the right to bear arms and the potential intrusion on state police power. The Supreme Court, led by Justice Alito, revisited precedents on the incorporation of the Second Amendment through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court examined the evolution of its Due Process Clause analysis before considering the incorporation of the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court, under Justice Alito, reevaluated its approach to the Due Process Clause analysis, focusing on protecting fundamental rights deeply rooted in tradition and essential to a fair justice system. It questioned the necessity of certain procedural safeguards and acknowledged that not all rights in the Bill of Rights are covered by the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court, under Justice Alito, reevaluated its approach to the Due Process Clause analysis, focusing on protecting fundamental rights deeply rooted in tradition and essential to a fair justice system. It questioned the necessity of certain procedural safeguards and acknowledged that not all rights in the Bill of Rights are covered by the Due Process Clause. The Court has abandoned certain characteristics in its incorporation of rights, now focusing on whether a guarantee is fundamental to our system of justice. The Court, under Justice Alito, reevaluated its approach to the Due Process Clause, focusing on protecting fundamental rights deeply rooted in tradition. It questioned the necessity of certain procedural safeguards and acknowledged that not all rights in the Bill of Rights are covered by the Due Process Clause. The Court has abandoned certain characteristics in its incorporation of rights, now focusing on whether a guarantee is fundamental to our system of justice. Lastly, the Court has stated that the Fourteenth Amendment applies the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights to the States under the same standards as federal encroachment. The Court analyzed whether the Second Amendment is a fundamental right incorporated in the concept of due process. The Court's decision in Heller emphasized self-defense as a basic right and focused on whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporated the Second Amendment for lawful purposes such as keeping and bearing arms. The Court in Heller defined the right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes like self-defense, protecting weapons typically owned by law-abiding citizens. Historical evidence from the Framing-era and ratifying era of the Fourteenth Amendment showed that the right to bear arms was considered fundamental to the system of government by both Federalists and Antifederalists, with differing views on its protection. Federalists believed the limited powers of the federal government were sufficient, while Antifederalists feared government infringement on traditional rights. The Court found that the Second Amendment was valued for self-defense, even as the threat of government intrusion faded. After the Civil War, legislative actions like the Freedmen's Bureau Act and Civil Rights Act of 1866 recognized the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. The Civil Rights Act and the Freedmen's Bureau Act aimed to secure equal rights for all citizens, including the right to bear arms, regardless of race or previous condition of slavery. Representative Bingham believed the Civil Rights Act protected the same rights as the Freedmen's Bureau bill. The Civil Rights Act and the Freedmen's Bureau Act aimed to protect the right to bear arms and ensure equal rights for all citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment provided a constitutional basis for these rights, with the Court emphasizing the historical recognition of the right to keep and bear arms as fundamental. Incorporation under the Due Process Clause was found, with a discussion on the Privileges or Immunities Clause regarding the imposition of the Second Amendment on the states. The Court focused on the assertion that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment would only outlaw discriminatory measures, stating five reasons why such a construction would be \"implausible.\" The Supreme Court analyzed the Freedmen's Bureau Act and the Second Amendment, emphasizing the need for more than just a prohibition of racial discrimination. Justice Thomas disagreed with the majority's decision and explored the application of the Second Amendment through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Justice Thomas criticized the Court's precedent on the Due Process Clause, emphasizing the need to determine the extent of protection for specific rights under the Privileges or Immunities Clause based on the understanding of ordinary citizens at the time of ratification. He highlighted the established meaning of 'privileges' and 'immunities' as synonyms for 'rights' and traced their English roots to support his argument. Justice Thomas criticized the Court's precedent on the Due Process Clause, emphasizing the need to determine the extent of protection for specific rights under the Privileges or Immunities Clause based on the understanding of ordinary citizens at the time of ratification. He highlighted the established meaning of 'privileges' and 'immunities' as synonyms for 'rights' and traced their English roots to support his argument. Additionally, he concluded that the Founding generation viewed rights as inalienable and recognized the inalienable rights of state citizenship. He also noted the textual similarity between Article IV, \u00a7 2 and the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, suggesting that the public's understanding of the former informed their understanding of the latter. Justice Thomas explored whether the Second Amendment was guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause by examining the similarities between the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States and citizens in the several States. He presented evidence from various sources, such as treaties and congressional speeches, to demonstrate that the ratifying public understood the former. Justice Thomas concluded that the ratifying public understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep and bear arms. He also questioned whether the Clause requires States to recognize those rights or merely prohibits discrimination among citizens if they recognize the Second Amendment's right. Thomas emphasized that leaving each State to decide which privileges or immunities of United States citizenship to recognize would provide little protection for liberty. Justice Thomas emphasized that the Privileges or Immunities Clause imposes a limitation on state power to infringe upon pre-existing substantive rights, not just to prohibit discrimination. He argued that the Clause establishes a \"minimum baseline of rights for all American citizens.\" Justice Thomas argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause sets a minimum baseline of rights for all citizens, not just to prohibit discrimination. He pointed to historical events showing the need for federal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to bear arms. Thomas, echoing the Court, emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment aimed to protect African-Americans from abuses by state militia and peace officers, not just discriminatory laws. He argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause establishes a minimum baseline of federal rights for all citizens, including the right to bear arms. Justice Stevens began his dissent by rephrasing the question presented, focusing on whether the Constitution guarantees individuals a fundamental right to possess a firearm within the home, including a handgun. He argued that procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights do not impact the meaning of \"liberty\" in the Fourteenth Amendment or the protection of nonprocedural rights like the Second Amendment. Substantive due process analysis is necessary to determine this. Justice Stevens' dissent in the Second Amendment case emphasized the need for a substantive due process analysis to determine if the Second Amendment applies to the states. He outlined three key principles from the Court's case law: rights protected by the Due Process Clause are not just procedural, substantive due process is about personal liberty, and state infringement does not have to mirror federal infringement. He also warned about the potential costs of federal court involvement. Justice Stevens disagreed with the plurality on the incorporation of rights under the Due Process Clause, emphasizing that historical pedigree should not be the sole determinant. He argued for a liberty-based approach focusing on the functional significance of rights, cautioning against imposing a uniform national standard that may conflict with varying local regulatory interests and states' core police powers. Justice Stevens focused on the functional significance of rights rather than historical conceptions, examining the nature of the right asserted by petitioners. He noted the ambivalent relationship firearms have with liberty, acknowledging their usefulness for self-defense but also their potential for harm. Stevens found the petitioners' argument for firearm possession in the home to have merit but ultimately supported the respondents due to concerns about destabilizing ordered liberty. Justice Stevens argued that the right to possess a firearm is different from other liberties recognized under the Due Process Clause and is not inherently linked to ordered liberty. He also emphasized that the Second Amendment is a federalism provision aimed at preserving state autonomy, making it unsuitable for incorporation by federal courts. Justice Stevens emphasized that the Second Amendment is a federalism provision aimed at preserving state autonomy, stating that the reasons behind it have limited relevance in today's crime-ridden cities. He agreed with the Seventh Circuit that states have the right to place restrictions on gun ownership, highlighting the importance of federalism over individual gun rights. Additionally, he noted that the Court's ruling would impact state sovereignty and highlighted the diverse patterns of gun violence and lawful gun use across different states and localities. Justice Stevens emphasized the Second Amendment as a federalism provision for state autonomy, supporting state restrictions on gun ownership. Justice Scalia critiqued the subjective nature of the dissent's standard, arguing against excessive judicial power. Justice Breyer, with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor, disagreed with incorporating a general right to bear firearms for self-defense under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Breyer disagreed with considering the Second Amendment right to private self-defense as 'fundamental' for application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, citing uncertainty in the historical basis of the Heller decision. Justice Breyer disagreed with extending the Second Amendment right to private self-defense to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment due to uncertainty in Heller's historical foundations. He argued that historical status is not the only relevant consideration and proposed considering factors like the nature of the right, contemporary disagreement, constitutional aims, and structural aims of the Constitution. Breyer applied these factors to the private right of self-defense, a central component of the Second Amendment according to Heller. Justice Breyer disagreed with incorporating the private right of self-defense recognized in Heller into the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. He argued that there is no consensus on the fundamental nature of the right, incorporation may not serve broader constitutional objectives, and it could disrupt the balance of decision-making authority between the States and the Federal Government. Breyer emphasized that determining the constitutionality of state gun laws involves complex empirical questions that courts may not be equipped to handle. Justice Breyer argued that courts lack the expertise to balance the right to bear arms against public safety concerns. He suggested adopting a state court approach for examining gun regulations but noted the Supreme Court's rejection of this. Breyer also emphasized the importance of historical context in determining incorporation of the Second Amendment. Justice Breyer questioned whether there is a consensus on the substantial private self-defense right described in Heller applying to the States, citing ambiguity in historical evidence. The plurality opinion criticized his dissent for lacking popular consensus on the fundamental nature of the right. The plurality opinion criticized Justice Breyer's dissent for lacking popular consensus on the fundamental nature of the Second Amendment right, arguing that it protects minorities and residents of high-crime areas. Incorporation may limit states' legislative freedom, but the plurality was not persuaded by this argument. The Court held that the Second Amendment applies to the states, but did not determine if the challenged ordinances violated the amendment, leaving that issue for the lower court to decide. Many questions regarding the scope of the Second Amendment remain unanswered. The Court in Heller addressed the standard of judicial scrutiny for firearms laws under the Second Amendment, rejecting a rational basis standard and Justice Breyer's proposed \"interest-balancing\" inquiry. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the states have been grappling with the implications of the Heller decision. Since the McDonald case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in United States v. Marzzarella established a framework for evaluating Second Amendment cases. The court considered whether a federal ban on unmarked firearms was constitutional, applying a two-pronged approach suggested by Heller. The defendant argued that firearms without serial numbers should be protected under the Second Amendment, but the court was not persuaded by this argument. The court in United States v. Marzzarella did not find firearms without serial numbers to be categorically protected under the Second Amendment. The court acknowledged that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k) burdened the defendant's Second Amendment right but noted that the law did not severely limit firearm possession and could still pass muster under varying levels of scrutiny. The court in United States v. Marzzarella found that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k) does not severely limit firearm possession and could still pass muster under varying levels of scrutiny. The Second Amendment right for lawful self-defense may extend beyond the home, but it is unclear how far this protection may reach. Heller suggested that the self-defense right could potentially extend further upon \"future evaluation.\" The Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not an unlimited right, as indicated by the Supreme Court in cases like Heller and McDonald. The Court has emphasized that certain regulations on firearms, such as those prohibiting possession by felons and the mentally ill, do not infringe on the Second Amendment. Heller also pointed out that colonial-era ordinances did not restrict the right of self-defense as much as an absolute ban on handguns. The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, but regulations must not burden the right of self-defense. The protection extends to common weapons, like handguns, but not dangerous or unusual ones. Challenges to bans on assault weapons have been upheld. Recent challenges to state and local \"assault weapons\" bans have been upheld, citing that these weapons are not typically possessed for lawful purposes like sport hunting or self-defense but are considered weapons of war. Courts have ruled that prohibiting these dangerous and unusual weapons does not violate the Second Amendment as defined in the Heller case. Future litigation is expected on the scope of the Second Amendment. Future litigation on the scope of the Second Amendment is expected as courts may draw from existing frameworks or develop their own standards. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected a Second Amendment challenge to a federal provision prohibiting persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence from possessing firearms. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a decision providing guidance on the framework for deciding Second Amendment challenges, following a two-pronged approach delineated in a previous case. The Fourth Circuit applied a two-pronged approach from Marzzarella to evaluate Second Amendment challenges. They noted that historical data is inconclusive on whether the Second Amendment applies to felons, requiring evaluation of the person rather than the conduct. The case was remanded to the district court for further review. The Fourth Circuit applied a two-pronged approach from Marzzarella to evaluate Second Amendment challenges, noting that historical data is inconclusive on whether the Second Amendment applies to felons. The court declared that the government must meet the intermediate scrutiny standard, not strict scrutiny, for felons like the defendant with a criminal history as a domestic violence misdemeanant."
