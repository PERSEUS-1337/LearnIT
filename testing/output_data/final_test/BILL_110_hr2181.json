    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that Bangladeshi citizen Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed, wrongly convicted of murder in 1996, is facing imminent deportation and execution in the United States. The circumstances of his trial and conviction raise suspicions warranting immediate intervention to prevent his deportation. Ahmed, a Bangladeshi citizen wrongly convicted of murder in 1996, faces certain execution by hanging in Bangladesh if the US Department of Homeland Security does not intervene. He served in the East Pakistani military before Bangladesh's independence and was ordered to station his men near the Prime Minister's home on August 15, 1975. Ahmed, a Bangladeshi citizen, was wrongly convicted of murder in 1996 and faces execution in Bangladesh. He had no knowledge of nor supported the violent coup that killed the Prime Minister and his family. Ahmed later served as a diplomat until Sheikh Hasina Wajed broke her promise to respect the Bangladeshi constitutional amendment. Sheikh Hasina Wajed orchestrated the repeal of the Bangladeshi constitutional amendment providing immunity to officers involved in the 1975 coup. Ahmed, wrongly convicted of murder in 1996, was sentenced to death in absentia without the opportunity to question the trial's fairness or present new evidence. Din applied for asylum in the United States but was denied. Ahmed, convicted of murder in Bangladesh, sought asylum in the US but was denied due to changes in immigration law post-9/11. The 9th Circuit Court upheld the denial, prompting the search for a country that respects human rights and does not have the death penalty for him to seek safe-haven. SEC. 2. DEFERRAL OF ACTION ON DEPORTATION: Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed's deportation order is indefinitely stayed, and he is granted deferred action status, released from ICE custody with an order of supervision. He will not be deported to Bangladesh or any country with an extradition treaty with Bangladesh or the death penalty. Certain relatives receive preferential immigration treatment. Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed is eligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Upon granting of permanent residence, the immigrant visa number will be reduced by 1. The proper officer will reduce immigrant visas by 1 for natives of the alien's birth country under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The spouse of Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed will receive the same immigration rights as him. Mohuiddin A.K.M. Ahmed is allowed to seek asylum in a foreign nation under the Immigration and Nationality Act."
