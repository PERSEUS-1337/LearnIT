The 109th Congress addressed USDA spending in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, resulting in $2.7 billion in mandatory spending reductions over five years. Changes in farm commodity payments and cuts to conservation, rural development, and research spending were key areas affected. Additionally, the House and Senate have taken steps towards passing the FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill, which will fund USDA agencies and programs. Several major weather events in 2005 and 2006, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and a widespread drought, prompted the 109th Congress to consider emergency disaster assistance for farmers. Congress has provided about $1.6 billion in agricultural assistance in response to the 2005 hurricanes. The Senate-reported version of the FY2006 agriculture appropriations bill contains $4.0 billion in various forms of farm assistance, including payments for major crop and livestock losses caused by any 2005 disaster. The 109th Congress considered emergency disaster assistance for farmers in response to major weather events in 2005 and 2006, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Senate-reported version of the FY2006 agriculture appropriations bill included $4.0 billion in farm assistance, such as payments for crop and livestock losses from any 2005 disaster. Farm income and price support programs are primarily governed by the 2002 farm bill, which is set to expire in 2007. Congress is debating whether to extend current farm support policies amidst concerns about federal spending constraints, farm program benefit distribution, and potential challenges from the World Trade Organization. The potential WTO challenges to farm price and income support spending will force Congress to consider significant changes to existing farm policy. Most crop payments are subject to annual per-person limits, with past efforts to reduce payment limits facing strong opposition from southern cotton and rice growers. Legislative proposals to reduce payment limits to $250,000 have been unsuccessful in the past. The Administration's FY2007 budget request includes a proposal to tighten crop payment limits. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program provides payments to dairy farmers when milk prices are below a target level. The program's authority was extended through September 30, 2007, but no payments are allowed beyond August 31, 2007. A provision in the House-reported version of the FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill would have allowed payments in September 2007, but it was deleted due to budget implications. In 2007, the provision for tightening crop payment limits was deleted on the House floor due to budget implications. Congress also passed a measure requiring regulation of a large dairy operation exempt from federally mandated minimum milk prices. In response to a WTO ruling against the US in a dispute with Brazil over the cotton program, Congress authorized the elimination of the Step-2 cotton program in 2006. Since the WTO ruling against the US in a dispute with Brazil over the cotton program, Brazil has pushed for further reductions in U.S. cotton support. A compliance panel was established by the WTO to assess if current U.S. actions comply with the ruling, potentially requiring additional changes to U.S. farm programs. Congress would likely decide on any necessary modifications in the 2007 farm bill. Spending on conservation programs has increased since the 2002 farm bill. Spending on conservation programs, which have grown rapidly since the 2002 farm bill, reached over $5.2 billion in FY2005. The 109th Congress reduced spending on some mandatory conservation programs by $934 million over five years. Congressional interest remains in the implementation of the Conservation Security Program, with questions raised about limited funding and implementation in only a few watersheds. Conservation policy options are being explored by environmental, conservation, and agriculture communities. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees are examining conservation issues for the next farm bill. Agriculture is a major energy consumer, and high energy prices could impact farm incomes. Agriculture is also seen as a potential producer of renewable fuels. Agriculture is considered a potential producer of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel, with the energy bill including a renewable fuels standard for biofuels. The goal is to increase U.S. ethanol production through incentives and trade policies to improve market access for agricultural products. The U.S. officials are involved in trade negotiations focusing on agricultural trade liberalization, including reducing subsidies and improving market access. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority next year sets a deadline for reaching an agreement. The U.S. is linking domestic subsidy reduction to the EU improving market access and G-20 countries opening their markets. The G-20 countries are willing to open their markets to agricultural, industrial products, and services. The 109th Congress passed legislation to implement the DR-CAFTA despite opposition from the U.S. sugar industry. The U.S. is negotiating new free trade agreements with various countries. Ongoing issues include rules for agricultural biotechnology products. The 109th Congress passed legislation to implement the DR-CAFTA despite opposition from the U.S. sugar industry. Ongoing issues of interest to Congress include rules of trade for agricultural biotechnology products, restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba, and funding for U.S. agricultural export and food aid programs. Agroterrorism is recognized as a national security threat, leading to increased attention on \"food defense\" measures since 2001. Some in Congress are pushing for additional laws or oversight to enhance food defense, focusing on interagency coordination, response leadership, and border inspections. Approximately 76 million people in the U.S. fall ill and 5,000 die from food-related illnesses annually. Congress is actively involved in oversight and legislation on food safety, including control of animal diseases, regulation of bioengineered foods, antimicrobial resistance, and fresh produce safety. In the 109th Congress, legislation was proposed to consolidate U.S. food safety oversight under an independent agency and clarify USDA's authority in setting standards for reducing pathogens in meat and poultry products. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or \"mad cow disease\") cases in North America have caused economic impact on the beef industry, with minimal risk to human health. The appearance of BSE in North America in 2003 raised meat safety concerns and disrupted trade for cattle and beef producers. Congress has been working on rebuilding foreign markets for U.S. beef and addressing concerns over protecting cattle and the public from diseases like avian flu. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has spread globally, but not yet in the United States, highlighting the importance of on-farm biosecurity to prevent a human pandemic. Congress responded to the threat of avian flu by providing emergency funding in FY2006, with $91 million allocated for USDA operations. Additional funding of $82 million is requested for FY2007. Mandatory COOL for fresh meats, produce, and peanuts was postponed for two years in the FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations Act. Some Members support mandatory COOL, while others seek to replace it with different measures. Some bills aim to make country-of-origin labeling (COOL) voluntary for fresh meats, fish, and produce. The FY2006 agriculture appropriation bill barred the use of funds for ante-mortem inspection of horses for food, with a funding ban effective for the last six months of FY2006. Foreign-owned plants in the U.S. currently slaughter horses for European and Japanese consumers and are paying user fees for inspection during this time. Legislation such as H.R. 503 and S. 1915 aim to ban horse slaughter, while bills like S. 1779 and H.R. 3931 seek to prohibit nonambulatory livestock from being used for human food. The CFTC regulates the futures trading industry and requires periodic reauthorization. The CFTC's reauthorization process began in 2005 after the current authority expired. Congress considers amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act during this process. Key issues in the debate include regulation of energy derivatives markets, security futures, foreign futures exchanges, and the legality of certain practices. The 109th Congress is discussing the connection between farm labor and immigration policies, particularly focusing on the use of workers from Mexico by U.S. employers. This is part of a larger debate on implementing a guest worker program, increasing border enforcement, and imposing employer sanctions to reduce unauthorized workers in the United States. The House and Senate are debating immigration reform measures that have implications for hired farm labor. Other bills introduced in the 109th Congress specifically address agricultural labor issues."
