    "title": "AB 302",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions, including discrimination against pregnant and parenting pupils. Federal regulations specify that discrimination includes pregnancy-related conditions and requires equal treatment for pupils with temporary medical conditions due to pregnancy or childbirth recovery. The Sex Equity in Education Act and Unruh Civil Rights Act prohibit sex discrimination in educational institutions, including discrimination against pregnant and parenting pupils. Businesses, including public schools, are prohibited from discriminating based on sex, including pregnancy-related conditions. Denial of accommodations for breast-feeding or expressing breast milk at school is also prohibited sex discrimination. California schools are failing to accommodate lactating pupil parents by not providing them with reasonable time and private space to express breast milk or breast-feed on campus. A new section in the Education Code requires schools to provide lactating pupils with private and secure rooms for these purposes. The Education Code in California now mandates schools to provide lactating pupils with accommodations such as access to a breast pump, power source, and safe storage for expressed milk. Lactating pupils must be given a reasonable amount of time to express milk or breast-feed, without facing academic penalties. Schools can use existing facilities to meet these requirements if at least one lactating pupil is present on campus. A complaint of noncompliance with lactating pupil accommodations can be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures. The agency must respond and if unsatisfied, the complainant can appeal to the department for a written decision within 60 days. If a local educational agency or the Superintendent finds merit in a complaint, a remedy must be provided to the affected pupil. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be made to local agencies and school districts by the Commission on State Mandates."
