    "content": "Courts have generally agreed that the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) does not establish a new privilege against disclosing classified information, but rather sets procedures to determine its materiality in criminal cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated that CIPA assumes a governmental privilege in criminal matters. This report will first discuss the government's ability to restrict disclosures in civil cases through the state secrets privilege before delving into CIPA's specifics in criminal prosecutions. The state secrets privilege, established in the 1953 case of United States v. Reynolds, allows the government to withhold information that could harm national security. While the privilege is absolute in civil litigation, it does not always lead to dismissal of the lawsuit. Courts vary in their approach to cases involving the state secrets privilege. Courts vary in their approach to cases involving the state secrets privilege, which allows the government to withhold information that could harm national security. The assertion of the privilege can either dismiss a claim entirely or exclude privileged evidence from further litigation, depending on the specific facts of the case. Prosecutions involving classified information differ based on whether the defendant already has access to the information in question. In cases of leaking classified information, the government may seek to prevent further disclosure, while in terrorism prosecutions, the concern is typically preventing harm. In terrorism prosecutions, classified information may be withheld from the defendant and the public through protective orders. Constitutional issues arise during discovery and trial phases, with the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) providing provisions to address these issues. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides provisions for resolving issues related to the use of classified information in advance of trial. Parties can request a pretrial conference to discuss disclosure of classified information, schedules for discovery requests, and hearings to determine relevance. Defendants must notify the court and prosecution of any classified information they expect to disclose. Failure to do so may result in the exclusion of such evidence at trial. The government can also appeal CIPA rulings before trial to prevent premature disclosure of classified information. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) allows for interlocutory appeals of rulings to prevent premature disclosure of classified information. Courts can issue protective orders to safeguard disclosed classified information, including limiting disclosure to individuals or attorneys with security clearances. In some cases, defendants may be ineligible for security clearances, and their attorneys may be prohibited from sharing classified information with them. In cases where defendants or their attorneys are unable to obtain security clearances, courts may appoint cleared counsel to handle classified information. However, cleared counsel may be restricted from sharing this information with the defendant or uncleared defense counsel. This was exemplified in a case where the defendant's attorneys had security clearances but the defendant did not, leading to a limitation on sharing classified information. The Second Circuit rejected the defendant's claim that restrictions on communication violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, citing the potential security risks of disclosing classified information. Cleared defense counsel were allowed to discuss relevant facts with the defendant, but not all information was shared due to security concerns. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure govern discovery in federal criminal litigation. Defendants can request information and evidence from the prosecution, including classified information. The court can allow redactions, summaries, or admission of relevant facts instead of providing discovery. The government can submit an affidavit explaining why the defendant is not entitled to certain information. The prosecution must provide certain classes of information to the defendant upon request, such as Brady material which includes exculpatory evidence. This encompasses witness statements that contradict the prosecution's theory. Prosecutors are responsible for information held by closely aligned agencies. The courts have not addressed if information exclusively held by the intelligence community falls under this category. Jencks material refers to written statements by prosecution witnesses. The Jencks material includes written statements by prosecution witnesses, with high impeachment value to show inconsistency or incompleteness in court testimony. The Jencks Act codified this requirement, and it may differ from Brady material in the context of classified information under CIPA. Prosecution can request redacted or substituted classified information to prevent harm to national security. In some cases, the court may reject redacted information to protect national security without the defendant's input. United States v. Moussaoui raised the issue of granting pre-trial access to government witnesses, allowing the defendant to depose \"enemy combatant\" witnesses considered intelligence assets. The Fourth Circuit determined that a deposition was warranted to preserve potentially exculpatory testimony. The Fourth Circuit considered providing the defendant with substitutes for depositions of witnesses due to national security concerns. The substitutes needed to put the defendant in a similar position as if the depositions had been provided. The Fourth Circuit suggested that government-produced summaries of witness statements could be used as substitutes for depositions in cases involving national security concerns. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) allows the government to request a hearing to determine the relevance and admissibility of classified information, which may be conducted in camera to prevent disclosure. If classified information is deemed material to the defense but the government objects to its disclosure, the court must accept the objection and impose nondisclosure orders on the defendant. The court can dismiss the indictment or impose sanctions if classified information is deemed material under CIPA. The government must choose between disclosing the information or facing court sanctions. CIPA allows for alterations to evidence to introduce relevant information in a different form. Substitutions can be made during discovery or at trial. The court, upon a sufficient showing, may allow the government to delete, substitute, or summarize classified information. If a substitute is rejected, the Attorney General can object to disclosure, leading to possible sanctions or dismissal of the indictment. The court may allow the government to make evidentiary substitutions for classified information in cases involving federal prosecutions of former intelligence officials. This authority is granted under Section 6(c) of CIPA. Two recent cases, United States v. Drake and United States v. Sterling, provide examples of courts permitting such substitutions. CIPA allows the government to make evidentiary substitutions for classified information in criminal prosecutions. Prosecutors have also sought substitutions for unclassified information that could threaten national security. In United States v. Drake, substitutions were sought for evidence protected under a statutory privilege applicable to the NSA. The case involved a former NSA employee accused of leaking classified information about inefficient resource use in a secret program. The government provided proposed evidentiary substitutions for admissible evidence in a secret program case, arguing that unclassified evidence was protected material under a statutory privilege. Admissibility decisions under CIPA remained subject to various privileges, including statutory and military laws. The government argued for the use of substitutions for unclassified evidence in a secret program case, citing statutory privileges. The defense objected, stating that CIPA only applied to classified information and did not allow for substitutions for unclassified evidence. The defense also questioned the validity of the NSA privilege in criminal cases. The defense challenged the NSA privilege in a criminal trial, arguing that CIPA does not prohibit substitutions for unclassified information protected by government privilege. The federal district court ruled that substitutions could be allowed for unclassified information, citing the court's authority to accept or reject such substitutions. This decision was influenced by a previous case where the government's objection to providing a witness was upheld by the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit accepted the government's position that CIPA was not applicable to unclassified testimony, but provided a framework for substitutions. The court allowed the witness to be deposed with precautions, citing the NSA privilege as a basis for substitutions. The court also considered whether the NSA privilege applied in criminal cases, as no court had ruled on this issue before. The district court applied the NSA statutory privilege in criminal cases by analogy to the state secrets privilege. This allowed the NSA to submit substitutions for unclassified evidence. Another issue arose regarding whether CIPA permits the government to submit substitutions for its own evidence in criminal leak prosecutions. In CIPA cases, the defense submits a 5(a) notice disclosing classified information expected at trial. The court holds hearings to determine relevance and admissibility of classified evidence. The government may propose substitutions for classified information. In United States v. Sterling, the government sought to submit substitutions for its own classified evidence. In the case of United States v. Sterling, the defense objected to the prosecution's use of substitutions for classified evidence, arguing that CIPA only allows substitutions for the defense's evidence, not the government's. The defense in United States v. Sterling argued that CIPA was intended to allow the defense access to classified information without impeding a fair trial, and to prevent \"graymail\" tactics. They contended that CIPA does not distinguish between evidence introduced by the defense and the prosecution. The government argued that CIPA allows for substitutions of evidence regardless of which party introduces it, citing the text of CIPA and legislative history. The government argued that CIPA allows for substitutions of evidence at trial, regardless of which party introduces it. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia rejected the defense's interpretation of CIPA and permitted limited substitutions and redactions in exhibits deemed relevant. The court ruled in favor of the government, indicating that the government's arguments were persuasive. The cases of Drake and Sterling show that CIPA is not the only way to prevent disclosure of sensitive information in criminal proceedings. CIPA does not change evidence rules and allows the court to protect classified information. It supplements the court's authority in resolving evidentiary disputes involving classified information in criminal cases. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) helps resolve evidentiary disputes in criminal cases involving classified information. It serves the purpose of protecting classified information and may implicate constitutional concerns. In some cases, the prosecution may present evidence at trial in a way that avoids disclosing classified information to the defendant. The defendant may be physically excluded from parts of the trial, while their counsel remains present, raising Sixth Amendment confrontation issues. The \"silent witness rule\" allows classified information to be referenced without disclosure, but it may limit public access to trial proceedings. The silent witness rule allows classified information to be referenced in court without disclosure to the public. However, if the defendant is not allowed to review the classified information in the same manner as the jury, it may violate their right to confront the evidence. In a case where only the prosecution had access to an unredacted document while the defendant and their counsel were given a redacted version, the Fourth Circuit deemed this unconstitutional. The government must either declassify the document, seek an effective substitute, or forego its use if they do not want the defendant to have access to classified information. The government cannot hide evidence from the defendant while giving it to the jury, as it violates the Confrontation Clause. The silent witness rule for classified evidence has been approved by courts under CIPA, but must not raise Confrontation Clause issues. In a specific case, the government sought to prevent the jury and defense from knowing the true identities of witnesses, which the defendant argued would violate his right to a public trial and to confront witnesses. Sterling argued that security measures used in witnesses' testimony could be confusing and prejudicial, as the sensitivity of the information disclosed was contested. The Fourth Circuit allowed access to witnesses' identities for the defense but reversed the decision to reveal their true names to the jury, citing sensitive information concerns. The Fourth Circuit ruled that revealing witnesses' identities to the jury could be prejudicial and confusing, as the information was sensitive. They suggested that any concerns about security measures could be addressed by instructing the jury that guilt cannot be inferred from such measures."
