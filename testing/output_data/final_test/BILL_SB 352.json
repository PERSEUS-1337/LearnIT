    "title": "SB 352",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 166 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include various contempts of court as misdemeanors, such as disorderly behavior during court proceedings or disturbances that interrupt the court's proceedings. The amended Section 166 of the Penal Code in California lists various contempts of court as misdemeanors, including willful disobedience of court orders, resistance to lawful orders, refusal to testify, false reporting of court proceedings, presenting false information to the court, and disobeying gang injunctions. A person guilty of contempt of court by contacting a victim in violation of the law may face imprisonment, a fine, or both. Each contact is considered a separate violation, and being currently incarcerated does not excuse the offense. A willful and knowing violation of a protective order or stay-away court order can result in contempt of court, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both. Different types of orders, including those related to elder or dependent adult abuse, can lead to this consequence. If the violation causes physical injury, the person may face a minimum of 48 hours in jail. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of the court orders pertain to orders issued under specific sections of the Family Code, excluding a party from the family dwelling, or enjoining specified behavior. A second violation within seven years involving violence results in imprisonment. Prosecuting agencies are responsible for enforcing these orders. A person who violates a protective order by owning, possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm will be punished under Section 29825. Probation for this offense must be consistent with Section 1203.097 and may include alternative requirements instead of a fine. The court may order the defendant to make payments to a battered women's shelter, provide restitution for counseling expenses, and assess the defendant's ability to pay fines or restitution as a condition of probation. The court must ensure that payments to the shelter do not hinder the defendant's ability to pay restitution to the victim or child support. If a married person is injured by their spouse's criminal acts, community property cannot be used to pay for the offending spouse's liability for restitution until all separate property is exhausted. A person violating an order may be punished for offenses under Section 136.1 or 646.9. Contempt finding does not prevent prosecution for these offenses. Contempt punishment can be credited towards any sentence for the substantive offenses. Conviction or acquittal for these offenses bars subsequent punishment for contempt. Section 368 of the Penal Code is being amended. Section 368 of the Penal Code is amended to provide special protections for crimes against elders and dependent adults, similar to those for minor children, due to their potential vulnerabilities. Any person who knowingly causes harm to an elder or dependent adult, resulting in physical or mental suffering, is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. If an offense results in great bodily injury to the victim, the defendant will receive additional prison time: 3 years if the victim is under 70, 5 years if 70 or older. If the offense causes the victim's death, the defendant will receive 5 years if the victim is under 70, and 7 years if 70 or older. Any person who knowingly causes an elder or dependent adult to suffer unjustifiable physical or mental pain, or places them in a situation endangering their health, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Repeat offenses can result in a fine up to $2,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Any person who violates laws on theft, embezzlement, forgery, or fraud, or identity theft against an elder or dependent adult, knowing the victim's status, faces fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to four years if the value of the property taken exceeds $950. Any caretaker of an elder or dependent adult who commits theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or identity theft against them faces a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both if the value of the property taken is under $950. Theft of property exceeding $950 can result in a fine of up to $2,500, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Theft of property under $950 can lead to a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Any person who commits false imprisonment of an elder or dependent adult using violence, menace, fraud, or deceit can be imprisoned for two, three, or four years. An elder is defined as a person 65 years or older, while a dependent adult is someone between 18 and 64 with physical or mental limitations that restrict their normal activities or ability to protect their rights. This includes individuals with disabilities or those admitted to a 24-hour health facility. (i) A \"caretaker\" is defined as a person who has the care, custody, or control of an elder or dependent adult. (j) Prosecution can occur under this section and other laws, but additional imprisonment terms are limited for single offenses. The court may require counseling for those convicted of violating the provisions, with the defendant responsible for the cost. Ability to pay will be considered, and probation will not be denied based on inability to pay. Upon conviction for certain violations, the court may issue a restraining order for up to 10 years to protect the victim and their family. The length of the order is based on the seriousness of the offense and the likelihood of future violations, regardless of the defendant's sentence. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
