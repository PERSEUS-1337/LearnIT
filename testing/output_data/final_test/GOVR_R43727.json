    "content": "The proposed FY2016 defense legislation (H.R. 2685, H.R. 1735, S. 1376) in Congress would not significantly alter the Syria Train and Equip program. Congress is considering extending authorities, modifying reporting requirements, and appropriating new funds, highlighting key policy issues in U.S. foreign policy towards Syria. Proposed reporting and certification requirements in the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act would necessitate the Administration to report on potential U.S. support and protection. The Administration is required to report to Congress on potential U.S. support and protection for program participants returning to Syria. Supporters argue for protection through defensive measures, while critics fear it could lead to armed conflict with unpredictable consequences. Proposed restrictions in the FY2016 NDAA reflect concerns about misuse of U.S. assistance. Some Members of Congress are concerned about ensuring that U.S. assistance to Syrian trainees is used for combating the Islamic State as intended in the FY2015 legislation. Administration officials emphasize that the assistance is meant to protect civilians and opposition-held areas. However, there is ambiguity regarding the trainees' intentions towards Bashar al Asad, raising questions about the ultimate use of U.S. assistance. Proposed new reporting requirements in the House-enrolled FY2016 NDAA would mandate the Administration to report on the feasibility and costs of establishing safe zones or no-fly zones in Syria. This reflects preferences of some Syrian opposition activists and U.S. supporters for broader U.S. assistance and potential military intervention to protect civilians. However, there are differing views on deeper U.S. involvement in Syria. The FY2015 NDAA and appropriations language, along with proposed defense legislative measures for FY2016, are being debated by Congress and the President regarding U.S. assistance to the Syrian opposition since 2011. Various views on the purposes, risks, and rewards of such assistance have been expressed. Overt non-lethal assistance has been provided to Syrian groups, along with humanitarian aid. The Obama administration provided assistance and weaponry to select Syrian opposition groups under covert action authorities. President Obama requested authority and funding from Congress to begin an overt military training program in mid-2014 due to the failure of UN-backed negotiations and the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq. President Obama requested authority and funding from Congress for an overt \"train and equip\" program for vetted Syrians to defend against attacks, stabilize territory, combat terrorists, and promote a negotiated settlement. The FY2015 CR provided temporary authorization for training and equipping vetted Syrians, which differed from the Administration's requests and expired in December 2014. The FY2015 NDAA also included provisions for this program. The FY2015 NDAA and Consolidated Appropriations Act provided authority and funding for the program to assist vetted Syrians in defending against ISIL, protecting the US and allies, and promoting a negotiated settlement in Syria. Congress rejected the Administration's request for explicit authority to train and equip Syrians. The FY2015 NDAA and Consolidated Appropriations Act provided authority and funding for the program to assist vetted Syrians in defending against ISIL, protecting the US and allies, and promoting a negotiated settlement in Syria. The Administration's request for explicit authority to train and equip Syrians to defend Syrian civilians from Syrian government forces was rejected by Congress. The FY2015 full-year appropriations and NDAA expanded the types of assistance to include stipends and construction of training facilities, added vetting requirements for program participants, and required detailed plans and approval from congressional defense committees for fund obligations. The FY2015 NDAA and Consolidated Appropriations Act authorized assistance to vetted Syrians for defending against ISIL and promoting a negotiated settlement in Syria. The program included criteria for notification and progress reporting, limited funds to FY2015 monies, and allowed the President to waive restrictions with congressional notification. Several hundred U.S. military training personnel and support personnel have deployed in support of the Syria Train and Equip Program. The program aims to field a force of 3,000 vetted Syrians in 2015 and 5,400 per year in 2016 and 2017. Congressional defense committees approved funding for the program in late 2014 and early 2015. Program implementers have engaged with Syrian groups to identify recruits and worked with partner governments for vetting assistance. Fighting in Syria and uncertainties among Syrian opposition members and their backers have raised concerns about the program's purpose. As of late March 2015, U.S. officials had identified over 2,000 planned participants and vetted 400 of them for the Syria Train and Equip Program. Training began for the first batch of 90 recruits in early May, with activities reportedly taking place in Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The United Kingdom has also pledged support by sending 75 training personnel. The Administration's FY2016 defense appropriations request includes $600 million for the program. The House and Senate versions of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act would authorize funding for the Syria Train and Equip Program with new reporting and certification requirements. Some Members of Congress aim to clarify the types of support the Administration will provide to program participants after their return to Syria. The State Department is seeking new authorities to provide nonlethal assistance to armed groups in Syria. The United States allocated nearly $400 million in assistance to support the Syrian opposition since the start of the revolution, including $30 million for non-lethal equipment and supplies to moderate armed Syrian opposition forces. Vetting procedures for these transfers have not been publicly described in detail. Section 7041(i) of the FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act expanded the Administration's authority to provide nonlethal assistance in Syria using the Economic Support Fund account. The FY2015 appropriations act extended authority to provide assistance in Syria using the ESF account, subject to strategy document updates. Preexisting provisions restricted such assistance, requiring emergency authorities. The FY2016 appropriations act draft seeks to extend this authority. The Administration's request for expanded notwithstanding authority in FY2014 was not granted, indicating congressional reluctance to ease U.S. assistance in Syria without specific approval. Current legislation does not explicitly authorize aid for Syrians, focusing on training against the Islamic State. Assistance aims to help vetted Syrians defend opposition territory and promote conditions for a negotiated settlement in Syria. The conflict in Syria has led to debates in Congress over the scope of the train and equip program, with some advocating for broader U.S. assistance or military intervention to protect civilians. Others may reject deeper U.S. involvement and prefer focusing on toppling the Asad regime. The conflict in Syria has sparked debates in Congress over the extent of U.S. involvement, with some advocating for broader assistance or military intervention to protect civilians. Others prefer focusing on toppling the Asad regime. Most armed opposition groups seek U.S. assistance to overthrow Bashar al Asad's government, but as of June 2015, Congress has not authorized support for regime-change operations by U.S.-trained forces. The FY2016 defense legislation does not clarify conditions for a negotiated settlement. The FY2016 proposals would not modify the purposes of U.S. assistance stated in enacted FY2015 legislation, including training Syrians for offensive anti-Asad operations. The enacted FY2015 legislation authorizes assistance to defend against attacks by the Islamic State organization, without mentioning the Asad government. The U.S. is planning to provide defensive training and equipment to Syrians to defend against attacks by the Islamic State organization. President Obama's administration has indicated a focus on an \"ISIL-first strategy\" but also allowing defense against pro-Asad forces. Legislation is being proposed to assess the potential effectiveness of establishing safe zones or a no-fly zone in Syria. The U.S. is discussing proposals with Turkey for assistance in Syria. Congress authorized assistance for securing opposition-controlled territory, not for stabilizing or providing services. The Administration may use State Department funds for stabilization efforts. The Administration may use State Department funds for stabilization efforts in Syria, alongside the DOD-led train and equip program. Legislation does not specify conditions for U.S. assistance or authorize new policy steps. Pressure is needed on the government of Bashar al Asad to negotiate a settlement, but the exact nature of this pressure is not publicly disclosed. The United States does not explicitly state that the departure of Bashar al Asad is a condition for a negotiated settlement in Syria. U.S. Central Command may discontinue support for forces if they deviate from initial objectives. Proposed FY2016 legislation does not mention this condition. The FY2016 defense authorization legislation requires specific Administration reporting on support for U.S. trained Syrians returning to Syria. Proposed changes aim to specify the support or protection provided to trainees. The Senate version of the FY2016 NDAA would require a detailed report on military support for recipients of assistance upon their return to Syria. The proposed bill aims to provide specific support to Syrian opposition elements trained by the U.S. to defend themselves against attacks by ISIL and Syrian government forces. Defense Department officials emphasize the importance of U.S. support for the trained Syrians upon their return to Syria. Defense Department officials have stated that the main focus of U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State remains on operations in Iraq, with ongoing consideration of post-training support for Syrian participants in the train and equip program. Secretary of Defense Carter mentioned the responsibility to help trainees if contested by regime forces, but details on how to exercise that responsibility are still being decided. Advocates suggest providing direct assistance to U.S. trainees returning to Syria, including protection from attacks by pro-Asad forces or the Islamic State. In response to potential attacks on trainees by various forces in Syria, some critics argue that using U.S. assistance for operations against non-Islamic State groups would be misuse. General Dempsey and General Austin have supported providing protective support to trainees for their success. Proposed FY2016 provision aims to prevent future assistance to entities found guilty of misuse. The proposed FY2016 legislation aims to maintain vetting requirements for the Syria Train and Equip Program, including a prohibition on the procurement or transfer of MANPADS. This is to prevent these systems from falling into the wrong hands and posing a threat to civilian and military aircraft. The 113th Congress considered proposals to define assistance for Syrian opposition groups and place restrictions on weapons transfers. One FY2016 proposal aims to ensure U.S. assistance is used for approved purposes only, with conditions on recipients who misuse training and equipment. The FY2016 legislation requires DOD to report on any misuse or loss of provided training and equipment, without a clear definition of \"misuse.\" Proposed changes include modifying notification and reporting requirements, addressing policy issues like protecting U.S. trainees and establishing safe zones in Syria. Proposed FY2016 legislation includes new requirements for military support to recipients of assistance in Syria, such as logistical, defensive, intelligence, and medical support. Future program funding approval would be contingent on certification of support provided by the United States Armed Forces. The United States will provide support to Syrian opposition elements for defense against ISIL and Syrian government forces. Proposed FY2016 legislation includes requirements for military support, with funding approval contingent on certification of support from the US Armed Forces. Legislation also mandates a report to Congress on the potential effectiveness of establishing safe zones or a no-fly zone in Syria. The FY2015 legislation added criteria for reporting on sustainment and support activities in Syria, including progress on command and control, construction activities, spending totals, and effectiveness assessments. Congress must approve reprogramming requests for funds in advance according to DOD regulations. The FY2015 legislation requires the Administration to report to Congress on vetting procedures and criteria for authorized assistance, with regular updates on progress and any misuse of funds. Proposed FY2016 legislation includes different sunset dates for authorized and appropriated funds, with the House and Senate NDAAs authorizing the appropriation to a Syria Train and Equip Fund account. The proposed House defense authorization act (H.R. 2685) would appropriate OCO-designated O&M funds to a Syria Train and Equip Fund account available until September 30, 2017. The FY2015 NDAA includes a \"sunset\" date of December 31, 2016 for the Syria Train and Equip Program authorities. The availability of funds could signal congressional support for the Administration's plan to train vetted Syrians over three years. Members of Congress have considered extending the program beyond the original sunset date. Members of Congress have considered key policy and oversight questions regarding the Syria Train and Equip Program, including the purposes of training and equipping Syrians, alignment of goals, vetting processes, effectiveness of training, and implications for U.S. policy goals. The United States is considering the support and protection for trainees returning to Syria, the potential expansion of the \"train and equip\" mission, funding options, program duration, reporting requirements, and public support for the commitment. The United States is evaluating the support for trainees in Syria, potential expansion of the \"train and equip\" mission, funding, program duration, reporting, public support, waiver authority, and effectiveness of similar programs in other contexts. The United States is assessing support for trainees in Syria, considering expanding the \"train and equip\" mission, funding, program duration, reporting, public support, waiver authority, and effectiveness of similar programs in other contexts. Discussions are ongoing regarding the purposes, scope, scale, costs, and implications of the Syria Train and Equip Program, as well as proposals for its modification. Members of Congress, Administration officials, Syrians, and other observers are debating the potential risks and rewards of different programs designed to achieve various goals in Syria. The scope of opposition-held territory in Syria may expand or contract, impacting potential costs and benefits for the United States. Reporting requirements in P.L. 113-291 mandate DOD to report on program spending and effectiveness of trained personnel. Proposed modifications in the FY2016 NDAA would require updated reporting on U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria. Different perspectives on \"success\" and \"effectiveness\" may influence assessments of U.S. security assistance. Observers may have different definitions of \"success\" and \"effectiveness\" in the context of U.S. assistance in Syria, particularly regarding training programs for vetted fighters. There are debates over whether the focus should be on offensive attacks against Islamic State or pro-Asad forces, or on defensive capabilities. The unique train and equip authorities granted by Congress for vetted Syrians differ from previous programs in scope and funding, raising questions about their ability to achieve U.S. objectives. The unique train and equip authorities granted by Congress for vetted Syrians in Syria allowed overt assistance to non-government actors, which was not possible under existing legal authorities. U.S. sanctions and restrictions limited the executive branch's ability to provide such assistance, leading to challenges in implementation and questionable results. Difficulties in implementing and questionable results have been seen in various U.S. assistance programs, including training Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Similar programs in Angola, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Nicaragua during the 1980s and 1990s faced limitations imposed by Congress. The success and failures of these programs are still debated. In 1998, Congress authorized the Department of Defense to provide goods and services to Iraqi opposition groups but did not approve direct training or weapon transfers. The U.S. government provided training and equipment to Free Iraqi Forces in 2003 for civil-military operations in Iraq. The Sudan Peace Act authorized assistance to areas of Sudan not controlled by the government for peace and democratic governance. $100 million was appropriated for this purpose in fiscal years 2003-2005. Some recipients of U.S. assistance held leadership positions in the South Sudanese opposition. Additionally, the U.S. government provided training and equipment to Palestinian security forces. The U.S. government has provided training and equipment to Palestinian security forces for specific purposes using foreign affairs authorities and funds. The Obama Administration notified Congress of a drawdown of up to $25 million in goods and services for Libyan forces in 2011, but Congress did not authorize a \"train and equip\" program for Libyan opposition members. Providing assistance to non-governmental groups presents challenges, and Members of Congress may need to consider policy questions when overseeing assistance programs for vetted Syrians. Members of Congress may need to consider the effects of outside arms and training on conflict settlement, violence intensity, national security goals, and humanitarian conditions when overseeing assistance programs for vetted Syrians. They should also weigh the tradeoffs between short-term security objectives and long-term political goals, as well as the roles of different U.S. government agencies in program implementation and the challenges of ensuring recipient reliability and integrity. The debate over U.S. security assistance abroad, including the potential support for U.S. forces in Syria, raises questions about policy and legal authorities. Secretary of Defense Carter testified that the Administration had not determined its authority to use military force against the Syrian government. The Obama Administration seeks additional authorization from Congress for military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as existing AUMFs do not provide clear-cut authority for such actions. The 113th Congress considered proposals for military force against the Islamic State, with the Obama Administration submitting AUMF language to the 114th Congress in early 2015. FY2015 legislation related to the Syria Train and Equip Program clarified it did not authorize the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities. Proposed FY2016 defense legislation also addresses authorization for the use of military force in Syria. The Obama Administration requested authority from Congress in 2014 to provide assistance to vetted Syrian opposition groups. The FY2015 defense authorization and appropriation acts allow DOD to provide training, equipment, and other support to these groups. The Obama Administration requested authority from Congress in 2014 to assist vetted Syrian opposition groups. The FY2015 legislation compared the Administration's requests for authority and funding with enacted legislation."
