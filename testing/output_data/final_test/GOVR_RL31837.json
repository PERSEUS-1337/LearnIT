    "content": "During the 1929 Depression, rural residents faced low incomes and living standards. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, Farm Security Administration, and Work Projects Administration provided assistance to rural families. Post-World War II, rural poverty, especially among farmers, remained a concern. The Eisenhower Administration initiated a Rural Development Program in 1955 to help low-income farmers. The focus on farms and rural poverty continued through the War on Poverty in the 1960s. The 1980s farm financial crisis and economic dislocation in rural America brought rural structural change to the forefront of policy concerns. The decline of farming and manufacturing jobs has widened the gap between rural and urban areas. Key federal rural policy focuses on housing, employment, human capital, poverty, medical care, and infrastructure development. The rural population has decreased over the past decade. According to the U.S. Census, as of July 2012, approximately 46.2 million people (14.6% of the U.S. population) lived in rural areas, down from about 16% in 2000. Rural areas have seen declines in population, including in retirement and recreation areas. Manufacturing accounts for 22% of rural private sector earnings and 11% of rural jobs. Farming remains a major focus in congressional debates on rural policy. Title VI of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246) addresses agriculture and manufacturing issues in rural areas, aiming to help them compete globally. Omnibus farm bills are key legislative tools for rural development, reauthorizing USDA programs. Congress uses these bills to address emerging rural issues and reauthorize rural programs. The USDA rural development mission agencies aim to enhance rural communities by providing financial and technical resources. Three agencies, established in 1994, focus on rural housing, business-cooperatives, and utilities. Congress has enacted various laws to address rural policies and residents' needs, such as the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 was crucial for providing electricity and telephone service to rural America. The National Commission on Rural Poverty was established in 1966, leading to various loan and grant programs for rural social welfare. The 1972 Rural Development Act marked a significant milestone in congressional concern for rural policy. New rural development legislation typically amends major authorizing statutes to address the needs of rural communities. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (P.L. 92-419) established the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to provide subsidized loans and grants for electrifying rural areas. Cooperatives, tax-exempt entities owned by members, were utilized to expand access to electricity and telephone services in rural communities. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 established the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to provide subsidized loans and grants for electrifying rural areas. By the mid-1950s, rural homes had electricity matching suburban levels, and by 1975, over 99% of farms were electrified. Telephone penetration in rural areas reached 90% by the mid-1970s and has remained around 95% for the past 20 years. The REA was replaced by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) in 1994, administering rural electric programs. The Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972, also known as the ConAct, serves as the authorizing statute for USDA rural development programs. Title V of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 designated the USDA as the lead agency for coordinating nationwide rural development programs, including the Community Facility Loan program, Rural Business and Industry Loan program, and Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. This legislation expanded the USDA's role in addressing multi-state, state, sub-state, and local rural development needs. The omnibus 1990 farm bill amended the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 to establish the Rural Development Administration (RDA) in USDA. The RDA absorbed non-farm FmHA functions and established provisions for rural economic development revolving funds, a Rural Business Investment Fund, and local revolving funds. It also set up a delivery system for certain rural development programs, including providing rural water and waste services. Established a delivery system for rural development programs, including rural water and waste facilities. Amended various acts to authorize lending for water and waste projects, establish wastewater treatment programs, provide emergency community water assistance grants, and enhance rural community access to telecommunications. Also supported rural businesses by establishing technical assistance units, deferring loan payments, and promoting rural incubator funds. Title VIII authorized the first rural Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/ECs) to revitalize low-income rural communities and attract private sector investment. The program was administered by USDA for rural areas and HUD for urban areas. By December 1994, three rural Empowerment Zones and 30 rural Enterprise Communities were named. Additional EZs and ECs were added in 1997 and 2001. Tax incentives for EZ Communities were extended until 2013, but the rural EC program expired in December 2009. The rural Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program expired in December 2009. USDA Rural Development is currently not authorized to designate any new zones or communities. The legislation also reorganized rural development into the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service, abolishing the Rural Electrification Administration. The 1996 omnibus farm bill abolished the Rural Electrification Administration and established the Rural Utilities Service as its successor. Title VII of the bill focused on Rural Development, including initiatives for telemedicine and distance learning services in rural areas, increased grant amounts for water and waste facilities, and revised the definition of \"rural\" areas for eligibility for grants and loans. The 2002 farm bill established mandatory funding for a Fund for Rural America, including the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) for rural research, economic development, and housing. Title VI authorized new rural development initiatives with mandatory funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Rural Strategic Investment Fund established a National Board on Rural America providing $100 million in planning grants. The Rural Business Investment Program offered $100 million in loan guarantees and subsidies for Rural Business Investment corporations. Enhanced Access to Broadband Service allocated $10 million-$20 million per year for grants and loans. Rural Local Television Broadcast Signal Loan Guarantees authorized $80 million. Value-added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants provided $40 million per year, with a 5% set-aside for organic production. In FY2003, $15 million was allocated for 10 new Agriculture Innovation Centers to assist value-added agricultural businesses. The Rural America Infrastructure Development Account authorized $360 million for water and waste water applications. The Rural Firefighters and Emergency Personnel Grant Program received $10 million per year from FY2003-FY2007 for training. Funding for these programs was blocked between FY2004 and FY2007, but the 2008 farm bill reauthorized some programs through annual appropriations. The 2008 omnibus farm bill, funded through annual appropriations, expired in September 2012 but was extended through December 2013. Title VI of the bill expanded broadband access in rural areas, created new assistance and investment programs, and authorized funding for water and wastewater projects. Some programs from the 2002 farm bill were reauthorized with discretionary funding in the 2008 bill. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the Value-Added Product Grants Program with $15 million of annual mandatory funding and $40 million of annual discretionary funding. It also modified the definition of \"rural\" to include \"areas rural in character,\" allowing certain rural areas to be eligible for USDA loans and grants. Special designations were made for San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Honolulu, Hawaii, and criteria were established for defining rural areas contiguous to urban areas. Other new provisions included loans and loan guarantees for locally or regionally produced agricultural food products. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized the Value-Added Product Grants Program with funding and modified the definition of \"rural\" to include \"areas rural in character.\" It also included provisions for loans and loan guarantees for locally or regionally produced agricultural food products. Additionally, new programs were introduced to support economically disadvantaged microentrepreneurs and increase equity capital availability in rural areas. Regional economic development commissions were also established. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and amended various loan and grant programs in key areas such as broadband, rural utilities, business, and community development. It extended funding for USDA Rural Development programs through FY2018, encouraging private or cooperative lenders to provide financing for water and waste water projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 reauthorized and amended loan and grant programs for rural development, encouraging private lenders to provide financing. It included provisions for technical assistance, loan guarantees, data collection on project economic effects, simplified funding applications, and consolidated business programs into Business Development grants. Mandatory spending was allocated for rural development loans, grants, and Value-Added Product Grants. The law amended the definition of rural areas, raised the population threshold for eligibility, and reauthorized funding for programs under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. It also established new procedures for the Access to Broadband Telecommunications Services in Rural Areas Program and authorized a Gigabit Network Pilot Program for high-speed broadband service. A new Gigabit Network Pilot Program for high-speed broadband service was authorized at $10 million for each fiscal year FY2014-FY2018. The law also authorized a new Rural Energy Savings Program to fund loans for energy efficiency measures. Various loan and grant programs are administered by USDA Rural Development agencies for rural housing, business, and utilities. Rural areas face challenges with substandard housing, poverty, and lack of affordable housing. The Housing Act aimed to address poverty and inadequate rural housing in America. It highlighted issues such as the prevalence of mobile homes, high housing costs for rural households, lack of clean water access, and limited mortgage credit. The legislation emphasized the importance of providing every American with a decent home and suitable living environment, especially in post-World War II when housing shortages were prevalent. The Housing Act played a significant role in shaping U.S. urban and suburban areas, influencing state and local policies on housing, social welfare, race relations, and economic development. It established housing as a central policy focus by financing slum clearance, increasing FHA mortgage insurance, and committing to building new public housing units. The Act aimed to address poverty and inadequate rural housing, emphasizing the importance of providing every American with a decent home, especially during post-World War II housing shortages. The Housing Act addressed shortages and low-quality housing in rural America by authorizing the Farmers Home Administration to grant mortgages for rural single-family houses. It provided financial assistance for rural property purchase, construction, insurance on loans, and rental housing for farm workers. The USDA Rural Housing Service now insures housing loans for home purchases, repairs, and rental housing development. The 1968 Housing Act aimed to address housing issues for low-income families by authorizing programs like the Section 235 homeownership program. It set a goal of creating 26 million new housing units, with 6 million reserved for low-income individuals. The act also established various other housing-related programs and agencies, including the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Title V of the 1983 Housing Act amends previous housing acts to require a percentage of rural housing loans to be available for very low-income individuals. It authorizes loans for manufactured homes meeting safety standards and includes programs for homeownership and rental housing without requiring annual reauthorization. Budget authorization is in terms of loan subsidies and authority. The Housing Act of 1983 requires a percentage of rural housing loans for very low-income individuals and authorizes loans for manufactured homes. Housing loan subsidies are transfers from the Treasury to lenders to provide loans at reduced interest rates. Loan authority refers to the total value of all loans made under a program. Funding for Rural Housing Service programs comes from the Rural Housing Insurance Fund through direct loans, guaranteed loans, and grants. The USDA's main housing loan program offers guaranteed loans with federal protection for private lenders in case of borrower default. Grants are direct funds given through competitions.
