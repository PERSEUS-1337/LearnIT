The Television and Radio Program Violence Reduction Act of 1993 presents key findings on the increase of violent programming on television and radio, especially targeting children. Studies show a significant rise in violent content in prime-time shows and children's programming, leading to concerns about the impact on children's behavior. The National Institute of Mental Health and various authorities have found that children imitate violent behavior seen on television, leading to aggressive behavior. Children watch TV for extensive hours, sometimes more than they attend school, often without adult supervision. Over 20 years of research has shown a consensus on the harmful effects of viewing televised violence on children. Over 20 years of research has established a consensus that watching televised violence increases children's aggressiveness and desensitizes them. There is a need to find solutions to limit this harmful influence while preserving freedom of expression. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"violence\" is defined as any action involving physical force with intent to cause harm, \"programming\" includes cartoons, \"child\" or \"children\" refers to individuals under 18 years old, \"person\" has the same meaning as in the Communications Act of 1934, and \"cable operator\" has a specific definition. The term \"cable operator\" is defined under section 602(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, while \"cable service\" is defined under section 602(5). A \"television or radio broadcast licensee\" is authorized to engage in broadcasting, and a \"franchising authority\" is defined under section 602(10) of the Communications Act of 1934. The Federal Communications Commission must establish standards for reducing violence in television and radio broadcasts and cable services within 60 days of this section's enactment. Final standards must be set within 150 days. Violations of these standards are addressed in Section 5. The Federal Communications Commission can impose civil fines for violations of rules or regulations related to reducing violence in television and radio broadcasts and cable services. Fines range from $5,000 for violations to $25,000 for intentional violations, with each program in violation considered a separate offense. Repeated violations can result in escalating fines after notice and opportunity for hearing. The Federal Communications Commission can revoke broadcast licenses for broadcasters and satellite licenses for cable operators after a hearing, for violations related to reducing violence in television and radio broadcasts and cable services. The Federal Communications Commission may exempt certain video and audio programming from requirements, including news broadcasts, sporting events, educational programming, and documentaries. The FCC will consider compliance with standards in license renewal applications for television and radio broadcasters."
