    "content": "The \"School Day Factor Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section of the Act is also included. Congress finds that the average school year length has increased over time, with the average number of school days per year remaining at 178.5 in 2008. Despite recommendations to increase instructional time for global competitiveness, no systematic increase in school days or school year has occurred. In 2008, 42 States mandate a school year of 180 or fewer days, with variations in the number of school days per year ranging from 173 to 182 across States. Research shows that students' conceptual mastery suffers when class material is condensed, and significant learning requires time investment. All students, especially those from low-income households, are at risk of losing educational gains during long summer breaks. The lack of out-of-school learning opportunities contributes to a widening achievement gap, with economically advantaged youth having more opportunities than disadvantaged youth, leading to cumulative achievement differences by 9th grade. Since 1991, over 300 expanded learning initiatives have occurred in 30 States, targeting high-poverty and high-minority student populations. These initiatives have led to improved student achievement, reduced absenteeism, and increased satisfaction among parents, teachers, and students. Research shows that increased school time benefits both students and teachers, providing teachers with more planning time, cooperative planning opportunities, professional development, and the ability to individualize instruction. Teacher employment also increases, with some transitioning to full-year positions depending on the adopted calendar conversion. The cost per hour of instruction decreases with the addition of more learning time, depending on the calendar conversion adopted. The purpose of the section is to outline the objectives or goals. The Act aims to ensure children have enough time for school achievement, access to quality education, and teachers can provide quality instruction. It encourages states to increase the school year to 200 days by 2014 without reducing the school day length. It also modifies allocations under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include factors related to the minimum number of school days. The Act encourages states to increase the school year to 200 days by 2014 without reducing the school day length and also promotes increasing the length of the school day. SEC. 1128 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 amends Subpart 2 of part A by adding the SCHOOL DAY FACTOR. This encourages states to increase the school year to 200 days by 2014 without reducing the school day length and promotes increasing the length of the school day. The definitions in this section clarify terms like \"academic year\" as the period from the first to the last day of a school year, and \"base level school year length\" which increases from 180 to 200 school days for the 2009-2010 to 2013-2014 academic years. The term 'instructional hours' refers to hours within the school day dedicated to student learning in core academic subjects. A 'school day' is a day with mandatory attendance for all students, delivering a minimum of 5.5 instructional hours. For the purposes of this section, the State-mandated school year length refers to the minimum number of school days required for students to attend in an academic year, excluding days waived for reasons like teacher professional development or weather. The State-mandated school year length for a State without a minimum number of school days but with a minimum number of instructional hours is calculated by dividing the minimum mandated instructional hours per academic year by the average number of instructional hours per school day in the State's public elementary schools. The State-mandated school year length for a State without a minimum number of school days is determined by the average number of school days attended by students in the preceding year or in case of a natural disaster. The school year length is determined by the average number of school days attended in the preceding year or in case of a natural disaster. Grants for educational agencies are adjusted based on the school day factor for the academic year. The school day factor for each State and local educational agency is calculated as a percentage, with adjustments made to grant amounts before any requirements are applied. The school day factor is calculated as a percentage based on the State-mandated school year length divided by the base level school year length, with adjustments made to grant amounts. The school day factor is calculated as a percentage based on the State-mandated school year length divided by the base level school year length, with adjustments made to grant amounts. The calculation involves dividing the State mandated minimum instructional hours per school day for the previous academic year by 5.5 and multiplying by 100, with a special rule for certain situations. The calculation for the school day factor involves comparing the State-mandated minimum instructional hours for the previous academic year with the hours for the academic year two years prior. This calculation determines the percentage used to adjust grant amounts. The school day factor, as outlined in Sec. 1128, is used to adjust grant amounts by comparing State-mandated minimum instructional hours for different academic years."
