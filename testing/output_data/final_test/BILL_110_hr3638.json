    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Border Security and Elimination of Sanctuary for Illegal Aliens Act of 2007\". The table of contents includes findings. The findings of Congress highlight the threat of illegal entry by dangerous gang members like MS-13, the risk of terrorists entering undetected, the high cost to taxpayers for supporting illegal aliens, and the need to secure borders. Congress emphasizes the urgent need to solve the worsening crisis of illegal immigration. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to increase incentives for recruiting and retaining full-time active-duty border patrol agents, including offering repayment of higher education loans and developing a retention program. This is in response to the urgent need to secure borders and address the crisis of illegal immigration. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 authorizes the use of new technologies to secure US borders. The Secretary of Homeland Security must prioritize building border fencing and submit a progress report to Congress by June 30, 2008. SEC. 5 mandates collaboration to end sanctuary of illegal aliens by requiring State and local law enforcement agencies to notify ICE immediately when an unlawfully present alien is arrested. SEC. 6 addresses expedited removal and criminal penalties for criminal aliens. Upon notification under section 5, an alien arrested shall be detained by ICE, presented before an immigration judge, added to a watch list, and immediately removed from the United States without further review. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to impose permanent ineligibility for admission to the United States for any period of time. Additionally, an alien removed from the US for unlawful presence may face up to five years in prison, fines, and expedited removal proceedings after serving their sentence."
