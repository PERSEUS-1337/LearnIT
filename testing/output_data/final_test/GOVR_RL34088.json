Federal laws and regulations govern time off from work, with state statutes possibly requiring additional leave. The Fair Labor Standards Act sets standards for wages and hours worked in the U.S. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not mandate breaks or holidays for employees, but federal employees are entitled to paid legal holidays. Private sector employers may choose to follow holiday practices and pay employees for time not worked. The FLSA requires employees to be paid more than their regular hourly wage rate in certain instances. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employees to be paid more than their regular hourly wage rate for overtime work. This act was enacted in 1938 during a period of high unemployment, with the penalty for companies extending workweeks being one-and-one-half times the standard hourly rate. Congress later allowed government employers to offer comp-time in lieu of overtime pay, giving employees the option to take leave instead of immediate compensation. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires overtime pay for employees. In the 1990s, the idea of \"comp-time\" in the private sector was introduced as a family-friendly option for workers to accumulate hours for caregiving. The Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act mandate prevailing wages and benefits for workers on federal projects. The Wage and Hour Division determines prevailing wage rates and benefits, including sick, vacation, and holiday leave. In the 1940s, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act was amended to allow states to use employee contributions for cash payments to those unable to work due to nonoccupational illnesses or injuries. In the 1940s, California, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island passed Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) laws for employees unable to work due to nonoccupational illnesses or injuries. Hawaii and Puerto Rico enacted TDI legislation in the late 1960s. Today, employees and employers contribute to four jurisdictions' social insurance programs, with Rhode Island and California relying on employee payroll deductions. TDI benefits are available to both employed and unemployed workers, with coverage varying by jurisdiction and allowing for private insurance plan substitution. Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) laws cover government employees and the self-employed, with payment values and durations varying by jurisdiction. Employers are not required to keep individuals on payroll while receiving benefits, but must comply with laws regulating treatment of employees with short-term nonwork disabilities. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits discrimination against pregnant individuals in the workplace. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 requires firms to treat pregnant employees the same as those with temporary disabilities, allowing them to take leave on the same terms. Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act do not mandate leave for short-term illnesses or caring for sick family members, but firms with family leave policies must apply them equally to all employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released guidance in May 2007 addressing unlawful discrimination based on sex-based stereotyping of pregnant workers and family caregivers. Congress has not prohibited discrimination based on caregiver status, so claims must be indirect applications of existing prohibitions against sex bias, disability discrimination, and unequal pay. Differences in state leave benefit laws may pose challenges for multistate companies. Differences in state leave benefit laws may pose challenges for multistate companies, leading to potential discrimination complaints. For example, California's Kin Care law allows employees to use paid sick leave to care for sick family members, while Minnesota requires employers to permit the use of personal sick leave for caregiving. California was the first state to mandate paid family leave in 2002, providing up to six weeks of paid time off for bonding with a new child. Both male and female workers in California are entitled to up to six weeks of paid time off to bond with their new biological, adopted, or foster children. They can also receive wage replacement while caring for seriously ill family members. Employers can require the use of accrued vacation time before drawing payments from the insurance fund. PFL must be taken concurrently with up to 12 weeks of unpaid family-medical leave under the California Family Rights Act. Noteworthy differences between CFRA and PFL/TDI include CFRA providing unpaid time off with health benefits and job reinstatement for employees at firms with at least 50 employees, while PFL/TDI offers cash benefits during short-term absences without job protection. Two other states have enacted paid family leave legislation, with New Jersey allowing workers to take up to six weeks of paid time off for bonding with a child or caring for a family member, with a requirement to use accrued leave before drawing payments from the insurance fund. The New Jersey family leave program is funded by employees through payroll deduction and cash benefits must run concurrently with unpaid job-protected leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Washington state's family leave insurance program was delayed until 2012 due to a lack of financing mechanism and budget shortfall. Many states have adopted the unpaid job-protected approach to family-medical leave over the insurance approach. District of Columbia proposed or passed unpaid job-protected time-off legislation after the Family and Medical Leave Act was signed into law in 1993. The federal law allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave for reasons such as caring for a newborn or adopted child, a family member with a serious health condition, or their own health condition. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to take unpaid leave for various reasons, including attending to their own health (including maternity-related disability), caring for family members, and attending to matters related to military service. The latest Labor Department survey shows that the predominant reason for FMLA leave in 1999-2000 was for the employee's own health, followed by caregiving for newborn or newly adopted children. Employees who take FMLA leave are guaranteed reemployment in the same or comparable positions. Employers cannot retaliate against workers for taking leave but can terminate them for legitimate business reasons. Private sector firms with 50+ employees must allow FMLA leave if certain criteria are met. Public sector employers must also provide FMLA leave. The act allows for 12 workweeks of leave in a 12-month period. The FMLA guarantees reemployment for employees taking leave, with 12 workweeks allowed in a 12-month period. It differs from TDI by providing more reasons for leave, health benefits, and job security. President Clinton directed the DOL to propose regulations for states to use tax dollars for federal-state programs. The Birth and Adoption Unemployment Compensation (BAA-UC) program, also known as Baby UI, allowed states to use tax dollars from the federal-state UC program to provide partial wage replacement for parents taking time off to bond with their newborn or adopted children. Unlike FMLA, BAA-UC leave was not guaranteed nationwide, had narrower reasons for leave, and did not require employers to retain employees unless they were also FMLA-eligible. BAA-UC did not have firm-size requirements like FMLA, as it was based on the broader employer coverage of the UC program. The model Baby UI bill allowed for up to 12 weeks of BAA-UC benefits, with time not worked counting towards the maximum duration of unemployment benefits. States were expected to base BAA-UC benefits on earnings and employment histories, deducting other income sources. DOL did not impose solvency requirements on states before enacting BAA-UC, but expected them to consider the impact on their UC trust funds. The Bush Administration rescinded BAA-UC in late 2003, citing it as a misapplication of federal UC law. This decision came after a review of all DOL regulations due to reduced state UC fund balances and a legal challenge. The administration disagreed with the Clinton Administration's interpretation of BAA-UC, stating that individuals must be able and available for work to receive unemployment benefits. The Bush Administration rescinded BAA-UC in late 2003, stating that individuals must be able and available for work to receive unemployment benefits. This decision came after a review of all DOL regulations and a legal challenge. The administration disagreed with the Clinton Administration's interpretation of BAA-UC, which encouraged parents to refuse available work. Some 24 Baby-UI bills were introduced in 20 states in 2001, but no state had passed legislation before the BAA-UC regulation was removed in November 2003. States appear reluctant to require family-medical leave benefits, possibly due to concerns about higher taxes on companies. The UC program is financed through state and federal payroll taxes, while three of the five states with TDI programs partly finance them through a payroll tax on employers. According to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits make up 30% of total employee compensation. Leave benefits, accounting for 7% of total compensation, receive less attention compared to health and retirement benefits. Limited data is available on gender, age, and other demographic characteristics of workers with regards to employer-provided paid leave. The National Compensation Survey (NCS) collects data from companies on benefit incidence and compensation cost levels. It obtains information on firm size and job characteristics, such as occupation and earnings. Private compensation surveys may not be representative or accessible. The analysis below is derived from the NCS, National Survey of America's Families, and the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which are nationally representative surveys. Private sector employees have access to paid vacations, holidays, funeral leave, jury duty leave, and sick leave. Companies also pay almost half of employees for military obligations. Less than two in five workers have access to sick leave. Private sector employees have limited access to paid family leave, with only 8% receiving this benefit. White-collar workers have more access to paid leave compared to blue-collar and service occupations. Full-time, union, and higher-paid employees are more likely to receive paid leave as part of their compensation package. In the private sector, larger establishments and firms in the New England and Middle Atlantic regions tend to provide more paid leave to employees. Businesses in the goods-producing sector offer more vacation and holiday leave, while the service sector offers more sick leave. State and local government employees have higher access to paid sick leave compared to federal employees. In state and local governments, employees have access to paid sick leave. Federal employees also have near-universal access to paid sick leave and other benefits. They can use annual leave for vacations, personal reasons, family caregiving, and bereavement. Sick leave generosity varies based on worker and job characteristics. On average, private sector workers earn eight paid sick days after one year or five years of employment. Full-time employees receive eight sick days, while part-time workers receive six days. After at least 10 years of service, full-time employees are provided nine sick days. Employees of firms with different sizes are granted varying numbers of sick days based on their years of service. For example, employees of firms with 1-99 workers receive an average of six days after one year and seven days after five years. In contrast, employees of firms with 100-499 workers get seven days after one or five years, while those in firms with 500 or more workers receive 11 days after one year and 12 days after five years. The trend of more sick days for employees in larger firms continues with longer service, with employees at firms with 1-99 workers earning seven days after 10 years, compared to 10 days for those in firms with 100 or more workers. Utilizing data from the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF), the Urban Institute found that fathers are more likely than mothers to have paid leave, and married parents are more likely than single parents to have access to paid leave. Access to paid leave increases with the age of parents and the age of the youngest child. Workers with a greater need for leave, such as parents with very young children, are the least likely to have access to paid leave. Family income is directly related to the receipt of paid time off from work. Based on data from various studies, lower-income families are less likely to have access to paid sick leave and vacations compared to higher-income families. For example, 76% of families in the bottom income quartile lacked paid sick leave, while only 40% of families in the top income quartile did. Similarly, 64% of employed women with family income below 200% of the federal poverty level are not paid when they miss work to care for a sick child, compared to 37% of working women in higher-income families. Additionally, only 36% of lower-income children have at least one parent with access to paid sick leave, compared to 81% of children in higher-income families. The analysis of NSAF data shows that lower-income families have limited access to paid sick leave, with only 36% of children having a parent with this benefit. Welfare receipt reduces the likelihood of paid leave, and current welfare recipients have even less access to paid time off. This lack of support could hinder parents from transitioning off public assistance and maintaining ties to the labor market during family crises or when caring for a sick child. Employees who work fewer hours are less likely to be offered paid time off, especially at smaller employers. Paid leave availability increases with job tenure, but for poor working parents, access to paid leave is similar regardless of tenure. This could be due to working part-time or in service occupations with low provision of paid leave benefits. The MEPS survey collects data on household healthcare expenses from a nationally representative sample. The Center for Health Statistics surveys households about demographic and job characteristics, including access to paid sick leave. In 2007, about 60.4% of workers reported having paid sick leave, with a slightly higher percentage for women. Married individuals were more likely to have sick leave compared to never-married individuals. Married persons (67.2%) are significantly more likely than never-married individuals (45.3%) to have access to paid sick leave. Employees age 25 and older have higher rates of paid sick leave compared to younger workers. Hispanics are less likely to receive paid sick leave than non-Hispanic groups, possibly due to industry employment patterns. Employees in certain industry groups have lower rates of paid sick leave, with only 34.9% in construction, 24.8% in leisure and hospitality, and 27.3% in natural resources having access to it. There is a positive relationship between educational attainment and the incidence of paid sick leave, with 28.1% of employees with less than 12 years of schooling having it compared to 78.9% of those who completed four years of college. Occupational employment patterns may explain this disparity. The MEPS data in Table 5 shows that white-collar occupations have higher access to paid sick leave compared to blue-collar and service jobs. There is a positive relationship between employee earnings and the prevalence of paid sick leave, with lower earners having less access to sick leave benefits. The percentage of employees with access to paid sick leave increases with higher earnings, reaching over 80% for those earning more than $23.00 per hour. Low-wage workers are less likely to be offered paid leave benefits, possibly due to being seen as more replaceable. The cost of offering paid leave is $2.07 per hour worked on average, ranking behind insurance and legally required benefits. If Congress passes paid family-medical leave, it could be funded through a mandate or a TDI program with a payroll tax on employers. The cost of offering paid leave is $2.07 per hour worked on average, ranking behind insurance and legally required benefits. Employers may try to finance added benefit costs by reducing other components of compensation. BLS calculates benefit costs for all surveyed employers, affecting the cost per hour worked based on benefit provision frequency. Vacation benefits have the highest average cost per hour worked, followed by holidays, reflecting the lower incidence of sick leave benefits. The cost of offering paid sick leave is lower for private firms compared to state and local government, with an average cost of 23 cents per hour worked for private firms and 82 cents for government. Smaller companies generally have lower costs for leave benefits, with workplaces with 99 or fewer employees averaging 14 cents per hour worked for paid sick leave. The average cost of paid sick leave at workplaces varies based on the number of employees, with smaller firms averaging 14 cents per hour worked and larger firms averaging 33 cents. Access to paid time off is unevenly distributed, exacerbating wage inequality. The U.S. government has a limited role in mandating leave benefits. The U.S. government has limited involvement in mandating leave benefits, with state governments taking a more active role. Businesses have been moving away from traditional benefit provisions in recent years."
