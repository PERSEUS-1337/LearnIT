    "content": "Legislative proposals have been introduced since the 105th Congress to create a national electricity portfolio standard that would require electric utilities to procure a certain share of the electricity they sell from specified sources. States and territories are implementing mandatory portfolio standards, with some including nonrenewable sources like nuclear or selected fossil fuels. Lawmakers and stakeholders use terms like renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and clean energy standard (CES) interchangeably. This report discusses the use of the term \"portfolio standard\" instead of \"CES\" or \"clean energy\" to avoid confusion. Lawmakers have multiple goals for portfolio standards, including greenhouse gas reduction and job creation. Policy design choices can impact the achievement of these goals. Other policies like tax incentives or funding for technology research could also promote certain types of electricity generation sources. The report does not compare portfolio standards with other policy options or fully examine the costs and benefits of a national portfolio standard. This report provides an overview of portfolio standards and policy design elements for the electric power sector, analyzing potential economic and environmental effects. It also mentions other considerations like public health, critical minerals, electric reliability, cybersecurity, and geopolitics, which are outside the scope of the report. Various entities analyzed the effects of a national portfolio standard in 2011 and 2012 due to congressional interest at that time. The U.S. electric power sector has undergone changes since 2012, with an increase in natural gas and renewable energy generation, and a decrease in coal-fired generation. Total electricity generation increased by 4% from 2012 to 2018. Coal's share of generation decreased from 37% to 27%, while natural gas increased from 30% to  . Coal generated 37% of total generation in 2012 and 27% in 2018, while natural gas generated 30% in 2012 and 35% in 2018. Renewable sources accounted for 12% in 2012 and 18% in 2018. Projections suggest coal will contribute 17% in 2050, natural gas 39%, and renewables 31%. Factors driving these trends include low natural gas prices, environmental regulations, declining costs for renewables, and federal incentives. Factors influencing the shift in electricity generation sources include capital costs, federal tax incentives, state policies, changing consumer preferences, and natural turnover of generators. Stakeholders may have differing views on the need for federal policies to promote certain energy sources. Some argue that cost-competitive sources like natural gas and wind may not require additional support, while others believe state policies should solely govern electricity generation. Increasing the pace of change in the U.S. electricity portfolio is a related consideration. The curr_chunk discusses key concepts related to portfolio standards in the U.S. electricity sector, including terms like Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Clean Energy Standard (CES). Lawmakers and observers may use these terms inconsistently, and the Appendix provides more information on related bills. The curr_chunk explains banking and borrowing provisions in portfolio standards, as well as the base quantity of electricity to which the standard applies. Excluding sources from the base quantity calculation can impact generation requirements and financial incentives for different sources. Carve outs, tiers, multipliers, partial crediting, and usage limits are policy options for influencing support for different eligible sources under a portfolio standard. Policymakers aim to prevent reliance on a single low-cost source for compliance. Carve outs mandate a minimum use of specific sources, like solar energy, even if more expensive. Tiers can achieve the same goal. Sources can be categorized into tiers or carve outs under a portfolio standard to ensure diversity and prevent reliance on a single source. Multipliers and partial crediting can provide extra policy support or less credit to selected sources, respectively. Clean energy refers to the sources included in a portfolio standard. Lawmakers have the option to include various sources in a portfolio standard, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and more. Covered entities, typically electricity distribution utilities, have compliance obligations under these standards. The choice of eligible sources and considerations are discussed in the section \"Source Eligibility.\" A utility procures electricity from different generators with various energy sources for its portfolio. Credits are used for portfolio standards, and compliance is assessed through accounting measures. Credits are issued to clean energy generators based on actual electricity generation, which can be sold to utilities for compliance. Bundled credits are generated when a generator sells both electricity and credits to the same entity. The sale of credits in the electricity market can create additional revenue for generators, potentially influencing the decision to construct new generators or keep existing ones operational. Lawmakers may allow entities other than generators and utilities to buy and sell credits, with prices depending on various factors like portfolio standard stringency and market conditions. The sale of credits in the electricity market can generate revenue for generators, influencing decisions on construction or operation. Compliance costs for portfolio standards are typically passed on to customers, potentially impacting utility profitability. Fungibility of credits allows for interchangeability, raising questions on the compatibility of state and federal credits under a federal portfolio standard. Market-based policies, like portfolio standards and cap-and-trade programs, aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation using credits for compliance. Credits under portfolio standards are not interchangeable with allowances under cap-and-trade programs. These policies use financial incentives to achieve goals, contrasting with command-and-control policies. Portfolio standards indirectly incentivize generation from specific eligible sources in electricity markets, creating a financial disincentive for ineligible sources. Tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees offer direct financial incentives for eligible sources, reducing their market costs. Monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) ensure market-based policies achieve their goals by measuring electricity generation from eligible sources. Verification and monitoring of electricity generation from eligible sources are common practices in the industry, especially for large-scale generators. Qualifying facilities (QFs) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 receive special treatment, and utilities are required to purchase electricity from them at a predetermined price. There is no direct relationship between QFs and sources eligible under portfolio standards, although the term \"qualifying source\" is sometimes used in both contexts. Registries, also known as tracking systems, are electronic databases used to facilitate credit issuance and transfer for clean energy sources under portfolio standards. Administrators verify electricity generation, create credits with serial numbers, and place them in the appropriate entity's account in the registry. Credit owners can sell credits by filing documentation for transfer authorization. Covered entities demonstrate compliance by transferring credits to the administrator's account. Cybersecurity measures can prevent theft of portfolio standard credits. Some government agencies and private firms operate registries for credit administration. Vintage refers to the time period in which a tradeable credit is issued. Portfolio standards have annual compliance periods, with vintage expressed in years or specific months. Eligible sources receive credits based on the year of electricity generation. Banking and borrowing rules govern credit transactions. In 2025, a vintage 2025 credit would be received for compliance. Congress faces choices in designing a national portfolio standard, balancing policy goals with consumer cost concerns. Design elements interact, influencing potential effects. Legislation or agency regulations could implement the standard. Previous federal proposals vary in approach. The previous federal proposals summarized in the Appendix take different approaches, some leaving most decisions to an agency while others specify most design choices. Specifying details in legislation could add complexity but give lawmakers greater control. Portfolio standards aim to increase electricity generation from specific energy sources defined by lawmakers, with recent debates focusing on attributes like carbon. The federal discussions focus on carbon intensity, technology maturity, and market competitiveness in relation to portfolio standards for energy sources. There is a debate on whether to include low carbon sources like natural gas or only zero carbon sources. Advocates differ on whether all zero carbon sources, including nuclear energy and CCS, should be eligible. Advocates debate the eligibility of nuclear energy and CCS in portfolio standards, focusing on cost, environmental concerns, and technology maturity. Including mature technologies may achieve policy goals at a lower cost and be easier to deploy due to established industry standards. However, it may not incentivize new investments as much. Energy storage and energy efficiency can be incentivized in portfolio standards by defining them as eligible sources and providing an accounting methodology for issuing credits to them. Their deployment helps achieve policy goals such as technology innovation, greenhouse gas reduction, and job creation. This approach may involve carve outs, tiers, multipliers, partial crediting, or usage limits to influence the use of new or mature technologies for compliance. Energy storage and energy efficiency can be incentivized in portfolio standards by defining them as eligible sources and providing an accounting methodology for issuing credits to them. Lawmakers could establish separate targets for energy storage deployment and energy efficiency alongside a portfolio standard to incentivize their deployment. Distributed energy resources (DER) are located near the point of consumption in the electric power sector. Federal portfolio standard proposals put a compliance obligation on electric utilities, even though utilities do not always own or operate DER. The electric power industry lacks established methodologies for measuring generation from distributed energy resources (DER), which are like energy efficiency in reducing electricity sales. Lawmakers may need to consider including DER that use renewable sources as eligible sources. Other factors to consider include energy density, geographic variability in resource quality, and potential uneven wealth impacts in portfolio standard policymaking. The curr_chunk discusses the potential wealth impacts in portfolio standard policymaking due to the concentration of renewable energy resources in specific regions. It raises concerns about fairness and the transfer of wealth between states with different levels of resource development. Excluding existing sources could penalize early adopters, while including them could lead to wealth transfer from states without supportive policies. The curr_chunk explains the ownership models of electric utilities in the United States, including investor-owned utilities (IOUs), publicly owned utilities (POUs), and electric cooperatives (co-ops). IOUs operate for profit, POUs are owned by local governments and operate on a not-for-profit basis, while co-ops are member-owned organizations in rural areas. State governments allow IOUs to act as monopolies in their service territories. Publicly owned utilities (POUs) and electric cooperatives (co-ops) operate as monopolies in electricity distribution, serving about 27% of Americans. They are generally exempt from state regulation on electricity rates and investment decisions. Lawmakers would need to decide which type of utility a national portfolio standard would apply to, considering concerns about compliance costs and cost distribution. Excluding some utilities based on ownership model could impact the overall effectiveness of the policy. Publicly owned utilities (POUs) and electric cooperatives (co-ops) face higher administrative costs due to serving fewer customers than investor-owned utilities (IOUs). Utility size, not ownership model, may be a more precise factor in addressing these concerns. Legislation has set different utility size thresholds for inclusion in compliance standards. Figure 2 and Table 1 illustrate the distribution of utilities by ownership model and size ranges. The text discusses different utility size thresholds for compliance standards, with examples such as S. 2146 in the 112th Congress. It mentions the provisions of PURPA applying to utilities with at least 0.5 million MWh of sales and considers the share of total U.S. electricity sales covered by a portfolio standard. In 2017, 82% of U.S. electricity sales came from distribution utilities with sales volumes greater than 2 million MWh. In 2017, 82% of U.S. electricity sales came from distribution utilities with sales volumes greater than 2 million MWh. Targets for portfolio standards can be set for specific years or phased in over multiple periods, with different implications for energy sources. Linear phase-in benefits existing sources and mature technologies. Existing sources like wind and solar can generate electricity to meet compliance obligations. A back-end loaded phase-in may prevent price increases and allow time for new technology commercialization. A stepped phase-in could balance advantages and disadvantages, leading to uneven investment patterns. The stringency of a policy correlates with changes in generation profiles compared to business as usual. The policy's stringency is linked to the costs and benefits of implementation, with more stringent targets leading to higher costs but also potentially greater technology innovation and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Stringency can be measured by the net change in generation from eligible sources, considering the diverse national electricity generation profile. The electricity generation profile is diverse with various sources. The net change is the difference between the required portfolio standard and the current generation from eligible sources. The stringency of a portfolio standard can influence public perception, with different ways to describe it. Compliance obligation for clean energy sources is based on the percentage of electricity sales. The base quantity is crucial for calculating compliance obligations in a portfolio standard. It determines the amount of generation required from eligible sources, with some proposals excluding certain sources from the calculation. This approach incentivizes utilities to procure electricity from excluded sources to lower their clean energy procurement obligations. The compliance obligation for a hypothetical portfolio standard with a 50% clean energy requirement is based on the base quantity of electricity sold by a utility. If sources are excluded from the base quantity, the utility must procure electricity from both excluded sources and clean energy sources to meet the standard. Incentives for procuring electricity from excluded sources are generally lower than for clean energy sources. The incentive to procure electricity from excluded sources is generally lower than for clean energy sources. Policymakers may exclude certain sources from the base quantity calculation to provide less support. Energy efficiency and DER are inherently included in the base quantity calculation, and utility investments in EE or DER can help achieve compliance with a portfolio standard by reducing the need to procure from clean energy sources. Some regulatory models are being developed to maintain or increase profitability as the use of energy efficiency (EE) and distributed energy resources (DER) increases. Uncertainties in future electricity demand, technology development, and costs can impact the cost to consumers of a portfolio standard, which lawmakers need to consider. Safety valves, provisions that reduce stringency in response to high costs, can be included in legislation to protect consumers from high electricity costs. Including safety valves could promote regulatory certainty for covered entities. Safety valves in legislation could promote regulatory certainty for covered entities and consumers by addressing concerns that may arise. Congress could authorize an agency to implement safety valves. An alternative compliance payment (ACP) allows utilities to pay a fee instead of surrendering credits, depending on the cost control level set. The use of ACP could be unlimited or limited to a certain share of overall compliance. Lawmakers must decide how revenue from an ACP in a national portfolio standard would be disbursed, such as funding policy goals or returning it to consumers. Portfolio standards may have provisions to suspend compliance under certain conditions like cost thresholds or reliability risks. Tradable credits are used for compliance, providing cost containment for portfolio standards. The use of tradable credits in portfolio standards allows utilities to demonstrate compliance by surrendering credits from low-cost sources located outside their service territory. Allowing unbundled credits can help contain costs for consumers, but concerns exist over localized concentrations of harmful pollutants from ineligible sources. The use of tradable credits in portfolio standards allows utilities to reduce compliance costs by banking or borrowing credits from low-cost eligible sources outside their service territory. This practice can help utilities manage volatility in electricity markets and lower overall compliance costs. Lawmakers could increase the stringency of a portfolio standard by raising the target percentage of electricity sales or moving the deadline earlier based on certain thresholds like credit price or greenhouse gas emissions levels. This could enhance the benefits of the standard, but may also create uncertainty and unintended consequences for covered entities. The potential effects of a portfolio standard include market participants altering their actions to avoid triggering stricter regulations. Design elements balance policy objectives with minimizing cost increases for consumers. Uncertainty surrounds projections of a portfolio standard's impact on the U.S. electric power sector. The potential effects of a national portfolio standard on the American economy are influenced by various factors such as future economic activity, electricity demand, energy costs, and technology costs. International decisions can also impact costs, like lower solar panel production costs due to global demand for solar energy. Increased electricity costs could affect economic activity, leading to reduced consumption, increased efficiency measures, or reduced spending on other goods and services. Some price responses may have minimal effect on overall economic activity, such as consumers shifting spending from electricity consumption to energy efficiency improvements. Regional differences in electricity price changes could occur due to geographic variability in energy resources. Utilities in regions with less potential for eligible sources may buy credits from generators in other regions, resulting in higher electricity prices for some customers and lower prices for others. The ability to use unbundled credits for compliance could reduce overall compliance costs. Unbundled credits for compliance could lead to wealth transfer between regions and impact electricity prices, especially affecting poorer Americans. Businesses associated with eligible sources may benefit, while those with ineligible sources may suffer. Policy design choices play a crucial role in potential wealth transfer within the electric power sector. Negatively affected businesses, including individual generators and firms in their supply chains, may experience loss of capital investment and reduced employment. Communities near affected generators could see a decrease in tax revenue and increased demand for social services. Conversely, positively affected businesses and communities may see increased capital investment, employment, and other positive economic effects. American businesses developing goods for compliance with portfolio standards could potentially expand into international markets. Some businesses in the electric power sector may not be significantly impacted by a national portfolio standard, depending on various factors. Proponents argue that portfolio standards can lead to environmental benefits like reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. The environmental impact would depend on source eligibility and stringency choices. Implementation could also affect environmental outcomes, with different effects based on the scale of installations. The implementation of national portfolio standards in the electric power sector could have varying impacts on businesses, depending on factors such as source eligibility and stringency choices. Federal law preemption of state laws can be complex, with some states already implementing mandatory portfolio standards. A national portfolio standard could potentially preempt existing state standards, affecting utilities in those states. In states with existing portfolio standards, utilities may have to comply with both state and national standards simultaneously. The higher stringency standard would determine the eligible sources in a utility's portfolio, which could lead to compliance issues if the federal standard does not include sources allowed by the state standard. A utility covered under two portfolio standards may not necessarily double the amount of procurement required from eligible sources, but could face increased administrative costs. Simultaneous operation of state and federal portfolio standards may pose concerns such as administrative burdens and confusion for eligible sources. Preemption of state programs by Congress could disrupt project finances and lead to investment losses in clean energy industries. Congress could consider exempting utilities from federal portfolio standards if they already comply with state standards of equal or greater stringency. They could also allow states' credits to be used for federal compliance. Another option is to compensate utilities with federal credits for meeting state standards. Alternatively, Congress could leave it to states or judicial review to decide on the interaction between state and federal programs. State approval processes for new electricity transmission lines, especially for wind generation sources, may hinder compliance with a national portfolio standard. There is a debate on whether a stronger federal role in approving transmission infrastructure is needed to meet clean energy goals. Congress has previously considered federal approval for transmission infrastructure, but this authority has not been utilized. The authority for federal approval of transmission infrastructure has never been used. Some states have adopted policies to create competition among electricity generators through deregulation. Portfolio standards require utilities to purchase electricity from potentially more expensive sources, leading to out-of-market payments that could distort electricity markets. Eligible sources still compete for market share. The curr_chunk discusses legislation that would establish national portfolio standards for renewable energy sources, with bills listed in order of introduction by Congress. The search methodology used phrases like \"renewable portfolio standard\" and \"clean energy standard\" to identify relevant bills. The table lists bills introduced by Congress in order, with House bills first and Senate bills second, related to portfolio standards for renewable energy sources. Some bills in the table have multiple provisions that may impact the electric power sector, but those are not detailed here."
