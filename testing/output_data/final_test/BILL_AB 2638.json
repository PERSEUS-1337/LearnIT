    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Local Investment Advisory Board is created under Section 16429.2 of the Government Code, consisting of five members including the Treasurer or designated representative as chair. Two members with expertise in investment or finance are appointed by the Treasurer, and two members from county, city, or local district financial positions are also appointed. Each member serves a three-year term at the pleasure of the appointing authority, with vacancies filled in the same manner for the unexpired term. The Local Investment Advisory Board members are entitled to a per diem allowance of $50 for each meeting attended, with a monthly limit of $300. They can also be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The board's main purpose is to advise and assist the Treasurer in investment decisions for the Local Agency Investment Fund. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund is created for governmental entities to make voluntary deposits for intermediate or long-term investments. The fund allows investments in corporate bonds up to three years, government bonds up to 30 years, physical gold, and convertible securities. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Advisory Board recommends qualified moneys for the fund. The Treasurer can reject deposits that may harm the state's portfolio. Investments aim for maximum returns with safe management. Titles of investments are kept secure by the Treasurer. The Controller distributes interest earned from investments to contributing entities proportionately. Reasonable costs are deducted before distribution, capped at 5% of earnings. If the Treasury Bill Rate is below 1%, costs cannot exceed a certain limit. The state's fiscal year earnings can have reasonable costs deducted, capped at 8% of earnings for the next fiscal year. These costs are credited back to state agencies involved in implementing the article. Moneys deposited in the Intermediate and Long Term Investment Fund are held in trust and cannot be transferred, loaned, impounded, or seized by the state. The right of local agencies to withdraw their funds from the fund upon demand cannot be denied, even if the state fails to adopt a budget by July 1. If an agency prematurely withdraws funds, they must pay a penalty determined by the Treasurer. The Intermediate and Long Term Investment Advisory Board is established with five members, including the Treasurer as chairperson. Members must have expertise in investing and finance or be treasurers, finance officers, or business managers from local government entities. Members from other investment boards are ineligible for selection. The term of office for appointed members of the board is two years, serving at the pleasure of the appointing authority. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members not state officers or employees do not receive a salary but are entitled to a per diem allowance and reimbursement for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The board advises the Treasurer on investments and distributes performance reports quarterly and annually to the Legislature and Department of Finance."
