    "content": "On December 8, 2015, the House passed H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015, which was included in the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The act changed who can travel under the VWP and included enhancements to increase program security announced by the Obama Administration on November 30, 2015. The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries, mainly in Europe, to enter the United States without a visa. The Obama Administration announced security enhancements for the VWP, including information sharing and biometric data collection on travelers. Assistance will be provided to countries to counter terrorist travel threats. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has come under increased congressional focus due to recent terrorist attacks in France and Belgium. Proponents argue that the VWP strengthens national security through document standards and information sharing, while critics fear it could create security loopholes. VWP travelers do not undergo the same screening as visa applicants. Consular officers conduct personal interviews and use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to screen visa applicants for inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act. They also check lookout databases like CLASS and TIPOFF. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the nonimmigrant visa requirement for temporary visitors from certain countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows eligible nationals from certain countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. Participants must obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). The program was modified in 2015 to restrict eligibility for individuals who have been in certain countries since March 1, 2011. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was modified in 2015 to restrict travel for individuals who have been in specified countries since March 1, 2011. The prohibited countries include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Exceptions apply for military service or official duties in a VWP country, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis. Individuals eligible for a waiver under the Visa Waiver Program include those traveling on official duty for international organizations, NGOs, or journalism purposes, as well as for legitimate business-related purposes in Iran and Iraq. Dual nationals of VWP countries and specified countries are ineligible for VWP travel. The Secretary of DHS can waive travel prohibition under the VWP for certain dual nationals if it serves US law enforcement or national security interests. DHS has not provided guidance on dual national waivers yet. VWP allows easier entry for certain nationals but has restrictions - those with B visas can extend stay or change status, but VWP entrants can only extend stay for emergencies for 30 days and cannot adjust status, except for limited exceptions. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows certain nationals easier entry into the US but with restrictions. To qualify for the VWP, a country must meet specific criteria, including offering reciprocal privileges to US citizens and having a low nonimmigrant refusal rate. Additionally, countries must issue machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers. Violating VWP terms can lead to deportation without judicial review, except in asylum cases. Countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) must meet various criteria, including issuing machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers and reporting lost or stolen passports to INTERPOL within 24 hours. They also need to screen foreign nationals using INTERPOL databases and accept repatriation of their citizens. Countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) must meet criteria such as issuing machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers, reporting lost or stolen passports to INTERPOL within 24 hours, screening foreign nationals using INTERPOL databases, and accepting repatriation of their citizens. Additionally, they must enter into an agreement with the United States to share information on potential threats, and not compromise U.S. law enforcement or security interests. The Secretary of DHS can suspend or terminate a country from the VWP based on security risks or emergencies. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries can be suspended or terminated if they pose security risks or compromise U.S. law enforcement interests. Argentina and Uruguay were removed from the VWP in 2002 and 2003, respectively, due to issues with illegal immigration. Countries with a disqualification rate of 2% to 3.5% are placed on probationary status. No country has been removed from the VWP since 2003. Countries with a disqualification rate of 2% to 3.5% may be placed on probation in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Belgium was previously on provisional status due to passport concerns but was later removed from probation. The Secretary of DHS can waive the refusal rate requirement for VWP admission under certain circumstances. The Secretary of DHS can waive the refusal rate requirement for admission to the VWP once an air exit system is in place to verify the departure of foreign nationals. Countries with a refusal rate waiver must meet all security requirements of the program. The Secretary of DHS can waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement for countries to participate in the VWP if they meet security measures, have a sustained reduction in visa refusal rates, cooperate on counterterrorism initiatives, and have a nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of less than 10% or an overstay rate below the maximum established by DHS and DOS. The Secretary of DHS, in consultation with the Secretary of DOS, may consider various factors for waiving the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement for countries in the VWP, including airport security, air marshal program, and overstay rates. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) was implemented to gather biographical information from aliens before travel to the US under the VWP. Visitors traveling to the United States by airplane or cruise ship on January 12, 2009 are required to use ESTA, which involves a $14 fee. ESTA collects biographical information such as name, birth date, citizenship, passport details, and travel information to determine eligibility for travel. If approved, the alien can travel, but if not, a visa is required before coming to the United States. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) collects biographical and travel information to determine eligibility for travel to the United States. ESTA approval is valid for two years or until passport expiration, with the DHS Secretary having the authority to revoke or shorten the validity period at any time. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) determines eligibility for travel to the United States, but does not determine admissibility. Admissibility is decided by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors at ports of entry. The Secretary of DHS is required to research developments to enhance ESTA technology for fraud prevention. Travelers under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) do not need a visa and are inspected by CBP officers upon arrival. Passenger manifests are sent to CBP officials before arrival for security checks. Passenger arrival and departure information for individuals entering and leaving the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is collected electronically through CBP's Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS). This data is sent to DHS's Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) for matching arrivals and departures. CBP officers conduct primary inspections at ports of entry by questioning applicants, examining passports, and checking against a computerized system to determine admissibility. The US-VISIT system uses biographical and biometric information to check the identity of travelers entering the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Primary inspections are quick, but suspicious travelers are referred to secondary inspections for further questioning and document examination. The US-VISIT system checks travelers entering the US under the Visa Waiver Program. An exit system was required by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act to record the departure of VWP aliens. DHS proposed biometric exit procedures for international visitors in 2008. In 2008, DHS proposed biometric exit procedures for international visitors. Congress required DHS to conduct pilots testing biometric exit procedures at airports. DHS completed the pilot programs, but GAO reported delays in delivering a comprehensive exit solution. In 2011, DHS announced an agreement with Canada to share entry records, counting entry into Canada as an exit in U.S. records. The number of entrants under the VWP has steadily increased since FY2009, with over 21 million people entering under the VWP in FY2014. In FY2014, the number of people entering under the VWP reached over 21 million, the largest ever. However, the proportion of total visitors represented by VWP entrants has been decreasing since FY2009. In FY2014, VWP entrants made up 31% of all temporary visitors, the lowest in over 20 years. The terrorist attacks in Europe in 2015 and 2016 have raised concerns about the risks posed by VWP country citizens who may have radicalized. The U.S. travel and tourism industry supports the VWP as a tool for economic growth through foreign tourism and commerce. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) benefits the U.S. economy by increasing foreign tourism and commerce. The Department of State (DOS) argues that waiving the visa requirement for low-risk countries reduces consular workloads, saves costs, and allows resources to focus on higher-risk nations. There are concerns about the VWP's impact on national security, with some arguing it poses a significant risk. Critics suggest a trusted traveler program for low-risk individuals instead of country-based waivers. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows visa-free travel for low-risk individuals, reducing consular workload but increasing immigration inspector workload at ports of entry. There is debate on whether the VWP enhances or compromises national security. The ESTA system has improved VWP security, but it cannot check against biometric databases like DHS's IDENT and FBI's IAFIS. Some argue that the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) may increase immigration fraud and decrease border security due to relaxed documentary requirements. However, others believe the VWP enhances security by setting standards for travel documents and information sharing, promoting economic growth and cultural ties. Concerns also exist about the security of the program, including DHS's ability to conduct reviews of VWP countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) undergoes regular evaluations by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure participation aligns with US security interests. Reports show delays in meeting reporting deadlines, prompting changes to enhance program security through the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act. In August 2015, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced new security measures for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including requiring e-passports for all VWP travelers, using the INTERPOL database for screening, and increasing the presence of air marshals on flights from VWP countries. Additional changes were announced in November to further enhance VWP security. The changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) included modifying ESTA to capture travel history to terrorist safe havens, accelerating review processes for VWP countries, requiring reports on biometrics and terrorism information sharing, offering assistance for terrorism information sharing with biometrics, and deploying Foreign Fighter Surge Teams. The Secretary of DHS's authority to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate has been suspended until the air exit system can match biometric information with watch lists. Some argue that the current biographic system is sufficient for security and immigration enforcement. DHS also agreed with Canada to share entry records for border crossings. The shared entry records may not include biometric identifiers, raising concerns about program security. More security measures, like biometric exit capacity, are needed before admitting more countries. Issues exist with timely reporting of lost and stolen passport data, with varying mechanisms and sources for this information. DHS primarily relies on INTERPOL's database for this data. P.L. 114-113 amended the reporting requirement for lost or stolen passports to be within 24 hours. VWP countries must share information on potential security threats with the US. All VWP countries have agreements for sharing terrorist information under HSPD-6. P.L. 114-113 amended reporting requirements for lost or stolen passports to be within 24 hours. VWP countries must fully implement HSPD-6 arrangements and PCSC Agreements to participate. A GAO report found that some VWP countries have not shared terrorist or criminal information as required. Concerns have been raised about potential terrorist threats, especially from those aligned with the Islamic State. Concerns have been raised about potential terrorist threats, especially from those aligned with the Islamic State, entering the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). One focus is on refugees from Syria, with reports of terrorists using fake Syrian passports to enter Europe. However, Syrian refugees resettled in VWP countries are ineligible to travel to the US under the VWP unless they receive citizenship and passports from those countries. Another concern is radicalized citizens of VWP countries. Several perpetrators of the 2015 Paris attacks were citizens of VWP countries, including France and Belgium. It is uncertain if these terrorists would have been eligible to travel to the US under the VWP, and if the visa requirement would have affected their ability to enter the country. The VWP allows certain countries to travel to the US without a visa, while others must obtain a visa. Some argue that the VWP increases security by setting travel document standards and sharing information. DHS has admitted 10 new countries into the program since 2008. Poland has expressed frustration over not being included in the VWP, despite President Obama's promise to prioritize their inclusion. Congress would need to amend the INA due to Poland's high visa refusal rate. Only 5 out of the EU's 28 member states are part of the VWP. Poland is not part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) despite President Obama's promise to include them. Congress would need to amend the INA to allow Poland into the program. Only 5 out of the EU's 28 member states are not VWP countries. EU citizens from non-VWP countries need a visa to travel to the US, while US citizens do not need visas for short stays in EU countries. EU has a reciprocity mechanism to achieve visa reciprocity with the US. The European Commission can suspend visa-free travel for a third country if there is no full reciprocity. So far, no visa-free travel has been suspended under the new reciprocity rules. The European Commission has not suspended visa-free travel under the new reciprocity mechanism despite delays in decision-making. Concerns have been raised about the nonimmigrant visa refusal rate as an arbitrary standard. DHS uses departure information to assess overstay rates for program participation. DHS calculates overstay rates for VWP and non-VWP countries using departure information from passenger manifests. The overstay rates for all current VWP countries are less than 3%, while the worldwide overstay rate for non-VWP countries is less than 2%. Visa refusal rates are not always indicative of overstay rates, as people may be denied visas for various reasons. Consular officers must ensure visa applicants are not ineligible under INA grounds for inadmissibility. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act (H.R. 158) was enacted to address visa inadmissibility issues, including criminal history and terrorist activity. Some provisions of the Act are controversial, leading to proposed amendments. Additionally, bills in the 114th Congress aim to enhance VWP security requirements. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements to enhance security features. Proposed changes include reinstating nonimmigrant refusal rate waiver authority, using overstay rates for program eligibility, creating a new VWP for the U.S. Virgin Islands, and adding Poland to the VWP. H.R. 158, H.R. 5253, and S. 1619 have received action, with H.R. 158 being enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements in P.L. 114-113 mandate that foreign nationals must have an electronic passport with biometric information. VWP countries must validate machine-readable passports by October 1, 2016. Travel between Schengen Area countries is exempt from this requirement. Individuals present in certain countries since March 1, 2011, including Iraq and Syria, are prohibited from using the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements in P.L. 114-113 state that individuals from certain specified countries are ineligible to travel under the VWP, unless they were there for military service or official duties. The Secretary of DHS can waive this prohibition if it serves law enforcement or national security interests. Additionally, countries must validate machine-readable passports by October 1, 2016, with exemptions for travel within the Schengen Area. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements in P.L. 114-113 amended reporting rules for lost or stolen passports, requiring countries to report within 24 hours. Program countries with international airports must certify screening of foreign nationals using INTERPOL databases or face termination from the VWP. Travel within the Schengen Area is exempt from this screening requirement. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires countries to sign and fully implement PCSC Agreements before being designated as VWP countries. Failure to share information on potential threats to the US will result in termination from the program, with reinstatement upon meeting requirements. DHS must report biennially to Congress on national security threats posed by program countries. Annual evaluations of program countries are conducted based on specific criteria. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires countries to meet specific criteria and share information on security threats to the US. The Secretary of DHS can suspend a program country if it poses a high risk to national security. The Secretary is also authorized to shorten the validity period of ESTA determinations and collect information on applicants' citizenships. Additionally, DHS must report annually on individuals denied travel under ESTA due to security threats. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) can be suspended if a country poses a security threat to the US. DHS must report on ways to strengthen ESTA to prevent terrorists from entering the US. Assistance must be provided to non-VWP countries for submitting information on lost travel documents to INTERPOL and validating e-passports at ports of entry. Congress suggests ICAO establish e-passport standards for member countries. S. 2362 includes provisions for DHS to evaluate ESTA questions regularly. S. 2362 requires regular evaluation of ESTA questions by the Secretary of DHS and data assessment by the Commissioner of CBP. It also mandates reports to Congress on airports adhering to preclearance requirements and potential national security benefits. Additionally, countries must comply with an agreement to support an effective Air Marshal Program. The provision prohibiting dual nationals of VWP countries and certain other countries from using the VWP has raised concerns about its impact on U.S. citizens with dual nationality. Dual U.S.-Iranian, U.S.-Iraqi, U.S.-Sudanese, or U.S.-Syrian citizens do not need a visa to travel to the U.S., but may face restrictions when traveling to VWP countries, especially those in the EU. The VWP is based on reciprocity and may restrict visa-free travel for certain dual national U.S. citizens to VWP countries. Concerns have been raised about discriminatory provisions in P.L. 114-113, and the Equal Protection in Travel Act aims to allow dual nationals from VWP and other countries to travel under the VWP. S. 2458 would amend P.L. 114-113 to designate countries of concern for dual nationals, making them ineligible for admission to the U.S. The bill aims to restrict visa-free travel for certain dual national U.S. citizens to VWP countries. It includes exemptions for official duties and delays implementation for certain individuals. S. 2458 would designate countries of concern for dual nationals, making them ineligible for admission to the U.S. It would also sunset the prohibition on certain dual nationals traveling under the VWP. The bills aim to restrict visa-free travel under the VWP for foreign nationals who have traveled to countries with terrorist organizations in the past five years. They also require machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers for VWP travelers and add additional requirements for countries participating in the program. Additionally, HSPD-6 arrangements and PCSC Agreements must be signed and fully implemented before a country can be designated as a VWP country. The bills propose stricter requirements for countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including reporting lost or stolen passports promptly, complying with U.S. aviation security standards, and assisting in the Air Marshal Program. Failure to comply could result in termination from the VWP. Considerations for VWP designation include sharing passenger information with the U.S. for non-bound flights. The United States collects and shares information on air travelers, screens passports against INTERPOL's database, shares lost or stolen document information with INTERPOL, collects biometric data on asylum seekers, and shares intelligence on foreign fighters with international organizations. S. 2337 proposes requiring biometric information from foreign nationals under the Visa Waiver Program. The bill proposes that foreign nationals under the Visa Waiver Program must submit biometric information before traveling to the United States, prioritizing countries with nationals linked to ISIL. The Secretary of DHS can delay implementation for up to two years for countries not posing a security risk. Countries can meet the requirement by signing an agreement to share biometric data for VWP travelers. The bill proposes biometric verification for VWP travelers to the US, with DHS conducting advance checks and sharing threat information. A demonstration program for biometric data verification is required within 15 months. ESTA fees would cover administration costs and security enhancements. H.R. 4122 would restrict VWP travel for individuals who visited certain countries in the past five years. H.R. 5253, related to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), would prohibit individuals who traveled to Iraq or Syria in the past five years from entering the US under the VWP. The bill also requires the screening of electronic passports at airports within one year of enactment. The Commissioner of CBP screens electronic passports at airports using facial recognition or other biometric technology. Individuals issued visas are continuously screened against criminal, national security, and terrorism databases. Bills like H.R. 1401 and S. 2091 authorize the designation of VWP countries with low overstay and refusal rates. The Secretary of DHS can waive the refusal rate requirement under certain conditions. The bills would revise the probationary period and procedures for terminating a country's participation in the VWP if requirements are not met. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) would review DHS methods for tracking aliens entering and exiting the US. DHS must evaluate security risks of aliens entering without ESTA verification and submit a report to Congress within 90 days of enactment. The bills propose changes to the Visa Waiver Program, including a provision to designate Poland as a VWP country and create a visa waiver program for CARICOM nations entering the U.S. Virgin Islands for up to 30 days. The bills also emphasize the importance of DHS prioritizing reviews of countries where necessary. The bill proposes changes to the Visa Waiver Program, allowing the Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands to request the addition of a country to the VIVWP. Factors considered include electronic travel authorizations, passport procedures, repatriation, visa refusal rates, overstays, and information exchange. The Visa Waiver Pilot Program was established in 1986, requiring countries to offer reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens and maintain a low non-immigrant refusal rate to participate. The Visa Waiver Pilot Program, established in 1986, required countries to offer reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens and maintain a low non-immigrant refusal rate. Congress passed legislation to extend the program's authorization, expand the number of participating countries, and modify qualifying criteria between 1986 and 1997. The Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994 and the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 modified the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, creating probationary statuses for countries with varying nonimmigrant visa refusal rates. Temporary extensions were granted through legislation in the 105th Congress, with the program set to expire in 1997 but extended through April 30, 1998. In 1998, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 105-173) extending the Visa Waiver Pilot Program through April 30, 2000, and made changes to the selection criteria for participating countries. The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act (P.L. 106-396) was signed into law on October 30, 2000, making the program permanent and strengthening documentary and reporting requirements. By 1999, 29 countries were participating in the program. The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act (P.L. 106-396) mandated machine-readable passports for VWP entrants by October 1, 2007, ongoing country evaluations, and collection of arrival/departure data. The USA Patriot Act (P.L. 107-56) advanced the passport deadline to October 1, 2003. The Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act required machine-readable passports for VWP entrants by October 1, 2007, with the option for a waiver until October 1, 2007. The USA Patriot Act accelerated the deadline to October 1, 2003, and mandated tamper-resistant passports for VWP countries. The deadline for presenting machine-readable passports was extended to October 26, 2004. Non-machine-readable passports now require a visa for entry into the United States. The Border Security Act of 2002 mandated VWP countries to report theft of blank passports and required aliens entering under the VWP to be checked against a lookout system. It also required VWP countries to issue machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers by October 26, 2004. The USA Patriot Act set a deadline for all VWP entrants to have machine-readable, tamper-resistant passports with biometric identifiers. The deadline for biometric passports in VWP countries was extended to October 27, 2005, by P.L. 108-299. After this date, all VWP entrants needed machine-readable, tamper-resistant passports, with only those issued after October 26, 2005, requiring a biometric identifier. Most VWP countries were unable to meet the new deadline, especially if they needed e-passports with electronic data chips. The U.S. government extended the deadline for biometric passports in VWP countries to October 27, 2005. Only France and Italy initially failed to meet the deadline but have since complied. Passports issued after October 26, 2006, require integrated chips. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 added the requirement for VWP countries to develop tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents. The U.S. government is developing a program to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents with biometric identifiers for entry verification. The 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 allowed the Secretary of DHS to waive nonimmigrant refusal rate requirements for the VWP once certain conditions are met, including an air exit system with biometric identifiers. After 2009, the air exit system must include biometric identifiers for aliens. If the system cannot match biometric information with watch lists, the Secretary of DHS cannot waive nonimmigrant refusal rates. Countries receiving refusal rate waivers for the VWP must meet security requirements, have reduced visa refusal rates, cooperate on counterterrorism, and have measures to continue reducing refusal rates. The criteria for countries to receive waivers of nonimmigrant refusal rates for the Visa Waiver Program include cooperating on counterterrorism, maintaining a low visa refusal rate, and meeting security requirements such as effective airport security and passport standards. Other factors like the country's air marshal program and estimated overstay rate are also considered. P.L. 110-53 made changes to the Visa Waiver Program criteria to enhance security, including implementing an electronic travel authorization system for aliens entering the United States under the program. Additionally, the act required the establishment of an exit system to record the departure of VWP aliens. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) under P.L. 110-53 requires countries to report lost or stolen passports through INTERPOL, accept repatriation of individuals with removal orders within three weeks, and share information with the United States. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires countries to share information with the United States to assess threats to U.S. security. The Secretary of DHS provides technical assistance to VWP countries, and the Director of National Intelligence conducts intelligence assessments. Immediate notification of threats from VWP countries is required. The Secretary of DHS may suspend a VWP country without prior notice if it poses a security threat, and reinstate it once the threat is resolved."
