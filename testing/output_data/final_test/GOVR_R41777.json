    "content": "A period of unemployment significantly increases the likelihood of a worker and their family falling into poverty. Unemployed individuals have a higher poverty rate compared to employed individuals. Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits aim to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to help stabilize the economy during recessions. Unemployment benefits provide partial wage replacement to prevent workers and their families from falling into poverty. The UI program, while not means-tested, plays a crucial role in reducing poverty associated with job loss. It also has a countercyclical effect by injecting money into the economy, helping unemployed workers meet basic needs and stimulating economic activity. The report examines the antipoverty effects of UI benefits during economic downturns, focusing on the most recent recession. It highlights the impact of additional benefits for unemployed workers. Estimates are based on 25 years of data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The report examines the impact of UI benefits on alleviating poverty during the 2009 recession. It does not consider behavioral changes that individuals, employers, or the government would have made without the temporary congressional changes in UI benefits. Some beneficiaries may have altered their behavior by taking a job earlier, relying on additional work hours, or applying for other government benefits. Employers may have also made different decisions regarding hiring and layoffs. The report discusses the impact of UI benefits on poverty during the 2009 recession and how behavioral changes in individuals, employers, and the government could have affected hiring and layoffs. It also addresses the aging labor market's impact on unemployment rates and the shift towards permanent job separations. The report further delves into the Unemployment Insurance system and its effects on poverty status. The section examines the impact of UI benefit receipt on an individual's poverty status, estimating the number of people below the poverty threshold without UI benefits. It also analyzes the number lifted above the threshold and the share of unemployed individuals who are poor based on UI benefits. The report compares the effects of the Unemployment Insurance system on poverty during recent recessions. Appendices provide legislative details on the EUC08 program and data on UI receipt trends by labor market status. The appendix examines different measures of labor underutilization, including unemployment rates, involuntary part-time workers, and discouraged workers. It compares CPS/ASEC estimates to UI administrative data benchmarks and assesses the quality of UI estimates over a 25-year period. The CPS/ASEC data undercount UI benefit receipt. The report may underestimate the impact of unemployment insurance on poverty rates due to undercounting in CPS/ASEC data. Figure 1 illustrates the U.S. monthly unemployment rate trends from 1987 to 2012, showing that unemployment tends to rise beyond the end of recessions as employers are cautious in hiring new workers. Job growth occurs when existing labor capacity is stretched and additional workers are needed to meet demand for goods and services. During recessions, unemployment rates tend to rise beyond the official end of the recession as shown in Figure 2. In the 1990-1991 recession, unemployment peaked at 7.8% 15 months after the recession ended. In the 2000 recession, it peaked at 6.3% 19 months after the end. The most recent recession saw a peak of 10.0% four months after the end. The duration of unemployment spells is also a key indicator of labor market stress. The median duration of unemployment during the most recent recession peaked at 25.0 weeks in June 2010, indicating significant labor market stress. This was more than twice as long as in previous recessions. By August 2012, the median duration had decreased to 18.0 weeks. Some individuals may drop out of the labor force altogether during economic downturns, believing that job search would be fruitless. The Bureau of Labor Statistics categorizes different groups of workers, including discouraged workers, marginally attached workers, and underemployed individuals. The U-6 measure includes unemployed, discouraged, marginally attached, and part-time workers for economic reasons. The U-6 measure includes unemployed, discouraged, marginally attached, and part-time workers for economic reasons. The U-6 rate is higher than the official unemployment rate, especially during economic contractions, indicating a heightened level of labor market distress. The U-6 rate, which includes unemployed, discouraged, marginally attached, and part-time workers, was significantly higher than the official unemployment rate during the period examined. In October 2009, the U-6 rate peaked at 17.2%, 7.2 percentage points above the official unemployment rate of 10.0%. Workers who lose their jobs face reduced chances of full-time employment and are more likely to end up in part-time positions. Unemployed workers who find new full-time employment experience decreased earnings. Benefits available include Unemployment Insurance, providing cash supplement to replace lost wages. Benefits include Unemployment Compensation (UC), Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08), and extended benefit (EB) programs. These are collectively referred to as Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits. Unemployed workers receive Unemployment Insurance benefits, which include Unemployment Compensation (UC), Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08), and extended benefit (EB) programs. Each state determines the specifics of UC benefits, eligibility, and duration based on federal guidelines. Eligibility is based on qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period prior to unemployment. The UC program provides benefits to workers who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet state-established rules. The UC program provides benefits to workers who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet state-established eligibility rules. States disqualify claimants who lost their jobs due to inability to work, voluntary quitting without good cause, job-related misconduct, or refusal of suitable work. Benefits are intended to help meet basic obligations until a new position is found, typically replacing up to 50% of a worker's wages for 26 weeks based on a substantial work history. The Extended Unemployment Compensation (EB) program, established in 1970, aims to provide federal response to economic downturns by extending unemployment benefits at the state level. Costs are shared between federal and state funds, with benefits capped at 13 weeks if certain economic conditions exist. The Extended Unemployment Compensation (EB) program provides up to 13 weeks of benefits based on specific unemployment rate thresholds. States can choose optional thresholds for additional benefits, such as an extra 13 weeks if the state's unemployment rate meets certain criteria. Recent studies suggest that current EB triggers for unemployment benefits are difficult to attain due to the secular decline in unemployment rates. Critics argue that the triggers deploy too late in some states, not at all in high unemployment states, and deactivate too quickly. Reasons for this include the long-term decline in unemployment rates, conflicting rate and lookback provisions, and changes to the program in the 1980s. The section also briefly describes temporary unemployment benefit programs in past recessions. The federal government has implemented various temporary unemployment benefit programs in response to economic recessions, including the EB program and the EUC08 program. These programs extended the duration of benefits beyond the regular state UC benefits, taking into account state economic conditions. From 1987 through 2013, three temporary programs were in effect, with complex changes in EUC08 during 2012. The 1991 Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program provided 13 to 33 weeks of benefits, the 2002 Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program offered up to 26 weeks, and the current EUC08 program started in July 2008 with up to 20 weeks, later modified to provide up to 53 weeks of benefits. Additionally, ARRA added $25/week (FAC) to all unemployment benefits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) temporarily increased all types of unemployment benefits by $25 per week from March 2009 to May 2010. It also excluded $2,400 in UI benefits from gross income for 2009. ARRA extended the EUC08 program through December 26, 2009, and provided 100% federal financing for the EB program until December 31, 2013. States were given the option to use exhaustion of EUC08 benefits as an eligibility requirement for weeks of EB. States can use exhaustion of EUC08 benefits as an eligibility requirement for EB payments between ARRA's enactment and the end of 100% federal funding. ARRA incentivized states to modify UI benefit computations and extend benefits to more individuals. States were required to adopt an alternative method of determining eligibility to access $7 billion in funding. They could receive the remaining two-thirds of the funds by implementing specific provisions such as allowing part-time work for former employees and providing extended compensation for training programs. 36 states received the full amount available under the modernization law. A total of $4.4 billion was distributed to 41 states under the modernization law. Data exist to show the percentage of unemployed receiving various types of unemployment benefits. As a recession ends, the percentage of those receiving regular UC declines. The percentage of unemployed receiving regular UC declines as most are long-term unemployed or new labor market participants. The ARRA provisions and EUC08 program expanded unemployment benefits, with almost two-thirds of all unemployed persons receiving benefits in 2009 and 2010. The percentage declined in 2011 but remained above half. In 2011, benefits declined but still remained above half of all unemployed workers. The percentage of those receiving additional benefits beyond regular UC payments was higher in 2010 compared to previous years. Unemployment insurance plays a significant role in reducing poverty among the unemployed, as shown by studies from the Congressional Budget Office and Vroman. The impact of unemployment insurance on poverty rates was studied in 2008 and 2009, showing a small overall effect that increases with longer unemployment duration. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act kept 1.3 million people out of poverty through additional temporary UI benefits. This report extends the research by analyzing the antipoverty effects of UI benefits across the three most recent recessions, estimating the impact on the poverty rate for the unemployed and families receiving UI. It also examines how much of the total UI benefits directly reduced family poverty levels. The impact of UI benefits on poverty rates extends to all recipients and their family members, affecting the income status of approximately 26.0 million individuals in 2011. UI receipt influences the overall poverty rate by providing additional income, as shown in Figure 6. In 2011, UI benefits reduced the poverty rate by 0.7 percentage points to 15.0%. The antipoverty effect of UI benefits decreased from 2010 to 2011 due to fewer unemployed receiving benefits. In 1993, UI benefits only reduced poverty by 0.5 percentage points, compared to a 1.1 percentage point reduction in 2010. The impact of UI benefits lifted approximately 26.0 million individuals above poverty in 2011. In 2009 and 2010, over 3 million people were lifted out of poverty by UI benefits, with the number decreasing to just over 2.3 million in 2011. UI benefits also lifted nearly a million children out of poverty in 2009, with the number decreasing in 2010 and 2011. In 1992, UI lifted about 1.5 million persons out of poverty, including nearly half a million children. Figure 8 illustrates the impact of UI benefits on individuals and families, showing that in 2011, UI benefits reduced the poverty rate by almost 9 percentage points. Figure 9 further demonstrates that UI benefits in 2009, 2010, and 2011 decreased the overall poverty rate by 7.1%, 6.5%, and 4.7% respectively, with the largest reduction seen in 2009. UI benefits significantly reduced the poverty rate, with a 3.8% decrease overall. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, UI benefits cut the poverty rate by 48.0%, 44.0%, and 39.4% respectively. Aggregate UI benefits in 2009 and 2010 were over twice those reported in 1992 and 2002. In 2011, UI benefits decreased but were still above previous recession peaks. In 2009, $18.5 billion in UI benefits reduced poverty, increasing to $20.0 billion in 2010 and $14.8 billion in 2011. In 2011, $14.8 billion in UI benefits went towards reducing poverty, accounting for 21.6% of all UI dollars. Actual benefits paid out exceed the amount captured by surveys, with income amounts falling short of benchmarks. Despite a decrease in aggregate UI benefits from 2011 to 2010, the share that went towards poverty reduction increased to an historic peak of 21.6% in 2011. Over one-fifth of UI benefits received by families in 2011 were used to reduce poverty. The poverty rates among unemployed persons differed based on whether they received UI benefits or not. Those who received UI benefits had lower poverty rates compared to those who did not. However, over the past recession and economic recovery, poverty rates among the unemployed increased regardless of UI benefits. Unemployed individuals not receiving UI benefits saw their poverty rate increase from 23.6% in 2006 to 30.1% in 2011, while those receiving UI benefits also experienced an increase in poverty rates. The pre-UI poverty rate among unemployed individuals who received UI benefits increased from 13.4% in 2007 to 27.5% in 2010, converging with the poverty rate of unemployed non-recipients. The gap between UI recipients and non-recipients widened slightly from 2010 to 2011, with UI recipients experiencing a decrease in poverty rates while non-recipients saw an increase. In most years, UI recipients had pre-UI poverty rates 40% to 50% lower than unemployed non-recipients, except during recessionary periods. UI benefits significantly reduced poverty rates among recipients during recession and recovery periods. In 2010, over a quarter of unemployed individuals receiving UI benefits would have been considered poor without them, but their poverty rate was cut by more than half to 12.5% after receiving benefits. In contrast, in previous recessions, UI benefits reduced the poverty rate from 18.9% to 10.1% in 2003. UI benefits played a significant role in reducing poverty rates during the most recent recession, with a notable decrease in the share of unemployed individuals without earnings. In 2007, only 5.6% of those receiving UI benefits had no earnings, compared to 21.7% of those without UI benefits. The share of unemployed UI recipients without earnings increased during the recession years, reaching over 25.7% in 2010. The proportion of unemployed individuals receiving UI benefits increased from 1-in-10 in 2008 to over 1-in-5 in 2009, over 1-in-4 in 2010, and just under that ratio in 2011. This trend corresponds to a rise in the median duration of unemployment and an increased reliance on EB and EUC08 benefits. The increase in pre-UI poverty rates among UI recipients suggests that the longer duration of unemployment is a contributing factor. The extended length of UI benefits beyond the regular 26-week limit has a significant poverty-reducing effect on unemployed workers, especially during and after recessions. The antipoverty effects of UI benefits were twice as high in 2009 and 2010 compared to previous recessionary periods. This increase may be due to temporary provisions like ARRA. The temporary provisions of ARRA and the EUC08 program in 1993 and 2003 increased benefit levels and duration, reducing the poverty rate for unemployed individuals receiving UI benefits. The report acknowledges caveats and did not consider behavioral changes or labor market shifts that may have impacted the unemployment and poverty rates. In 2011, UI benefits lifted an estimated 2.3 million people out of poverty, including 620,000 children. The poverty rate for families receiving unemployment benefits was significantly lower than it would have been without these benefits. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program (EUC08) was created in 2008 under the Supplemental Appropriations Act. It provided temporary unemployment insurance benefits until January 2, 2012, and was amended multiple times. In 2011, UI benefits lifted 2.3 million people out of poverty, including 620,000 children. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program (EUC08) started with 20 weeks of benefits and was expanded to provide up to 63 additional weeks in 2012. This was later adjusted to offer up to 53 weeks of benefits from June 2012 onwards. The program was further extended until December 2013, allowing for a potential total of 53 weeks of benefits. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program (EUC08) started in September 2012 and was extended until December 2013, providing up to 47 weeks of additional UI benefits. The analysis in Appendix B examines trends in labor force status and UI receipt based on the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Social and Economic Supplement data. It includes different measures of labor underutilization and definitions of labor utilization beyond just unemployment. The appendix analyzes UI receipt among various labor force statuses, including unemployed, part-time workers, and discouraged workers. CPS/ASEC collects income data, including UI benefits, since 1988. Comparison with administrative benchmarks is provided in Appendix C. Figures show individuals reporting UI receipt and their labor force status in 2011. The analysis focuses on groups of persons who reported UI benefit receipt in 2011, based on the 2012 CPS/ASEC data. These groups include \"Unemployed\" (70.3%), \"Involuntary part-time workers\" (3.9%), and \"Part-year discouraged workers\" (2.6%). The analysis includes \"Discouraged potential workers, outside the labor force\" (2.5%) who did not look for work because they believed no work was available. These groups represent the majority of persons who received UI benefits in 2011, totaling 8.1 million (79.2%). Among persons who reported UI receipt, not all have limited labor force attachment directly associated with economic conditions. Groups include \"Full-time, Full-Year Workers\" (6.1%) and \"Out of the labor force for personal reasons\" (12.6%). Reported UI receipt is somewhat incongruent with their labor force status during the year. The report discusses various groups of individuals who reported unemployment insurance (UI) receipt, including those who were ill, disabled, taking care of family, going to school, or retired. Some anomalies in UI receipt may be due to misreporting or imprecise reporting of labor force attachment. For example, individuals enrolled in school may still be eligible for UI benefits while attending approved training programs. Comparing the Share of Unemployed and Underutilized Workers at Any Time During the Year to Monthly and Annual Average. The annual measures of unemployment and labor underutilization from CPS/ASEC data are compared to monthly unemployment and employment rates published by the BLS. CRS estimates are based on respondents' labor force status over a year, resulting in higher unemployment and underutilization rates compared to BLS monthly data. The CRS CPS/ASEC unemployment rate in 2009 was 13.0%, 3.3 percentage points higher than the BLS annual average monthly rate. The underutilized worker rate was 19.5%, compared to the BLS U-6 alternative unemployment measure of 16.3% for 2009. Figure B-4 shows estimates of persons with limited job attachment due to economic conditions. The labor force includes civilians age 15 and older who held a job or looked for work, as well as discouraged potential workers. In 2011, an estimated 23.8 million were unemployed, 8.2 million were involuntary part-time workers, and 1.7 million worked only part year but did not search for work. Additionally, 1.9 million discouraged potential workers were outside the labor force. In 2011, an estimated 35.6 million persons had limited or no labor force attachment due to economic conditions, compared to 29.4 million in 1993 and 24.2 million in 2003. The share of the labor force experiencing unemployment peaked at 13.0% in 2009, similar to the peak in 1991 and 1992. The 1990-1991 recession saw a 3 percentage point increase in unemployment, while the most recent recession had a different impact. In 2011, over one-sixth of the labor force had limited labor force attachment for economic reasons, with a total unemployment rate of 18.0%. This included unemployed individuals, involuntary part-time workers, part-year discouraged workers, and discouraged potential workers. In 2011, the share of the labor force under the expanded definition of unemployed exceeded the previous high in 1992. 30.2% of unemployed persons received UI benefits, down from 36.1% in 2009. The UI recipiency rate among discouraged potential workers in 2011 was 13.5%, higher than in 1992 and 2003. Among all persons with limited or no labor force attachment for economic reasons, 22.8% received UI benefits in 2011, down from 2009. In 2011, $103.7 billion in unemployment benefits were distributed, with $68.5 billion reported in the CPS/ASEC. Approximately 34% of UI benefits were either not reported or underreported, the highest level in 25 years. The U.S. DOL does not calculate the number of individuals who received benefits annually. Approximately 30% of the unemployed reported receiving unemployment benefits at some point during the year in 2011. The yearly ratio may be lower than the monthly ratio due to UI recipients being likely to remain unemployed longer, leading to underreporting of total UI benefits. The ratio of underreporting UI benefit receipt is lower than underreporting the total value of UI benefits, indicating that those who received lower UI benefit values are more likely to not report. Figure C-1 compares estimates of aggregate UI benefits and number of recipients on the CPS/ASEC to DOL benchmarks from 1987 to 2011, showing CPS/ASEC estimates as a percent of DOL benchmarks based on UI spending and benefits data. The CPS/ASEC does a better job at capturing UI dollars than the number of persons receiving benefits. It captures roughly 59% of persons who receive UI benefits, with the ratio increasing during recessions and decreasing in recovery. The ratio ranges from 49% to 73% over the years examined. The CPS/ASEC captures roughly 59% of persons receiving UI benefits, with the ratio varying from 49% to 73% over the years. Recovery periods show lower ratios, indicating that those receiving small UI benefits or for a short period are less likely to report benefit receipt."
