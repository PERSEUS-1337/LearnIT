    "content": "In the FY2013 budget request, the Obama Administration is seeking $880 million for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in Russia and other former Soviet Union states. This includes $519.1 million for DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, $291.4 million for nonproliferation programs, and $70 million for State Department programs. This total does not include funds for nonproliferation programs like GTRI, Megaports, and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund. The United States allocates significant funding for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in Russia and other former Soviet Union states. These programs aim to transport, store, and eliminate weapons, secure materials used in weapons, and prevent proliferation of knowledge. Since FY1992, over $13 billion has been appropriated for these efforts across various agencies. President George W. Bush supported these programs, and the Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request includes $880 million for these initiatives. At the U.S.-Russian summit in May 2002, the United States and Russia pledged to continue cooperative threat reduction programs and expand efforts to reduce weapons-usable fissile material. The G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction was created in June 2002, with the United States committing up to $10 billion over 10 years for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in Russia and other former Soviet states. President Obama has also pledged to accelerate these goals and lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons. President Obama has pledged to accelerate efforts to secure all nuclear weapons materials at vulnerable sites within four years. He appointed a White House Coordinator for Nuclear Security to coordinate U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Additionally, Obama and Russia's President Medvedev signed a Joint Statement on nuclear cooperation in July 2009, confirming their commitment to preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. They highlighted their commitment to pursuing various threat reduction and nonproliferation programs to secure nuclear materials globally. In the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense plans to expand capabilities to counter weapons of mass destruction and support threat reduction efforts. Congress has supported U.S. nonproliferation programs in former Soviet states, authorizing funds and shaping programs. Analysts question if the U.S. has done enough to prevent leakage of knowledge, weapons, and materials from these states. The Bush Administration's budget cuts in early 2001 reduced funding for DOD threat reduction and DOE's defense nuclear nonproliferation programs. Despite some increases in funding in later years, there were still decreases in FY2005 and FY2007 for DOD threat reduction programs. Analysts argue that the funding falls short of addressing proliferation risks from former Soviet states. Funding has shifted towards border security and assistance to more nations globally, away from securing weapons and materials in former Soviet states. Some analysts support this shift in focus. The shift in focus towards global nonproliferation efforts is supported by some analysts, but concerns arise about the potential undermining of U.S. programs with former Soviet states if funding does not increase. Congressional actions on budgets for FY2008 and FY2009 increased funding for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. The FY2011 budget faced challenges due to a lack of appropriations bills, leading to funding through a continuing resolution. Funding levels varied for different programs, with some receiving more than requested while others received less. The FY2011 budget for U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance faced challenges with funding levels lower than requested. Congress debated on funding levels, with some seeking to fund at FY2008 levels, which could have undermined efforts to secure nuclear materials. Despite lower funding than requested, ongoing efforts will be sustained. Studies have offered recommendations for program size and operation different from past approaches. The report reviews the history of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs, focusing on funding for programs in the former Soviet Union. While the U.S. has expanded efforts globally, most funds still support projects in the former Soviet states. Recent shifts in funding and focus provide only a partial view of U.S. programs in this area. In November 1991, Congress initiated U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the Soviet Union due to concerns about the safety of Soviet nuclear weapons. Senators Nunn and Lugar proposed an amendment to the CFE Treaty legislation, authorizing $400 million in FY1992 DOD funds for assisting the Soviet Union in destroying and safeguarding nuclear weapons. Senators Nunn, Lugar, and Biden supported a program to address the risks of Soviet nuclear weapons after the collapse of the Soviet Union, emphasizing the need for safeguards against proliferation and potential dangers like theft or misuse of weapons. They warned that weakening control over these weapons could lead to global nuclear proliferation. Senator Nunn and other senators supported legislation to address the risks of nuclear proliferation worldwide, emphasizing the importance of dismantling Soviet nuclear and chemical weapons to enhance national security. Senator Biden stated that the assistance provided through the legislation would benefit the United States, not the Soviet Union. However, some questioned the characterization of the assistance as foreign aid. Some members of Congress opposed providing assistance to the Soviet Union, arguing that it would divert resources towards developing new weapons that could threaten the United States. They debated whether the assistance was foreign aid or a security program benefiting both countries. Initially, the DOD budget funded U.S. threat reduction assistance to the former Soviet states. Initially, Congress used the DOD budget to fund U.S. threat reduction assistance to the former Soviet States, which later became known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program. Other agencies like the State Department and Department of Energy also participated in projects requiring their expertise. In FY1997, these agencies took over budgetary and management responsibilities for projects within their expertise. The term \"CTR\" now specifically refers to DOD-funded threat reduction programs, while \"threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance\" encompasses programs in DOD, DOE, and State. The implementation of the CTR program involved coordination among various U.S. government agencies and negotiations with recipient nations before providing aid. The program was more complex and slower than initially envisioned. The Clinton Administration worked to resolve bureaucratic issues delaying the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program in the former Soviet states. They provided policy and financial support, increasing expenditures on CTR. The high level commission chaired by Vice President Gore and Russia's Prime Minister Chernomyrdin identified efforts later funded through the CTR program. The Clinton Administration successfully increased expenditures on CTR projects by the mid-1990s, expanding U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance across multiple agencies. Efforts evolved to include a wide range of programs aimed at securing and destroying nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, with funding growing from $400 million to nearly $1 billion annually. By the mid-1990s, U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance under Nunn-Lugar expanded to nearly $1 billion annually across multiple agencies. Concerns about nuclear materials from Russia appearing on the black market led to the view of CTR as a long-term effort to eliminate Soviet weapons and prevent new threats. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry described CTR as \"defense by other means.\" In the mid-1990s, U.S. assistance to former Soviet states aimed to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Concerns were raised about the security of Russian nuclear and chemical facilities, prompting Congress to expand security programs. A task force in 2001 highlighted the urgent threat of weapons of mass destruction or materials being stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nations. Since 2001, analysts have emphasized the risk of weapons-usable materials in Russia being stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile states. The Bush Administration expanded threat reduction assistance to prevent weapons of mass destruction from reaching terrorists, increasing funding for export control programs and knowledge leakage prevention. The Bush Administration expanded threat reduction assistance to prevent weapons of mass destruction from reaching terrorists, focusing on programs to secure Soviet-era nuclear weapons and recover radiological sources for dirty bombs. The Obama Administration also emphasized the importance of these programs in containing proliferation and reducing the threat of WMD terrorism. The CTR program is transitioning from a nuclear-centric focus on the former Soviet Union to countering WMD threats globally. The Obama Administration has increased funding for securing materials worldwide and emphasizes cooperation with other nations to contain dangerous weapons. The CTR program initially focused on assisting Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan with nuclear weapons dismantlement and secure transportation. Over time, it expanded to include securing materials for nuclear and chemical weapons, preventing scientific expertise diversion, and demilitarizing defense industries. Congress later allowed funds for environmental restoration at military sites and housing for former personnel. The 104th Congress reversed the initial focus of the CTR program, banning the use of funds for environmental restoration and housing for military officers. The program's mandate was then outlined to focus on securing and dismantling nuclear and chemical weapons, and preventing proliferation of knowledge and materials for weapons production. The CTR program focuses on destroying weapons of mass destruction, establishing safeguards against proliferation, and preventing the diversion of scientific expertise. Congress expanded the program to include biological weapons prevention and emergency assistance for removing weapons and materials globally. The Bush Administration reduced CTR funding in FY2002. The Bush Administration reduced CTR funding by nearly 10% to $403 million and initiated a review of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia and former Soviet states. The review aimed to ensure programs are focused on priority goals and conducted efficiently. Analysts had mixed reactions, with some seeing potential for program expansion and others fearing funding cuts. The Administration stated that most programs were effective but signaled a shift in focus for U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance. The Bush Administration reduced CTR funding by nearly 10% to $403 million and initiated a review of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia and former Soviet states. The review signaled a shift in focus towards chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation, including increased funding for a controversial chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia. This change was seen as a response to post-September 11 concerns about terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The Bush Administration increased funding for biological weapons proliferation prevention and requested $200.3 million for the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia in FY2003. Funding for strategic offensive arms elimination in Russia decreased, and the CTR program objectives were revised to focus on dismantling WMDs and securing related technology and materials. The Bush Administration increased funding for biological weapons proliferation prevention and requested $200.3 million for a chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia in FY2003. The CTR program objectives were revised to focus on dismantling WMDs and securing related technology and materials, with an emphasis on increasing transparency and encouraging higher standards of conduct. The FY2010 Annual Report on the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program highlighted ongoing projects consistent with these objectives, but noted the absence of specific reference to the destruction of nuclear weapons. The FY2010 Annual Report on the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program outlines objectives that focus on preventing rogue states and terrorists from accessing weapons of mass destruction and related materials. Activities include dismantling weapons delivery systems, enhancing security of WMD during transportation, storing dangerous pathogens securely, developing early warning systems for bioterror attacks, preventing proliferation of WMD, and fostering defense and military partnerships. The Nunn-Lugar Amendment authorized the transfer of funds for threat reduction activities in the former Soviet Union. Congress has approved nearly $9 billion for the Cooperative Threat Reduction program since 1992, with funding requests and authorizations detailed in Table 1. In FY1996, the House reduced CTR funding to $200 million, but the Senate and conference committee settled on $300 million. In FY1997, the House approved $302.9 million, Senate added $37 million, and the conference committee agreed on $302.9 million. In FY2001, the House reduced funding to $433 million, but the Senate and conference committee settled on $443 million amidst a dispute over funding for a chemical weapons destruction facility in Russia. In FY2001, there was a dispute over funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye in Russia. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for this program, with the House eliminating funding for construction and the Senate accepting a small reduction in total funding for threat reduction. Total U.S. spending on threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia increased despite fluctuations in CTR funding. In FY2001, funding for the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye in Russia was disputed, with the House eliminating construction funding and the Senate accepting a small reduction in total threat reduction funding. Despite fluctuations in CTR funding, total U.S. spending on threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to Russia increased. Funding for DOE and State Department programs grew, while the Bush Administration's request for CTR funding declined in FY2007 and FY2008, mainly due to reductions in funding for the Shchuch'ye facility and weapons elimination programs. In FY2008, there were declines in funding for weapons elimination programs, which the Administration did not propose to offset with increases in funding for new projects. Congress added funding for CTR programs, with the House allocating $50 million for the plant at Shchuch'ye and $7 million for potential new initiatives. The Senate added $80 million to the CTR budget, with funds going towards biological weapons proliferation prevention and strategic offensive arms elimination in Russia. The conference committee accepted the Senate's funding level, authorizing $428 million for CTR, with a focus on biological weapons proliferation prevention. The legislation authorizes $10 million for new CTR initiatives outside the former Soviet Union, with an additional $10 million allocated for new initiatives. The House and Senate authorized $434.1 million and $445.1 million respectively for CTR programs, with a focus on biological weapons proliferation prevention. The conference committee accepted the Senate's funding level and added $10 million for new initiatives. The Obama Administration requested $404.1 million for DOD's CTR program in FY2010, with Congress authorizing $424.1 million. For FY2011, the Administration requested $522.5 million, primarily allocated to biosecurity programs and the Global Security Lockdown initiative. The Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has evolved over the years, with funding approved by Congress in various Defense Authorization Acts. The program was initially divided into three project areas but has since been restructured by the Obama Administration in FY2012. The FY2013 budget request for the CTR program is $519.1 million. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has been restructured by the Obama Administration, creating new categories for project areas. One of these categories is \"Global Nuclear Security,\" which focuses on enhancing safety, security, and control over nuclear weapons and materials. These chain of custody activities were developed in response to concerns about the transit and storage of nuclear weapons and materials. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, thousands of nuclear weapons were distributed among Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were spread among four states (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan). Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin committed to removing non-strategic nuclear weapons and storing them in Russia. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan pledged to return all warheads to Russia. The United States has appropriated funds for transportation security projects to assist in the secure transport of warheads. The United States has provided assistance for the secure transport of 1,000-1,500 warheads per year, including armored blankets, storage containers, and support for rail car safety. Funding in FY2005 supported specialized warhead transportation railcars, with 45 train shipments in 2004 and 24 in 2005. Increased transparency requirements led to a pause in shipments between November 2004 and May 2005. The United States has provided assistance for the secure transport of warheads, including new heated rail cars to replace aging ones. Funding was allocated for transportation security, with a reduction in the number of shipments per year. Additional funding was authorized for transportation security in subsequent years. In FY2010, Congress authorized $46.4 million for transportation security, with $45 million requested for FY2011. The funding supports transporting deactivated nuclear warheads. In FY2011, Congress authorized $45 million for the program. The Obama Administration did not request additional funding in FY2012, incorporating it into the Global Nuclear Security program. CTR projects have enhanced Russia's security at storage facilities for nuclear warheads. Russia has operational sites, storage sites, and rail transfer points for warheads. The U.S. assists with security at rail transfer points storing warheads from the Russian Navy. The CTR program enhances security at storage sites for nuclear warheads in Russia, including large national stockpile storage sites and smaller sites at military bases. The program provides perimeter fencing, alarm systems, and inventory control equipment. However, Russia's reluctance to share information and allow access to sites has slowed down the security upgrades. The United States has faced challenges in installing security upgrades at weapons storage locations in Russia due to limited access granted by Russia's Ministry of Defense. However, agreements in 2003 have allowed for increased access, leading to significant funding increases for security enhancements at storage sites. Plans are in place to enhance security at up to 42 sites in Russia. The United States has allocated significant funding for security upgrades at weapons storage sites in Russia, with completion of installations by 2008. A Security Assessment and Training Center has been established for personnel to test security systems. Additionally, training programs for personnel with access to nuclear weapons are being developed. Total appropriations for weapons storage security between FY1995 and FY2010 amounted to $831.8 million, with additional funding requests in subsequent years. The United States allocated significant funding for security upgrades at weapons storage sites in Russia, totaling $84.1 million in FY2006 and an additional $87.1 million in FY2007. Congress approved added funding for warhead security, with increases reflecting commitments made by Presidents Bush and Putin in 2005. Assistance was provided at 15 sites, with funding from the CTR program and DOE nonproliferation budget. Funding shifted towards sustainment after upgrades were completed. The funding for weapons storage security in the United States has shifted towards sustainment activities after completing upgrades. The FY2009 request decreased to $24.1 million, with Congress approving it. In FY2010, $15.1 million was requested, but the appropriation increased to $22.1 million. The FY2011 budget includes a $9.6 million request for sustainment efforts at secure storage sites, which was authorized by Congress. Funding for weapons storage security activities in the Global Nuclear Security program area was requested in FY2012. The United States provided funding for projects related to storage of fissile materials in Russia, including providing containers and assisting in building a secure storage facility at Mayak. Russia inherited a large number of nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union and has begun dismantling them, with several projects aimed at improving the security of the removed fissile materials. The Mayak facility in Russia, funded by the United States, provides secure storage for nuclear materials from dismantled warheads. The facility, equivalent to material from 25,000 warheads, began accepting materials in 2006. A transparency agreement between the US and Russia is still pending. Destruction and dismantlement projects aid in eliminating nuclear weapons. The CTR program, funded by the United States, has helped Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan remove warheads, deactivate missiles, and eliminate launch facilities for nuclear weapons covered by the START treaty. Over 7,500 warheads, 768 ICBMs, 651 SLBMs, and 155 heavy bombers have been deactivated with CTR assistance. The program incentivized Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to relinquish nuclear weapons in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The United States has provided assistance to Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in eliminating strategic nuclear weapons. This effort is complete in Belarus and Kazakhstan, ongoing in Russia and Ukraine. Over 1,400 ballistic missiles and 7,500 warheads have been eliminated. Storage facilities have been constructed for missiles and fuel. Collaboration with Ukraine includes eliminating rocket motors from SS-24 ICBMs. The United States, Russia, and Ukraine are collaborating to eliminate rocket motors from SS-24 ICBMs. Funding for the project has fluctuated over the years, with the US supporting safe storage of rocket motors and purchasing casings from Ukraine. Ukraine is independently financing a water washout facility for this purpose. The Bush and Obama administrations have allocated millions of dollars for this effort in various fiscal years. The United States is providing funding to support the storage of SS-24 rocket motors in Russia while an elimination facility is being constructed. The US is also assisting in the elimination and dismantling of various types of ICBMs in Russia. Funding for this project has seen fluctuations over the years, with reprogramming of funds by the Administration reducing the allocated amount. The Bush Administration allocated funds for weapons storage security and strategic arms elimination programs in Ukraine and Russia. Congress approved $78.9 million for FY2007 and $77.9 million for FY2008. The Senate increased funding for arms elimination in Russia to $102.9 million, with $25 million designated for accelerating activities at storage sites. The conference committee allocated $92.885 million for this project area. The Obama Administration requested and Congress authorized funding for Strategic Offensive Arms Elimination in Russia, totaling $92.885 million for FY2009. Additional funding requests were made for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, supporting the elimination of various ICBMs and submarines in Russia and Ukraine. The Obama Administration requested funding for Strategic Offensive Arms Elimination in Russia, including the elimination of SS-18 and SS-19 ICBM silo launchers, SS-25 ICBMs, SS-N-18 SLBMs, and a Delta-IV submarine. A plant was built to dispose of liquid fuel from Soviet ICBMs, but Russia used much of the fuel for its space-launch program, leading to concerns about waste in the CTR program. The United States has spent over $4 billion on threat reduction projects, including assisting Ukraine and Kazakhstan in eliminating nuclear weapons facilities. DOD appropriated $38.2 million for Ukraine and $44.5 million for Kazakhstan between FY1994 and FY2003. No additional funds have been requested in subsequent years. Russia declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, stored at seven sites. The United States questioned the accuracy of this declaration, leading to Russia's loss of certification for CTR programs in FY2002. Russia has committed to destroying these stocks by 2007 (with a requested extension until 2012) but lacks financial resources. Germany leads a European consortium in constructing a destruction facility at Gorny for blister agents. The United States is assisting Russia in designing and building a facility. The United States is assisting Russia in constructing a facility at Shchuch'ye to destroy Russia's nerve agent stockpile, which is estimated to be around 5,450 metric tons. Construction began in March 2003, with operations starting in March 2009. The facility was officially dedicated in late May 2009, and as of September 2011, Russia had eliminated a significant portion of the stockpile. In FY1999, the House attempted to reduce CTR funding for Shchuch'ye by $53.4 million, citing Russia's chemical weapons as more of an environmental concern than a security threat. Funding for the project faced debates and restrictions in subsequent years, with Congress eventually resuming funding in FY2002. The United States limited funding for the Shchuch'ye project to $50 million in a conference report, with the possibility of using the remaining $83.6 million for other projects related to nuclear weapons storage and elimination. The Bush Administration requested $200 million for the project in FY2004, but the House reduced the funding to $171.5 million and mandated that funds in excess of $71 million could only be released if Russia and other nations contributed to the project. The U.S. limited funding for the Shchuch'ye project to $50 million in a conference report, rejecting the House's concerns about financial commitments from other nations. By December 2003, six countries had contributed $69 million to the project. The Bush Administration requested $158.4 million for Shchuch'ye in FY2005, representing a significant reduction in funding from FY2004. The FY2004 budget included funding for a one-time investment in capital-intensive construction equipment, leading to a reduced request for FY2005. Additional funding was requested and received for FY2006, with a further reduction in FY2007. The lack of funding for the Shchuch'ye plant in FY2008 raised concerns, prompting the House Armed Services Committee to add nearly $43 million to the budget. The House Armed Services Committee added $6 million to the budget for the Shchcuch'ye project in FY2008 due to rising construction costs in Russia. Congress also allocated $1 million in FY2009, $3 million in FY2010, and an additional $3 million in FY2011. Analysts believe more funding may be needed in the future. The Obama Administration requested $9.8 million for the Shchuch'ye project in FY2012, with an additional $14.6 million requested for FY2013. Funding will support technical support to Russia for the Kizner CWDF destruction facility. Congress has imposed certifications on funding, including Russia's commitment to provide $25 million annually, destroy all remaining nerve agent, and share data on its chemical weapons stockpile. The President requested Congress to allow him to waive the certification requirements. The President requested Congress to waive certification requirements for construction to continue on the weapons stockpile, despite Russia not meeting all conditions. Congress granted waiver authority for one year in FY2003, extended to FY2004 and through 2011. The Soviet Union had the world's largest biological weapons program. Russia had the world's largest biological weapons program, with over 50 sites and 60,000 employees. Despite deteriorating security systems, Russia continued research in the 1990s. The US provided assistance through the CTR program to improve safety and security at Russian biological weapons sites. The United States is assisting Russia in eliminating infrastructure and equipment at Biological Research and Production Centers capable of producing biological weapons. Programs include enhancing safety and security, developing surveillance networks, securing storage facilities, and promoting cooperative biodefense research to prevent the spread of Russian biological weapons knowledge. These efforts are implemented through the International Science and Technology Centers. The Biological Threat Reduction program, implemented through the International Science and Technology Centers, supports activities in former Soviet states like Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. CTR funding helped destroy a biological weapons production facility in Stepnogorsk, Kazakhstan. Progress in gaining Russia's cooperation for nonproliferation projects has been slow, with difficulty accessing key military facilities. Russia's reduction in complex size complicates the situation. The reduction in Russia's complex size is exacerbating the situation, potentially leaving scientists unemployed. Biological pathogens pose a high proliferation risk due to their small size and easy transport. The DOD allocated $1.1 billion between FY1997 and FY2011 for these projects, with significant increases in recent years. The Bush Administration requested $54.2 million in FY2004, with Congress approving the amount but imposing restrictions on funding. The House aimed to prohibit cooperative research in the Soviet Union until certain conditions were met. The conference committee modified the measure for CTR funding, requiring the Secretary of Defense to ensure no prohibited research at facilities and implement security measures. The Bush Administration shifted funding towards bio-security and bio-safety efforts, reducing Cooperative Biodefense Research projects. The Bush Administration shifted funding from Cooperative Biodefense Research projects to bio-security and bio-safety efforts, reflecting congressional concerns about Russian biological weapons programs. Additional funding was approved for BW proliferation prevention in FY2006 and FY2007, with a study mandated by the 109th Congress to analyze cooperation opportunities between Russia and the United States on biological weapons proliferation prevention. The Bush Administration requested $144.5 million for Biological Weapons Threat Reduction programs in FY2008, with funding split between Biosecurity, Biosafety, and Threat Agent Detection and Response ($125.75 million) and Cooperative Biological Research ($18.75 million). Senator Richard Lugar sought to add $100 million for the CTR program in FY2008, with the Senate eventually adding $50 million to support programs in the former Soviet Union and accelerate high-priority efforts. The committee authorized $158.5 million for programs in the former Soviet Union to prevent biological weapons proliferation. The funding was split between Biosecurity, Biosafety, and Threat Agent Detection and Response, as well as Cooperative Biological Research. The Obama Administration requested $152 million for Biological Threat Reduction in FY2010. In FY2010, the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Threat Agent Detection and Response program would receive $133.3 million, a decrease from its previous funding of $174.3 million. Cooperative Biological Research projects would receive $26.5 million, an increase from $18.8 million in FY2009. Congress authorized the requested amount, while House Armed Services called for continued efforts to strengthen biological threat reduction programs and interagency coordination. The HASC also emphasized the importance of maintaining focus on preventing the proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons in addition to biological weapons. The Obama Administration requested funding for Biological Threat reduction, with allocations for Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Threat Agent Detection and Response, as well as Cooperative Biological Research. Congress approved the funding requests for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. The project area is now referred to as Cooperative Biological Engagement, with plans to extend efforts to nations in Africa. Demilitarization programs aimed to encourage former Soviet states to reduce their weapons capabilities. The International Science and Technology Center funded projects in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to convert military efforts to peaceful purposes. Demilitarization funds supported Defense and Military contacts between the US and former Soviet republics to promote counter-proliferation, demilitarization, and democratic reforms. DOD allocated over $100 million for Defense and Military contacts, with additional funding approved for FY2004 and FY2005. In FY2003, the Bush Administration added a new demilitarization program. The United States cooperated with military establishments in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan to improve border controls. Moldova joined the effort in FY2006 with funding to develop its border control systems. DOD is assisting Ukraine in establishing a WMD monitoring capability along its border with Moldova. CTR completed the radiation portal monitoring program. The CTR program completed radiation portal monitoring in Uzbekistan in 2008 and is assisting Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in developing WMD surveillance capabilities along their Caspian Sea borders. Funding for the program fluctuated over the years, with Congress appropriating $40 million in FY2003 and additional amounts in subsequent years. The program received $48 million in total from the conference committee. The conference committee approved nearly $48 million for WMD proliferation prevention programs in the former Soviet Union. Congress added $9 million for a total of $59 million in FY2009. In FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $29.1 million, and Congress authorized this amount. For FY2011, the budget request included $26.1 million, which Congress approved in the Defense Authorization Act. In FY2012, Congress approved $28.1 million, and an additional $32.4 million was requested for FY2013. The FY2010 budget also includes $17 million for new CTR initiatives. The budget for DOD's CTR program includes $17 million for new initiatives. Congress added $10 million in FY2009 for emerging proliferation concerns. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed the CTR program. DOD expanded contacts with nations outside the former Soviet Union. The FY2011 budget added a new program area for Global Nuclear Lockdown with a $74.5 million request. The budget request for the DOD's CTR program in FY2011 included funding for securing \"weapons-usable\" materials in Russia and establishing \"centers of excellence\" outside the former Soviet Union. These centers were allocated $30 million and aimed to expand CTR support globally. Congress authorized funding for this program area in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act, which was not funded in FY2010. This project area was later merged into the Global Nuclear Security project area in FY2012 under the Obama Administration's budget request. The Administration requested $121.1 million for weapons storage security in FY2012, compared to $118.6 million in FY2010 and $164.3 million in FY2011. Congress approved this amount, and $99.8 million was requested for FY2013. The State Department plays a key role in U.S. nonproliferation efforts, negotiating agreements and coordinating policies. They manage the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund to assist nations with proliferation-prone weapons. The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) received varying amounts of funding from Congress between 1993 and 2013, with the Bush Administration requesting increases over the years. The fund aimed to help countries establish better control mechanisms for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) aims to help countries establish better accounting and control mechanisms for nuclear, chemical, and biological materials. Funding from this program has been used to eliminate WMD infrastructure in Libya and Iraq, redirect weapons scientists, and manage international science and technology centers in Moscow and Kiev. The State Department manages the Nonproliferation of WMD expertise program and the Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance Program. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, concerns arose about scientists selling nuclear weapons knowledge. The International Science and Technology Center was established in Moscow in 1992 to address this issue. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in Moscow in 1992 to address concerns about scientists selling nuclear weapons knowledge. By early 2010, 39 countries were participating in the centers, with funding totaling $836.5 million supporting the work of over 70,000 scientists. However, reports indicate that support for the center was waning, and funding has declined in recent years, raising uncertainty about its future. The future of the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) in Moscow is uncertain as Russia announced its withdrawal in 2010. The center funds scientists working on nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, with a focus on nuclear scientists. About half of the participants are senior scientists, reaching a significant portion of the Soviet nuclear complex. Scientists spend less than 50 days per year on center-funded projects. The Science Centers fund research projects and support former Soviet scientists through a Partners Program, which has grown significantly over the years. Some grants go to research institutes in Russia, and income from research projects may deter scientists from selling their knowledge to potential proliferant nations. The Partner Program of the Science Centers has grown significantly since 2002, with over 430 partners providing $9.5 million to support 34 projects in FY2009. The ISTC in Moscow has received over $803 million in funding from participating nations, with the United States contributing about $220 million. The United States also supports the Biological Weapons Redirection Program through the ISTC, redirecting scientists to commercial, agricultural, and public health projects. Funding has shifted from nuclear scientists to biological and chemical weapons scientists, including those from other former Soviet states. The ISTC is facing a decline in funding, leading to a focus on graduating scientists to projects with commercial viability. The Bio Industry Initiative aims to help Russia repurpose former BW facilities for peaceful research. The Global Threat Reduction program has expanded to engage scientists in Iraq and Libya. The Bush Administration requested $59 million for science centers and BW redirection programs in FY2004, receiving $50.2 million. In FY2005, $50.5 million was requested, with $30.5 million allocated to the science centers. In FY2005, the Bush Administration requested $50.5 million for the ISTC, with $30.5 million for science centers, $17 million for the Bio-Chem Redirect program, and $3 million for the BII. Congress approved $52.6 million for FY2006. Funding for programs in the former Soviet Union is decreasing as efforts expand to Libya and Iraq. In FY2007, $52.7 million was requested, with $22.7 million for Science Centers, $17 million for Bio-Chem Redirect, and $13 million for BII. $2.5 million was requested for scientist redirection in Iraq and $1 million in Libya for FY2008. The Obama Administration requested $68 million for the Global Threat Reduction Program in FY2010, with budgets of $69 million in FY2011 and FY2012. Analysts have questioned the effectiveness of science center programs, with concerns raised by the General Accounting Office in 1995 about scientists involved in weapons work. Critics of the CTR program suggest that supporting Russian weapons scientists may indirectly support Russian weapons programs. The State Department requested $64 million for FY2013. The State Department disputed conclusions that U.S. funds supported Russian weapons programs through grants from the ISTC, stating the grants were meant to supplement scientists' income. The State Department has improved auditing procedures to ensure grants support assigned projects and not Russian weapons work. Analysts question the effectiveness of ISTC and STCU due to insufficient funding to fully support scientists, raising concerns about achieving the objective of keeping scientists away from weapons programs. However, cooperation with Russian institutes and steady funding help build relationships. The State Department's Partners Program aims to redirect Russia's nuclear scientists towards more commercially viable projects instead of weapons work. Concerns about smuggling and illegal exports of materials and technology from the former Soviet Union persist due to the collapse of political control along the borders and economic weaknesses in newly independent states. The State Department's EXBS program assists former Soviet states in export control and border security. The EXBS program assists nations in improving their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. It helps establish legal basis, licensing procedures, enforcement capabilities, and provides detection equipment and training. The United States provides assistance to nations to improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. This includes establishing legal basis, licensing procedures, enforcement capabilities, and providing detection equipment and training. The State Department also supports border control efforts in various programs to coordinate and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction. The National Security Council is leading an effort to develop a strategic plan for interdiction assistance to prevent smuggling. Between FY1998 and FY2002, the State Department allocated $146 million to the EXBS program for nations in and around the former Soviet Union, with approximately $100 million going to Georgia for its border security program. Funding for border security in other former Soviet states was around $5-$7 million per year, until an additional $24.7 million was added in FY2002. Funding requests for the EXBS program declined in subsequent years, with the Bush Administration requesting $13.9 million in FY2004 and $38 million in FY2005, with only around $19 million allocated to projects in nations in and around the former Soviet Union. In FY2006 and FY2007, the EXBS program budget was $43.4 million, with $8.5 million going to former Soviet Union nations and $19 million to other regions like South Asia. The Bush Administration requested $45.050 million for FY2007, with less than $6 million going to former Soviet Union states. For FY2008, the total request was $41.3 million, with only around $4.5 million allocated. The EXBS program budget for FY2008 to FY2013 ranged from $41.3 million to $61 million, with only a fraction allocated to former Soviet Union nations. The Department of Energy also contributed to threat reduction in these states. The DOE, along with DOD, worked on projects with Russian officials to secure nuclear materials. Delays were caused by Russia's nuclear energy ministry being less cooperative. Projects at nuclear facilities began in 1994. U.S. nuclear laboratories also collaborated with Russian counterparts to address safety and security issues. This led to the MPC&A program, starting with less than $3 million in FY1993. The MPC&A program, starting with less than $3 million in FY1993, grew to $73 million in FY1995. In FY1996, DOE took over budgetary and management responsibility. Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention aimed to provide employment for Russian nuclear scientists. DOE expanded efforts in the 1990s, managing programs through NNSA to secure nuclear materials and upgrade security at nuclear sites. The MPC&A program grew rapidly in funding during the 1990s, reaching $169 million in FY2001. However, the Bush Administration reduced funding to $138.8 million in FY2002, shifting money from Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs to U.S. nuclear weapons programs. Congress objected to this reduction. The Bush Administration reduced funding for the MPC&A program in FY2002, but Congress objected and restored funding to the FY2001 level. After the September 11 attacks, Congress added $150 million for security measures in Russia. The Bush Administration increased its budget request for MPC&A in FY2003 to accelerate upgrades and material consolidation efforts. Congress approved $260 million for FY2004, including $5 million for \"high priority\" projects. In FY2004, Congress approved $260 million for the MPC&A program, with additional funding for \"high priority\" activities and an initiative under the Second Line of Defense Program. The Bush Administration requested $238 million for FY2005, reflecting completion of security upgrades at Russian Navy warhead storage sites. Congress authorized the full amount requested by the President in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill, adding $84 million for a total of $322 million in the MPC&A program. The report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 notes that added funding should be used to secure nuclear weapons sites and materials production sites in Russia. The Bush Administration requested $343.4 million for these programs in FY2006, with $100 million allocated to the Second Line of Defense and Megaports Initiative. Approximately $245 million was left to secure nuclear materials in Russia. Congress added $20 million in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act to accelerate warhead security work. The Energy and Water Appropriations Committee added $83.6 million to pursue new opportunities in warhead security work with Russia in the DOE budget. In the FY2007 budget, the Bush Administration requested $413.2 million for MPC&A. In FY2007, the Bush Administration requested $413.2 million for MPC&A, with $124 million allocated for Second Line of Defense and Megaports. This left $298.7 million to secure nuclear materials in Russia. Congress appropriated $472.7 million for this program area, shifting money among budget areas. The FY2008 budget request sought $371.7 million for MPC&A. The FY2008 budget request sought $371.7 million for the MPC&A program areas, with $119.3 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and Megaports initiatives. This leaves $251.8 million for securing nuclear warheads and materials in Russia. Congress increased funding for MPC&A programs in the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act and the FY2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The House version of the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill included $401 million for MPC&A, with the Senate adding $10 million and the conference committee adding $30 million, mainly for the Second Line of Defense program. The House Energy and Water Development Subcommittee provided $831.8 million for MPC&A, noting its importance in protecting against nuclear terrorism. Funding was also added to accelerate work at Russia's nuclear facilities and expand the Second Line of Defense program. The Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY2008 allocated $624 million for MPC&A, with $136 million for Second Line of Defense and $130.8 million for Megaports. The President's FY2009 budget requested $429 million for MPC&A, with Congress adding $22 million. The Obama Administration requested $552.3 million for FY2010, a significant increase over previous years. In FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $552.3 million for the project area, including $194 million for the Megaports program. Congress approved $592 million for these programs but appropriated only $572 million. In FY2011, $590 million was requested, with $265 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and Megaports. However, funding remained at FY2010 levels, with $572.1 million appropriated. For FY2012, $571.6 million was requested, with $132.7 million allocated to the Megaports initiative. In FY2012, $569.9 million was allocated for securing warheads and materials in Russia, with $132.7 million for the Megaports initiative. The Obama Administration requested $311 million for this program area in FY2013. Congress has appropriated nearly $5 billion for efforts to improve security at nuclear sites in Russia, with reductions in Second Line of Defense and Megaports as projects near completion. NNSA has identified 105 nuclear sites that may need assistance in improving their security systems. According to NNSA, Russian sites hold 600 metric tons of nuclear materials for 41,000 warheads. Ministry of Defense owns 63 sites, Minatom has 11, and 31 are civilian. DOE assists with MPC&A in two phases: rapid upgrades for unauthorized access delay, and comprehensive upgrades tailored to each facility's security needs. The Department of Energy (DOE) has improved security at sites in the former Soviet Union housing over half of their nuclear materials. By 2006, upgrades were completed at 81% of facilities, focusing on facility upgrades rather than material capture. By 2007, upgrades were completed at nearly 90% of buildings. Funding has also supported security upgrades at nuclear facilities outside the former Soviet Union. The DOE has provided assistance to Russia's navy by improving security at naval nuclear warhead and fuel storage sites. Upgrades were completed at all naval nuclear fuel storage sites by the end of 2004 and at the last two warhead sites in FY2006. The program aims to create regulations, reporting requirements, training, and maintenance facilities to ensure the effectiveness of the security upgrades in the long term. The FY2006 budget included $6.5 million for upgrades at the last two warhead sites, with Congress approving $16 million for navy complex sites. Additional funding was requested and approved for FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009 to provide sustainability support, including training and maintenance. The upgrades for security equipment at warhead storage sites were completed by the end of 2008. Funding requests and appropriations for Navy Complex programs were as follows: $33.9 million in FY2010, $33.8 million in FY2010, $34.3 million in FY2011, $33.7 million in FY2012, and $39.9 million in FY2013. Upgrades were also completed at 25 sites on 11 SRF bases ahead of schedule in 2007. The 12th Main Directorate of Russia's Ministry of Defense completed security upgrades at nine sites in FY2009. Funding for the project area increased from $47.5 million in FY2006 to $121.9 million in FY2008, with a request for $53.6 million in FY2009. The funding for security upgrades at the 12th Main Directorate of Russia's Ministry of Defense increased from $47.5 million in FY2006 to $121.9 million in FY2008. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $34.4 million, reflecting completion of most upgrade work and a shift to sustainment activities. The FY2010 budget requested $48.6 million, which was approved, and in FY2011, the budget request increased to $51.4 million. Congress authorized this, but the appropriation remained at the FY2010 level of $48.6 million. In FY2012, Congress approved $59.1 million for sustainability and training programs at various sites. The Administration requested $8.3 million for these projects in FY2013. The Administration has requested $8.3 million for projects in FY2013, which will support training and maintenance centers and replace outdated security equipment at up to 11 sites in Russia's nuclear weapons complex managed by Rosatom. DOE has completed upgrades on buildings housing a significant amount of weapons-useable materials in the complex. The Department of Energy (DOE) has accelerated work at facilities in Russia with increased funding and cooperation. Security upgrades are planned to be installed by 2008. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham worked with Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy to accelerate programs and clear bureaucratic obstacles. The FY2006 budget requested $86 million for this program area, with Congress approving the request. The FY2007 budget requested $56.5 million, reflecting the completion of many projects. The DOE accelerated work at facilities in Russia with increased funding and cooperation. The FY2007 budget requested $56.5 million for the program area, reflecting the completion of many projects. The House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee increased the request by $65 million, but the final appropriation was $85 million. Congress appropriated $56.1 million in FY2009, and $71.5 million in FY2010. In FY2009, DOE planned to continue work at sites in Russia, including Mayak, Arzamas-16, and Chelyabinsk-70. Additional funding in FY2010 would go towards upgrades at newly added facilities and replacing equipment at upgraded sites. The NNSA budget request for FY2011 included $105.3 million for the Rosatom complex, supporting upgrades at sites added after the 2004 Bratislava agreement. Funding would also support projects in other former Soviet states. Congress approved $80.7 million for this effort. The Obama Administration requested $80.7 million for the Rosatom complex in FY2012 to support MPC&A upgrades at buildings storing nuclear materials. $47 million was requested for FY2013, with reductions due to completion of ongoing security upgrade projects. DOE has assisted in upgrading security at 31 civilian nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, containing around 40 metric tons of weapons-usable materials. Rapid and comprehensive upgrades have been completed at most facilities, with plans to finish upgrades at the remaining 5% of sites. The DOE planned to complete upgrades at facilities housing the final 5% of nuclear materials by FY2008, with increased funding approved by Congress. The Bush Administration requested less funding in FY2007 and FY2008, but Congress increased the appropriations each time. For FY2009, the Administration requested $34.5 million, which was approved by Congress. The Bush Administration requested $34.5 million for FY2009, and Congress approved this request. The Obama Administration requested $43.5 million for FY2010; Congress increased this amount to $63.5 million. Funding for sustainability efforts at sites with completed upgrades was approved for FY2011 and FY2012. An additional $60.1 million was requested for FY2013, with a focus on sustainability. The MPC&A program is assisting in consolidating nuclear materials in former Soviet states. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working on removing nuclear materials from buildings and converting them to less attractive forms for nuclear weapons. They plan to remove materials from 40% of 55 buildings by FY2003 and convert 17 metric tons of uranium by 2012. Funding requests for this effort have been approved by Congress, with additional funding requested for FY2007. The decrease in funding is due to a slow-down in the availability of highly enriched uranium. The House increased the approved request to $21.8 million, with final approval for FY2007 at $27.7 million. Subsequent budget requests were $19.7 million for FY2008, $20.9 million for FY2009, and $13.6 million for FY2010. Congress approved requests for FY2011 ($13.9 million), FY2012 ($14.3 million), and an additional $17 million for FY2013. The funding is used to convert nuclear materials to less attractive forms for proliferation prevention. The MPC&A budget supports building infrastructure in Russia for sustained operations after upgrades. Efforts include regulations, inspections, site safeguards, and training programs. Funding decreased from $41 million in FY2005 to $30 million, with a request for $48.1 million in FY2007. Congress appropriated $29.7 million. The funding for MPC&A decreased from $41 million in FY2005 to $29.7 million in FY2007. Subsequent requests and appropriations increased, with the Obama Administration requesting $68.5 million in FY2010, and Congress approving this amount. Concerns about terrorist acquisition of nuclear materials post-9/11 led to additional funding requests for sustainability programs. Many nations have nuclear materials that could be used in a dirty bomb, with former Soviet Union states posing a greater threat due to scattered radioactive devices. The Department of Energy has a program to identify and secure these sites, receiving initial funding in FY2002. In response to the threat of nuclear materials being used in dirty bombs, the Department of Energy received $150 million in funding post-9/11 to secure 35 nuclear waste sites in Russia and former Soviet states. They also work with the IAEA to secure facilities globally. Funding requests for this program were $24.8 million in FY2005, $24 million in FY2006, $18.3 million in FY2007, and $6 million in FY2008. The Department of Energy's Second Line of Defense Program aims to detect and intercept nuclear material smuggling in former Soviet states. By FY2006, equipment was installed at over 150 sites, with plans for 51 more in FY2007. The program has equipped 161 sites in Russia and aims for 370 by 2011. Training and communication equipment will be provided to border control agents. The Second Line of Defense Program, funded by the Department of Energy, started in FY1998 with less than $3 million per year but received increased funding of $46 million in FY2002. In FY2006, $24 million was approved for the core program, and an additional $28 million was added in FY2004 for the Megaports initiative. This project aims to deploy radiation detectors at major foreign seaports to detect nuclear or radioactive materials. By 2008, the Megaports program had completed work at 23 ports and planned to expand globally. The Megaports program, funded by the Department of Energy, completed work at 23 ports by the end of 2008 and planned to work on 5 more ports in 2009. The funding for the program increased significantly from $15 million in FY2005 to $73.9 million in FY2006. The budget for Second Line of Defense and Megaports in FY2007 was $124 million, a $27 million increase from the previous year. This shift in funding signaled a move away from projects in the former Soviet Union towards projects in other nations. In FY2007, the budget for Second Line of Defense and Megaports was $124 million, a $27 million increase from the previous year. There was a significant shift in funding, with $84 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and $40 million allocated to Megaports. The increase in Second Line of Defense was due to efforts to install radiation detection equipment in the Caucuses region, while the decrease in Megaports was because equipment installation at five ports was completed in 2006. The House and Senate committees approved funding for both programs, with additional funding added by the Energy and Water Appropriations Committee. In FY2007, the budget for Second Line of Defense and Megaports was $124 million, with $84 million allocated to Second Line of Defense and $40 million to Megaports. Congress appropriated $191.9 million in FY2007, with $116.1 million going to Megaports. In FY2008, Congress allocated $266.9 million, with $136 million for the core program and $130.8 million for Megaports. The Bush Administration requested $212 million for SLD in FY2009, with Congress appropriating $71.9 million for the core program and $102 million for Megaports. These increases show Congress's focus on enhancing port security and detecting nuclear materials. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $71.9 million for the core program and $102 million for Megaports. The Obama Administration requested $78.4 million for the core program and $194 million for Megaports, which was approved. For FY2011, the Administration requested $140.4 million for the core program and $124.9 million for Megaports, but funding remained at $78.4 million and $194 million, respectively. In FY2012, the Administration requested $263.8 million for SLD, with $129.4 million for the core program and $134.4 million for Megaports. Congress appropriated $262 million, slightly reducing the Megaports portion. For FY2013, the Obama Administration requested $92.6 million for the SLD program, with $73 million for the core program. The funding for the SLD program in FY2013 was reduced to $92.6 million, with $73 million allocated to the core program and $19.6 million to Megaports. DOE completed installing radiation detection equipment and Megaports equipment in FY2012, transitioning to sustainability programs in FY2013. Funding history for International Nuclear Materials and Cooperation programs shows an increase in funding for SLD over the past decade. In recent years, funding for programs to secure warheads and Navy and SRF sites at Rosatom has increased sharply. However, as these programs wind down, MPC&A funding and DOE's contribution to nonproliferation programs in Russia have started to decline. The Russian Transition Initiative has been renamed to Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and is now part of the Global Security Engagement and Cooperation effort. This program has also expanded to include nations outside the former Soviet Union like Libya and Iraq. The DOE programs, Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and Nuclear Cities Initiative, aim to prevent knowledge leakage from Russia's nuclear weapons complex. These programs help Russia downsize its nuclear weapons complex and create sustainable work for scientists through technology projects with market opportunities. The Bush Administration plans to expand the program to engage biological and chemical weapons scientists, requesting funding for two chemical weapons institutes in FY2004. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program started in 1994, matching U.S. weapons labs and industry with Russian scientists for cooperative research projects. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program, started in 1994, aims to match U.S. industry with Russian scientists for research projects with commercial potential. The program received funding from the FY1994 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and continued to receive additional funding until FY2003. In FY2004, the Bush Administration requested funding for projects under IPP, which was approved by Congress. However, a GAO study in February 1999 criticized the program for spending nearly half of its funds at U.S. nuclear weapons labs. The report raised concerns about the oversight of the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program, noting that Russian institutes only received around one-third of the funds allocated. Despite DOE's defense that the program employed thousands of scientists, Congress reduced funding for the program in FY2000 and mandated limits on spending at U.S. labs. The United States mandated negotiations with Russia to prevent taxes on funds for the IPP Program. A critical GAO report in 2007 highlighted overstatements by DOE on scientist support and job creation. Questions were raised about the program's value and future direction. The IPP program engaged thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians between FY1994 and FY2002, with projects in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. It has created 850 high tech jobs in Russia and received $125 million in private sector matching funds. The Nuclear Cities Initiative was established in 1998 to bring commercial enterprises to Russia's closed nuclear cities. The Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI) program was established in 1998 to attract commercial enterprises to Russia's closed nuclear cities, aiming to reduce the weapons complex and prevent scientists from selling their knowledge. The program received funding of $87 million between FY1999 and FY2003, with additional funding requested by the Bush Administration. Questions were raised about the program's value and effectiveness, leading to proposed budget cuts in FY2002. The Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI) program, established in 1998 to attract commercial enterprises to Russia's closed nuclear cities, faced challenges with limited funding and uncertain political support. Despite initial acceptance of reduced funding, Congress later added $15 million to the program. However, the NCI program reportedly made limited progress in addressing employment problems. The Bush Administration announced the program's cessation in 2003 due to disagreements with Russia on liability provisions. Ongoing projects continued. The NCI program faced challenges with limited funding and political support. Despite ongoing projects, new funding was not allocated after 2003. The Administration allocated $41 million to the Russian Transition Initiative in FY2005, supporting projects in Russia's closed nuclear cities. In FY2006, $37.9 million was requested for the Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program, with funding phased out for NCI programs in Snezhinsk and Sarov. Efforts were focused on redirecting engineers and technicians from Russia's plutonium production reactors in Seversk. The budget reduction in FY2007 led to a contraction of efforts to redirect Russia's nuclear scientists and reduce the size of Russia's nuclear weapons complex. The total request for the programs equaled $28.1 million, with funding increased to $39.6 million by the Appropriations Committees. In FY2008, the budget request sought $20.2 million for these programs. The FY2008 budget request sought $20.2 million for programs related to redirecting Russia's nuclear scientists and reducing their nuclear weapons complex. Funding increased to $39.6 million, with Congress appropriating $30.1 million. The Obama Administration requested $20 million in FY2010, and Congress appropriated $19.7 million. In the early 1990s, the US and Russia pledged to end plutonium production for nuclear weapons, with Russia hesitating due to using reactors for light and heat production in cities. In 1994, the US and Russia agreed to work together on providing alternative energy sources for Russian cities, with the goal of shutting down reactors by 2000 if alternative energy facilities were developed. The initial plan to replace reactors with fossil-fueled power plants was deemed costly, leading to exploration of converting plutonium production reactors to a type that did not produce weapons-grade plutonium. Each side planned to contribute half of the $160 million needed for this conversion project. After a financial crisis in 1998, Russia could not pay its share for the core conversion project, causing the expected cost to double. The US might have had to pay over $300 million if the project continued. Safety concerns raised the possibility of closing the reactors after conversion. In late 1999, Minatom proposed replacing the reactors with fossil fuel plants, estimating a similar cost to the core conversion. By late 2000, the US and Russia agreed to replace the reactors with fossil fuel plants. The US Congress prohibited the use of funds for fossil fuel plants in FY2000 and FY2001. The Bush Administration endorsed the reactor shut-down program and transferred the project to the DOE. Contributions were made by DOD, DOE, and the State Department, with funds allocated in various fiscal years. The United States and Russia received funding for a reactor shutdown program in FY2004 and FY2005. The program aims to shut down old nuclear reactors and replace them with new fossil fuel plants by 2008 and 2011. Safety improvements are also being implemented at the reactors. In Seversk, two nuclear reactors are being shut down and a fossil fuel plant from the 1950s is being refurbished, with completion expected by December 2008. In Zheleznogorsk, the US is assisting in shutting down a nuclear plant and constructing a new fossil fuel plant, with the project more than one-third complete. The DOE requested increased funding for a fossil fuel plant project at the Seversk site, with completion expected by 2011. Congress allocated over $200 million for the project in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. Funding for the program area was also increased in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act, with a budget request of $206.6 million for FY2007 aimed at completing the shutdown of the Zheleznogorsk reactor by 2010. The Zheleznogorsk reactor shutdown project received varying funding amounts from Congress, with the FY2008 budget request seeking $181.6 million. Funding for the Seversk site decreased as the project nears completion, while funding for Zheleznogorsk increased. The House added $10 million to accelerate work in Zheleznogorsk, but the Senate reduced the request. In the final budget, Zheleznogorsk received $159.1 million. For FY2009, DOE requested $141.3 million, with no funding for Seversk and $139.3 million allocated to Zheleznogorsk. The Obama Administration requested $24.5 million for the Zheleznogorsk reactor shutdown project in FY2010, with $2 million allocated to crosscutting and technical support activities. Funding was authorized and appropriated for FY2010, but no funding was requested for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. In September 1998, the United States and Russia agreed to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium to a form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons, leading to the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement in September 2000. According to the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, parties could dispose of plutonium by converting it to mixed oxide fuel for nuclear power reactors or immobilizing it to prevent its use in nuclear weapons. Some critics oppose the use of plutonium in power generation, fearing it could be a cover for developing nuclear weapons. Russia values plutonium for its civilian power program, while the United States initially planned to pursue disposal methods. The Bush Administration decided to focus on converting surplus plutonium to MOX fuel instead of pursuing multiple disposal options. Congress allocated funds for construction of facilities in Savannah River, SC for the U.S. surplus plutonium disposal program. The U.S. and international allies agreed to contribute to Russia's plutonium disposition program, with allies pledging $700 million. The Bush Administration requested $47 million for Russian Fissile Materials Disposition in FY2004, with prior balances of $151 million to be spent in Russia. However, in 2003, the plutonium disposition program was halted due to disagreements on liability provisions. A liability agreement was reached in 2005, but not yet signed by Russia's President Putin. The FY2005 budget included $64 million for U.S. assistance to Russia. The FY2005 budget included $64 million for U.S. assistance to Russia on plutonium disposition. Congress authorized and appropriated the requested amount but questioned the Administration's ability to begin construction in May 2005. The Administration requested additional funds for FY2006 and FY2007, but Congress appropriated less than requested. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have expressed concerns about Russia's potential shift away from the MOX program. The United States considered funding fast breeder reactors in Russia to burn plutonium directly for energy, but concerns about nonproliferation led to funding cuts. Congress also questioned the value of the U.S. MOX program and reduced funding. In late November 2007, the U.S. and Russia reached an agreement on how to proceed with the program. The United States and Russia reached an agreement on disposing of plutonium, allowing Russia to burn some in modified reactors and convert some into MOX fuel. Critics fear this will slow down the elimination of Russia's weapons-grade plutonium. Funding for the program remains uncertain, with only $1 million requested for FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $1 million for FY2009 and FY2010 for technical oversight of the program by U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories. In FY2011, the Administration requested $113 million for Russian Materials Disposition. Congress authorized funding for the program in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act, but did not appropriate funding in the continuing resolution due to lack of funds in FY2010. The Administration withdrew the request for $100 million of the FY2010 funds during debates over the continuing resolution. The Obama Administration withdrew the request for $100 million of the FY2010 funds for Russian fissile materials disposition during debates over the continuing resolutions. Congress appropriated only $1 million for this program in FY2012, and the Administration has requested $3.8 million for FY2013. Various issues have arisen since the Nunn-Lugar amendment was passed, including disputes over specific projects like the chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. The debate over U.S. threat reduction assistance to Russia and former Soviet states continues, with questions about whether it serves broader national security goals and concerns about allowing Russia to divert resources to develop new weapons. Critics question if the assistance is defense or foreign aid, echoing debates from previous years. The debates over U.S. threat reduction assistance to Russia and former Soviet states focus on new concerns raised during assessments of program performance and potential links between weapons of mass destruction and terrorist organizations. Supporters and critics discuss issues related to program implementation and proposals for the future. The slow progress of the program in its early years was attributed to the need for cooperation with Russia and interagency coordination issues. Despite each key agency managing its own projects, coordination problems persist, hindering efficiency and resource sharing. There is a lack of clear leadership in setting policies and priorities for U.S. threat reduction efforts. Proposed solutions aim to address these challenges. Many analysts suggest creating a strategic plan and appointing a program coordinator to enhance U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. The lack of clear leadership and coordination issues have hindered the efficiency of these programs. According to analysts, U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs lack clear leadership and coordination. A strategic plan and a high-level program coordinator are recommended to improve efficiency and coordination among agencies. The need for a high-level program coordinator to provide consistent direction, resolve budgetary conflicts, and enhance political leadership in U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs has been highlighted. Both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have rejected the idea, citing existing interagency coordination efforts. The Proliferation Strategy Policy Coordinating Committee, chaired by a National Security Council senior director, coordinates U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs related to the former Soviet Union. Some argue for a new interagency committee, while Congress supports a high-level coordinator. Legislation proposed a Senior Advisor to the President for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 established an Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism within the Executive Office of the President. This advisor would lead inter-agency coordination of U.S. efforts to implement its WMD nonproliferation strategy and oversee the development of a comprehensive budget for programs to prevent WMD proliferation and terrorism. The Obama Administration created a new NSC position for the prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism, with a designated director and deputy director focusing on threat reduction efforts. This position aims to coordinate nonproliferation programs in various departments and analysts believe budget responsibility is crucial for its success. The success of a White House-based nonproliferation \"czar\" may depend on budget control and corrective actions to establish and enforce priorities across government agencies. A high-level committee with agency representatives may have more success in creating consensus on priorities, but matching funding levels could still be challenging. Analysts and officials highlight budget responsibility as a primary barrier to successful threat reduction implementation. The primary barrier to successful implementation of threat reduction projects is gaining access and transparency from officials in recipient nations, particularly Russia. Russia has been slow to provide access to nuclear weapons storage areas and has not provided complete information or access to facilities in its biological weapons complex. Despite years of negotiations, a transparency agreement for the Mayak facility storing fissile materials has not been completed. Access to many facilities in Russia's nuclear weapons complex has not been granted, hindering U.S. efforts to improve security for nuclear materials. Analysts note that Russia's secrecy regarding its nuclear weapons programs undermines support for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in the United States. The lack of a systematic approach to addressing security issues at nuclear complex sites has led to delays in program implementation. Better coordination among threat reduction programs is needed, with a single program coordinator suggested to help identify and address problems efficiently. In the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, Congress called for a report on impediments to successful implementation of threat reduction programs. Problems with access to Russian facilities are cited as one of the main obstacles. The United States and Russia signed an agreement in 1992 outlining rights and responsibilities for implementing programs funded by U.S. assistance. If this agreement were to lapse, the U.S. would not be able to award new contracts for projects funded by U.S. assistance. The original agreement, set to last for seven years, was extended for another seven years in 1999 and was set to expire in June 2006. It covered programs funded by the Department of Defense, with the Department of Energy adopting a similar agreement for its programs in the former Soviet Union. The most contentious issue was liability for accidents during project implementation, with Russia assuming all liability initially. However, recent disagreements have arisen over holding U.S. contractors liable for accidents resulting from sabotage. The disagreement over liability for accidents resulting from sabotage impeded the conclusion of a new implementation agreement for DOE's Plutonium Disposition Program. The United States and Russia recognized that failure to resolve this issue could stall or stop a nonproliferation program that had made great strides in securing weapons and materials in Russia. Finding an acceptable solution for the DOE program's agreement could ease efforts in negotiations over the broader umbrella agreement. The DOE program's agreement was a key point of contention between the United States and Russia, particularly regarding liability for accidents resulting from sabotage. Contractors in the program were willing to accept liability placed on U.S. companies, which could expose them to Russia's legal system. The two countries eventually reached an agreement on liability provisions during the G-8 summit in July 2005, setting up a separate process for addressing sabotage-related situations. In mid-June 2006, the United States and Russia agreed on liability protections for sabotage situations, extending the umbrella agreement for seven years. The new agreement retains blanket liability protections for existing projects but addresses Russia's concerns for future projects. U.S. contractors could be liable for damages caused by sabotage or accidents in some cases. The original Nunn-Lugar amendment had conditions recipients had to meet before receiving U.S. threat reduction assistance. Congress expected the President to exercise judgment when deciding whether to issue certifications for recipient nations committed to specific policies, including substantial investment in dismantling weapons, forgoing military modernization exceeding defense needs, and complying with arms control agreements and human rights standards. The standard for commitment to these policies may be less demanding than one requiring precise behavior. The Clinton and Bush Administrations had differing approaches to certifying Russia's compliance with chemical and biological weapons agreements. The exclusions in the certification process lack clear definitions for terms such as \"substantial investment\" and \"legitimate defense requirements.\" Congress considered adding new exclusions to the CTR. Congress debated adding new or modified exclusions to the CTR legislation over the program's lifespan. Efforts to provide more precise standards of behavior for recipient nations or link assistance to additional policy areas were often rejected to avoid cutting off U.S. threat reduction aid to Russia. Instead, requirements were crafted to give the President flexibility in balancing concerns about recipients' policies with the goal of containing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction. Certification requirements related to the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye were added in FY1998 and FY1999. In FY1998 and FY1999, Congress added certification requirements for the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. The President needed to certify Russia's progress in implementing the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, resolving compliance issues, and declaring information on chemical weapons facilities. Congress allowed the President to submit an alternative certification for chemical weapons destruction activities in Russia, citing national security concerns. However, funding for Shchuch'ye in FY2002 reinstated certification requirements without the alternative provision. The Secretary of Defense had to certify Russia's information on chemical weapons stockpiles, annual commitment to elimination, and practical plan for nerve agent destruction before US funding could be provided. The Bush Administration announced in April 2002 that it could not certify Russia's commitment to its arms control obligations under the Chemical Weapons and Biological Weapons Conventions, which stalled many ongoing CTR projects. The Administration asked Congress for authority to waive certification requirements to continue funding. The Bush Administration requested Congress to waive certification requirements to continue funding CTR programs in Russia. Most Members of Congress agreed, with the Senate granting permanent waiver authority and the House providing a three-year waiver for certain exclusions. The Bush Administration requested Congress to waive certification requirements for funding CTR programs in Russia. The Senate granted permanent waiver authority, while the House provided a three-year waiver for specific exclusions. In the FY2006 Defense Authorization Bill, the Senate gave the President unlimited waiver authority, which was adopted by the conference committee. The President must still present a waiver annually if Russia's compliance cannot be certified, but this authority is available every year. The Senate's FY2007 Defense Authorization Bill aimed to eliminate certification requirements from the CTR. The Senate approved removing certification requirements from the CTR legislation, but the House rejected it. The final bill still gives the President unlimited waiver authority. The Bush Administration believes certification and waivers are crucial to encourage openness in Russia. Some in Congress support this approach, prioritizing the CTR program while considering Russian behavior in other policy areas. Some Members of Congress prioritize U.S. threat reduction assistance to Russia over considering Russian behavior in other policy areas. There are differing opinions on amending the CTR legislation to remove certification requirements or providing the President with permanent waiver authority. Others argue that Russian policies in areas like nuclear cooperation with Iran and military modernization pose new threats to U.S. security and should take precedence over threat reduction assistance. The 110th Congress eliminated certification requirements from the CTR program, allowing U.S. assistance to Russia without restrictions. The U.S. allocates over $1 billion annually to threat reduction programs in the former Soviet Union and additional funds to nonproliferation efforts worldwide. Despite program expansion in the 1990s, some analysts argue for increased U.S. commitment to these initiatives. The Baker-Cutler report in 2001 recommended the US spend $30 billion over 10 years on DOE's nuclear materials programs. Analysts agree that more funding is needed to accelerate programs, citing implementation problems and unspent money. Increased funding could enhance programs like the science centers in Moscow and Kiev. Increased funding is needed to accelerate various programs, such as the science centers in Moscow and Kiev, disposal of plutonium in Russia, and elimination of plutonium producing reactors. The Bush Administration agreed to add funding to some programs to expedite progress. Export and border control programs could also benefit from additional funding for improved equipment and procedures at border crossing points. The Bush Administration implemented various programs to accelerate progress, including science centers and export and border control programs. Additional international funding was called for to shut down Russia's plutonium-producing reactors and improve security at storage sites for nuclear warheads. However, with a fixed budget of $1 billion per year, expanding these programs or introducing new ones may require reducing funding for other programs. Trade-offs between projects may be necessary due to the increasing costs of programs like disposing of weapons-grade plutonium. In the FY2004 budget request, the Department of Energy sought funding to accelerate the blend-down of highly enriched uranium and to secure radiological sources. The US has reduced funding for MPC&A projects in Russia's nuclear weapons complex while some programs are finishing, allowing for increased funding for other projects. As large construction projects funded in the 1990s conclude, there may be challenges in meeting the commitment to spend $1 billion annually. DOD's CTR budget has decreased, and DOE's funding for programs in Russia has also declined. This could lead to additional funding for new projects in the former Soviet Union. The US has reduced funding for MPC&A projects in Russia's nuclear weapons complex as some programs finish, potentially leading to increased funding for new projects in the former Soviet Union. President Obama aims to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials globally in four years, which may require additional funds for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs outside the former Soviet Union. Funding for programs in the former Soviet Union could decline in the near future despite a possible increase in the overall budget for nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance. The United States has sought to consolidate, contain, and destroy weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union to prevent leakage. New projects like the WMD Proliferation Prevention Project and DOE Second Line of Defense focus on setting up barriers outside the nuclear weapons complex. In an effort to enhance security, measures are being taken to prevent nuclear resources from leaving the former Soviet Union. These approaches aim to create a \"layered defense\" against the leakage of weapons, materials, and knowledge. However, there may be competition for funding and political support between these external barriers and protecting nuclear materials at their source in Russia's nuclear complex. The debate over U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance may address the focus and priorities in addressing the global issue of weapons of mass destruction proliferation to rogue nations or terrorist groups. The global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a significant threat, requiring an international response. The G-8 Global Partnership is an initiative aimed at reducing this threat by involving multiple countries in funding and cooperative programs. The G-8 Global Partnership Against Weapons of Mass Destruction involves multiple countries in funding and cooperative programs to reduce the global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The initiative includes extending U.S. threat reduction assistance to nations outside the former Soviet Union and encouraging all nations to secure their weapons and materials. The program, known as 10+10 over 10, involves the United States pledging $10 billion over 10 years to sustain threat reduction programs in Russia. The G-8 Global Partnership Against Weapons of Mass Destruction involves multiple countries funding threat reduction programs. The United States has pledged $10 billion over 10 years for ongoing programs in Russia, with Russia also contributing $2 billion. Guidelines include monitoring, auditing, transparency measures, and liability protections for donor countries. The G-8 leaders agreed to focus on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in Russia and Ukraine. The United States sees its assistance to former Soviet states as part of the Global Partnership commitment. They also aim to redirect scientists in Iraq and Libya. Assistance can be extended to other nations following the Partnership's guidelines. The G-8 leaders invited other nations and organizations to contribute to the Global Partnership for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Several European nations and additional countries have joined the partnership, with pledges totaling around $17 billion. President Bush emphasized the need to expand the list of donors and recipients. Some analysts question the effectiveness of the Global Partnership in providing significant new funding. The Global Partnership for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs has received pledges totaling around $17 billion, including $10 billion from the United States. Analysts are concerned about sustained funding over the next 10 years due to economic challenges. Participating nations are funding numerous projects in recipient nations, with expenditures increasing. Questions remain about setting priorities and dividing responsibilities for different nonproliferation projects. The Global Partnership for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs has received pledges totaling around $17 billion, including $10 billion from the United States. Analysts are concerned about sustained funding over the next 10 years due to economic challenges. Participating nations are funding numerous projects in recipient nations, with expenditures increasing. Most analysts agree that added funding would help to expand and accelerate high-priority projects such as the destruction of chemical weapons, dismantlement of nuclear submarines, disposition of fissile materials, and employment of former weapons scientists. Each nation allocates its own funds to these programs without relying on a single coordinating body. In the debate over the FY2003 Defense Authorization Bill, the Senate approved an amendment allowing DOD to use up to $50 million in FY2003 CTR funds \"outside the states of the former Soviet Union\" to address emerging proliferation threats and opportunities for the United States. Senator Lugar proposed legislation to assist nations in securing or destroying weapons and dangerous materials, create international standards for handling nuclear material, and undertake missions to secure dangerous materials. The Senate and Bush Administration supported the proposal, but the House objected and the language was removed. The Bush Administration requested a similar authorization in FY2003, which was approved by the Senate but rejected by the House. The Bush Administration requested up to $50 million in CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union in the FY2004 Defense Authorization Bill. The Senate supported the measure, but the House preferred managing such programs through the State Department. The conference committee approved the use of $50 million in CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union, addressing House concerns. The committee language specified that funding for short-term projects could only be used after the President determined if DOD was the most suitable agency. The Bush Administration utilized this authority in 2004 to assist Albania with chemical weapons disposal. The Senate proposed shifting approval power to the Secretary of Defense in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Bill to streamline responses to proliferation issues, but the House objected. The 110th Congress expanded the authority to spend CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union and streamlined the process for approving projects. Congress added $10 million to fund these programs and eliminated the requirement for short-term projects only. CTR programs outside the former Soviet Union are now defined similarly to those inside, focusing on the elimination and safe storage of chemical or biological weapons. The 110th Congress expanded the authority to spend CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union, emphasizing safe transportation and storage of nuclear weapons and preventing proliferation of weapons and military technology. Congress aimed to expand the CTR program beyond the former Soviet Union borders. In FY2008, Congress expanded the CTR program globally, emphasizing new initiatives for international cooperation, partnerships, and denuclearization efforts in Asia and the Middle East. The National Academy of Sciences recommended a broader CTR program to engage nations worldwide in securing dangerous weapons and materials. The Obama Administration supports expanding Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) efforts beyond the former Soviet Union to help other nations secure and eliminate dangerous weapons and materials. This includes providing funds for nonproliferation assistance in various program areas. Advocates argue that the US can use its threat reduction model to assist countries like Pakistan in securing nuclear materials at risk of theft by terrorists. Some question the applicability of the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program to nations outside the former Soviet Union, citing concerns about access to nuclear facilities, legal issues, and the potential unintended consequences of U.S. assistance in securing weapons. The proliferation threat and the link to terrorism highlight the presence of nuclear, chemical, and biological materials in many countries worldwide. There is a global presence of nuclear, chemical, and biological materials in many nations. These materials lack proper accounting, security, and control systems. While not all materials are useful for nuclear weapons, they could be used for other harmful purposes. The international community and individual nations should address these issues beyond current measures. Some suggest expanding Cooperative Threat Reduction programs to address this problem. Expanding CTR programs beyond the former Soviet Union could help address the global problem of securing and accounting for radiological and chemical materials. The effort may require diplomatic and political steps, with the United States and others encouraging nations to recognize and address their vulnerabilities. This new global focus could shape the second decade of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance. In the second decade, the focus of threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance may shift towards concerns about terrorist organizations acquiring nuclear, chemical, and biological materials. Global cooperation in addressing vulnerabilities in multiple countries is expected to increase, with the potential for other nations to contribute expertise and resources alongside the U.S."
