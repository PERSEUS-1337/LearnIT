The findings presented by Congress highlight the significant impact of obesity in the United States, with over 78 million adults affected. Obesity is linked to chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, leading to substantial healthcare costs. Projections suggest that a large percentage of Americans will be overweight or obese in the coming years, emphasizing the urgent need for intervention. SEC. 3.

The Medicare and You Handbook will now include information on the coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, including details on eligible providers. Effective immediately for notices distributed after the enactment of this Act. The Medicare and You Handbook will now include information on the coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity for Medicare beneficiaries and providers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide distinct, written notifications regarding this coverage within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Medicare and You Handbook will include information on coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity for Medicare beneficiaries and providers. Written notifications will be provided annually for the first 3 years after the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2012, and as determined appropriate by the Secretary thereafter. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is given authority to coordinate programs for preventing and treating obesity and expanding coverage options under Medicare. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to develop a plan to coordinate efforts across various departments to address obesity in adults, with updates required annually. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with expert representatives to develop a plan to treat and reduce overweight and obesity in the United States, including interagency cooperation and best practices in States. The plan to address overweight and obesity in the United States includes identifying best practices, collaborating with various entities for intervention evaluation, research initiatives for surveillance and monitoring, and recommendations for budget coordination. The plan under the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2012 includes recommendations for coordinating efforts across Federal agencies to address overweight and obesity. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report summarizing the plan's strategic recommendations and evaluating the effectiveness of coordinated interventions. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2012 requires the Secretary to submit an annual report evaluating the effectiveness of coordinated interventions, conducting interim assessments, and making recommendations for updating the plan based on data. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2023 to carry out these activities. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2012 authorizes the Secretary to expand qualified health care providers for intensive behavioral therapy and include chronic weight management drugs as Medicare covered Part D drugs. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2012 allows Medicare to cover weight management drugs under Part D, with the amendment specifying the inclusion of such drugs if deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The effective date for this amendment is two years after the Act's enactment."
