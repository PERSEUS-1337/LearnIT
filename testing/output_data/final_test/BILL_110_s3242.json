    "content": "The Act titled \"Digital Television Transition Consumer Relief Act of 2008\" allows for temporary duty suspension and reliquidation of certain digital-to-analog converter boxes and television tuners. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 mandated the switch to digital TV broadcasts by February 17, 2009. Millions of US consumers without cable or satellite service need digital-to-analog converters to receive signals. Low-income families, rural residents, and vulnerable populations are less likely to have the necessary equipment. The Digital Television Transition Act of 2005 required the switch to digital TV broadcasts by February 17, 2009. Low-income families and vulnerable populations are less likely to afford digital-to-analog converters needed to receive signals. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is collecting an import tax on converter boxes, adding to the costs of conversion. Congress believes the costs of transitioning to digital TV should be affordable for all Americans. The Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended to define a 'digital-to-analog converter box' as a device solely for converting digital TV channels to analog format for display on analog TVs. Temporary duty suspensions are also introduced for these converter boxes. The Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended to include duty suspensions for digital-to-analog converter boxes and television tuners used in the assembly of these boxes. The amendments made by subsection (d) apply to goods entered on or after December 1, 2007. U.S. Customs and Border Protection can liquidate or reliquidate entries at the applicable rate under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States upon request. Entries described in paragraph (4) must have a request filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. Payment for amounts owed must be made within 180 days of liquidation or reliquidation, with interest. These entries include entries or withdrawals from warehouse. Entries for duty-free goods made on or after December 1, 2007, must meet specific criteria to qualify for duty-free treatment under subsections (d) and (e) of the Act."
