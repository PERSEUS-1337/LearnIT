    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Television Violence Reduction Through Parental Empowerment Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that parents should have the technology to block violent TV programs for their children. Violence affects American children more than adults, with teenagers being victims of 1,800,000 violent crimes from 1982-1984. Children watch a lot of TV, with an estimated 22,000 hours watched before finishing high school. The American Psychological Association estimates that children witness 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on television before finishing elementary school. Various health organizations have agreed on the harmful effects of television violence on children for almost 20 years, despite efforts to reduce it. The technology exists to allow parents to block violent TV programs for children, despite parental advisories and advanced TV technologies making monitoring difficult for working parents. Congress urges television programmers to electronically send adopted rating or warning systems with program signals to protect parental rights in guiding children's TV viewing habits. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require televisions to have circuitry enabling viewers to block channels, programs, and time slots. This applies to TVs manufactured or imported in the US with screens 13 inches or larger. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require TVs to have blocking technology for certain channels and programs. Regulations prohibit shipping, manufacturing, or importing devices without Commission-approved rules for performance standards and signal reception. The Commission ensures availability of blocking service for consumers with new video technology. Amendment includes adding sections 303(v) to the Act. The amendments made by this Act will take effect one year after enactment. The Federal Communications Commission will create rules to implement these amendments within 180 days of enactment."
