The California Israel Commerce Protection Act, also known as the California Israel Commerce Protection Act, highlights the strong bond between the United States and Israel based on shared values of freedom and democracy. California and Israel have established beneficial business partnerships in various sectors such as agriculture, education, energy, entertainment, health, and science. On March 5, 2014, the Governor of California and the Prime Minister of Israel signed a memorandum of understanding for strategic partnerships in innovation and cooperation. In July 2015, the Legislature affirmed support for the MOU, noting expanded cooperation in areas like energy, agriculture, business, and academia. Public retirement systems in California invest in foreign companies that may be at risk due to ties with businesses boycotting Israel.
