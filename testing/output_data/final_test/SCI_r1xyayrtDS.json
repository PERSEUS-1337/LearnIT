    "content": "Reinforcement learning in an actor-critic setting relies on accurate value estimates of the critic. Clipped Double Q-learning (CDQ) is used in the TD3 algorithm to address overestimation issues. CDQ induces an underestimation bias, so a new algorithm proposes using a weighted average of CDQ and a single critic target to balance value estimates. The weighting parameter is adjusted during training to match actual returns and prevent over- and underestimation. Off-policy reinforcement learning aims to be more data-efficient by reusing old experience for training, but the combination of TD learning, function approximation, and off-policy training can be unstable. The deadly triad in reinforcement learning involves instability in TD learning, function approximation, and off-policy training. Double DQN is effective for preventing divergence in discrete action spaces, but struggles with overestimation in continuous action spaces. TD3 algorithm addresses this issue with Clipped Double Q-learning, improving critic accuracy and algorithm performance. The authors propose a method to address the underestimation bias in the CDQ critic update. They train two critics with a weighted average of the single TD target for each critic and the TD target from CDQ, balancing out biases. The authors address underestimation bias in the CDQ critic update by training two critics with a weighted average of single TD target and CDQ target. This method improves Q-value estimates and enhances reinforcement learning agent performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on continuous control tasks. The open-sourced code allows for easy reproducibility and evaluation on various random seeds. The DPG algorithm learns a deterministic policy in an actor-critic setting, extended to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm using multi-layer neural networks. The TD3 algorithm further enhances DDPG with three additional components for improved results. The TD3 algorithm adds three components to DDPG for better results. The actor is updated less frequently than the critic, noise is added to actor's actions in the critic update, and Clipped Double Q-learning prevents overestimation bias. This method improves Q-value estimates and achieves state-of-the-art results on continuous control tasks. The work investigates methods to address overestimation bias in Q-learning, including using a single estimator, averaging Q-estimates, and introducing a weighting parameter in the TD target. Different approaches have been explored to balance between overestimating and underestimating terms in Q-estimates for discrete action spaces. The weighting parameter in the TD target is set individually for each state-action pair in Q-learning. Divergence of Q-values has been studied in recent works, with a focus on continuous action spaces. Achiam et al. (2019) considered continuous action spaces and derived an algorithm that does not require multiple critics or target networks, but is computationally intensive. Model-free reinforcement learning for episodic tasks with continuous action spaces involves an agent interacting with its environment by selecting actions to maximize future rewards. The value function Q\u03c0(s, a) represents the expected return for a state-action pair, while the policy \u03c0\u03c6 is optimized to maximize the expected return J(\u03c6) using the deterministic policy gradient. This approach eliminates the need for multiple critics or target networks but is computationally intensive. The actor-critic method involves learning a value function Q\u03c0 to approximate the policy parameters \u03c6. The Q-learning algorithm uses TD learning to update the value function, with Deep Q-learning being a variant that uses neural networks to approximate Q\u03b8. The network is updated by regressing its value at (s, a) to its 1-step TD targets. Parameters \u03c6 and \u03b8 are updated using an exponential moving average. The actor-critic method involves learning a value function Q\u03c0 to approximate the policy parameters \u03c6. Q-learning in this setting can lead to overestimation of Q-values, which is problematic for actions with low returns. To address this, Clipped Double Q-learning was proposed, using two Q-networks trained in parallel to minimize overestimation bias. Clipped Double Q-learning (CDQ) addresses the issue of overestimation bias in Q-values. The advantage of CDQ is that Q-estimates do not explode, preventing performance breakdown. If biases differ for different state-action pairs, the critic may reinforce wrong actions, leading to decreased performance. However, the critic can correct itself with new experiences, eventually improving actor performance. The critic's role in training the actor is crucial to prevent underestimation bias in Q-value estimates. An experiment was conducted comparing CDQ and DDPG critic updates in training TD3 agents on different environments from OpenAI gym. The results showed that taking the minimum over two estimates can lead to an underestimation bias. Balanced Clipped Double Q-learning (BCDQ) is proposed as a new algorithm to reduce bias in Q-value estimates. It addresses the overestimation bias seen in DDPG-style updates and the underestimation bias in CDQ by training two Q-networks on different TD tasks. The study compares bias in Q-value estimates of DDPG, CDQ, and BCDQ on OpenAI gym environments. DDPG overestimates, CDQ underestimates, while BCDQ shows more accurate estimates. BCDQ uses a weighted average of two networks to reduce bias. The study compares bias in Q-value estimates of DDPG, CDQ, and BCDQ on OpenAI gym environments. DDPG tends to overestimate, CDQ tends to underestimate, while BCDQ aims for more accurate estimates by using a weighted average of two networks to reduce bias. Adjusting the weighting parameter \u03b2 over the training process helps correct for bias in Q-value estimates. The study compares bias in Q-value estimates of DDPG, CDQ, and BCDQ on OpenAI gym environments. While DDPG tends to overestimate and CDQ tends to underestimate, BCDQ aims for more accurate estimates by adjusting the weighting parameter \u03b2 over the training process. This adjustment helps correct for bias in Q-value estimates by increasing \u03b2 when underestimation occurs. The parameter \u03b2 is updated based on the sum of time steps in episodes, with a threshold set to the maximum possible steps. Stochastic gradient descent is used to optimize \u03b2, increasing computational complexity minimally. BCDQ approximates true Q-values better than other methods, indicating the adjustability of \u03b2 during training. Adjusting the weighting parameter \u03b2 during training allows for canceling out biases in BCDQ. The parameter gets close to zero for Hopper task, emphasizing CDQ updates, while for HalfCheetah, CDQ is not heavily weighted due to induced bias. Adapting \u03b2 prevents error accumulation from bootstrapping in TD target estimation and shows the challenge of treating it as a fixed hyperparameter across different environments. The Balanced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (BTD3) proposes using the average of two Q-network predictions to update critics, unlike CDQ in TD3. This approach aims to address changing learning dynamics in different environments by adjusting the weighting parameter \u03b2 during training. The BTD3 algorithm uses BTDQ to update critics and averages predictions of two critics for actor learning. It is evaluated on challenging continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym using MuJoCo physics engine. Adjusting learning rates improved performance on Humanoid-v3 task.

The algorithm sets learning rates and initializes parameters for different environments, adds exploration noise, and evaluates policy performance periodically.

The BTD3 algorithm outperforms SAC and DDPG, matching or surpassing TD3 in various tasks with significantly higher episode rewards. Dynamic adjustment of the weighting parameter \u03b2 during training is essential for optimal performance, as fixed values lead to worse results compared to BTD3 and TD3. The evaluation shows that fixed values for \u03b2 that seem promising can perform worse than other values, supporting the importance of dynamic adjustment in BCDQ. Learning curves for different continuous control tasks are shown in Figure 4, highlighting the biases induced by Clipped Double Q-learning and the benefits of Balanced Clipped Double Q-learning. The Balanced Clipped Double Q-learning algorithm (BCDQ) improves value estimates by adjusting a weighting parameter through comparing Q-values with actual returns. BCDQ is used in the Balanced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (BTD3) for state-of-the-art performance in continuous control tasks. It can be added to actor-critic algorithms with minimal computational complexity and has potential for use in discrete action spaces, warranting further research."
