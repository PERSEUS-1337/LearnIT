The \"Renew America's Schools Act of 2017\" provides grants for energy efficiency improvements at public school facilities through eligible entities consisting of local educational agencies and various partners with knowledge in energy improvements. The \"Renew America's Schools Act of 2017\" covers improvements in building systems like HVAC, lighting, and renewable energy technologies for better teacher and student health. The \"Renew America's Schools Act of 2017\" authorizes competitive grants for energy improvements in schools, prioritizing high-need educational agencies with renovation, repair, and improvement funding needs. The competitive criteria for classifying local educational agencies include fiscal capacity, maintenance likelihood, and energy efficiency/safety benefits. To be eligible for a grant, applicants must submit a needs assessment of the current condition of their facilities. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for applicants seeking energy improvement grants, including a needs assessment, work plan, capacity description, maintenance training needs, energy efficiency benefits, cost estimate, and available resources. The curr_chunk details the availability of resources for activities funded under the grant, including utility programs and public benefit funds. Recipients must use grant amounts solely for energy improvements outlined in the application, with a portion allocated for operation and maintenance training. Funds can also be used for third-party audits for energy improvements. The grant allows for investigation and analysis of energy improvements, continuing education development, and contracting requirements including Davis-Bacon wage rates and competition for funds. The grant recipients must ensure competitive bidding for repair or renovation contracts, prioritizing small, minority, and women-owned businesses. They must also report on the use of funds for energy improvements and cost savings. The Secretary will develop guidelines and best practices for activities under this section. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2018 through 2023."
