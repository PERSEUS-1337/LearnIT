    "content": "The 110th Congress will face challenging issues in foreign, defense, and trade policy, starting with the situation in Iraq. The Administration is expected to request supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as focus on social and political stability in those countries. Other priorities include the fight against terrorism, efforts to deter Iran and North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons, and consideration of Free Trade Agreements. The 110th Congress will focus on challenging issues in foreign, defense, and trade policy, particularly in Iraq. Congress will consider Free Trade Agreements and extending presidential Trade Promotion Authority. The main issue in Congress is how to address the situation in Iraq, with a shift towards considering new approaches rather than staying the course. The ISG recommends a major U.S. diplomatic initiative in the region, including engagement with Iran and Syria. The 110th Congress will focus on challenging issues in foreign, defense, and trade policy, particularly in Iraq. The ISG recommends a major U.S. diplomatic initiative in the region, including engagement with Iran and Syria, and intensified efforts to resolve conflicts in the Middle East. Congress will evaluate recommendations to make training of Iraqi security forces the primary U.S. military mission and withdraw combat brigades by early 2008. Congress may consider legislative measures to promote these policies and provide supplemental funding for the war. In early February, the Defense Department is expected to request supplemental appropriations for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for FY2007. Congress may link funding to political benchmarks or propose a timetable for troop withdrawal. There is also support for adding troops in Iraq. Congressional action on the FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill may spark ongoing debates in the 110th Congress on military preparedness and funding sufficiency. In recent years, Congress has provided increasing amounts of money for war-related costs in annual appropriations bills. In FY2006, over $530 billion was provided for the Department of Defense, with about $120 billion for the war. The 109th Congress approved a $70 billion \"down payment\" for war costs in FY2007, including funds for repairing and replacing Army and Marine Corps equipment. The Army has incurred higher costs than expected for equipping and reorganizing forces for current and future operations. The Army and other services have requested an additional $125-130 billion for war-related expenses in FY2007, bringing the total to almost $200 billion. Congress faces the challenge of balancing readiness and fiscal discipline, including managing budgetary tradeoffs between increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps and modernizing military forces. Other foreign policy issues include dealing with North Korea and Iran's nuclear activities. Political and diplomatic activity is expected in 2007. In 2007, political and diplomatic activity is expected regarding North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs. The 110th Congress may address NATO's role in Afghanistan, the status of Kosovo, and relations with Russia. NATO's engagement in Afghanistan is controversial, Kosovo's status may be resolved in early 2007, and Russia poses challenges and opportunities for the United States. The 110th Congress may focus on security issues in Asia, including flashpoints in various regions and terrorist activities. Attention may also be given to the rise of China, negative attitudes towards the United States in certain Asian nations, and counternarcotics efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean. Key U.S. policy issues in Latin America and Africa include border security cooperation with Mexico, addressing threats to democracy in Venezuela, leftist populism in Latin American countries, and promoting peace, security, counter-terrorism, and HIV/AIDS assistance in Africa. Secretary of State Rice introduced Transformational Diplomacy in 2006 as a bold foreign policy initiative. Transformational Diplomacy, introduced by Secretary of State Rice in 2006, aims to shift State Department personnel to critical locations in Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East to promote democratic principles. This initiative may require increased funding and oversight from the 110th Congress. Trade issues have also become controversial in Congress in recent years. Trade policy has become increasingly controversial in Congress, with Members grappling with the effects of globalization. Concerns include lost jobs, lower wages, income inequality, trade deficits with China, and currency undervaluation. Mainstream economists downplay the role of trade policy in these issues, but for many Members, it sets the stage for a debate on U.S. trade policy. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority in July 2007 could launch this debate in the 110th Congress. The Bush Administration completed free trade agreements with various countries under the authority delegated by Congress. The President may request renewal of Trade Promotion Authority, which could impact pending FTA negotiations and U.S. participation in WTO talks. The debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations could have significant implications for U.S. trade policy and the relationship between Congress and the President. Current U.S. engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq stem from the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, with perceptions of Iraq as a sponsor of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The September 11 Commission found no evidence of an operational relationship between Saddam's regime and Al Qaeda. The U.S. forces are involved in combat and stabilization missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Iraq is more troubled, with over 2,880 U.S. service members killed and sectarian violence surpassing the Sunni Arab-led insurgency. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has shown resilience in 2006 as NATO peacekeeping forces take over the primary stabilization mission. Despite U.S.-designed political transitions and national elections in both countries, violence continues. Operation Iraqi Freedom removed Saddam Hussein's regime, but Iraq remains unstable due to Sunni Arab unrest. Iraqi Freedom removed Saddam Hussein's regime, leading to instability in Iraq due to Sunni Arab resentment and insurgency. President Bush claims success with elections, a permanent constitution, and progress in security forces. The U.S. aims to include more Sunni Arabs in power structures and plans to remain in Iraq until its government can defend itself. President Bush aims to include more Sunni Arabs in Iraq's power structure to address their feelings of marginalization. The debate in the United States over the wisdom of the invasion is fueled by mounting casualties and financial costs, with concerns about the progress of Iraqi Security Forces. Several senior U.S. military leaders are expressing less optimism about the situation in Iraq. The memo to President Bush by National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley expressed doubts about Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's ability to control Shiite militias fueling sectarian violence in Iraq. Debates over Iraq policy options continue in Congress, with some calling for major new initiatives and others citing the need for more troops. Some believe U.S. forces are caught in the middle of a civil war in Iraq. Some Members suggest focusing on reconstruction and policing in cleared areas, while others propose political restructuring with three autonomous regions for Iraq's major communities. The Senate Armed Services Committee discussed the Iraq Study Group's recommendations, including engaging Iraq's neighbors like Iran. The Iraq Study Group recommended engaging Iraq's neighbors, gradually replacing U.S. combat operations with training Iraqi security forces. U.S. military operations in Iraq involve counterinsurgency, training ISF, and special operations against terrorist cells. Future military operations and troop levels are under scrutiny amid escalating violence. The ongoing debate among U.S. military and civilian decision-makers focuses on the appropriate strategy for U.S. troop levels in Iraq. While there is consensus on eventually handing over operations to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), opinions vary on the timing and method. Some argue for a short-term increase in U.S. troops and intensified counterinsurgency operations, while others advocate for a phased drawdown of U.S. troops to encourage the ISF to operate more effectively on their own. Major coalition allies are also considering their military options in Iraq. Many major coalition allies in Iraq, such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, and Japan, are withdrawing their military forces. Over $35.7 billion has been allocated for Iraq's reconstruction, with funds going towards training Iraqi security forces, non-security infrastructure, and economic aid. Congressional concerns include the appropriate strategy for U.S. troop levels in Iraq. The U.S. government is facing concerns about the efficiency of funds allocated for Iraq's reconstruction and the ability of the Iraqi government to sustain infrastructure projects. In Afghanistan, insurgent threats have escalated, raising doubts about the future of U.S. involvement. The political process in Afghanistan has seen significant progress with the adoption of a new constitution and successful elections. Despite newfound personal freedoms and increased participation of women in economic and political life, the insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban has unexpectedly escalated in 2006. The Taliban, previously mostly defeated, have conducted larger scale attacks on coalition and Afghan security forces in southern provinces, hindering reconstruction efforts. Factors contributing to increased violence include slow reconstruction pace, Afghan corruption, narcotics funding, regional faction leaders' influence, Taliban safe havens in Pakistan, and potential inspiration from Al Qaeda. The 110th Congress is expected to monitor U.S. civilian and military actions closely. The 110th Congress is likely to monitor U.S. civilian and military assistance to Afghanistan, focusing on reconstruction efforts to win over the Afghan population. Over $3 billion was appropriated in FY2006 for Afghan stabilization and reconstruction. Measures include strengthening the central government and security forces, deploying NATO-led ISAF for peacekeeping, and running Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) for securing reconstruction. The 110th Congress is likely to monitor U.S. civilian and military assistance to Afghanistan, focusing on reconstruction efforts to win over the Afghan population. Afghan, U.S., and European officials have stated that poppy cultivation and drug trafficking are serious strategic threats to Afghanistan's security and counter-terrorism efforts. Despite international efforts, Afghanistan produced a record opium poppy crop in 2005-2006, supplying 92% of the world's illicit opium. The opium economy is a multibillion-dollar trade that supplies heroin to Europe, Russia, and the United States. Congress has appropriated over $1.9 billion for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Congress has allocated $1.9 billion for counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan and surrounding countries since 2001. Efforts include eradication, interdiction, alternative livelihood assistance, judicial reform, and public awareness activities. Challenges such as insecurity, delays in institution-building, and corruption have hindered full implementation. Legislation requires formal reports on Afghan narcotics trade and U.S. combat efforts. The Defense Authorization Act mandated an updated policy review by December 31, 2006. Foreign Operations programs are funded under a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. The United States has around 22,100 service members in Afghanistan, with 12,000 under NATO command and the rest under U.S. command for counterterrorism operations. Troop reduction plans were in place. The United States planned to reduce its troop presence in Afghanistan, but insurgent operations prevented this. NATO countries, including the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, and the Netherlands, have conducted offensive operations against Taliban insurgents. However, insurgents still have a significant presence in Afghan provinces. NATO countries have placed restrictions on how their troops can be used, necessitating additional forces for combat operations. Progress was made on modifying these restrictions at NATO's Riga Summit in November 2006. At NATO's Riga Summit in November 2006, progress was made on modifying national caveats for NATO forces in Afghanistan. Some argue that aggressive military action against the Afghan drug trade could do more harm than good. U.S. and coalition military officials are against proposals that could turn combat forces into \"drug police.\" The Administration is set to submit the regular Department of Defense budget on February 7, 2007, along with a large FY2007 supplemental request for Iraq, Afghanistan, and global war on terror operations. This request is in addition to the $70 billion already received by DOD. Congress has already appropriated $507 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and enhanced security for DOD since the 9/11 attacks. In early 2007, Congress may address budgetary levers to influence troop levels in Iraq and assess the validity of war cost requests for FY2007 and FY2008. Funding restrictions have been more effective than the War Powers Act in limiting military operations, drawing parallels to the Vietnam experience. Key amendments were enacted or debated to limit U.S. troop strength and funding for combat activities in Vietnam after the January peace accord. The War Powers Act has been challenged by the executive branch on constitutional grounds. Congress is facing challenges in assessing the Administration's war requests due to limited information on costs and troop levels. The Iraq Study Group criticized the lack of clarity in funding requests for Iraq operations. DOD has not provided a breakdown of previously appropriated funds for Iraq, Afghanistan, and counter-terror operations. War funds are mixed with regular funds during execution, making it difficult to track spending and estimate the impact on the deficit. Congressional leaders have pledged to increase oversight of DOD war costs. Congressional leaders have pledged increased scrutiny of DOD war costs, considering extending the scope of the Special Inspector General. The Iraq Study Group calls for including a full year of war costs in DOD's regular budget to avoid circumventing the normal process. DOD's detailed budget justification for FY2007 is uncertain, with service requests for the FY2007 supplemental estimated at $100 billion to $160 billion. The President is likely to request an additional $100 billion for FY2007, making a total of $170 billion, which would be 45% higher than the previous year. If troop levels remain the same, it is unclear why the FY2007 supplemental should be larger than FY2006. If combat troops are withdrawn, war costs are expected to decrease. CBO estimated that war costs would decrease by $11 billion if 25,000 troops were withdrawn and by $17 billion if 60,000 troops were withdrawn. On the other hand, if troop levels were increased, war costs could rise. The funding for training Iraqi security forces has increased to $15.4 billion, with $3.9 billion available for FY2007. There is a proposal to expand U.S. military personnel embedded with Iraqi forces, which may require additional training monies. Deputy Secretary of Defense England issued new guidance on war costs, leading to increased requests from the services. The long war on terror is considered DOD's key mission, raising questions on why such costs are classified as emergency war supplemental spending. The FY2007 war costs may be higher due to current readiness problems and the cost of reset for war-worn equipment. Army and Marine Corps units are facing equipment shortages, affecting their ability to train fully for combat and respond to contingencies. Despite being fully-funded for reset requirements, equipment shortfalls are still a concern. The Army and Marine Corps are fully-funded for reset requirements in FY2007, with maintenance backlogs expected to decrease by up to half. They have received $48.6 billion for reset, including $23.7 billion for FY2007. If troop levels decrease in FY2008, the Army estimates its reset requirements would drop to $10.5 billion. Readiness problems for reserves are due to personnel shortages and concerns about meeting recruitment and retention goals. The FY2008 request for war costs will reflect the Administration's assumptions about troop levels. If troop levels decline, operational and reset costs may also decrease, depending on the pace of withdrawals and redeployment of combat troops. The Iraq Study Group report does not specify troop levels or deployment location, but Congress could ask the Department of Defense to identify cost changes with different troop levels. Terrorism is a global, national, and transnational phenomenon. Understanding terrorist capabilities and motivations is crucial for counterterrorism strategy. The alignment of the Administration's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism with resources is a key concern for Congress. Monitoring the progress of the Administration's efforts is also a focus for Congress. The likely focus of Congressional oversight is on the Administration's efforts to meet counterterrorism mission requirements outlined in key legislation. This includes assessing post-9/11 counterterrorism and intelligence programs, evaluating successes and failures, addressing civil liberty concerns, and monitoring terrorists' use of emerging technologies and materials for weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, measuring success in U.S. counterterrorism policies is a key issue. The focus of U.S. counterterrorism policies includes assessing success, understanding individuals attracted to terrorist cells, and the impact of U.S. foreign policy on international partners. Strategic options and recommendations from various groups may lead to adjustments in global counterterrorism efforts and military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The possibility of international support fragmenting on global terrorism issues is a concern. The Administration may need to adjust military and diplomatic efforts in response to global terrorism issues, especially if insurgent activity in Iraq and Afghanistan escalates into civil war or failed states. This could lead to shifts in U.S. strategy and international partner support, prompting Congress to exercise oversight. The United States has long worked to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction through international treaties. The \"nonproliferation regime\" consists of international treaties, supply controls, and agreements to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The Bush Administration supports policies to prevent proliferation globally, including diplomatic initiatives, economic policies like export controls and sanctions, and military action if necessary. Recent events have highlighted the threat of proliferation, such as the sale of nuclear technology by Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan. The threat of nuclear proliferation was highlighted by A.Q. Khan's sale of sensitive technology to countries like North Korea, Iran, and Libya, leading to intensified inspections and noncompliance resolutions. Responses included stronger export controls, the Proliferation Security Initiative, and proposals for a more proliferation-resistant fuel cycle. The PSI, created in 2003 to disrupt WMD trade, lacks current funding but has support through various bills. The 110th Congress may consider funding activities related to carrying WMD cargo and extending sanctions on Iran under PL 109-293. Legislation may be considered regarding North Korea's nuclear program and efforts to reinvigorate the Six Party Talks. China's diplomatic efforts following North Korea's nuclear test in October 2006 may prompt further action by the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress is likely to closely monitor talks on North Korea's nuclear program and provide funding for U.S. programs addressing WMD proliferation risks. This includes assistance to Russia and former Soviet states to secure WMD materials and efforts to prevent proliferation from countries like North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran. Congress may review funding allocations for these programs and specific projects. The 110th Congress is likely to closely monitor talks on North Korea's nuclear program and provide funding for U.S. programs addressing WMD proliferation risks, including assistance to Russia and former Soviet states. Congress may review funding allocations for these programs and specific projects, as well as the degree of international cooperation and program effectiveness. U.S. relations with China have improved during the George W. Bush Administration, with increased cooperation on various issues including North Korea's nuclear weapons activities. The 110th Congress is expected to focus on U.S.-China trade relations, addressing issues such as the large trade deficit, China's currency policy, intellectual property rights protection, and WTO commitments. The interconnected economies of the U.S. and China have led to increased investment and engagement, reflecting China's economic growth and international influence. The 110th Congress is expected to address U.S.-China trade relations, focusing on issues like the trade deficit, China's currency policy, intellectual property rights protection, and WTO commitments. Bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties against subsidized imports from China and increase import tariffs on Chinese goods. The 110th Congress is likely to continue pursuing similar initiatives. The 110th Congress is expected to address U.S.-China trade relations, focusing on issues like the trade deficit, China's currency policy, intellectual property rights protection, and WTO commitments. Taiwan remains a sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations, with the PRC claiming sovereignty over the island and adopting an \"anti-secession law\" in 2005. This could potentially lead to direct U.S.-PRC conflict under the Taiwan Relations Act. The 110th Congress is expected to address U.S.-China trade relations, focusing on issues like the trade deficit, China's currency policy, intellectual property rights protection, and WTO commitments. U.S. policy on Taiwan is complicated by political gridlock in the Taiwan government, hindering a substantial U.S. arms package authorized for sale in 2001. Congressional sentiment favors Taiwan and may seek to support a Free Trade Agreement with Taiwan. The 110th Congress is likely to focus on U.S.-China trade relations, Taiwan's observer status in the WHO, Taiwan's defense spending, and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Concerns also exist about China's economic growth and expanding political influence globally. China's global relations extend to U.S. allies and regions of U.S. dominance. They participate in international groupings excluding the U.S., like the East Asia Summit. Energy politics are crucial, with significant oil deals with countries considered \"rogue regimes.\" In 2004, Beijing targeted \"bad actors\" like Sudan, Angola, and Venezuela for energy-related development, signing agreements with Venezuela worth over $400 million. China also prioritized energy cooperation with Canada in 2005, focusing on gas, nuclear, clean energy, and oil sources like Alberta's massive \"oil sands.\" The 109th Congress debated the national security risks of selling American energy assets to China, and the 110th Congress is expected to remain active on these issues, possibly considering recommendations made by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in November 2006. The U.S. faces a significant challenge from Iran, fueled by concerns over their nuclear program and President Ahmadinejad's comments. Tensions escalated after Hezbollah's conflict with Israel in 2006. The Bush Administration has focused on containing the threat posed by Iran, particularly regarding their nuclear program. Talks with Iran have stalled, with the U.S. seeking multilateral negotiations if Iran suspends uranium enrichment. The U.N. Security Council referred Iran to the U.N. Security Council in February 2006 due to non-compliance with safeguards obligations under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Resolution 1696 was passed on July 31, 2006, demanding Iran to halt its activities and return to negotiations, hinting at possible sanctions if Iran failed to comply by August 31, 2006. The EU-3, along with Russia and China, have been negotiating with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Despite initial agreement for sanctions in 2006, proposals have had little effect as Iran continues to enhance its uranium enrichment capabilities. The U.S. is also concerned about Iran's support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas in the Near East region. Iran is believed to have ties with Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The U.S. accuses Iran of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, leading to sectarian violence. The 110th Congress is monitoring U.S. policy towards Iran, with some advocating for military action if Iran continues its nuclear program or threats against U.S. interests. Legislation supporting regime change in Iran and extending sanctions was passed in the 109th Congress. H.R. 6198, signed in September 2006, extends sanctions until December 31, 2011, and authorizes funding for promoting democracy in Iran. It also makes exports of weapons of mass destruction to Iran sanctionable. In FY2006, a total of $66.1 million was provided for democracy programs, public diplomacy, cultural exchanges, and broadcasting in Iran. Israel engaged in wars in Gaza and Lebanon in summer 2006 with inconclusive results, leading to ongoing conflicts. The conflict between Israel and Palestine led to a fragile cease-fire agreement in November, with the Quartet demanding Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel. President Abbas's negotiations with Hamas for a unity government have reached a deadlock, as Hamas refuses to meet the Quartet's conditions. Israel seeks to work with Abbas to address the situation. Israel seeks to work with Abbas to establish an independent Palestinian state with territorial contiguity, free Palestinian prisoners, and take confidence-building measures. Meanwhile, Israel launched a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon after an attack and kidnapping incident, resulting in high casualties and infrastructure damage. Hezbollah has not released kidnapped soldiers, is believed to be rearming, and is pressing for a greater role in Lebanese politics, risking democracy and increasing instability near Israel. Syrian President Bashar al-Asad is leveraging Hezbollah's perceived victory to push for a renewed peace process with Israel and the U.S. Syrian President Bashar al-Asad is working with Iraq to urge Israel and Washington for a renewed peace process to regain the Golan Heights. Some in Israel and the international community want to revive peace talks with Syria, while others, including some in the U.S. Administration, prefer to keep Syria isolated until it meets certain conditions. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert also rejects engagement with Syria until it changes its behavior. The U.S. Administration supports Israel in its conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, stating that Israel is exercising its right to self-defense. The US Administration supports Israel in its conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, advocating for Israel's views in international forums. It has provided humanitarian aid to Palestinians through third-party agencies but not directly to the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority. Congress has passed resolutions supporting Israel and condemning Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel remains a top recipient of US foreign aid, with restrictions on aid to the Palestinian Authority. The 110th Congress will likely continue to scrutinize aid to Palestinians and Lebanon. The new Congress may examine recommendations of the Iraq Study Group for a comprehensive peace process in the Middle East, including direct talks with Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians, and Syria. The U.S. goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula faced a setback with North Korea's nuclear test in October 2006, following previous provocations and missile tests. Since November 2005, North Korea has boycotted the Six-Party Talks, demanding an end to financial measures and pressure from the United States. China and South Korea, North Korea's major trade partners, have not significantly changed their approach despite condemning North Korea's missile tests in July 2006. North Korea's nuclear test has raised concerns about a more potent nuclear threat, a potential arms race in Asia, and the transfer of nuclear weapons to hostile states or groups. The global nonproliferation regime is also at risk, along with ongoing human rights issues and law enforcement concerns. With diplomatic efforts stalled and limited military options, these challenges are unlikely to be quickly resolved. In 2006, Congress passed legislation related to North Korea, requiring the appointment of a Policy Coordinator and regular reports on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Congress' role in North Korean policy will depend on the Administration's response to these requirements. The North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 2006 added North Korea to the Iran-Syria Nonproliferation Act. The 110th Congress inherits unfinished work from its predecessor, including annual appropriations measures for funding the U.S. government. Sanctions on third parties for weapons-of-mass-destruction-related transfers to and from North Korea, particularly affecting North Korea's missile trade, have been authorized. The 110th Congress is set to pass an emergency spending measure for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Incoming Congressional leadership plans a vigorous first 100 legislative hours focusing on oversight of the war in Iraq and counter-terrorism efforts. They will also implement recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and the Iraq Study Group. The Executive Branch will introduce new global issues initiatives challenging the Congress. In January 2006, the Secretary of State announced organizational changes in diplomatic and foreign assistance services, including Transformational Diplomacy and Transformational Development initiatives. Global issues for the 110th Congress include United Nations reform, humanitarian crises like Darfur, terrorist threats, and health disasters such as avian flu, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Congress will address funding and authorizing for these issues. The 110th Congress will have opportunities to address global issues such as United Nations reform, humanitarian crises, terrorist threats, and health disasters like avian flu, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice introduced Transformational Diplomacy in 2006, focusing on building democratic, well-governed states and helping others improve their lives and nations. Transformational Diplomacy involves relocating State Department personnel to key regions in Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East to enhance U.S. diplomacy effectiveness. This includes establishing regional public diplomacy centers and American presence posts operated by a single diplomat in key population centers. Diplomats will receive training in public diplomacy skills and be encouraged to promote democratic principles. Funding and oversight issues will be addressed by the 110th Congress when the President's budget is submitted in early February 2007. The President's FY2008 budget may require increased funding for global repositioning of State Department personnel. The 110th Congress may hold early hearings with Secretary Rice to assess the effectiveness of the Transformational Diplomacy initiative and its impact on democracy promotion. Foreign aid has gained importance in U.S. foreign policy post-9/11, with a focus on addressing failing states as permissive environments for terrorism. The Administration has prioritized global development as a key component of its National Security Strategy, alongside defense and diplomacy. Initiatives such as the Transformational Development initiative, led by Randall Tobias, aim to restructure foreign aid programs to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives. Randall Tobias has been charged with restructuring aid programs to align with U.S. foreign policy goals. He has created a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to guide budgeting and ensure programs meet strategic objectives. The FY2008 budget request for foreign aid, based on this Framework, will be presented to Congress. Congress will assess the impact on program and country funding, potentially through an authorization bill or appropriations process. President Bush previously launched two major initiatives in global development. President Bush launched major foreign assistance programs including PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge Account. He also initiated a malaria initiative with significant funding. Lawmakers in the 110th Congress face challenges in sustaining aid pledges and responding to unforeseen foreign policy contingencies and natural disasters. In the 110th Congress, lawmakers are facing challenges in foreign assistance due to tight budgets and pressure from humanitarian and security emergencies like Darfur. Congress has made sharp cuts in foreign aid spending in recent years, and efforts to prioritize resources and find savings will be a focus early in the Congress. The need to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities to combat international terrorism is a major factor driving foreign aid policy. The 109th Congress supported the Bush Administration's initiatives to enhance U.S. and international capabilities for security, governance, and economic development in conflict and post-conflict situations. The Administration is expected to seek continued support from the 110th Congress for these activities, including potential expansions and new initiatives. The creation of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) in 2004 has been a key focus of these efforts. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) was established in 2004 to monitor and coordinate civilian efforts in crisis states. The Administration is expected to request funding from the 110th Congress to expand S/CRS capabilities, including a proposal for a civilian S&R reserve force. There may also be a request to reconsider previous decisions denying State Department funding for a Conflict Response Fund to support S/CRS' overseas activities. The Secretary of Defense was granted $100 million in transfer authority for S&R purposes in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. The Administration may seek approval for new initiatives on inter-agency cooperation in line with NSPD 44. DOD and key Members of Congress are advocating for the development of civilian capabilities for activities like political institution building and humanitarian aid. The Administration may request Congress to enhance military search and rescue capabilities in line with the 2005 DOD Directive 3000.05. Analysts suggest that civilians should handle activities like political institution building and humanitarian aid to relieve military forces. The development of civilian capabilities is crucial to improve search and rescue performance. Congress may also need to address issues related to State Department sponsored-DOD implemented operations. Issues may arise regarding the scope and management of the State Department sponsored-DOD implemented Global Peace Operations Initiative. The United States trains and equips foreign military forces for international peacekeeping operations. Congress may need to address budget priorities and levels for humanitarian assistance in the 110th Congress. The key policy issues for Congress focus on budget priorities, funding levels, and types of worldwide support for humanitarian assistance. Congress supports humanitarian efforts to respond quickly to crises, provide relief, and promote a U.S. presence. Factors influencing decisions include the type of assistance needed, impact of conflict and refugee flows on regional stability, and contributions from neighboring countries and the international community. The role of neighboring countries and the international community in providing relief efforts is crucial. Funding for emergency humanitarian assistance is authorized by Congress. International recovery efforts involve various actors such as U.N. agencies, NGOs, and donors. Coordination of assistance and donor fatigue are key concerns for Congress, impacting funding and support levels. The Darfur, Sudan situation is considered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with millions displaced and over 220,000 refugees in Chad. The United States provided $776.3 million in humanitarian assistance in FY2006. The United States provided $776.3 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan and Eastern Chad in FY2006 and $190.4 million for FY2007. Concerns exist about tens of thousands of North Koreans living illegally in China, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 refugees. China views them as economic migrants, not political refugees, and has forcibly returned some to North Korea where human rights violations are reported. The United Nations has not been granted access to assess the situation, but some foreign NGOs have been allowed. Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 in response to this issue. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-333) was passed by Congress in response to concerns about North Korean refugees in China. The civil-military relationship in post-emergency transitions and reconstruction, particularly in Iraq, is still evolving, with aid worker security remaining a significant concern. Disaster assistance is often provided through NGOs using foreign assistance funds, but violence in some areas has led to the suspension of activities or withdrawal of aid agencies. The military's role in post-emergency transitions and reconstruction is evolving, with ongoing controversies over the use of Department of Defense funds and personnel. Congress is expected to address global health issues in the 110th Congress, including appropriations for health programs, reauthorization of PEPFAR, and strengthening health systems in developing countries to combat infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Over 65 million people have contracted HIV since 1981, with more than 25 million deaths from AIDS, and over 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. In 2005, over 4 million people were newly infected with HIV/AIDS, with more than 40 million living with the disease worldwide. There are about 300 million malaria cases annually, causing over one million deaths, mostly in Africa. Asia and Africa have over 80% of the 14 million TB cases globally. Various appropriations bills for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are pending, with funding amounts slightly below requests. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act authorized $15 billion from FY2004 to FY2008 for fighting HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Some advocates want more funding. P.L. 108-25 also authorizes $1 billion for the Global Fund through FY2008, but appropriators have exceeded that by over $500 million. Members introduced legislation to amend the act, which reserves 33% of prevention funds for abstinence programs. Some analysts urge Congress to increase spending on prevention strategies like preventing HIV transmission from mother to child and expanding PEPFAR Focus Countries to regions with rapidly spreading virus. Many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, face health system challenges due to shortages of medical personnel. Global health experts warn that the influx of funds for HIV/AIDS initiatives is draining in-country resources and health workers. The influx of funds for HIV/AIDS initiatives is pulling in-country resources and health workers away from government-run health clinics to foreign-funded programs, exacerbating the health worker shortage. Proponents argue for increased investment in public health systems to address global health challenges like avian influenza and bioterrorism, which require enhanced global cooperation and containment efforts. The curr_chunk discusses various issues for policy makers, including health data reporting, pandemic preparedness, managing public fear, coordinating responses to infectious disease outbreaks, and overcoming resource challenges. It also mentions the attention drawn to United Nations reform by Congress and the executive branch. The 110th Congress is addressing issues related to U.N. reform, including management, programmatic, and structural reforms. Some reforms are still being considered, while others are in various stages of implementation. Ban Ki-Moon has replaced Kofi Annan as Secretary-General and has stated that U.N. reform will remain a priority during his tenure. Ban has stated that U.N. reform will remain a priority during his tenure as Secretary General. The appointment of a new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations may impact U.S. policy and ongoing U.N. reform efforts. The U.S. has been actively involved in U.N. reform, advocating for strengthening internal oversight, improving human rights mechanisms, and increasing fiscal discipline. Concerns such as the U.N. oil-for-food program and sexual exploitation have contributed to current reform efforts. The United States maintains economic sanctions on various countries, individuals, or entities for foreign policy or national security goals. U.S. interest in U.N. reform remains strong, focusing on improving oversight, human rights mechanisms, and fiscal discipline. Issues like the oil-for-food program and sexual exploitation have fueled current reform efforts. The United States enforces economic sanctions on countries supporting terrorism, restricts arms trade with certain nations, limits foreign aid to specific states, and imposes trade restrictions on individuals identified as threats. The United States enforces economic sanctions on individuals involved in narcotics trafficking, terrorism, disrupting peace processes, weapons proliferation, conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and diamond trafficking. Congress has struggled to balance foreign policy and national security concerns, focusing on human rights, proliferation, counter-terrorism, and democracy promotion measures, especially after September 11, 2001. The United States enforces economic sanctions on individuals involved in various illegal activities. Congress focuses on human rights, proliferation, counter-terrorism, and democracy promotion measures, especially after September 11, 2001. Sanctions have become more pragmatic and less absolute, with some countries being recognized as vital allies in the war on terrorism. The Administration reports annually to Congress on various issues that could lead to the imposition of economic sanctions on countries with objectionable practices. The 110th Congress faces new legislative requirements to restrict trade, aid, or transactions with states exhibiting objectionable behavior. Recent events such as the Six Party talks with North Korea, Iran's nuclear ambitions, the crisis in Darfur, and potential leadership changes in Cuba, Belarus, Libya, Syria, Iran, the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, and Iraq may lead to the imposition of new economic sanctions. The 110th Congress may address U.S. policy priorities in Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on promoting peace, security, counter-terrorism, military cooperation, assistance efforts, democratic governance, human rights, and trade. Relations with the African Union will likely emphasize peacekeeping cooperation and crisis mediation. The 110th Congress may focus on peacekeeping cooperation, crisis mediation, and U.S. support for AU capacity building. U.S. efforts to promote peace and security in Africa will remain prominent, with a new U.S. ambassador to the African Union and the anticipated opening of an AU mission in Washington, DC. Peace and security concerns will center on diplomatic, policy, and logistical assistance initiatives to mediate political and military crises in various countries. Darfur crisis resolution and Sudan's north-south Comprehensive Peace Agreement implementation will be key issues for Congress. The 110th Congress may focus on peacekeeping cooperation, crisis mediation, and U.S. support for AU capacity building. Peace and security concerns will likely focus on military-political crises in various African countries, including U.S. policy responses and assistance programs. Congressional attention will be on U.S. military cooperation with African countries, counter-terrorism initiatives, and efforts to further U.S. security goals in the region. The role of U.S. assistance in Africa will continue to be a focus of policymaking attention, with key issues including aid for economic growth, education, public health, food security, democratization, and civil society strengthening. Support for countering HIV/AIDS will remain prominent. Congress may assess the implications of the Administration's foreign assistance strategy reformulation for Africa and compare it with the roles of USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Trade, market-driven economic growth, and related goals in U.S.-Africa relations will also be important. The 110th Congress is likely to focus on U.S.-Africa trade, economic growth, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). There may be consideration of a U.S.-Southern African Customs Union free trade agreement. China's economic role in Africa, Africa's oil exports to the U.S., and efforts to promote governance and human rights in Africa will also be of interest. Congressional attention will continue on political repression in Zimbabwe. The 110th Congress may focus on U.S.-Africa trade, economic growth, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). There could be consideration of a U.S.-Southern African Customs Union free trade agreement. Congressional attention will continue on political repression in Zimbabwe, with concerns about governance and economic collapse. President Robert Mugabe's controversial policies have contributed to the country's crisis. In July 2004, atrocities in Darfur were declared genocide, and in May 2006, the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed after two years of negotiations. The Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) was signed after almost two years of negotiations to address the crisis in Sudan that began in 2003. The security situation has worsened since the agreement, with ongoing violence between the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and Sudan Armed Forces in South Sudan. Implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement by the Government of Sudan has been slow and selective, according to United Nations officials and observers. The crisis in Sudan continues to be of interest to Congress. President Bush signed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act in 2006, imposing sanctions on Sudan. CRS will focus on humanitarian and political aspects of the crisis in Darfur. In Somalia, the Islamic Courts Union captured Mogadishu in June 2006, leading to negotiations with the Transitional Federal Government. U.S. officials have expressed concern about the situation. The political crisis and humanitarian emergency in Somalia, along with concerns about terrorist presence in East Africa, remain unresolved. Africa is heavily impacted by AIDS, with over 11% of the global population but 63% of infected individuals. Southern Africa has infection rates as high as 33.4%. Policy makers may consider diverse issues related to funding and allocating U.S. AIDS funding for Africa, including challenges recipient countries face in efficiently absorbing foreign assistance. Some advocate for increased funding due to the severity of the pandemic in Africa. Other funding issues include the reauthorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, anti-retroviral drug treatment efforts, and the balance between treatment and prevention in anti-AIDS programs. For the 110th Congress, Asia presents critical policy choices regarding security, economic relationships, and values projection. Asian countries have focused on economic development and military modernization, impacting regional dynamics. Asia's focus on economic development and military modernization has led to more independent governments in the region. Challenges exist in flashpoints like the Taiwan Strait, Korean Peninsula, and India-Pakistan border, as well as terrorist activity in various countries. Despite potential disruptions, Asia has been relatively stable in recent years, with most nations undergoing significant changes without resorting to open warfare or regressive governance. The long-term trends in Asia include the rise of China, military buildup, declining favorable attitudes towards the United States, rising nationalism, growing U.S. strategic relationship with India, and cooperation with Pakistan in countering threats like al Qaeda. The long-term trends in Asia include the rise of China, military buildup, declining favorable attitudes towards the United States, rising nationalism, growing U.S. strategic relationship with India, and cooperation with Pakistan in countering al Qaeda and potential instability. Additionally, there is a need for the United States to realign its military forces, a scramble for natural resources, globalization and trade leading to outsourcing of jobs, expanding industrial production networks creating interdependency among economies, and a developing network of regional free trade and security arrangements in East Asia. The 110th Congress faces issues such as foreign assistance funding for anti-terror campaigns, trade agreements with various countries, Chinese currency valuation, U.S.-India nuclear cooperation, North Korea's nuclear program, human rights in Burma and North Korea, war on terrorism, rising power of China, cross-strait tensions between Taiwan and China, and the formation of an Asian trading bloc. Under the Bush Administration, U.S.-Japan ties have strengthened, with a focus on confronting North Korea's nuclear program and Japan's involvement in U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2002, U.S.-Japan bilateral initiatives have emphasized security cooperation, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reaffirming commitment to common strategic objectives. Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in 2006, he has worked to repair Japan's relationships with South Korea and China, reaffirming commitment to the U.S. alliance. Congressional interest in U.S.-Japan relations is driven by security and economic concerns. Issues between the U.S. and South Korea have caused divisions since 2000, leading to difficult negotiations between Seoul and Washington. Negotiations between the United States and South Korea over a Free Trade Agreement will be a key focus for the 110th Congress. The talks involve issues like access for U.S. rice, autos, and pharmaceuticals in South Korea, as well as U.S. restrictions on South Korean textiles and anti-dumping regulations. A deal must be reached before July 1, 2007, when President Bush's trade promotion authority expires. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expires on July 1, 2007, requiring an agreement to be signed before that date for expedited Congressional consideration. The Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) must be completed before April 2, 2007, due to the 90-day presidential notification requirement. Policies towards North Korea differ, with South Korea's \"sunshine policy\" focusing on reconciliation and cooperation, while the Bush Administration seeks to end North Korea's nuclear capabilities. These differences have been evident in the six-party nuclear negotiations with North Korea. The Bush Administration has a negative attitude towards sanctions on North Korea imposed in 2005 and 2006. There are divisions between the U.S. and South Korea over the sanctions issue, leading to criticism of South Korea in Congress and the media. Changes in the U.S.-R.O.K. military alliance have occurred since 2002 due to anti-American sentiment in South Korea. Successful negotiations have taken place between the Pentagon and R.O.K. Defense Ministry regarding U.S. military presence in South Korea. Negotiations are ongoing for the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces and the relocation of U.S. forces to new bases in South Korea. Plans are in place for dismantling the U.S.-R.O.K. Combined Forces Command. South Korea has sent over 2,000 troops to Iraq. Future issues include the withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces after September 2008, implementing command restructuring, South Korea's right to veto the use of U.S. forces in other crises in Northeast Asia, and its role in the fight against Islamic terrorism. India, as the region's dominant actor, is seen as a potential counterweight to China's influence and a \"natural partner\" of the United States. The strategic partnership between Washington and New Delhi includes counterterrorism cooperation, military exercises, high-technology trade, and civilian nuclear energy cooperation. This initiative, launched in 2005, would reverse U.S. nonproliferation policy and require a peaceful nuclear agreement between the two countries. The United States and India are working towards a peaceful nuclear agreement, pending approval by Congress. The growing Indian-American community's influence is evident in Congress, with a focus on regional stability, including encouraging peace between India and Pakistan. Congress also addresses human rights abuses, trade issues, and HIV/AIDS spread in India. The United States has a significant interest in Pakistan due to issues such as terrorism, WMD proliferation, and democratization. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan changed after 9/11, with Pakistan becoming a key ally in counterterrorism efforts. Congress and President Bush lifted sanctions on Pakistan and provided large-scale assistance in 2001. Islamist influences also play a role in the region. The U.S. resumed large-scale assistance to Pakistan in late 2001. Islamist political parties and militant groups complicate policymaking. Efforts to pacify the tribal areas have had little success, with the emergence of a \"Pakistani Taliban\" posing a threat to U.S. interests. The proliferation of nuclear materials by A.Q. Khan's network in 2004 raised concerns about Pakistani military and government complicity. Islamabad has refused access to Khan, and questions about military control over secular parties persist. Pakistan's government has marginalized secular political parties and consolidated power, with a poor human rights record. The country receives significant U.S. aid, including security assistance and reimbursement for counterterrorism support. Pakistan seeks a Bilateral Investment Treaty and Reconstruction Opportunity Zones with the U.S. Major arms sales may be discussed in Congress. The 110th Congress may address major U.S. arms sales to Pakistan. In South Asia, Nepal's civil war is showing signs of ending with a peace accord in 2006. An election in June 2007 aims to revise the constitution and decide the fate of the monarchy. U.N. monitors are overseeing peace arrangements between Maoist rebels and Nepal Army forces. In Sri Lanka, a 23-year-old civil war has reignited, threatening a fragile cease-fire agreement from 2002. In Sri Lanka, a civil war has reignited, with heavy fighting between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2006. The United States designated the Tigers as a terrorist group in 1997 and has cooperated with other countries to revive the peace process. Meanwhile, Bangladesh faces political instability, Islamist extremist violence, and corruption. Key U.S. challenges and interests in the region include addressing arms sales to Pakistan and monitoring Nepal's peace accord and upcoming elections. Key U.S. challenges in Southeast Asia include fighting terrorism, responding to China's influence, gaining leverage over Burma, and promoting trade. The 110th Congress will oversee U.S.-backed counter-terrorism programs in the region, focusing on reducing the threat of large-scale attacks by groups like Jemaah Islamiyah. Cooperative activities include intelligence sharing and joint military exercises in the Philippines and Indonesia. In 2007, Congress will focus on enhancing military ties with Indonesia after lifting U.S. sanctions in 2005. China has increased aid, trade, and diplomatic presence in Southeast Asia, potentially cultivating security relationships. Some Southeast Asian leaders feel the U.S. has neglected the region, but attention has expanded to include negotiations for Free Trade Agreements with Thailand and Malaysia. In 2004, Singapore was put into effect, PNTR status for Vietnam was considered, and a TIFA was signed with ASEAN in 2006. U.S. regional and bilateral foreign assistance programs address issues like terrorism, trade, democracy, human rights, and infectious diseases. Assistance aims to tackle conditions contributing to radical ideologies and terrorism, such as poverty, lack of education, and political disenfranchisement. The 110th Congress faces challenges in Burma's deteriorating political and human rights situation. In 2006, Burma and Laos received a Tier 3 ranking on the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, leading to the denial of non-humanitarian aid. Laos, the Philippines, and Thailand receive bilateral assistance for counter-narcotics programs, while Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam receive aid for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Transatlantic relations and developments in Europe and Eurasia will remain of interest in the 110th Congress. The transatlantic agenda between Europe and the U.S. involves various policy concerns like NATO operations in Afghanistan, counter-terrorism efforts, non-proliferation strategies, and trade relations. Despite some differences in priorities, there is ongoing cooperation on issues like the Palestinian-Israeli peace process and Iraq. Europe is currently in a period of introspection which impacts its integration project and capabilities. Stalled EU reforms may hinder further enlargement post-2007 entry of Romania and Bulgaria. Turkey's EU membership is contentious. New leadership replacing lame duck governments in key European countries soon. Transatlantic issues for 110th Congress: NATO in Afghanistan, Kosovo status, and Russia relations. NATO's Afghan engagement is its largest operation. Kosovo's status may see resolution in early 2007. Russia poses opportunities and challenges for Europe and the U.S. Russia presents opportunities and challenges for Europe and the United States, especially regarding its policies towards neighboring states and influence as an energy source. NATO's ISAF mission in Afghanistan aims to stabilize the country, battle the Taliban insurgency, and support reconstruction efforts. The Afghan government, with NATO's assistance, is working to improve governance and combat the thriving heroin industry. This mission tests NATO's political will and military capabilities in a country lacking coherent governing authority. NATO forces in Afghanistan face challenges due to national caveats and distance from home countries. Disputes over troop restrictions persist, with casualties reported. Efforts at the Riga summit in 2006 reduced but did not eliminate caveats. Congress likely to hold hearings on Afghanistan stabilization, heroin trade, and NATO's mission. US and Russia cooperate on combating global terrorism. The paramount security threat is fueled by Islamic extremism and exacerbated by the danger of WMD proliferation. Possible major bilateral energy cooperation based on Russia's oil and gas production is a key factor. Tensions include U.S. concerns about anti-democratic trends under President Putin, Russian interference in neighboring countries, and Russia's nuclear power reactor construction in Iran. The Bush Administration emphasizes cooperation with Russia while downplaying areas of tension. The 110th Congress is likely to address Cooperative Threat Reduction programs and foreign aid to Russia, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, and Russian accession to the WTO. Congress will also oversee U.S. policy towards Russia, focusing on domestic political developments and relations with neighbors. The United States has provided aid and troops to the Balkans to maintain stability, but support has decreased as other foreign policy priorities have emerged. Kosovo remains a challenging issue, with talks between Kosovo and Serbia making little progress on the issue of independence. U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari is expected to propose a solution after Serbia's parliamentary elections in January 2007. After Serbia's January 21, 2007 parliamentary elections, there is anticipation for a solution to Kosovo's independence issue, potentially with U.N. oversight being terminated and a limited EU and U.S. role established. A U.N. Security Council resolution may endorse these recommendations, with around 1,700 U.S. troops in Kosovo expected to remain until the status issue is resolved. Legislation in the 110th Congress may address the status issue and potential early U.S. recognition of Kosovo's independence. The 110th Congress may focus on legislative and oversight attention to Latin America and the Caribbean, including counternarcotics efforts in the Andean region, immigration reform, border security, threats to democracy in Venezuela, and the rise of populism in Latin America. Calls for early U.S. recognition of Kosovo's independence are being debated, with supporters advocating for self-determination for ethnic Albanians in the province, while opponents warn of potential destabilization in the region. Latin America has seen progress in democratic and economic development with U.S. support, but challenges remain such as persistent poverty in Haiti and the rise of populism in countries like Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The U.S. has focused on counternarcotics efforts in the Andean region, particularly through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative aimed at eradicating illicit drug production. Trade issues, including free trade agreements, and debates on fostering political change in Communist Cuba are also key topics in U.S. relations with Latin America. Challenges in Latin America, including terrorist threats, trafficking, gang violence, and HIV/AIDS, will continue to be of interest to the 110th Congress. Trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, and Panama may be affected by the new political makeup of Congress and the expiration of fast track Trade Promotion Authority in July 2007. In the 110th Congress, U.S. policy towards Cuba will focus on supporting political and economic change in the Communist nation, especially with Fidel Castro's temporary departure due to health conditions. The policy includes economic sanctions and support for the Cuban people through humanitarian aid and democracy promotion projects. The Bush Administration has tightened economic sanctions in recent years. The Bush Administration has tightened economic sanctions on Cuba, including restrictions on travel and humanitarian assistance. There are differing opinions in Congress on how to approach U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others suggest lifting sanctions incrementally in response to positive changes in Cuba. Congress continues to show high interest in Cuba. Congress has shown continued interest in Cuba with various legislative initiatives regarding sanctions and human rights. Despite some attempts to ease sanctions, provisions have been removed from final measures due to President Bush's threat of veto. The debate on Cuba policy is expected to continue in the 110th Congress, with potential oversight of U.S. democracy promotion efforts in Cuba. U.S. assistance to Colombia is also likely to be a key issue for Congress. U.S. assistance to Colombia is a significant issue for the 110th Congress, with Colombia being a top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) supports Plan Colombia, aimed at combating internal armed conflict and drug trafficking. Colombia produces a large percentage of the world's cocaine, with leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries heavily involved in the drug trade. Funding for ACI has totaled over $5 billion from FY2000 to FY2006. The 110th Congress is considering U.S. assistance to Colombia, focusing on concerns about human rights abuses, counterterrorism efforts, aerial fumigation of drug crops, alternative development, risk to U.S. personnel, paramilitary demobilization, and the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The 110th Congress is considering U.S. assistance to Colombia, focusing on concerns about human rights abuses, counterterrorism efforts, aerial fumigation of drug crops, alternative development, risk to U.S. personnel, paramilitary demobilization, and the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The agreement aims to increase U.S. exports to Colombia and eliminate tariffs within ten years, with controversial labor and sugar provisions. Critics fear weakened worker rights and adverse effects on U.S. sugar producers due to increased sugar imports from Colombia. Colombia's trade preferences under the Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act are set to expire on June 30, 2007. The Haitian government and international donors are working on an interim assistance strategy to address various needs. They aim to boost public confidence with short-term projects while also focusing on long-term development plans to improve living conditions and government institutions. Donors are collaborating with the government to develop a poverty reduction plan and ensure transparency in fund allocation. The 109th Congress passed a special trade preferences bill for Haiti in 2006. The HOPE Act of 2006, included in H.R. 6111, aims to create jobs in Haiti but faces opposition from some U.S. textile interests. The incoming Senate Finance Committee Chairman plans to hold a hearing before the act goes into effect. The 110th Congress will also consider support for security measures in Haiti, including disarmament programs and police reform. The Administration has partially lifted the arms embargo. The Administration partially lifted the 15-year-old arms embargo against Haiti to allow arms and equipment to Haitian security units. Some Members have expressed concern about doing so before the Haitian police force has been vetted for those accused of human rights violations or other crimes. President Rene Preval has asked for U.S. support for public works projects and urged the U.S. Congress to approve legislation providing preferential trade treatment to Haiti. Immigration and border security matters are likely to dominate U.S. interest in Mexico in 2007. In 2007, U.S. interest in Mexico is focused on immigration reform, particularly the approval of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 to build a border fence. The 109th Congress considered immigration reform measures but faced challenges in resolving key differences between House and Senate provisions. President Bush supports comprehensive immigration reform with increased border security and a guest worker program. The 110th Congress is focused on comprehensive immigration reform, border security, and trade issues with Mexico. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n opposes the border fence and emphasizes economic development to reduce illegal migration. Drug cartel violence in Mexico is a concern, with President Calder\u00f3n stating it threatens the Mexican state. Trade issues, including NAFTA and the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, are also important. Resolution of trade disputes, including Mexican trucks access to U.S. highways and sugar imports, has been a concern. Relations with Venezuela have deteriorated under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, with declining cooperation on anti-drug efforts and concerns about democratic institutions. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, elected in 1998, survived a recall effort in 2004, and was re-elected in 2006. Concerns include his military arms purchases, relations with Cuba and Iran, and efforts to spread populism in Latin America. Tensions in bilateral relations were exacerbated by comments in 2006. The U.S. faces a dilemma in pressing for democratic principles without taking sides in Venezuela's political environment. Despite frictions, Venezuela remains a major supplier of oil to the U.S. Venezuela, a major supplier of oil to the United States, has faced tensions in bilateral relations due to President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's actions. The 110th Congress is likely to focus on oversight hearings on conditions in Venezuela, energy security, and U.S. policy, with legislative initiatives targeting funding for democracy and anti-drug efforts, human rights, and energy security. The Middle East remains a major concern for the 110th Congress due to international terrorism, weapons proliferation, and ongoing conflicts. In Iraq, a civil war between Sunni and Shiite factions complicates efforts for a unified state, while Iran's nuclear ambitions and interference in Iraq and Lebanon raise U.S. worries. Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts have stalled since Hamas' electoral victory in 2006. The hard-line Palestinian faction Hamas won a majority in Palestinian parliamentary elections. The US and Israel refuse to engage with a Hamas-led regime until it recognizes Israel, renounces terrorism, and accepts previous agreements. A border war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon added to regional instability. The 110th Congress will play an active role in monitoring US military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a focus on funding for these conflicts. The 110th Congress is likely to closely scrutinize conflicts, including recommendations from the Iraq Study Group co-chaired by James A. Baker, III and Lee Hamilton. The Group's recommendations involve diplomatic efforts to end the war and engage with countries like Iran and Syria. Congress may support dealings with moderate regional states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt, but may oppose dialogue with Iran or Syria. Relations between the United States and Syria are affected by various bilateral issues, including Syria's opposition to U.S. military operations in Iraq, its desire for hegemony in Lebanon, connections to Palestinian terrorist groups, possible pursuit of arms proliferation, and obstruction of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. U.S. legislative provisions and executive directives restrict aid and trade with Syria due to its designation as a sponsor of international terrorism. The U.S. government has demanded that Syria withdraw from Lebanon, stop supporting insurgents in Iraq, and end connections to Palestinian rejectionist groups. Relations between the United States and Syria are strained due to various issues, including Syria's support for insurgents in Iraq and connections to Palestinian terrorist groups. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Syria, such as the Syria Accountability Act, to pressure them to align with U.S. objectives. Syria's dominant role in Lebanon is a key concern for the U.S. The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005 led to Syria's military withdrawal from Lebanon, free elections, and the appointment of an anti-Syrian prime minister. However, pro-Syrian factions still held power, and Hezbollah's influence grew after the 2006 war with Israel. In the aftermath of the 2006 war with Israel, tensions in Lebanon escalated as Hezbollah and its allies demanded the dissolution of the Siniora cabinet and the establishment of a \"government of national unity.\" This government would give Hezbollah significant ministerial power, leading to a standoff with the international community over the establishment of an international tribunal to try suspects in the Hariri assassination. Congress has shown ongoing interest in Lebanon's political developments. Congress has shown considerable interest in Lebanon, especially regarding Syrian influence and the security of Israel. They condemned the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri and supported Israel during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Future Congressional attitudes towards Lebanon may be influenced by Hezbollah's efforts to increase their influence, particularly if it threatens Israel. Some Members of Congress are inclined to enhance Lebanon's internal capabilities. The 110th Congress may consider increasing economic support and foreign military aid to Lebanon to enhance its stability. U.S. aid to the Middle East focuses on countries like Israel and Egypt, but recent efforts also support regional security and economic reforms. The 110th Congress may address potential policy issues regarding U.S. assistance to Egypt, with some lawmakers questioning the effectiveness of aid in promoting reform. There have been failed attempts to cut Egypt's aid in previous foreign operations appropriations bills. The 110th Congress may address aid to the Palestinians, with the U.S. halting most aid to the Hamas-led government and focusing on humanitarian assistance and democracy promotion. The House passed S. 2370 in the 109th Congress regarding Palestinian aid. The Senate version of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 was passed, barring aid to the Hamas-led Palestinian government unless it acknowledges Israel's right to exist and adheres to international agreements. The act exempts humanitarian aid and democracy promotion, providing $20 million for a fund promoting Palestinian democracy and Israeli-Palestinian peace. The House version of the bill was more stringent, and the FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill includes no appropriation for Economic Support Fund programs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Senate version of H.R. 5522 recommends appropriating $25 million for ESF programs in the West Bank and Gaza, with funds channeled through international organizations or NGOs. The continuing appropriations resolution provides funding at the FY2006 or House-passed FY2007 level. Developments in Iraq have implications for the broader Middle East. Iraq's neighbors play a significant role in affecting conditions in Iraq and have security implications for the broader Middle East. Concerns include Iranian support for Iraqi Shiite groups and Turkish worries about Kurdish issues in northern Iraq. Regional responses to potential developments in Iraq, such as sectarian violence or U.S. military presence, will impact policy decisions for the 110th Congress. The apprehension in northern Iraq's Kurdish population and potential bid for independence, along with Sunni Arab states' concerns about Iraq's minority Sunni population, are key regional issues. Longer-term concerns include Iraq's reintegration into the global economy and regional security challenges affecting U.S. policy efforts in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group report emphasizes the need to address regional crises comprehensively, including the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional instability. Relations with Iraq's neighbors, especially Iran and Syria, pose challenges for the United States. Congress can review the Quadrennial Defense Review to assess current U.S. defense strategy and force planning. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in February 2006 was the first reassessment of U.S. military requirements post-9/11 attacks. It identified four types of threats: traditional, unconventional (terrorism and guerrilla operations), catastrophic (weapons of mass destruction), and disruptive attacks (cyber-warfare). The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in February 2006 assessed military threats facing the U.S., including cyber-warfare and biotechnology. Congress can evaluate the Bush Administration's plans for U.S. forces in response to contemporary security challenges. The active-duty force and structure decreased after the Cold War, but the downsized force was still effective against Iraqi forces in 1991. The February 2006 QDR aimed to reconceptualize the national security threat environment post-Cold War, focusing on transforming U.S. forces into smaller, more agile units for quicker deployment. The 2006 QDR aimed to reshape national security strategy post-Cold War, emphasizing agility and stability in conflict resolution. It endorsed organizational changes like the Army's modularity plan and Navy's Fleet Response Plan. Program initiatives included increasing Special Operations Forces by 15% and developing defenses against bio-weapons. Target date for force readiness was accelerated to 2018. The 2006 QDR aimed to reshape national security strategy post-Cold War, emphasizing agility and stability in conflict resolution. It endorsed organizational changes like the Army's modularity plan and Navy's Fleet Response Plan. Program initiatives included increasing Special Operations Forces by 15% and developing defenses against tailored bio-weapons; and an acceleration by nearly 20 years\u2014to 2018\u2014of the target date for fielding a new, long-range strike weapon that could supplant aging bombers. However, this QDR raises some challenging questions about whether the Administration is budgeting adequately for the very diverse capabilities that would be needed to carry out its ambitious repertory of tasks. The Defense Department may need to reconsider expensive weapons programs like the Army's Future Combat Systems, the Navy's DD(X), and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter due to budget constraints. Congress will face challenges in funding defense programs, including the regular FY2008 defense budget request of $490 billion. The FY2008 defense budget request is expected to total $490 billion or more, with additional costs for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress approved $70 billion for FY2007, but more funding will be requested. Controversy may arise over compliance with the McCain amendment requiring a full estimate of FY2008 costs for Iraq and Afghanistan. Senator McCain and other senior Members of the defense committees are pushing for full-year funding estimates for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress may provide funding despite the lack of estimates from the Defense Department. There is also anticipation of a large request for additional emergency funding in FY2007 and FY2008 to cover costs and equipment/personnel shortfalls related to the operations. The Army and other services are facing long-term shortfalls in equipment, personnel, and funding due to the ongoing \"long war\" against global terrorism. These include the need for more force protection, transport, communications equipment, and personnel for specific missions. It is challenging to address these additional requests within the regular defense budget, as revealed by the Iraq war. The Defense Department is expected to request large amounts of money from emergency accounts to avoid constraints on regular spending, causing concern among budget analysts. Congress has been supportive of adding funds for military equipment shortages, especially for the war efforts. Members of Congress have also raised concerns about reported shortfalls in training equipment for troops. Members of Congress have complained about training equipment shortages for troops preparing to deploy and for strategic reserve units. Some members support increasing ground forces to ease personnel strains, but this may be costly amid budget deficit concerns. The issue of trade-offs between military spending and other government needs may be a priority in the new Congressional session. The President plans to allocate military construction funds for base realignment and closure implementation. The 2005 base realignment and closure (BRAC) round is driving a significant increase in military construction budget requests for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009, exceeding $12.6 billion. Local jurisdictions are seeking assistance from Congress to address infrastructure challenges related to new defense missions and personnel relocations. Some areas facing job losses are requesting special assistance for job training and economic redevelopment planning. These issues are expected to remain a focus for Members of Congress throughout the 110th Congress. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommended closing 22 major military installations and modifying work at 33 others. The military departments have started implementing these recommendations with a deadline of September 15, 2011. The Department of Defense is redeploying 60,000-70,000 troops from overseas garrisons to domestic installations in a comprehensive force restructuring. This BRAC round is the largest-scale movement of forces since the end of the Cold War. The 2005 BRAC round is the most intense and complex movement of forces since WWII. It involves planning, construction, and movement phases, with funding needed during the 110th Congress. The movement phase will start in late FY2009 and continue until completion. Military construction and troop movements are funded through the BRAC 2005 account. The annual Military Construction/Military Quality of Life, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies appropriation funds various BRAC-related activities such as property transfers, closure expenditures, and environmental remediation. Congress considers annual appropriations to implement BRAC actions due to the changing nature of warfare. Adjustments to defense installations are necessary every five to ten years. The BRAC requires specific Congressional authorization for adjustments to defense installations every five to ten years. Congress may also consider new legislation for oversight of current and future rounds. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 addressed the relationship between the Director of National Intelligence and key national intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and other intelligence agencies have large budgets and analyze vast amounts of data for the DNI and DOD. They face challenges in meeting different priorities and overseeing surveillance systems like satellites and UAVs. The availability of real-time information systems is crucial for sharing intelligence without compromising sources and methods. The role of DOD in collecting human intelligence (humint) raises concerns about overlapping with the CIA. Questions also arise about DOD special forces' counterterrorism missions and whether they constitute covert actions under the National Security Act. U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are heavily involved in global military operations, with a 15% increase called for in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) has called for a 15% increase in special operations forces, including Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs. The Marines are also establishing a Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) with capabilities for foreign military training and direct action missions. Concerns have been raised about the emphasis on Classified Special Mission Units (SMUs) and their covert operations. The 110th Congress will face issues regarding Army modernization, including organizational restructuring, fiscal requirements, and equipment development. The Army is undergoing a total transformation to better meet operational needs, redesigning its active duty divisions into a brigade-level force. The National Guard and Reserves will also transition to a brigade-centric force over time. The Army is undergoing a total transformation to better meet operational needs by redesigning its active duty divisions into a brigade-level force. The National Guard and Reserves are also transitioning to a brigade-centric force over time. This redesign effort is intended to sustain the Army through long-term wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are concerns about equipment and personnel shortages in the new modular brigade combat teams. The wars have taken a toll on the Army's equipment, leading to a significant equipment reset. The Army is facing significant equipment damage due to combat, requiring a $12 to $13 billion annual reset program. Equipment shortages are impacting readiness, especially for National Guard units with domestic missions. The Future Combat System (FCS) is a $117 billion modernization program. The Army's primary modernization program, the Future Combat System (FCS), is a $117 billion-plus program aimed at replacing current systems with advanced networked combat systems. FCS is considered high risk due to conceptual technologies, with plans to field up to 15 FCS-equipped brigades by FY2014. Budgetary pressures may lead to changes in the program, such as cancelling or deferring individual platforms. The Navy's shipbuilding has been a focus of Congress since the 1990s, with concerns about the shipbuilding rate, cost of new ships, and the industrial base. The Navy aims to maintain a 313-ship fleet but lacks enough ships in its 30-year plan to consistently support this goal. Potential changes may include cancelling or delaying unmanned aerial and ground vehicles and slowing the equipping of FCS brigades. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to support a 313-ship fleet but has deficiencies in various ship types. To make the plan affordable and executable, the Navy requires changes in budget and future shipbuilding costs. Questions have been raised about the feasibility of these changes. In the proposed FY2008 budget, the Navy plans to procure aircraft carriers, submarines, destroyers, combat ships, and amphibious vessels. The Navy's shipbuilding plan in FY2007 included funding for three Littoral Combat Ships, one LPD-17 class amphibious ship, and one TAKE-1 class auxiliary cargo ship. The overall rate and affordability of Navy shipbuilding is a key debate, along with the potential for nuclear propulsion in surface ships. The 109th Congress authorized a three-year multiyear procurement contract for 60 F-22A Raptors, with oversight falling to the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress will face issues with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, C-17 Globemaster strategic airlifters, and the fielding of a short-range Joint Cargo Aircraft. Development challenges and funding concerns surround the F-35 program, while debates continue over the production of C-17s and the replacement of aging KC-135 aerial tankers. The DoD needs to replace its aging fleet of KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft through the KC-X program. Congress is debating the size, capabilities, and number of aircraft to be procured. The Air Force is also starting a program for a new long-range bomber by 2011, with questions on procurement numbers and funding. Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) is a major acquisition program with Congress supporting it and allocating $106 billion since Reagan's era. The U.S. BMD program has received $106 billion in funding since the Reagan Administration's SDI program. Congress plays a significant role in BMD policy and oversight. Funding for BMD testing has been a concern, with potential debate over a $10 billion budget request and deployment of a third NMD site in Europe during the 110th Congress. The U.S. BMD program has received significant funding since the Reagan Administration. Congress oversees programs like the Airborne Laser and the Kinetic Energy Interceptor. The National Nuclear Security Administration maintains nuclear warheads with a Life Extension Program, but confidence in warheads may decrease over time due to minor changes in components. The Reliable Replacement Warhead program aims to improve the reliability, longevity, and certifiability of existing weapons. The debate between supporters of the Life Extension Program (LEP) and Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) revolves around maintaining nuclear warheads. LEP proponents argue for the effectiveness of the current program, while RRW supporters claim it offers better safety and protection. Some argue that a return to nuclear testing is necessary to validate RRWs. Congress faces questions on which program is more cost-effective and which will better maintain the nuclear deterrent in the long term. The 110th Congress will monitor military recruiting and retention performance to adjust incentives for success. Recruiting brings new service members while retention keeps trained personnel. The Active Component recruits 175,000 personnel annually to retain future leadership responsibilities. The 110th Congress will monitor military recruiting and retention performance to adjust incentives for success. With ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other worldwide deployments, analysts have anticipated challenges in recruiting and retention due to extended deployments and family separations. Despite the Army missing its recruiting goal in FY2005, efforts to enhance benefits and incentives aim to maintain a viable all-volunteer force. The Army missed its annual recruiting goal in FY2005, with a low number of recruits in the Delayed Entry Program. To support the FY2006 goal, Congress doubled the enlistment bonus, raised the enlistment age, and offered various financial incentives. This included bonuses for referrals, incentives for former soldiers to return, and increased the number of recruiters by 1,200. In FY2006, the Army increased recruiters by 1,200 and relaxed standards for moral waivers, misdemeanors, aptitude, and tattoos. All active component services met or exceeded recruiting goals, bringing in over 180,000 new service members. Retention was successful, with only the Navy missing its goal. In FY2006, the Army increased recruiters and relaxed standards for moral waivers, misdemeanors, aptitude, and tattoos. Despite successful recruiting and retention, FY2007 poses challenges with high targets, a strong economy, and concerns about quality standards. The Army has seen changes in recruiting standards, with more waivers being granted for moral and medical conditions. There is a challenge in recruiting and retaining officers, with ROTC officer production missing goals and West Point graduates experiencing increased attrition. Congress has been aware of the evolving role of reserve components. The evolving operational role of reserve components has focused on equalizing military benefits between active and reserve components. One major issue is the reserve retirement age, with proposals to lower the age at which retired reservists begin drawing pay generating interest in Congress. The transition from a strategic to operational reserve has been highlighted since September 11, 2001. Since September 11, 2001, over 400,000 reserve component personnel have been deployed in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. The 108th and 109th Congresses enacted changes to equalize benefits between active and reserve components, including expanding TRICARE health care coverage and introducing the Reserve Educational Assistance Program for reservists. The GI Bill Active Duty benefit ranges from 40 to 80 percent based on time spent on active duty. A task force is considering a \"Total Force GI Bill\" to enhance benefits for active and reserve servicemembers. Congress has enacted a provision for a monthly special payment of up to $3,000 to prevent financial hardship during transitions. Initiatives were considered to enable reservists to obtain medical care before and after serving on active duty. A three-tiered benefit for reservists returning from active duty was enacted in 2005, but the 109th Congress replaced it with an expanded medical benefit for all drilling reservists and National Guardsmen. By September 2007, all reserve component members in a drilling status will have access to TRICARE by paying 28 percent of the costs. Concerns about the growing costs of Defense health care, estimated to reach $64 billion by 2015, have prompted the introduction of this new benefit. The increasing medical budget in large measure derives from changes enacted in 2000 to establish Tricare for Life which supplements Medicare coverage and provides a pharmaceutical benefit for retirees and dependents 65 and over. In 2006, DOD officials and some Members of Congress advocated initiatives to limit cost growth, but only a few were adopted. Congress mandated studies on approaches to the growing costs of military medical care. Some observers believe the issue will be re-visited during consideration of FY2008 authorization and appropriations bills. President Clinton modified the military policy on providing abortions at military medical facilities in 1993. President Clinton modified the military policy on providing abortions at military medical facilities in 1993, allowing abortions if paid for with non-Department of Defense funds. However, the FY1996 National Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-61) included language barring the use of funds for abortions at DOD facilities, except in cases where the life of the mother would be endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The FY1996 National Defense Authorization Act included language prohibiting the use of DOD facilities for abortions, reversing President Clinton's 1993 policy change. This contentious issue has led to repeated attempts in Congress to repeal or modify the restrictions, with votes largely falling along party lines. The change in Congressional control in the 110th Congress may lead to proposals for expanding abortion services at military facilities. Proposals for expanding abortion services at military facilities, including privately funded services, are likely to be considered as part of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The 110th Congress faces oversight challenges related to Department of Defense acquisition policies, particularly in Iraq, with reports of cost overruns, waste, and contract mismanagement. Scrutiny is high on DOD procurement practices in Iraq and traditional defense acquisition programs' cost control and performance. The 109th and 110th Congresses focused on controlling costs and meeting schedules for DOD activities in Iraq. Congress conducted audits, investigations, and hearings that revealed cost overruns, waste, fraud, and abuse in contracts. Questions were raised about the size, scope, and costs of Iraqi contract awards, as well as contractor integrity. The lack of an adequate DOD accounting reporting system was identified as a major issue in managing contracts. The 110th Congress is interested in investigating contracts providing support services to the U.S. military during and after Operation Iraqi Freedom, including the management of the Army's LOGCAP III contract awarded to Kellogg, Brown and Root for food and shelter services in Iraq and Afghanistan. The lack of collaboration among military services' contracting offices and the Army's inadequate accounting reporting system have hindered data collection on contractors in Iraq. The 110th Congress is expected to address the expiration of the LOGCAP III contract in 2007 and the upcoming competition for the LOGCAP IV contract. Previous Congresses have conducted oversight hearings on DOD acquisition programs, focusing on improving workforce skills, procedures, and preventing cost and schedule issues in equipment acquisition. The 110th Congress is expected to address issues with DOD acquisition programs, including workforce skills, procedures, and cost and schedule problems in equipment acquisition. Other key issues to examine include senior leadership turnover, industry performance incentives, and transparency in acquisition decisions. The defense acquisition landscape is further complicated by the number of reports and pilot programs aimed at improving acquisition policies. Despite various analysis and recommendations, there is no suggestion for major systemic reorganization similar to the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. The 110th Congress may face a decision on whether to continue with the current approach to defense acquisition reform or pursue a comprehensive restructure similar to the Goldwater-Nichols legislation. This decision is crucial as it will impact the overall method and desired outcomes of defense acquisition reform. The 110th Congress may need to decide on defense acquisition reform, which could lead to structural and issue-driven changes. Trade issues, including concerns about globalization and trade deficits, are expected to be prominent during this Congress. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority on July 1, 2007, could spark early debate on these issues. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expired on July 1, 2007, and Congress must decide on its renewal. This decision could impact pending Free Trade Agreement negotiations with countries like Malaysia, South Korea, and Panama, as well as U.S. participation in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Other trade issues may also be addressed during the 110th Congress. Legislation targeting China's exchange rate and trade practices was introduced during the 109th Congress due to concerns over the U.S. trade deficit with China. The 110th Congress may focus on promoting U.S. exports and foreign investment, including re-authorization for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Differences on legislation regarding foreign investments review in the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) were not reconciled in the previous Congress. The 110th Congress may address concerns over control by Dubai Ports company at U.S. ports. Legislation on Export Administration Act, funding for IMF, World Bank, and MDBs, and extension of ATPA trade preferences for Andean countries were discussed in the 109th Congress. The 110th Congress will need to decide on extending ATPA trade preferences for Andean countries as the June 30, 2007 expiration date approaches. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is set to expire on July 1, 2007, which grants the President special authority to enter into certain trade agreements with expedited legislative procedures. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President special authority to negotiate trade agreements with expedited legislative procedures. It allows Congress to exercise its constitutional authority over trade while giving the President added negotiating leverage. The core provisions of TPA have remained unchanged since 1974, but renewal efforts have become more controversial over time. The United States is currently engaged in multiple trade negotiations, raising questions about the prospects for TPA renewal. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal efforts have become increasingly controversial due to concerns over trade's negative effects and partisan debates. Congress last renewed TPA in 2002 after a divisive vote, focusing on labor, environment provisions, and bipartisan involvement in trade policy. With various trade negotiations ongoing, including the WTO's Doha Round and bilateral agreements, Congress faces decisions on TPA renewal options. The WTO's Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations was suspended in July 2006 due to differences between the United States, the European Union, and developing countries on major issues like agriculture, industrial tariffs, services, and trade remedies. The future of the negotiations depends on various factors such as uncompleted negotiations, economic effects of trade liberalization, and political will between the Bush Administration and Congress. The Doha Round negotiations have been suspended due to disagreements on industrial tariffs, non-tariff barriers, services, and trade remedies. The agricultural negotiations are a major sticking point, with differences in proposals from the US, EU, and G-20 countries hindering progress. The deadline for reaching an agreement is April 1, 2007, before the expiration of US trade promotion authority. The Doha Round negotiations have been suspended due to disagreements on industrial tariffs, non-tariff barriers, services, and trade remedies. The United States and the EU are conditioning their offers on market access and subsidies, while the G-20 is waiting for progress on farm subsidies before improving offers on non-agricultural market access and services. The talks have resulted in amending the TRIPS agreement for developing countries. The TRIPS agreement allows developing countries to access generic drugs through compulsory licenses to combat public health epidemics. Negotiations are at a stalemate, making it unlikely to reach an agreement before TPA expiration. Efforts will be made to restart negotiations for progress in hopes of TPA extension. The state of negotiations may impact the 2007 farm bill and potential changes in U.S. patent law to implement TRIPS access to medicine decision. Congress may be asked to approve proposed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Peru and Colombia in the first months of the 110th Congress. Other negotiations are in progress with Panama, Malaysia, and South Korea, while negotiations with Thailand and the United Arab Emirates are currently suspended. The proposed FTAs are part of the Bush Administration's policy of competitive liberalization. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expires on July 1, 2007, with a de facto deadline of April 1, 2007 for reaching an agreement. In the 110th Congress, legislators may consider proposed FTAs with Peru and Colombia to combat the narcotics trade and boost their economies. Other potential agreements include those with Korea, Malaysia, and Panama, aiming to address trade barriers and open up sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. In the 109th Congress, implementing legislation was approved for the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and FTAs with Bahrain and Oman. FTAs have been proclaimed in force with Bahrain and CAFTA-DR countries. CAFTA-DR was the most contentious, passing by narrow margins in both the House and Senate. Congress may debate future implementing legislation. In the 109th Congress, implementing legislation was approved for the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and FTAs with Bahrain and Oman. Congress may question various aspects of the Administration's trade policy, including trade promotion authority obligations, labor protection provisions, economic benefits of FTAs, and geopolitical influences on FTA partners selection. Legislators are primarily concerned with how potential trade agreements impact the employment and business prospects of constituents. By year-end 2006, the U.S. current account deficit is expected to surpass the record $717 billion deficit recorded in 2005, raising concerns about the long-term impact on the economy. The deficit is being financed through inflows of foreign capital, which are bridging the gap between domestic supplies and demand for capital. Foreign investors hold a large share of U.S. assets, including corporate stocks, bonds, and Treasury securities. Their reduced purchases could strain the U.S. economy and pressure Congress to address budget issues. International capital flows drive the value of the dollar, as demand for U.S. assets translates into demand for the dollar. The value of the dollar changes based on demand for dollar-denominated assets. Capital inflows impact the dollar's value, affecting the U.S. current account balance and trade accounts. Changes in capital inflows can alter the composition of jobs and economic activity. The value of the dollar is influenced by capital inflows, impacting the U.S. current account balance and trade accounts. This can lead to changes in job composition and economic activity. Foreign investment in critical industries is a concern for some groups in the U.S. Congress may be pressured to promote exports and address countries manipulating their currencies to support the dollar exchange rate. Foreign investment in critical industries and sectors is a concern for some in the U.S. as it may impact economic security and lead to job losses. While many communities welcome foreign direct investment for potential taxes and employment, national security concerns and job losses are being weighed against these benefits. Observers are also worried about the large capital inflows from foreign investors into the U.S. Foreign investors holding over 50% of U.S. Treasury securities raises concerns about financial crisis risk, dollar value uncertainty, and trade balance impact. Capital inflows help keep U.S. interest rates low but may involve Congress in any potential crisis due to its fiscal and monetary policy roles. Some observers are concerned about foreign investors having unlimited access to invest in or acquire U.S. firms, especially those involved in critical economic activities. Restrictions on foreign investment may conflict with U.S. law and international efforts to relax national rules. The Exon-Florio provision gives the President authority to block foreign investments threatening national security. Amendments were proposed in the 109th Congress to this provision. Efforts to amend the Exon-Florio provision, which allows the President to block foreign investments threatening national security, may continue in the 110th Congress. Congressional focus may also include funding levels for U.S. export promotion programs and their adherence to WTO rules. Legislation was passed in the 109th Congress to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank's charter through September 30, 2011. In the 110th Congress, efforts may be made to reauthorize export promotion programs of the Department of Agriculture and OPIC. Funding for these programs, which include credit guarantees and insurance, has not been controversial due to self-sustainability. However, non-revenue generating activities may face scrutiny in tight budget times. Export promotion functions include combating foreign export subsidies, developing foreign markets, financing U.S. trade, providing export assistance services, negotiating trade barriers, funding feasibility studies, and government advocacy. The U.S. government has 19 federal agencies promoting exports, with the U.S. Trade Policy Coordinating Committee coordinating their efforts. These agencies spent $1.4 million on export promotion activities, with a focus on agricultural promotion. In the 110th Congress, there may be a new effort to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), which provides statutory authority for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. The EAA periodically has been reauthorized for short periods of time since its original expiration in 1989. In the 109th Congress, H.R. 4572 (Hyde) was introduced in December 2005 but no action was taken on the bill. In December 2005, legislation to amend the Export Administration Act of 1979 was introduced but no action was taken. The bill aimed to increase penalties for export control violations, establish objectives for U.S. participation in multilateral control regimes, and reauthorize the Act for two years. The Bush Administration supported the bill, which highlighted the debate on balancing national security concerns with commercial considerations. Some argue that the current export control system needs to find a balance between national security and commercial interests. They believe that foreign countries should not have an automatic right to import U.S. technology, as it should consider U.S. policy interests like non-proliferation and human rights. Critics also mention that export controls can benefit the U.S. due to its advantages in high-technology areas. Critics argue that current export controls disadvantage U.S. businesses by imposing cumbersome licensing procedures, leading to lost sales to overseas competitors. They believe that selling technology overseas is essential for funding research and development critical for U.S. security interests and competitiveness. Congress has legislative responsibilities regarding U.S. involvement in international financial institutions. The 109th Congress authorized funding for key MDB initiatives, including replenishments for the World Bank's International Development Association, the Asian Development Fund, and the African Development Fund. The 110th Congress may consider appropriations for these initiatives. The 110th Congress may consider appropriations for replenishing the African Development Fund and addressing policy issues related to IFIs, such as multilateral debt relief, anti-corruption policies, environmental impact, governance reform of the IMF, and monitoring international exchange rates."
