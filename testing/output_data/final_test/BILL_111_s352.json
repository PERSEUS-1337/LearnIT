    "content": "The \"DTV Delay Act\" postpones the DTV transition date. The DTV Delay Act amends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to change the transition date to June 13, 2009, from February 18, 2009. Conforming amendments are made to related sections in the Communications Act of 1934. The Federal Communications Commission will extend the licenses for recovered spectrum, including construction requirements, for a 116-day period. \"Recovered spectrum\" refers to analog spectrum defined in the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER BOX PROGRAM. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 is amended to extend the Coupon Program deadline from March 31, 2009, to July 31, 2009. Additionally, provisions are made for issuing replacement coupons for expired ones and modifying the redemption process. The amendments made by this section will only take effect after additional budget authority is enacted to carry out the analog-to-digital converter box program under the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION. Permissive early termination allows television broadcast stations to switch to digital broadcasting before the mandated date, as long as it follows FCC requirements. The FCC allows public safety radio services to operate on spectrum recovered from television broadcasting cessation, subject to FCC rules. Expedited rulemaking by the FCC and NTIA is required within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Within 30 days of the Act's enactment, each entity must adopt or revise rules to implement the provisions of the Act and its amendments. SEC. 5. Extension of Commission auction authority to 2012."
