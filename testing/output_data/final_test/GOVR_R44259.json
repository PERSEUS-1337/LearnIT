In 2014, the nation's violent crime rate was the lowest since 1970, and the homicide rate was the lowest since 1960. Even if rates are rising in 2015, they would need to more than double to reach previous high points. Data from the FBI shows a lag in reporting on a rising number of homicides. Data from the FBI lags by a year, with information on rising homicides and violent crimes coming from law enforcement agencies or state UCR programs. Since 1990, large and medium-sized cities have seen homicide and violent crime rates following national trends. Cities with populations of 50,000 or more had lower rates in 2014 compared to 1990, with the largest cities experiencing the greatest decreases. It is important to analyze crime data over longer time periods to determine trends, as short-term increases do not necessarily indicate a break in the overall downward trend. Crime data can be subject to random fluctuations, seasonal effects, and past successes, leading to short-term increases in reported violent crimes. Increases in crime rates may not necessarily indicate a break in the overall downward trend. The percentage change in reported crimes is a relative measure sensitive to magnitude. It can be misleading depending on the time period chosen, as shown by examples of homicide rates in different cities. The analysis of homicide data from the nation's 60 most populous cities shows a 16% overall increase in reported homicides, with 26 cities experiencing a 20% or more increase. However, 20 cities saw a decrease in homicides, and the majority of cities (44 out of 60) did not have statistically significant increases. Large fluctuations in reported homicides from year to year are not uncommon. In 2009, there was an increase in reported homicides, with 15 cities showing significant increases. It is too early to conclude if there is a reversal in decreasing violent crime rates. The \"Ferguson effect\" is a widely discussed explanation for the recent spikes in violent crime. The \"Ferguson effect\" theory suggests that protests over police-involved shootings have led to a decrease in proactive policing, emboldening criminals and resulting in increased violent crime in some cities. Anecdotal evidence includes decreased arrests in St. Louis after the Michael Brown shooting and a rise in homicides in Baltimore. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 42% in early November, with 43 recorded in May 2015 following riots over Freddie Gray's death. Arrests were down 57% compared to the previous year. The rise in homicides in St. Louis began before Michael Brown's shooting, and arrests were decreasing in Baltimore before Gray's death. Reasons for reduced arrests include staffing shortages and a new patrol strategy. Efforts to reform police have not hindered their effectiveness as crime fighters. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has remained effective in fighting crime despite concerns about police aggressiveness. Crime levels have stayed low even as the number of stops has decreased. There is no evidence that operational efficiency has suffered, and crime statistics in New York City remain impressive compared to other cities. Law enforcement may be facing a legitimacy problem in communities where residents feel unfairly treated by the police. The effectiveness of law enforcement may be hindered not by reluctance to engage in proactive policing, but by a lack of community cooperation. Trust and confidence in the criminal justice system are crucial for its effectiveness, as people are more likely to follow the law when they perceive it as legitimate. Fear of unfair treatment by police and doubts about their impartiality can lead to citizens taking matters into their own hands. The \"Ferguson effect\" may lead to legal cynicism and reduced police legitimacy in communities, potentially causing an increase in gang violence and violent crime in urban areas. Critics of law enforcement practices are urged to support the police to prevent violence from taking hold of the city. The Major Cities Chiefs Association identified gang-related activity as a reason for violent crime increases, citing episodic gang violence triggered by various factors. This localized explanation may drive violent crime in specific cities but does not necessarily indicate a national trend. The increase in violent crime in cities like Baltimore may be linked to stolen prescription narcotics during riots, leading to gang turf wars. Repeat violent offenders are also identified as a factor in rising homicides in cities like Washington DC and Chicago. Police chiefs highlight the issue of releasing such offenders contributing to reckless firearm use. Recidivism among violent offenders is a persistent issue, with data showing high rates of rearrests within five years. A small percentage of released inmates are responsible for a large portion of post-release arrests. Hundreds of thousands of inmates have been returning to communities annually for over two decades. Between 1990 and 2014, 595,000 inmates were released from state and federal prisons annually. The number of releases increased until 2008, then decreased from 2009 to 2014. There is a discussion on the potential correlation between released inmates and violent crime rates, with concerns about the lack of real-time crime data. Research on homicides in major U.S. cities suggests a need for more up-to-date crime information. Data on homicides in U.S. cities was collected from various sources including police departments' websites, state UCR programs, media reports, and surveys. Some cities reported data as of May 31, 2015, while others had data available as of September 7, 2015. The FBI is working on redesigning the UCR program to publish crime data more frequently. Up-to-date national crime data could reveal if the increase in homicides in some cities is part of a national trend or a localized issue. The FBI is working on redesigning the UCR program to publish crime data more frequently, as collecting and reporting data is labor-intensive. Preliminary crime data might not be useful or could be misleading due to potential revisions, but various people find value in these preliminary data."
