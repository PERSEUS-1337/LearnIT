    "title": "SB 1304",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 170 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows for reassessment of taxable property that has been damaged or destroyed without fault, either by the property owner or the assessor within the past 12 months. Eligibility for reassessment is based on specific criteria for the cause of damage or destruction. The Revenue and Taxation Code allows for reassessment of property damaged or destroyed by a misfortune or calamity, including restricted access or environmental contamination. This includes a drought condition like the one in 1976 and 1977. The application for reassessment can be filed within the specified time frame or within 12 months of the misfortune or calamity, by submitting a written request to the assessor with property details, condition, value after damage, and dollar amount of damage. The application must be executed under penalty of perjury or verified by affidavit if outside California. An ordinance can be applied to specified misfortunes or calamities as determined by the board of supervisors. It cannot be applied to certain calamities unless another ordinance is in effect. The ordinance can set a time limit for its effectiveness or remain in effect until repealed. Upon receiving an application, the assessor will appraise the property before and after damage, determining values of land, improvements, and personalty. If the values before exceed those after by $10,000 or more, percentage reductions will be calculated and reflected on the assessment roll. Taxes will be adjusted accordingly, not exceeding the actual loss. The \"board\" refers to either the county board of supervisors or an assessment appeals board established by the county board of supervisors. The assessor must inform the applicant in writing of the proposed reassessment amount and the right to appeal to the board within six months. The board will make a final decision on the property's damaged value, with no presumption on the property's value after the damage date. After informing the applicant of the proposed reassessment amount and right to appeal, the assessor forwards reduced values to the auditor for entry on the roll. Reassessed values cannot be reviewed except by a court. If a property has suffered damage within the last 12 months, the assessor will provide the owner with an application for reassessment. The owner must file the application within 12 months of the damage. The property will be reassessed if the application is completed and filed on time. This process does not apply if the assessor has already initiated reassessment. The reassessment process for damaged property involves applying the current tax rate to the reassessed amount. The owner is liable for a prorated portion of taxes for the current fiscal year before the damage occurred, as well as a proration of taxes for the damaged property after the damage occurred. The term \"fiscal year\" refers to the portion of the tax year used to determine adjusted taxes due. If damage occurs after January 1 but before the next fiscal year, reassessment determines tax liability for the following fiscal year. If property is fully restored during the next fiscal year, taxes for that year are prorated based on the months before and after restoration. Any excess tax paid will be refunded to the taxpayer without the need for a claim, and the assessed value of damaged property will be the taxable value until it is restored or reconstructed. If partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair progresses on subsequent lien dates, the taxable value increases based on the difference between the factored base year value before the calamity and the assessed value in its damaged state. If progress is slow by the third lien date, the assessed value is determined according to specific guidelines for properties in declared emergency areas. When property is fully repaired, the assessor will make additional assessments based on completion date. If completed between January 1 and May 31, there will be two assessments to determine the new taxable value. If repair, restoration, or reconstruction is completed between June 1 and January 1, the additional assessment will be the difference between the new taxable value and the current taxable value. The assessor will enroll the new taxable value on the lien date following completion. The new taxable value is based on the property's full cash value or factored base year value. Chapter 3.5 may be applied by the assessor, and this section applies to all counties in the state. Any ordinance in effect pursuant to former Sections 155.1, 155.13, or 155.14 shall remain in effect subject to limitations. The assessor may reassess a property for damage caused by misfortune or calamity with approval from the board of supervisors. The amendments apply retroactively to properties in Porter Ranch affected by the methane gas leak in 2015 and 2016. Reassessment applications can be filed within 12 months of enactment. Existing laws on property value claims are not altered. The subdivision does not presume property damage for civil actions related to the gas leak. The Legislature deems a special law necessary due to the unique circumstances of the methane gas leak in Porter Ranch in 2015 and 2016. This act is urgent for the immediate relief of affected residents."
