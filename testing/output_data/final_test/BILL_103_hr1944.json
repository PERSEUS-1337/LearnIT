The 50th anniversary of the Mariana campaign of World War II is being commemorated, which led to the capture of Saipan and Tinian by American forces and the liberation of Guam from Japanese occupation. The battle of the Philippine Sea resulted in a defeat for the Japanese fleet by US naval forces, and the recapture of Guam restored freedom to the indigenous Chamorros who suffered during the Japanese occupation. During the Japanese occupation, indigenous Chamorros on Guam suffered, while Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard units showed heroic bravery. The Guam Insular Force Guard, Guam militia, and people of Guam defended the island and assisted American forces. Guam residents were forcibly removed from their homes, relocated, and subjected to forced labor. The liberation of the Mariana Islands during World War II was a turning point in the Pacific war, leading to American victories at key battles and providing air bases for land-based bombers to reach Japan. The air offensive from the Marianas helped shorten the war against the Japanese. Japanese war-making capability shortened the war and reduced the toll of lives to secure peace in the Pacific. The sense of Congress is to plan a commemoration for the 50th anniversary of the Mariana campaign in collaboration with Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Steps should be taken to develop visitor facilities at War in the Pacific National Historical Park and complete a monument before July 21, 1994, for historical interpretation. The amendment authorizes appropriations for the construction of a monument within War in the Pacific National Historical Park on Guam to commemorate the loyalty of the people and heroism of American forces during World War II. Additionally, programs will be implemented to interpret the experiences of the people of Guam during the war, including oral histories. Within six months of enactment, the Secretary must provide updated cost estimates and a plan for developing the park to the Senate and House committees. The Secretary is also authorized to preserve World War II weapons and fortifications within the park. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
