    "content": "The 2007 America COMPETES Act aimed to enhance U.S. competitiveness in science and technology by investing in research and development. It included provisions for doubling funding for certain research accounts and authorizing STEM education programs. The Act has since expired, along with its successor, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The America COMPETES Act funding authorizations spanned FY2008 to FY2010, extended through FY2013 in 2010. No funding legislation has been enacted since then. Bills introduced in the 113th Congress were not passed. The 114th Congress has introduced reauthorization bills, including H.R. 1806 and H.R. 1898, some of which have passed in the House. In the Senate, S. 1398 has been introduced. This report provides an overview of the COMPETES Acts, including legislative history, policy debate, and implementation status of related programs. It also analyzes major bills for reauthorization from the 113th and 114th Congresses. The federal conversation focuses on concerns about prosperity and security in scientific and technological advancement. The central rationale for federal programs, policies, and activities is to maintain the U.S.'s strengths in scientific and technological advancement for prosperity and security. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 exemplified this approach by investing in innovation through research and development, and improving competitiveness with $32.7 billion in appropriations for federal research accounts and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 allocated $32.7 billion for federal research accounts, STEM education, and innovation-related programs between FY2008 and FY2010. It established the \"doubling path policy\" for PS&E research, aiming to double funding for certain accounts over a seven-year period. STEM education and innovation programs authorized by the act include the Math Now program at the Department of Education, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program at NIST, and the Advanced Research. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 reaffirmed key policy thrusts of the original act, focusing on investing in innovation through research and development to improve U.S. competitiveness. Funding for PS&E doubling path accounts would now double over an 11-year period instead of 7 years, with STEM education provisions emphasizing college and university-level programs. Additionally, the reauthorization allowed federal agencies to offer innovation prizes, established a new loan guarantee program for manufacturers, and created a regional innovation program. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 authorized $45.5 billion in appropriations between FY2011 and FY2013, focusing on R&D in physical sciences, engineering, and STEM education to enhance U.S. competitiveness. Advocates argued that innovation is crucial for economic competitiveness and national prosperity. Many observers believe innovation is vital for national competitiveness. The United States is at risk of losing its innovation advantage due to external pressures and internal weaknesses. Rapidly developing countries like China and India are competing for high-value jobs and industries, posing a threat to the U.S. Proponents of the acts raised concerns about federal funding for research in physical sciences and engineering, as well as the education and training of U.S. scientists, engineers, and technicians. The America COMPETES Act, influenced by the American Competitiveness Initiative, aimed to address concerns about federal funding for research and education in STEM fields. Opposition to the act focused on fundamental assumptions, alternative policies, and cost considerations. Some analysts questioned the need for increasing STEM graduates, citing a lack of evidence for workforce shortages. The America COMPETES Act (H.R. 2272) aimed to boost STEM fields through federal investment in R&D and education. Opponents raised concerns about costs and market distortion. Introduced in 2007, the bill combined five previous House bills. The America COMPETES Act (H.R. 2272) combined five previous House bills related to science and technology. It passed both the House and Senate, with the final version signed into law as P.L. 110-69 on August 9, 2007. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (H.R. 5116) was introduced in the House on April 22, 2010. It passed the House and Senate, with the final version signed into law as P.L. 111-358 on December 28, 2010. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (H.R. 5116) was signed into law as P.L. 111-358 on December 28, 2010. The implementation of the Act was found to be inconsistent, with some new programs only partially implemented by May 2013. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 authorized a doubling path policy for certain federal PS&E research accounts, with some provisions implemented inconsistently by May 2013. The Act also includes STEM education provisions and other ongoing interest provisions like ARPA-E and innovation inducement prize provisions. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 authorized a doubling path policy for certain federal PS&E research accounts, targeting specific federal agency accounts such as NSF, NIST, and DOE. However, actual appropriations to these targeted accounts did not reach authorized levels, hindering the goal of doubling funding in seven years. Actual appropriations to targeted accounts did not reach authorized levels, hindering the goal of doubling funding in seven years as outlined in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. Funding for the targeted accounts would have doubled in about 11 years if appropriations had grown at the authorized compound annual growth rate of 6.4%. Actual appropriations to targeted accounts did not reach authorized levels, hindering the goal of doubling funding in seven years as outlined in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. Policymakers have sought to double funding for federal research accounts, but previous efforts have not resulted in doubling budgets within proposed time frames. For example, the National Institutes of Health saw a nearly 100% increase in funding from FY1998 to FY2003. Implementation of STEM education provisions from the America COMPETES Acts has been mixed, with some programs continuing while new ones were only partially implemented. The largest STEM education account at NSF, Education and Human Resources (E&HR), saw a 20% funding increase between FY2007 and FY2013, although it did not reach authorized levels. The federal STEM education effort has changed substantially since the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. In FY2014 and FY2015, the Obama Administration proposed significant changes to the federal STEM education portfolio, reducing the number of programs and activities while maintaining overall funding levels. The federal STEM education effort in FY2015 consisted of 129 investments totaling $2.9 billion, down from 229 investments in FY2012. The impact of these changes on COMPETES-authorized agencies and programs is unclear. The America COMPETES Act included more K-12 education provisions than the 2010 reauthorization, but many were not funded and later repealed. Only one program, Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, received defined appropriations. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow (TCT) program received $2.2 million in funding per fiscal year between FY2008 and FY2010, but no funding was provided in FY2011. Congress has not allocated defined funding for TCT since then. The Department of Education (DOE) implemented some STEM education provisions authorized by the America COMPETES Act, but the extent of implementation is unclear. DOE terminated activities previously identified as consistent with the America COMPETES Act, such as the DOE ACTS program. NSF's implementation of Act-authorized STEM education programs was mixed, with some programs continuing operation while others were not implemented. The NSF initiated the Professional Science Master's (PSM) program in FY2010 with ARRA funding, but it has not received funding since then and has been reported to have shut down. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 focused on postsecondary STEM education and governance issues, directing the establishment of a Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Education (Co-STEM) to coordinate federal STEM education efforts. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a progress report on federal STEM education programs and coordination efforts. The report included an updated inventory of federal STEM education programs with funding levels for FY2014 and FY2015. NSF implemented provisions from the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, but it is unclear if programs like the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) were treated equally in terms of funding between FY2011 and FY2013. The NSF's handling of the STEM Training Grant Program and the GRF differed from the IGERT between FY2011 and FY2013. It is unclear if this aligns with Congress's intentions. The STEM Training Grant Program, modeled after the UTeach program, was not established by NSF during the authorization period. UTeach, funded by NSF in 2000, is not specifically targeted by NSF, but similar activities are funded through other programs like the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship. The Department of Education has provided funding for UTeach replication, with 44 UTeach programs in 21 states and the District of Columbia starting in spring 2015. The America COMPETES Act established ARPA-E at the Department of Energy, outlining its administrative structure, leadership, and responsibilities. The America COMPETES Act established ARPA-E at the Department of Energy, reauthorizing it in 2010 with program changes focused on research projects in areas not typically undertaken by industry. The statute also added responsibilities for R&D in advanced manufacturing processes and technologies, as well as identifying mechanisms for commercial application of successful energy technology projects. The DOE implemented ARPA-E in 2009 with funding from ARRA. Congress provided regular appropriations starting in FY2011. ARPA-E has funded over 400 energy technology projects, with some analysts questioning if projects align with industry needs. A 2012 GAO report found most projects couldn't be funded solely by private investors. The agency now requires applicants to disclose prior private sector funding. The GAO found that many winning ARPA-E projects involved unproven technological concepts, making them too risky for private investors. They recommended that ARPA-E provide guidance for applicants to explain why private investors are not funding their proposals and require documentation from private investors. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology also discussed the need for more transparency in funding sources for ARPA-E projects. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, held a hearing in January 2012 regarding GAO findings on ARPA-E projects. The majority staff report and Subcommittee's ranking Member disagreed on private industry funding for ARPA-E projects. Former ARPA-E director, Arun Majumdar, endorsed GAO's findings, stating that private investors would not have funded any ARPA-E projects. The ARPA-E project demonstrated that selected projects met critical criteria and objectives. It is unclear if ARPA-E implemented provisions for R&D in advanced manufacturing processes. Some projects aim to develop manufacturing capabilities, and ARPA-E's technology transfer capacity has been a focus for policymakers. An audit in 2011 found that ARPA-E had not established a systematic approach to meet technology transfer requirements. The Inspector General noted that ARPA-E is addressing concerns about its technology transfer activities by requiring recipients to spend a minimum of 5% of their awards on technology transfer and outreach. External researchers found that ARPA-E's program managers are hands-on with award recipients and promote contacts with venture and commercial funding. ARPA-E uses various mechanisms to help move technologies into the marketplace, including assistance from its Technology-to-Market team. ARPA-E's Technology-to-Market team assists project teams in implementing their plans and hosts an annual Innovation Summit to move technologies into the marketplace. In 2015, 34 projects received $850 million in follow-on funding from the private sector after an initial ARPA-E investment of $135 million. The agency collaborated with NSF in 2012 to allow project teams to participate in the I-Corps program, teaching participants to identify product opportunities from academic research. The federal government, philanthropic organizations, and other entities use prizes to induce innovation. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 granted federal agencies broad authority to stimulate innovation through prize competitions. Federal agencies have been using innovation inducement prizes authorized under Section 105, with OSTP publishing annual reports on its implementation. In its progress updates, OSTP reported that federal agencies have initiated over 100 prize competitions under the authority of Section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. Prizes enable agencies to pay only for success, reach beyond the usual participants, and establish ambitious goals without predicting the winning team or approach. The use of innovation inducement prizes aims to increase problem solvers, bring diverse perspectives, and maximize cost-effectiveness. Observers note a variety of evolving competition practices and experimentation in federal prize design, with a focus on ambitious outcomes like market stimulation and inspiring transformation. Literature frequently discusses the design and management of innovation contests. Innovation contests are discussed in the literature on innovation inducement prizes. Studies have examined the impact of the number of contestants on contest outcomes, with open contests being suitable for uncertain problems. Questions have been raised about the design of innovation competitions, including the possibility of conditioning prize payments on market tests and ensuring widespread access to technologies through pricing conditions. Prizes are also evaluated as a policy tool, with considerations on trade-offs and complementarities with other innovation policy tools like patents. Prizes in innovation policy are discussed in relation to trade-offs with patents and grants, as well as design considerations. Publicity is seen as a key motivator in prize competitions. Some argue that prizes are unnecessary, while others provide guidance on strategic and tactical considerations in prize design. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 established an Interagency Public Access Committee for coordinating innovation inducements. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) established an Interagency Public Access Committee to coordinate federal science agency research and policies on the dissemination of research results. Two working groups were formed to focus on scholarly publications and digital data, issuing requests for comments on data sharing and public access. Commenters had varying opinions on implementation. In February 2013, OSTP Director John P. Holdren issued a government-wide policy memorandum on increased access for federal agencies with over $100 million in funding. In February 2013, OSTP Director John P. Holdren issued a policy memorandum directing federal agencies with over $100 million in R&D expenditures to develop plans for increased public access to research results they fund. By November 2014, two agency plans had received final approval, while others were still in the review process. Holdren's letter mentioned that agencies would release public access plans in the next three months. Three bills in the 114th Congress aim to reauthorize provisions of the COMPETES Acts: H.R. 1806, H.R. 1898, and S. 1398. H.R. 1806 and H.R. 1898 cover physical sciences, engineering research, STEM education, and related programs. S. 1398 focuses on the Office of Science and ARPA-E within the Department of Energy. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 1806) prioritizes Federal investment in basic research and scientific discovery. H.R. 1806 authorizes appropriations for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, along with various research, STEM education, and innovation programs. It also includes funding for research activities at the Department of Energy, such as electricity delivery, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and fossil energy. Most appropriations authorizations are for FY2016 and FY2017. The bill is similar to previous ones but not identical. H.R. 1806 authorizes appropriations for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science for FY2016 and FY2017. The bill passed the House on May 20, 2015. Funding levels for targeted accounts are detailed in Table 1, showing year-over-year increases in funding. The bill does not mention the doubling path policy. H.R. 1806 authorizes appropriations for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science for FY2016 and FY2017. It addresses governance concerns in federal STEM education by establishing advisory panels and coordinating offices. The bill also includes provisions for informal STEM education activities, changes to the Noyce program, and the inclusion of computer science in STEM education. Additionally, it requires NSF to establish the Hispanic-Serving Institutions program authorized by the 2007 America COMPETES Act. The provisions in H.R. 1806 include coordination of international science and technology partnerships, establishment of the U.S. Chief Technology Officer position within OSTP, authorization of certain research programs in the Office of Science, addressing commercialization issues within DOE, and amending the ARPA-E statute. It also authorizes appropriations to NSF by directorate and funding below current levels for certain DOE and NSF accounts and programs. H.R. 1806 authorizes funding for ARPA-E at $140 million in FY2016 and FY2017, with Congress funding ARPA-E at about $280 million since FY2012. H.R. 1898 seeks to invest in innovation through research and development, STEM education, and improve U.S. competitiveness by authorizing funding for NSF, NIST, and the Office of Science. It also amends federal STEM education and innovation-related programs. H.R. 1898 authorizes funding for NSF, NIST, and the Office of Science from FY2016 through FY2020, with provisions for year-over-year increases. It includes STEM education provisions and highlights compound annual growth rates for the agencies. H.R. 1898 includes STEM education provisions such as establishing a government-wide STEM education coordinator and a STEM Education Advisory Panel. It authorizes grants for undergraduate STEM education reform, advanced manufacturing education at community colleges, and R&D on state-based STEM education standards. The bill also aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and employment. H.R. 1898 includes provisions to address cultural and institutional barriers in STEM education and employment, reauthorize Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies, support federal employee attendance at scientific conferences, authorize Office of Science research programs, and reauthorize the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The Energy Title of America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 (S. 1398) aims to advance research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences through a National Engineering Biology Research and Development program. It focuses on doubling basic energy research funding over 18 years, with a 4% annual increase starting from FY2015. The doubling path policy in S. 1398 aims to double funding for basic energy research over 18 years at a 4% annual increase rate. It includes the Office of Science and ARPA-E, evolving from the COMPETES Acts policy which focused on physical sciences and engineering research. The baseline year for S. 1398 is FY2015, targeting increases for the Office of Science and ARPA-E. The table in S. 1398 compares funding levels from FY2014 to FY2020, including authorized levels and the Administration's FY2016 request. Amendments in S. 1398 aim to coordinate ARPA-E activities with DOE efforts and restrict funding for commercially viable projects. The bill also includes provisions to repeal DOE STEM education activities authorized by the America COMPETES Act. S. 1398 aims to repeal certain STEM education provisions from the America COMPETES Act and the Department of Energy Science Education Enhancement Act. It would also repeal specific programs authorized by P.L. 110-69, including the Nuclear Science Talent Expansion Program and the Hydrocarbon Systems Science Competitiveness Grants. S. 1398 aims to repeal remaining STEM education provisions from the America COMPETES Act and DOE-SEEA. It would also eliminate funding for DOE STEM education programs like Early Career Awards and Distinguished Scientist programs. S. 1398 consolidates Early Career and Distinguished Scientist programs, providing $150 million annually from FY2016 to FY2020. The COMPETES Acts have been key authorization acts for NIST, Office of Science, and NSF since FY2008, with provisions for ARPA-E, OSTP, ED, NASA, NOAA, DOC's Economic Development Administration, and GAO. Congressional debate on COMPETES Acts reauthorization may cover a wide range of innovation-related policy issues. The COMPETES Acts cover various issues related to innovation and competitiveness, including funding levels for NSF, NIST, and the Office of Science, as well as federal STEM education efforts. Several bills were introduced in the 113th Congress to reauthorize provisions from the COMPETES Acts, such as H.R. 4159, H.R. 4186, H.R. 4869, and S. 2757, which included policy and fiscal provisions for physical sciences and engineering research, STEM education, and related programs at COMPETES Act agencies. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4159) aimed to boost innovation, research, and STEM education funding for agencies like NSF, NIST, and the Office of Science from FY2015 to FY2019. It did not mention the doubling path policy but focused on year-over-year increases for these agencies. H.R. 4159 aimed to increase funding for agencies like NSF, NIST, and the Office of Science from FY2015 to FY2019. It included STEM education provisions such as establishing a STEM education coordinator and providing guidance for federal agencies. At NSF, the bill authorized grants for STEM education reform at higher education institutions and community colleges. H.R. 4159 aimed to reform STEM education by authorizing grants for advanced manufacturing education at community colleges and R&D on state-based STEM education standards. It also included provisions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and employment. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 established the Regional Innovation Program and Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing. H.R. 4159 aimed to reform STEM education by authorizing grants for advanced manufacturing education and R&D on state-based STEM education standards. It also included provisions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and employment. The bill's DOE title would have authorized certain Office of Science research programs and reauthorized and amended ARPA-E. Section 204 would have created a new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Education (ARPA-ED) at the Department of Education. H.R. 4159 was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, as well as the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, but was not marked up or enacted. The FIRST Act (H.R. 4186) aimed to invest in innovation through scientific research and development to improve US competitiveness. It included provisions for funding NSF and NIST, as well as federal STEM education programs. The Chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology mentioned small funding increases for NSF in his statement. The FIRST Act (H.R. 4186) authorizes small funding increases for NSF and NIST in FY2015. It includes STEM education provisions and establishes a STEM Education Advisory Panel. The bill, H.R. 4186, would have established a STEM Education Advisory Panel and a federal government-wide STEM Education Coordinating Office at the NSF. It also included provisions for informal STEM education activities, changes to the Noyce program, and clarified that computer science is included in the definition of STEM education. Additionally, the bill authorized and amended certain Networking and Information Technology R&D program provisions, coordinated international science and technology partnerships, and provided for public access to federally funded research and data. The Transfer Act of 2013 (H.R. 2981) aimed to amend the Small Business Act and expand a proof-of-concept pilot program at the National Institutes of Health. The FIRST Act proposed defined appropriations to NSF by directorate and required NSF to justify how each grant served national interests. H.R. 4186 was not enacted but was marked up by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in May 2014. H.R. 4869, the Department of Energy Research and Development Act of 2014, would have authorized funding for the Office of Science and other Department of Energy programs in FY2014 and FY2015. The bill aimed to provide funding levels for the Office of Science in line with the COMPETES Act legacy, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.3% in authorized appropriations. H.R. 4869, the Department of Energy Research and Development Act of 2014, aimed to authorize funding for the Office of Science and other DOE programs in FY2014 and FY2015. The bill included provisions for specific research programs, national laboratory issues, and amendments to the ARPA-E statute, as well as authorizing activities in various R&D areas such as nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and fossil energy. The Subcommittee on Energy, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee attempted to mark up a committee print of DOE-RDA on June 11, 2014, but the markup was adjourned due to concerns about the process. H.R. 4869, sponsored by the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, was formally introduced on June 13, 2014. S. 2757, The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014, aimed to invest in innovation through research and development to improve the competitiveness of the United States. S. 2757, The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014, differs from H.R. 4159 by not including Office of Science or other Department of Energy provisions. Both bills would authorize funding for NSF and NIST, with S. 2757 authorizing appropriations from FY2015 through FY2019 for stable and sustained increases in funding. The Senate version of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014, S. 2757, focuses on authorizing appropriations for NSF and NIST from FY2015 through FY2019. It does not include funding for the Office of Science. The bill also includes provisions for STEM education, such as directing the NSTC Subcommittee on STEM Education to seek input from stakeholders when updating the federal strategic STEM education plan. The Senate version of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014, S. 2757, focuses on authorizing appropriations for NSF and NIST from FY2015 through FY2019. It includes provisions for STEM education, such as developing guidance for federal agencies on informal STEM education and authorizing programs for STEM secondary schools at NSF. NASA is directed to continue STEM education and outreach activities, and NSF may establish a prize program for educational practices. Other provisions include evaluating federal science agency programs and policies. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2014, S. 2757, included provisions for STEM education, such as establishing a prize program for educational practices in STEM fields. It also directed NSF to maintain its criteria for evaluating grant proposals and authorized the expansion of the Innovation Corps program. Additionally, it would have reauthorized the Regional Innovation Program at the Department of Commerce and the National Nanotechnology Initiative. However, S. 2757 was not enacted."
