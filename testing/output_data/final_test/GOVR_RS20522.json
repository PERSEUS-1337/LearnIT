    "content": "The RAH-66 Comanche is a next-generation armed reconnaissance helicopter designed for stealthy penetration of enemy airspace and reconnaissance. It incorporates advanced computers and communications for a leading role in the digital battlespace with a wide range of weaponry. Its primary roles include seeking out enemy forces and designating targets for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter in adverse conditions. Originally, the Army planned to replace older helicopters with 5,023 Comanches, but budget constraints and force limitations have impacted this plan. The RAH-66 Comanche program faced budget constraints and force structure modifications, leading to significant changes. The utility transport version was canceled, and the procurement objective reduced to 1,292 armed reconnaissance helicopters. The program saw delays in production decisions, prototype reductions, budget cuts, and restructuring to add experimental operational capability helicopters. Despite these challenges, the Comanche program successfully completed tests and entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase with two prototypes built by Boeing-Sikorsky. Boeing-Sikorsky has built and flown two Comanche prototypes, with a third one expected to be flown in March 2005. The plan was to build five pre-production aircraft and deliver eight production aircraft by 2004. A total of 650 Comanches will be purchased, with 73 produced during Low Rate Initial Production. The Comanche program includes building nine EMD aircraft for training purposes by 2006. The Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is delayed to September 2009, with full-rate production of 60 aircraft per year starting in 2011. The production cost is reduced from $39.3 billion to $26.9 billion, with each Comanche estimated to cost $32.3 million. The Army aims to increase production to 96 aircraft per year to cut costs. The Comanche program has faced challenges due to concurrent development of multiple systems. A restructuring plan will delay certain capabilities to later blocks, including radar system and UAV control. Funds intended for Comanche upgrades will now be used for a companion UAV instead. Approximately $644 million will be spent on the UAV between 2004 and 2009. The Army is exploring the use of UAVs alongside Apache and Comanche aircraft. The Army has been experimenting with teaming UAVs with Apache and Comanche helicopters. It is uncertain if the Comanche's companion will be an operational UAV, one in development, or one specifically for the job. The final decision on Comanche numbers is pending, with plans for 819 Comanches to equip the Objective Force by 2008. Fielding detachments of 12 Comanche aircraft to brigade-strength units of action, accompanied by eight UAVs, is part of the plan. The RAH-66 Comanche program was reviewed by DoD's Inspector General in May 2002, who praised the restructuring efforts to reduce risk. Critics argue that the highly sophisticated helicopter is unnecessary in today's threat environment and its capabilities are too similar to the AH-64 Apache, questioning the justification for its costs. The DoD's Inspector General praised the restructuring of the RAH-66 Comanche program in May 2002. Critics argue that the helicopter's capabilities are too similar to the AH-64 Apache, questioning its cost justification. Some believe that the Comanche's reduced radar signature may not make it more survivable in modern conflicts. Supporters argue that the Comanche meets the criteria for deployability, reliance on forward bases, and versatility in today's low-intensity regional conflicts. Supporters argue that the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter satisfies deployability, reliance on forward bases, and versatility criteria for modern conflicts. An Army study comparing Comanche with other aircraft showed better situational awareness, survivability, and lethality. Comanche also improved the effectiveness of the AH-64D Longbow and reduced maintenance burdens. The RAH-66 Comanche helicopter's maintenance costs and effectiveness compared to other aircraft are debated. Studies show it may be more expensive to fly than the Kiowa Warrior but less costly than the AH-64D. The reduction in the Comanche program has led to a focus on improving the AH-64 Apache. The Army is considering improvements to the Apache, such as a life-extension program or upgrades, and possibly procuring more Longbow models. Questions arise about whether the Comanche should pursue certain features like external fuel or an air-to-air missile capability. There is uncertainty about upgrading the Comanche for 'heavy' attack requirements and maintaining its stealthy profile while carrying external weapons. Some doubt if the Comanche, which currently has weight problems, has the power needed for these upgrades. The Marine Corps is expected to seek a replacement for its AH-1Z Super Cobra helicopters around 2020, with a joint program with the Army being considered. Congress strongly supported the Comanche program by consistently meeting or exceeding DoD's budget requests for funding, urging for higher funding priority and full-scale production by 2004. House and Senate authorizers matched the Administration's request for FY04 Comanche funding. The Comanche program is the Army's major aviation development program, contributing to future warfighting missions with increased deployability, versatility, and lethality. Congress may need to consider the long-term capabilities if the Comanche buy is reduced and evaluate the return on the $6.8 billion R&D investment for 650 helicopters. Some argue that improved versions of the AC-130 and A-10, or the STOVL variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, could be more effective providers of Close Air Support to Army ground forces than the RAH-66. The need for the Comanche helicopter has been questioned, with some suggesting it could replace the Apache as the Army's premier attack helicopter. Consideration of export issues is crucial in any military program involving the Comanche. Consideration of export issues is crucial in any military program involving the Comanche helicopter. The potential for Comanche exports to sustain the aviation industrial base and balance U.S. trade is a key consideration. The question arises whether the Comanche, being less overtly designed for attack than the Apache, could be offered for export to a larger number of countries. However, due to its low observable features, there may be a need to limit Comanche exports to only our closest allies. The curr_chunk discusses various news articles and updates related to the Comanche helicopter program, including decisions made by the U.S. Army and the impact on companies like Boeing and UTX. The articles mention the reduction in the number of Comanche helicopters to 650, the Army's readiness to move forward with the program, and considerations for filling any gaps with Apache helicopters.

It mentions the reduction in the number of Comanche helicopters to 650, the Army's readiness to proceed with the program, and the possibility of filling gaps with Apache helicopters. The AH-64D Longbow is highlighted as an upgraded version of the AH-64A with advanced features. Maintenance requirements for the RAH-66 are projected to improve with advanced technologies, but will only be confirmed once the aircraft is in use.
