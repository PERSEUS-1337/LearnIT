    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48412 of the Education Code is amended to allow persons 16 years or older, or in 10th grade for one academic year, to verify basic skills proficiency for a \"certificate of proficiency\" equivalent to a high school diploma. The department will maintain a record of all certificates issued. The department will develop competency standards in basic skills taught in public high schools and conduct regular examinations in the fall and spring semesters to verify competency. Exams will be scheduled to allow for timely notification of results before the end of the semester in most school districts. The department may conduct examinations during summer recess or at other times as needed for eligible persons with religious convictions or physical handicaps. The department may charge a fee for examination applications to cover costs, not exceeding the cost of test renewal. Fees collected will be used for department expenses, with excess funds going to the General Fund. Examinees meeting specific criteria are exempt from the fee. Examinees meeting specific criteria, such as being homeless or a foster youth under 25 years old, are exempt from examination fees. Verification of homeless status can be done by a homeless services provider. The state board will adopt rules and regulations for implementing the section, including emergency regulations if necessary. The department will review the effectiveness of examinations periodically, with costs recovered through fees. The Superintendent must report to the Legislature by December 1, 2018, on homeless and foster youth taking high school proficiency tests, the impact of waived fees, future test takers, funding recommendations, administrative costs, and contractor reimbursements. The annual reimbursement to contractors for foster youth services is outlined, with a deadline for reporting set for January 1, 2020. Additional state funds cannot be allocated for this purpose. Foster youth are defined as individuals removed from their homes by the juvenile court under specific sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code.

A report must be submitted to the Legislature by December 1, 2018, detailing this provision. The Superintendent may adopt emergency regulations to implement provisions related to homeless and foster youth taking high school equivalency tests at no cost. This includes data on test takers, future projections, funding recommendations, administrative costs, and contractor reimbursements.
