TD-VAE is a generative sequence model that learns explicit beliefs about future states and is trained using temporal difference learning. Generative models of sequential data are widely applicable in various domains such as speech synthesis, neural translation, and image captioning. The paper focuses on reinforcement learning in partially observed environments, where agents need to build a representation of uncertainty to act optimally. While agents with memory could learn this implicitly through model-free reinforcement learning, the reinforcement signal may be too weak. Additionally, for model-based planning, agents need to be able to generalize to a collection of tasks. To plan in a model-based fashion, an agent must imagine consistent distant futures based on past experiences. Step-by-step planning is often unrealistic. A model should learn abstract state representations, belief states, and exhibit temporal abstraction for optimal decision-making. The paper introduces a new model called Temporal Difference Variational Auto-Encoder (TD-VAE) that can make 'jumpy' predictions and learn from temporally separated time points without backpropagating through the entire time interval. This model meets requirements not found in existing literature and shows improved likelihood in training deep state-space models. The full TD-VAE model learns from temporally extended data by making jumpy predictions into the future, training consistent simulators of complex 3D environments. It computes a neural belief state with good representation of uncertainty on the environment's state. Autoregressive models decompose joint sequence likelihood as a product of conditional probabilities, used to train an autoregressive model of data. The curr_chunk discusses the use of conditional generative models in various tasks such as handwriting synthesis, density estimation, image synthesis, audio synthesis, video synthesis, generative recall tasks, and environment modeling. These models have the potential weakness of only making predictions in the original observation space and not learning a compressed representation of data, leading to computational heaviness and instability at test time. Conditional generative models, like RNNs, have potential weaknesses in only making predictions in the original observation space. To address this, state-space models offer an alternative approach using latent variables to model transitions between states. These models consist of decoder and encoder networks to generate states and observations, with recent research exploring different model configurations. State-space models use latent variables to model transitions between states, with decoder and encoder networks generating states and observations. These models are commonly trained with a VAE-inspired bound, allowing reasoning about the conditional distribution of future data given the past. The distribution of future data given the past is crucial for reinforcement learning and generative sequence modeling. Sufficient statistics are needed to derive the optimal policy or enable conditional data generation. In autoregressive models, the internal RNN state serves as sufficient statistics, but for state-space models, an equivalent quantity is sought. State-space models use latent variables to model transitions between states, with decoder and encoder networks generating states and observations. In state-space models, the filtering distribution p(z t | x 1 , . . . , x t ) is crucial for computing the conditional future distribution. Training a network to extract a code b t can effectively form a neural belief state, fully characterizing the filtering distribution. Classical training of state-space models does not compute a belief state due to leakage of uncertainty in the autoregressive posterior. Resampling z t\u22121 would be required to obtain all information about z t from (x 1 , . . . , x t ). In state-space models, the filtering distribution p(z t | x 1 , . . . , x t ) is crucial for computing the conditional future distribution. The notion of a belief state and its connection to optimal policies in POMDPs is well known, but little work investigates computing belief states for learned deep models. A neural form of particle filtering has been used to represent the belief state explicitly as a weighted collection of particles. Predictive state representations (PSRs) and temporal abstraction are also important aspects to consider. In this section, a sequential model is developed that constructs a latent state-space and creates an online belief state. The model aims to optimize the data likelihood by decomposing it autoregressively. By inferring over two latent states, belief states are formed for times t-1 and t. The Markov assumptions simplify the model, and a belief over zt and a one-step smoothing distribution are decomposed for optimal policies. The model developed in this section constructs a latent state-space and creates an online belief state to optimize data likelihood. It decomposes a belief over zt and a one-step smoothing distribution for optimal policies. The model expresses a state model describing how the world's state evolves from one time step to the next. Planning for a trip abroad illustrates that the relevant timescale for planning may differ from the observation and action execution timescale. When planning for a trip abroad, the relevant timescale for making a plan may differ from the observation and action execution timescale. Models that can imagine future states directly, without going through all intermediate states, are beneficial for various reasons. These include stronger training signals from the future, independence from temporal sub-sampling choices, and avoiding jumpy predictions. Temporal jumps in predictions can be computationally efficient, especially when predicting multiple steps into the future. Various research directions explore this concept, such as using recurrent neural networks with skip connections to bridge distant timesteps. Different approaches involve sub-sampling data and building models with fixed or variable time-skips to predict future observations directly. These methods aim to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency by considering temporal jumps in the data.

Different approaches involve sub-sampling data and building models with fixed or variable time-skips to predict future observations directly. These methods aim to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency by considering temporal jumps in the data. In contrast, for more general problems, predicting future frames directly without learning appropriate states can be limiting. This is because the observations may not capture the full state of the system, leading to missing information needed for accurate predictions. To address this limitation, an extension of sequential TD-VAE is proposed to incorporate time abstraction. Temporal jumps in predictions can be computationally efficient, especially when predicting multiple steps into the future. A forward RNN encodes a belief state from past observations, but instead of relating information known at adjacent time steps, two distant time steps are related through their respective states. The TD-VAE model involves learning a jumpy, state-to-state model between these distant time steps. The negative loss for the TD-VAE model is calculated using a specific equation. The model's computation flow is detailed in FIG2. Different approaches for choosing the distribution of times for training the model are discussed. The model's computation flow is described in detail, including the development of a hierarchical version of TD-VAE with multiple layers of latent states. The goal is to predict future time steps by compressing relevant information into codes. The existence of a state capturing the world's condition at each time step is posited, with an agent at the current time making observations. The agent at time t2 uses its belief model to guess the state of the world by maximizing the likelihood of the current observation x t2 given the state z t2. A variational bottleneck penalty is applied to prevent encoding too much information from x t2 into z t2. The agent then questions if the state at time t2 could have been predicted from the state at time t1, requiring estimation of the state at t1 based on aggregated observations between t1 and t2. The agent uses its belief model to guess the state of the world at time t2 by maximizing the likelihood of the current observation. It computes a smoothing distribution and optimizes its predictive model of the world state. The agent assesses the predictability of the revealed information by minimizing the KL between the smoothing distribution and the belief distribution at time t1, resulting in the TD-VAE loss. The TD-VAE loss is obtained by summing all losses in reinforcement learning, where the agent models a belief about future states instead of discounted rewards. The model trains the belief at time t1 using belief at some future time t2, accomplishing this by variationally expressing possible future states. The TD-VAE model trains the belief at time t1 by auto-encoding a sample of the future state at time t2, ensuring consistency between beliefs at the two time steps. Experiments are conducted using a partially observed MiniPacman environment for training state-space models. The TD-VAE model outperforms filtering and mean-field models in modeling agent observations in a MiniPacman environment. Belief states capturing past experience and uncertainty are crucial for achieving a high score while avoiding ghosts. The TD-VAE model outperforms filtering and mean-field models in modeling agent observations in a MiniPacman environment by learning the state and rolling forward in jumps. The model is trained on sequences of MNIST digits moving in different directions, showing improved performance compared to restricting the encoder to obtain a belief state. The TD-VAE model is trained on sequences of MNIST digits moving in different directions. It aims to predict future inputs by sampling states and rolling out sequences of frames. The TD-VAE model can roll forward samples in steps of more than one time step, preserving motion direction. It can build a state with little information and sample states far into the future from noisy data of a harmonic oscillator. The TD-VAE model can predict the future state of a noisy harmonic oscillator, including frequency and magnitude, but struggles with accurately predicting position. The model uses an LSTM and a hierarchical structure with two layers to capture latent variables. The TD-VAE model utilizes a hierarchical structure with two layers, where latent variables in the higher layer are sampled first. The belief, smoothing, and state-transition distributions are feed-forward networks. Training is done on sequences of length 200, with random time intervals. The model accurately predicts the state of the system. The TD-VAE model accurately predicts the state of the system by utilizing a hierarchical structure with two layers. The model shows that the state z t2 is predicted correctly with the correct frequency and magnitude of the signal. Additionally, the model improves the quality of the belief state through training. The harmonic oscillator has different frequencies in each interval, and the model needs to learn the relation between these frequencies to correctly model the signal. In the final experiment, a binary classifier is trained from the belief state to the final frequency f4, comparing models with LSTM architecture trained on next-step prediction vs TD-VAE loss. Results show TD-VAE performs better with longer separating time intervals and smaller LSTM sizes. The model is then tested on a visually complex domain using sequences of frames from DeepMind Lab environment to demonstrate explicit beliefs about possible futures. The model uses convolutional LSTMs to represent beliefs about possible futures, with time skips sampled uniformly. Samples from the belief state decode to similar frames, indicating a belief about multiple futures. The model uses convolutional LSTMs to represent beliefs about possible futures with time skips sampled uniformly. Different i's decode to different frames, showing beliefs about multiple futures. Training on time separations, the model moves forward and rotates, as shown in FIG4 with 4 rollouts. The paper argues for a model different from an accurate simulator, presenting TD-VAE as a sequence model that bridges time points to encode the future explicitly. The text discusses the application of TD-VAE in modeling complex settings and its potential uses in reinforcement learning. It introduces an approximate ELBO for training the one-step TD-VAE and explores modifications for a jumpy TD-VAE training regime. The model utilizes convolutional LSTMs to represent beliefs about future states with time skips, showcasing multiple possible futures. The text introduces a jumpy state-space model for subsequence modeling, enriching the posterior distribution over states by incorporating the entire sequence. This approach utilizes belief states at subsampled times to derive a loss function similar to TD-VAE, showcasing the use of auxiliary variables for a stronger posterior. In this section, a general recurrent variational auto-encoder is discussed, focusing on how constraints outlined in previous sections lead to the TD-VAE model. The architecture includes forward-backward encoder RNNs and a forward decoder RNN, allowing for the generation of arbitrarily long sequences. Various works fall under this framework. The desired properties include sampling forward in latent space. The architecture of a general recurrent variational auto-encoder is discussed, emphasizing constraints that lead to the TD-VAE model. The encoder must not feed into the decoder or prior of latent variables for forward sampling in latent space. The belief state represents knowledge up to time t and cannot receive input from the backwards decoder. The encoder can have alternating layers of forward and backward RNNs, with connections adjusted accordingly. The model should ideally have unrestricted access to information without being disturbed by sampling or information bottlenecks. Using the forward encoder for computing the belief state prevents running backwards inference. Sampling from the belief state can provide a glimpse into the future, allowing for inference on what the world would have looked like given this future. The model uses VAE training to sample from posterior and prior distributions at different time points, obtaining VAE losses and a reconstruction term. The framework presented in the main paper aims to learn models by bridging temporally separated time points and modeling the world with different hierarchies of state. The model presented aims to learn hierarchies of state by using a stacked (hierarchical) version of the model, extending to L layers with a deep LSTM. The model implements deep inference, where higher layers influence lower ones, and samples downwards to generate higher level representations before lower level ones. The model implements deep inference with a stacked hierarchical version using a deep LSTM with L layers. The distribution of one layer depends on samples from the posterior distribution in previously sampled layers. The order of inference follows the direction of generation, from higher to lower layers. The model uses a recurrent neural network to summarize latent variables and does not share weights between layers. Functional forms used in the model include a hidden layer size of 50 for D maps and a size of 8 for zlt. Belief states have a size of 50, and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0005 is used. The same network is used for the MNIST experiment with modifications such as pre-processing observations with a two hidden layer MLP. The decoder in the model has a two-layer MLP that outputs the logits of a Bernoulli distribution, with observations pre-processed by a two hidden layer MLP with ReLU nonlinearity. The input \u03b4 t is not used in any network."
