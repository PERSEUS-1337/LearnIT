    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fiscal Year 2016 Department of Veterans Affairs Seismic Safety and Construction Authorization Act\" and authorizes certain major medical facility projects for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $35 million for seismic corrections to Building 208 at the West Los Angeles Medical Center and $158 million for a new research building at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The Department allocated funds for various construction projects at different Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, including a new community living center in Long Beach, seismic corrections in West Los Angeles, and critical construction projects in multiple locations. The Department lacks authorization to use funds for major medical facility projects, including critical seismic safety projects in California, increasing the risk of life-threatening building failures in case of a seismic event. California faces a high risk of a major earthquake in the next 30 years, with even smaller quakes posing a threat to unsafe buildings. Seismic events of magnitude 6.0 or higher occur approximately every 1.2 years in the state. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized to carry out seismic corrections in San Francisco, including retrofitting high-risk buildings, with a budget not exceeding $180,480,000. The funding allocated for seismic corrections and construction projects in various locations including West Los Angeles, Long Beach, Alameda, Livermore, Louisville, and Perry Point amounts to a total of $927,062,000. In Perry Point, Maryland, $92,700,000 is authorized for seismic corrections and renovations. In American Lake, Washington, $16,260,000 is allocated for building construction. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized $1,113,802,000 for construction projects in fiscal year 2016. These projects can only use funds from fiscal year 2016 or earlier. Funds for Construction, Major Projects, allocated for fiscal years before and after 2016, available for obligation."
