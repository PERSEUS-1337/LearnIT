    "content": "The federal workforce and the rights of federal agencies and employees have been the focus of legislative proposals and the Trump Administration. Statutory limits on removing or demoting federal employees stem from reforms to the earlier patronage system. The Pendleton Act of 1883 was passed due to discontent with the corruption of the system. The Pendleton Act of 1883 reformed the patronage system of public employment by requiring federal employees to be hired based on merit. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 further modernized the civil service system by creating a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel actions against federal employees. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 established an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review to protect federal employees and regulate agency actions such as removal, demotion, and suspension. The Act provides legal protections, authorizes challenges to agency decisions, and directs review to the Merit Systems Protection Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The report primarily focuses on the CRSA's applicability to the competitive service, excluding performance-based actions and certain categories of employees. It briefly discusses constitutional protections for federal workers under the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the federal government to follow specific procedures when taking away life, liberty, or property. It also protects against the deprivation of \"property interests\" without due process, which can include public employment created by federal law. Public employees have a constitutional property interest in their continued employment, which can be created by federal law. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) ensures that covered employees cannot be removed from federal service without cause or unacceptable performance, giving them a property interest in continued employment that cannot be deprived without due process. Congress is not obligated to provide a property interest to federal employees, but once it does, it must be respected. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) gives covered employees a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment, which cannot be deprived without constitutionally adequate procedures. Courts balance factors to determine the process due, including the private interest affected, risk of erroneous deprivation, and government interest. Individuals with a property interest in continued employment are entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before agency action. Prior to termination, an employee is entitled to notice of charges, an explanation of evidence, and an opportunity to present their side. The type of procedures required for due process depends on the severity of the deprivation and the totality of the proceedings. Less formal pre-deprivation proceedings are allowed when a subsequent full hearing and judicial review are available. The Supreme Court in Gilbert v. Homar upheld immediate suspension of a public employee arrested for a felony, stating post-deprivation procedures can satisfy due process when quick action is necessary. The right to be heard is not unlimited, and agencies can take adverse action for false statements in response to misconduct charges. Employees can exercise their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves. Employees have the right to exercise the Fifth Amendment and remain silent, but agencies can consider this silence when evaluating charges. The CSRA's provisions may overlap with constitutional requirements, but due process may sometimes require additional protections. In a case reviewed by the Federal Circuit, ex parte communications containing new and material information to the decision maker were found to violate due process, as they prevent the employee from receiving notice of the reasons and evidence for adverse actions. In Ward v. United States Postal Service, the Federal Circuit ruled that ex parte communications regarding an employee's penalty determination violate due process by preventing the employee from receiving notice of the reasons and evidence for the agency's decision. The court rejected a distinction between communications on the basis for adverse action and those on the appropriate penalty, stating that both types of communications are problematic. Ex parte communications on an employee's penalty determination violate due process. In adverse actions, \"egregious\" behavior creates a rebuttable presumption for removal promoting service efficiency. The Federal Circuit in Allred v. Department of Health and Human Services emphasized the need for employees to rebut this presumption with countervailing evidence. The CSRA categorizes federal employees and determines procedural protections. The CSRA categorizes federal government employees into SES, competitive service, and excepted service groups, providing procedural protections for actions taken against them. SES employees hold high-level positions above General Schedule 15 and are selected based on merit. SES members are selected based on merit and serve as a bridge between career staff and political appointees in federal executive agencies. The CSRA outlines specific requirements for SES employees, separate from competitive and excepted service employees. Competitive service generally covers all civil service positions in the executive branch except for SES positions, those appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, or those exempted by statute. Certain positions outside the executive branch and in the government of the District of Columbia may also be included in the competitive service. The CSRA provides procedural protections for government employees, including SES members, competitive service employees, and excepted service employees. Chapter 75 of Title 5 outlines protections for major adverse actions such as removals, suspensions, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs. Agencies can only take major adverse actions for cause that promotes efficiency of the service, as interpreted by the Federal Circuit. These protections apply only to covered employees. Chapter 75 of Title 5 provides protections for covered employees, including individuals in the competitive service and preference eligibles in the excepted service. When taking adverse actions, agencies must give 30 days' notice, allow employees to respond, and provide a written decision. Covered employees can appeal to the MSPB for review. Employees covered under Chapter 75 of Title 5 can appeal adverse actions to the MSPB, which can order remedies like reinstatement and backpay. The MSPB will uphold agency decisions if supported by evidence and must establish conduct, nexus to service efficiency, and reasonableness of penalty. Employees can appeal MSPB decisions to the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit will uphold the MSPB's decision unless it is arbitrary. The MSPB's decision is upheld by the Federal Circuit unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or unsupported by substantial evidence. To sustain an adverse action, the agency must show cause that promotes efficiency, establishing a nexus between misconduct and agency functions. Certain on-duty offenses are inherently linked to service efficiency. The MSPB has outlined three circumstances in which an agency can establish a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service. This includes egregious misconduct creating a rebuttable presumption, misconduct affecting job performance or trust, and demonstrating the impact on job performance by a preponderance of evidence. The agency can establish a nexus between off-duty misconduct and job performance by demonstrating that the misconduct interfered with the agency's mission. Certain egregious conduct can create a rebuttable presumption of this nexus, such as off-duty criminal misconduct involving sexual abuse of a minor or drug trafficking. The Federal Circuit has affirmed these rulings, emphasizing the importance of proving the impact on job performance by a preponderance of evidence. The Federal Circuit requires the MSPB to establish clear standards for determining a nexus between off-duty non-criminal misconduct and job performance. In a case where an employee was removed for videotaping sexual encounters without consent, the court overturned the decision, stating that a presumed nexus was not justified. The court ruled that the Board lacked a clear standard for determining when private dishonesty constitutes misconduct affecting job efficiency. Without such a standard, removal actions could be arbitrary and based on subjective moral judgments. The case was remanded for the Board to establish a meaningful standard for evaluating non-criminal misconduct. The MSPB can uphold removal decisions if an employee's misconduct affects job performance or agency trust. Examples include cases where criminal behavior jeopardized safety or disrupted agency operations. The MSPB can uphold adverse actions if an employee's off-duty misconduct undermines their effectiveness as a public representative for the agency or interferes with the agency's mission. This includes cases where behavior is antithetical to the agency's programs or undermines public confidence in the agency. The Federal Circuit upheld an adverse action against a civilian employee of the Marine Corps for engaging in an adulterous affair with a deployed Marine's wife, as it undermined trust with Marine families essential to the employee's job responsibilities. The Board has authority to review and mitigate agency penalties based on factors outlined in Douglas v. Veterans Administration, including the nature of the offense, the employee's job level, past disciplinary and work record. The Board reviews and mitigates agency penalties based on factors such as the nature of the offense, job level, past disciplinary record, performance, ability to get along with coworkers, dependability, impact on job performance and supervisor confidence, consistency of penalty with others, rehabilitation potential, mitigating circumstances, and clarity of rules violated. The MSPB reviews and mitigates agency penalties based on various factors, including the nature of the offense, past disciplinary record, performance, and consistency of penalty with others. The choice of penalty is determined by the employing agency and can only be overturned if unreasonable in light of relevant factors. The MSPB may modify a penalty if the agency fails to weigh relevant factors or if the penalty clearly exceeds reasonableness. An important consideration is whether similar offenses are treated comparably, and disparate treatment of analogous employee situations can result in mitigation of the agency's penalty. The MSPB reviews agency penalties based on various factors, including the nature of the offense, past disciplinary record, and consistency with others. If an employee claims unfair treatment compared to similarly situated employees, they must show substantial similarity in charges and circumstances. The agency must then justify any different treatment with a legitimate reason. Agencies can change policies, but must still provide a valid reason for any discrepancies in treatment. The CSRA allows agencies to apply more stringent disciplinary actions in the future by notifying employees effectively. Major adverse actions under Chapter 75 include removals, demotions, furloughs under 30 days, and suspensions over 14 days. Indefinite suspensions for disciplinary reasons lasting more than 14 days are considered major adverse actions. The MSPB and Federal Circuit have ruled that indefinite suspensions qualify as adverse actions. To sustain an indefinite suspension against a covered employee, an agency must meet procedural requirements similar to major adverse actions under Chapter 75. The suspension must be based on a cause promoting service efficiency and have a nexus to the service's efficiency. The MSPB emphasizes that indefinite suspensions must have an ascertainable end, even though the exact duration may not be known. Such actions must include a condition subsequent to terminate the suspension. The MSPB has outlined specific situations where indefinite suspensions are justified, such as for criminal behavior, medical reasons, or access to classified information. Agencies must provide advance notice of adverse actions, but immediate suspension is allowed in cases of alleged criminal behavior. The ultimate penalty imposed by the agency must be reasonable, with a clear end to the suspension. Chapter 75 allows agencies to immediately suspend an employee if there is reasonable cause to believe they have committed a crime. The focus is on events prior to the suspension to determine if reasonable cause was established, not on whether the employee should be convicted. Substantive defenses to criminal prosecution should be addressed in a criminal trial, not as a challenge to the agency's decision. The Board must examine the agency's decision based on the grounds invoked, without substituting its own reasoning. An agency can establish reasonable cause for immediate suspension if an employee is believed to have committed a crime. This can be done through its own investigation or by relying on third-party accounts like the police or courts. The agency must establish reasonable cause for immediate suspension based on the grounds invoked, without substituting its own reasoning. The formality of procedures used by third-party entities plays a role in meeting the threshold. A formal judicial determination or indictment following an investigation satisfies the standard, while a mere arrest without probable cause does not. In cases in between, the agency may need to delve into the record to ensure sufficient justification for summary action. The MSPB has ruled that \"reasonable cause\" is essential for immediate suspension. The MSPB has ruled that a grand jury indictment or a probable cause determination by a judge is sufficient to establish \"reasonable cause\" for immediate suspension without the need for an independent investigation by the agency. Additionally, the Board has upheld indefinite suspension based on an employee's arrest and arraignment for a probation violation, especially if the employee has a prior felony charge or guilty plea to a felony offense. The Board has ruled that a guilty plea to a felony offense or a criminal charge resulting in \"Probation before Judgment\" can establish reasonable cause for suspension. An indefinite suspension was upheld in a case where the employee was charged with a misdemeanor and ordered to appear for a jury trial. The Board also upheld a reasonable cause finding based on a criminal complaint. The agency's reasonable cause finding can be supported by various sources, such as criminal complaints, sworn statements, and third-party findings. Even if individual sources may not be sufficient on their own, a combination of them can still justify a reasonable cause finding. For example, an employee's admission of guilt to the investigating agency can meet the threshold requirement, even if criminal proceedings are still pending. However, the Board has ruled that an agency cannot indefinitely suspend an employee based solely on its own investigation into allegations of criminal conduct. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) requires agencies to have reasonable cause to believe an employee has committed a crime before taking adverse action. Mere suspicion or an arrest warrant is not enough, and evidence supporting a grand jury indictment is generally necessary. The agency's decision can be reversed if only \"mere suspicion\" is shown, as seen in a case where reliance on written statements fell short of the required proof. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) requires agencies to establish reasonable cause before taking adverse action based on an arrest. Mere suspicion or an arrest warrant is not sufficient. The MSPB ruled against an agency that relied on an employee's arrest without further investigation, emphasizing the need for official police reports and witness statements. Similarly, the MSPB rejected an indefinite suspension based solely on an arrest and a conversation with the employee admitting to being arrested. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) requires agencies to establish reasonable cause before taking adverse action based on an arrest. The agency must conduct a thorough investigation, including examining police reports and witness statements, to justify an indefinite suspension. Simply relying on an arrest or a conversation with the employee admitting to being arrested is not sufficient. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) mandates agencies to have reasonable cause for adverse actions based on arrests. Simply relying on an arrest and arraignment, without further investigation, may not justify an indefinite suspension. Federal employees' rights are safeguarded by statutory and constitutional requirements, including procedural protections under the CSRA. Congress has provided procedural protections to civil servants through the CSRA, outlining conditions for agencies to take adverse actions against federal employees. Agencies can only take actions for misconduct that promote service efficiency, following procedural provisions for employees to defend themselves. Employees have a property interest in continued employment with constitutional protections ensuring due process. These protections inform statutory rules on adverse actions and may influence proposals to modify the process of removing federal employees. Proposals to modify the process of removing federal employees may be considered by lawmakers when amending civil service laws."
