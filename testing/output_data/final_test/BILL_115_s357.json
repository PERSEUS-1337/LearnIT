    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act, titled the \"Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act,\" defines key terms such as conservation district, exchange land, map, and non-public exchange parcel. The Act defines terms such as public exchange parcel, public land, and Secretary, related to the Santa Ana River Wash Plan Land Exchange Act. SEC. 3. EXCHANGE OF LAND; EQUALIZATION OF VALUE. The Secretary shall exchange public land with the conservation district, equalizing values as necessary, within 2 years of this Act's enactment. The conservation district will transfer land to equalize values with an equalization payment if necessary under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The appraisal will determine fair market values for exchanged properties. The appraisal will include the public and non-public exchange parcels' fair market values, which will be credited against any required equalization payment. If the credit is not enough to offset the full payment, the conservation district may pay the remaining amount to the United States. The Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 states that if a conservation district chooses not to make an equalization payment, the land exchange will not proceed. If the exchange land value exceeds the public land value, the Secretary can order the exchange without additional payment from the United States. The Secretary will finalize a map and legal descriptions of the land to be conveyed under the Act for public inspection. Costs of Conveyance: The conservation district must pay any conveyance-related costs. SEC. 4. APPLICABLE LAW. The Act of February 20, 1909 does not apply to public land and any exchanged land under this Act. The exchange of lands is subject to the conservation district's rights for groundwater recharge facilities in the Bunker Hill Basin. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 applies to the exchange of land or non-public exchange parcels, which may be held or managed under this Act. Cancellation of Secretarial Order 241 from 1929, withdrawing public land for a transmission line, is revoked."
