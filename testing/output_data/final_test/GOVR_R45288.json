The growth in dual-military married couples and single parents serving on active duty also rose. As a result, family-oriented benefits and programs, such as the DOD's child development program, have become essential components of servicemember compensation packages. This report discusses the development and oversight of DOD-sponsored childcare services, focusing on the justification, components, policies, funding, and legislative history. DOD considers childcare services crucial for enhancing force readiness and morale. Congress is presented with issues and options related to oversight and funding of military childcare programs. DOD-sponsored childcare services support mission readiness, retention, and morale of the total force. Quality childcare reduces lost duty time and distractions for servicemembers. Childcare benefits are linked to improved recruitment, morale, and retention. Active duty servicemembers list childcare as a top stressor related to military life. Research suggests that DOD must offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain talent in the all-volunteer force. Studies show mixed results on the impact of employer-sponsored childcare on employee performance and satisfaction, with some indicating positive links, especially for employees without family support. Research on the impact of employer-sponsored childcare on employee performance and satisfaction is mixed. While some studies show positive relationships between childcare benefits and reduced turnover, other research suggests limited empirical evidence of significant effects on individual performance or productivity. Military families, especially single parents and dual military couples, may experience childcare challenges that affect readiness and retention decisions. Some military families have indicated that childcare issues could lead them to leave the military. Some military families, especially those with pre-school age children, are more likely to leave the military due to childcare challenges. Family-friendly benefits may lead to perceived inequities and negative effects on morale for childless workers or parents unable to use the benefits. Research shows mixed attitudes towards specific family-friendly benefits but no overall impact on attitudes towards the organization. Military families have unique childcare needs due to frequent permanent change-of-station moves. PCS can disrupt consistent childcare arrangements for military families, especially for single-parent servicemembers or couples with both parents in the service. DOD tracks Demand Accommodation Rate to measure childcare needs, with 78% accommodation reported in FY2015. Wait list data reflects the demand affected by demographic factors. In 2014, there were 10,979 children on waiting lists for military childcare, with 73% being ages 3 and under. Waiting lists may not accurately represent total childcare demand as families may seek other options due to long wait times. Waiting list numbers could also overestimate demand if families remain on lists after a PCS. Demand for military childcare can fluctuate based on various factors such as parental preferences, availability of community-based options, deployment schedules, and mission requirements. In 2017, 61.1% of married-couple families with children under 18 had both parents working outside the home. Approximately 41% of military servicemembers have dependent children, with 2% in dual-service marriages, 6% as single parents, and 32% having dependent children. The total military child population under the age of 13 is approximately 1.2 million, with 34% aged 3 and under. A 2017 survey found that 47% of active duty spouses were employed, with 51% of those not employed wanting to work. Childcare challenges were a top reason for not working, and 67% of military families struggle to find suitable childcare. The DOD offers childcare programs for children from birth to 12 years old. The Military and Community Family Policy Office oversees child and youth programs in DOD. Childcare is not guaranteed for servicemembers, who must have care plans for dependents. DOD offers Child Development Centers, Family Child Care, and School-age Care as part of its child development programs. In FY2017, the Military and Community Family Policy Office operated over 628 Child Development Centers and nearly 2,600 Family Child Care homes to provide childcare for military and DOD civilian employees. The Navy had a higher number of certified FCC homes due to their cost-effective nature compared to CDCs. The focus will be on facility-based care. The CDCs provide facility-based care for military service members, surviving spouses, and DOD civilians. Eligibility for CDC services is determined by DOD, with priority categories based on the child's sponsor's employment status. Military rank, paygrade, or financial need are not criteria for priority. The CDP is the second largest appropriated-fund program among DOD's quality of life programs. The military Child Development Program (CDP) is funded through various accounts, including MILCON, O&M, and MWR. In FY2017, approximately $843 million in O&M funds were allocated to CDPs, with $17 million designated for emergency childcare support. OCO funds are used to provide emergency and respite childcare services for servicemembers during deployments. MILCON funding for CDC facilities varies depending on need. The funding for military Child Development Programs (CDPs) varies annually based on need. Family Child Care (FCC) facilities in military housing receive subsidies from appropriated funds for construction and maintenance. CDCs are funded by a mix of appropriated and non-appropriated funds. Appropriated funds cover operation and maintenance costs, while non-appropriated funds mainly cover staff salaries. NAF are used to pay for staff salaries at CDCs, with funds sometimes subsidized by MWR activities. The installation commander can allocate MWR-generated revenues to childcare services, but reliance on these subsidies may be problematic due to their unreliability. Concerns about inequity for servicemembers who do not require childcare services may arise if too much MWR revenue is used for family-related benefits. Military childcare programs generate approximately $400 million in non-appropriated funds annually through parent-usage fees. The Secretary of Defense establishes CDC fees annually, adjusted for cost of living increases, and can use appropriated funds to subsidize family home day care providers. Each family pays a sliding scale fee based on total income, with childcare not considered an entitlement. The military childcare program offers sliding scale fees based on total income, with fees ranging from $222 to $944 per month per child. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services benchmarks affordable childcare at 7% of family income for low-income families. An E-5 would pay approximately 9.7% of their income for childcare fees for one child under the standard fee structure. The average annual cost for center-based childcare for one infant in high-cost states like California is $23,077, and $12,393 in lower-cost states like South Carolina. Military childcare fees are generally lower than civilian center-based care fees. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that out-of-pocket childcare costs have nearly doubled between 1985 and 2011. DOD centers do not have variable fees for infants. Childcare decisions for military parents can be complex, with limited information about provider options and quality of care at new duty stations. DOD's regulations for military childcare centers have stricter standards than civilian centers and are ranked highest in national assessments. DOD uses accreditation and certification rates to monitor childcare program quality. Accreditation is a costly process that ensures quality standards in civilian childcare centers, which may be unaffordable for some military servicemembers. Without DOD-subsidized options, military families may resort to informal childcare arrangements. National accreditation organizations evaluate providers based on various criteria such as curriculum, staff competencies, and relationships. Costs for accreditation vary by the number of children and are typically awarded for a five-year term. The accreditation process promotes quality assurance in childcare. Accreditation for childcare centers involves self-assessment, signaling quality to parents, and improving staff morale. Critics argue it burdens staff, but studies show it enhances care quality at minimal cost. Military centers were mandated to meet accreditation standards by 1996. As of 2015, 97% of DOD CDCs were nationally accredited, close to the goal of 98%. DOD FCCs are encouraged to seek accreditation. CDC and SAC facilities must meet operational standards including DOD's UFC and OSHA standards. CDCs undergo unannounced inspections at least four times a year. The law requires immediate remedy of any safety, health, or child welfare violations at military child development centers, with exceptions for non-life-threatening violations. If not remedied within 90 days, the center must be closed until the violation is fixed, unless waived by the Secretary of the military department. Childcare centers must meet the same standards as CDCs and undergo inspections by FCC staff. DOD achieved a 100% certification rate goal for FY2015. Childcare employees must meet training requirements including early childhood development, child abuse prevention, and CPR. At least one employee at each CDC must specialize in training and curriculum development to ensure a qualified workforce. The law requires competitive pay for CDC employees to recruit a qualified workforce. They also receive federal benefits and access to military installation amenities. Background checks are mandatory for all individuals interacting with children. FCC providers receive training and operate as independent contractors. In response to a 2012 incident at a CDC in Fort Myer, VA, DOD implemented a new policy in 2015 to strengthen background check procedures. The policy requires DOD components to ensure timely completion of background checks and involves parents in oversight through a board at each CDC. The federal government's involvement in childcare dates back to the Great Depression and was further expanded during World War II with the passage of the Lanham Act of 1940. During World War II, the Lanham Act of 1940 provided grant funding for childcare for children ages 0-12 while women worked outside the home. Over 550,000 children nationwide received care from these programs. After the war, funds were withdrawn with the expectation that women would resume childcare duties at home. In the 1950s and 1960s, non-working spouses mainly provided care for military servicemembers. Today, over 50% of the total active duty force is married, with females accounting for approximately 16% of the force. Between 1970 and 1980, the demand for military childcare services increased due to the inclusion of more women and career-oriented personnel with dependents in the all-volunteer force. The proportion of women in the military rose from 2.5% to over 6%, and the number of dual military marriages also grew during this time. In 1975, the Department of Defense instructed services to stop discharging pregnant or custodial mothers involuntarily. Between 1970 and 1980, the demand for military childcare services increased as more women joined the workforce. The quality of childcare services on DOD installations came under scrutiny, with a lack of specialized training for teachers and aides noted in a 1976 survey. In 1978, DOD formalized government responsibility for installation childcare centers as part of the military's MWR program. Congress allocated funds for new childcare facilities in 1982 due to deficiencies in existing centers. These deficiencies included lack of emergency evacuation access, lead-based paint peeling, and leaking roofs. The GAO highlighted issues with military childcare facilities, such as lack of emergency evacuation access, lead-based paint peeling, and leaking roofs. It was suggested that DOD establish minimum standards for group size, caregiver ratios, educational activities, staff training, and food services. In 1985, the Military Family Act created an Office of Family Policy within the DOD to coordinate programs for military families. The Military Family Act of 1985 established the Office of Family Policy within the DOD to coordinate programs for military families. In 1988, the Office played a key role in formulating the Defense Department's Instruction for Family Policy, which laid the groundwork for current military childcare programs. Allegations of child abuse at military installations in the late 1980s led to a special investigative team being established by the DOD, following a congressional inquiry in 1988. In 1988, a congressional inquiry was launched to address allegations of child abuse at military installations. Issues raised included staff-to-child ratios, lack of background investigations for employees, and inadequate procedures for preventing and responding to abuse. Other concerns included exemption from licensing standards, lack of quality programming, low wages for childcare employees, and limited funding for necessary repairs and upgrades. Capacity issues and unsuitable civilian alternatives were also highlighted. In 1989, Congress passed the Military Child Care Act (MCCA) to improve the quality, safety, availability, and affordability of military childcare. The law standardized health and safety inspections, increased caregiver salaries, required parental participation, and mandated DOD oversight. It also authorized funds to subsidize family home day care providers and required a subsidized CDC fee structure based on family income. Employee quality was to be improved through credentialing and mandatory training. The Military Child Care Act (MCCA) mandated training for employees, accreditation of military childcare centers, establishment of a national hotline for child abuse reporting, and creation of a child abuse task force. The Military Family Act and MCCA were amended under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. DOD can now subsidize civilian childcare programs outside military installations, with providers needing to meet DOD regulations and standards for eligibility. The Senate Committee supports the financial assistance to enhance quality of life services for children of military personnel and eligible federal employees. The Military Family Act and MCCA were amended to allow DOD to subsidize civilian childcare programs for eligible federal employees. Childcare subsidies are provided through Operation and Maintenance funds, with a subsidy covering the difference between installation-based care and community-based care up to a certain cap. Childcare Aware of America administers the fee assistance subsidy services, supporting over 15,000 military families in 2016. The President is required to review the military compensation system every four years, with the 10th QMRC focusing on military quality of life programs. Concerns were raised about DOD's management of these programs. The authors of the report raised concerns about DOD's management of the childcare program, noting limited availability, lack of priority based on need, and unclear impact on force management goals. The QRMC made recommendations to improve equity, efficiency, and access to the childcare benefit. The authors recommended prioritizing families of deployed soldiers and servicemembers in critical occupations for childcare assistance. They suggested implementing a pilot voucher program and increasing investment in family child care. Despite existing DOD policies, priority levels have not been adjusted accordingly. Congress mandated biennial reports on childcare assistance, and in 2011, President Obama launched an initiative to support military families. The initiative to support military families focuses on childcare and child development. The military needs 37,000 more childcare slots. The Military Family Federal Interagency Collaboration aims to increase childcare availability and quality for military families in 20 states. The Collaboration is working on improving access to quality childcare. The National Defense Authorization Act established a commission to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Commission submitted recommendations in 2015, including standardized reporting of childcare wait times and exempting childcare personnel from hiring freezes. The Commission recommended improving access to childcare on military installations by providing DOD with information and budgeting tools to do so within 90 days of need. The FY2016 NDAA proposed a survey on childcare for military families, but it was not adopted. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 authorized the use of funds for constructing childcare facilities. The authority to add over 9,000 childcare spaces through additions and renovations to existing facilities was extended in the FY2008 NDAA. The MCRMC recommended reauthorization of this provision and proposed changes to raise the threshold for minor military construction projects. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced enhancements to the military childcare program in 2016 as part of a broader military personnel reform initiative. DOD's proposed changes aim to extend military childcare center hours to a minimum of 14 hours per day to align with servicemember work hours. Servicemembers would receive 12 hours of subsidized care, with additional hours at full cost. The initiative is expected to cost DOD $230 million over five years. Congressional concerns about childcare services arose due to a hiring freeze in 2017. The FY2018 NDAA (P.L. 115-91) addressed recruitment and hiring issues for CDC positions in the military. It modified hiring authorities for military childcare employees, required consideration of active and reserve component patrons when setting CDC hours, and authorized direct hire authority for qualified childcare providers within DOD CDCs. The FY2018 NDAA addressed recruitment and hiring issues for military childcare services providers within DOD CDCs. Section 576 of the bill requires a review of pay grades to ensure fair wages. Congress debates the provision of childcare support and oversight concerns for DOD's CDP. Opposition to government support of childcare programs is based on social, fiscal, or equity concerns. Some argue that government support for childcare programs raises social, fiscal, and equity concerns, suggesting that childcare should be a parental responsibility. There are concerns that subsidized childcare may lead to negative outcomes for children and families, such as increased negative behaviors and reduced parental relationship quality. In 2017, the U.S. experienced its lowest birthrate in 30 years, leading to potential economic consequences and strain on entitlement programs like Social Security. Accessible and affordable childcare can help improve fertility rates and labor-force outcomes for women, allowing them to pursue careers outside the home. Center-based childcare has both positive and negative social and behavioral effects on children compared to home-based or parental care. High-quality center-based childcare has slight benefits for children's cognitive, social, academic, and language skills, especially for those from low-income households. Some argue that government regulation or subsidies for childcare can ensure broad access to quality care as a societal good, potentially benefiting children and parents. In the military, this could provide better financial security for junior enlisted and single-parent families. Some argue that the federal government has a national security interest in providing high-quality childcare for military families to improve the recruiting pool. Studies show youth with military family members are more likely to serve, benefiting the military in the long term. However, there are arguments against government sponsorship of childcare, citing inequity and discrimination. Some argue that the federal government should have a smaller role in providing social welfare programs like subsidized childcare, suggesting state and local governments or private/nonprofit groups should take the lead. Concerns have been raised about rising personnel costs in DOD-funded childcare programs, with some advocating for prioritizing war-fighting capabilities over expanding personnel benefits. Advocates for DOD-sponsored childcare services highlight the importance of competitive benefits to attract and retain talent, especially during periods of force growth and low civilian unemployment. Congress must consider whether certain childcare activities should be funded or incentivized. DOD's current childcare programs include on-installation care, training, support for privatized care, subsidies for off-installation care, and providing information about private childcare options. The Navy has historically had a large number of certified Family Child Care (FCC) providers, which are noted for being lower cost compared to Child Development Centers (CDC). A 2002 RAND study found that the average annual cost per infant in a CDC was more than twice as much as in an FCC. FCCs operate in private residences with lower overhead costs, while CDCs have full-time administrative staff. In 2015, the Navy reported that 94% of FCC providers were military spouses, offering employment opportunities while freeing space at CDCs. FCCs provide flexibility for drop-in services, care for sick children, and care outside normal hours. FCC care is available for infants from four weeks old, with a cap of six children per provider. The Family Child Care (FCC) program starts at six weeks with a cap of six children per provider. Some parents prefer the in-home setting for more discretion over caregivers, but there are limitations such as potential moves affecting continuity of care. Military spouses often operate in-home care but may face challenges with frequent moves and lack of backup caregiving options. Starting up and certifying home-based care in a new location can be burdensome. The process of certifying a new Family Child Care (FCC) location can take anywhere from two to nine months, including background checks, home inspections, and training. FCC homes may have less oversight compared to government-operated facilities, making Child Development Centers (CDCs) a more preferable option for servicemembers due to stability, convenience, continuity of care, and oversight. CDCs offer employment opportunities for military spouses, are typically located on military installations for convenience, and can accommodate more children than FCCs. Some research suggests children in center-based care are sick more often than those in home-based care, potentially causing more time off for military parents. The cost of building and maintaining CDC facilities is significant, with a need for repairing and replacing aging facilities. While some prefer care on the installation for proximity to work, others may find it more convenient to have care near their residence in the civilian community. Distance from the installation affects the likelihood of using CDC care. The farther a family lives from the installation, the less likely they are to use CDC care. The fee assistance program offers benefits such as more choice in care models and opportunities to build social networks in the community. Military families express a desire to connect with non-military families in their neighborhoods. Fee assistance programs can increase local connections, especially for families living off base. Reservists, who often live farther from military installations, could benefit from these programs. Subsidizing private childcare could improve the quality of childcare services in the community. Some concerns about fee assistance programs for non-DOD affiliated providers include limited coverage for extended duty hours and higher costs compared to on-installation care. Military families may face challenges with preferred private childcare providers not meeting DOD standards for fee assistance subsidies. One alternative could be providing fixed stipends to military parents for childcare subsidies. Supporters propose a system to subsidize childcare for military personnel, offering more choice and flexibility in selecting providers. Cash benefits are seen as more efficient than in-kind benefits. Some military families were unaware they were receiving subsidies for childcare. A survey found that most personnel prefer maintaining existing quality of life benefits over cash vouchers. A proposed system to subsidize childcare for military personnel suggests exchanging benefits for cash vouchers, raising questions about oversight and accountability. Cash stipends could vary based on factors like the child's age or the family's working status. Non-DOD financial support for childcare is also available at the state level. Non-DOD financial support for childcare includes state and federal programs offering grants, subsidies, and tax credits. Military families may receive assistance through installation referral centers and private childcare centers. Oversight issues related to access, equity, and quality exist. Military childcare programs are highly rated and seen as a model for other employers or agencies. Military families express frustration over lack of awareness of available non-CDC support, CDC wait-list management issues, desire for longer or more flexible CDC hours, and need for more infant spots. DOD and military services use various outreach methods for childcare services, but some members, especially in the Guard and Reserves, are unaware of all available services, eligibility requirements, and subsidized services in local communities. In response to challenges faced by military families with childcare services, the Department of Defense has implemented initiatives such as assigning dedicated staff, providing targeted information for expectant parents, and launching MilitaryChildCare.com in 2015. This online portal helps members find childcare services, submit care requests, and join waiting lists for military CDCs. Additionally, Child Care Aware of America assists military families in finding accredited care centers for off-installation care. The online portal MilitaryChildCare.com helps military families find accredited care centers, determine eligibility, and apply for subsidies. Concerns remain about wait list management, with wait times exceeding DOD's target of 90 days. Family advocacy groups are concerned about wait list priority and the length of waiting lists, especially in high-demand areas. Some family advocacy groups argue for higher wait list priority for active servicemembers over DOD civilian employees due to frequent PCS moves for military families. They suggest income-based placement on wait-lists to prioritize CDC placement for families who can least afford off-installation care. Current law requires DOD to set fees based on family income but does not establish priority categories for military childcare wait-lists. The time spent on a wait list depends on geographic demand and CDC capacity. Options to expand CDC capacity on high-demand installations include building new facilities or expanding existing space. Potential barriers to expansion include lack of physical space and military construction funding. Construction projects have long lead times and may not accommodate short-term demand surges. Recruiting and hiring childcare workers to maintain caregiver-to-child ratios can also be a limitation. Staffing issues, such as federal hiring freezes and background check delays, have slowed hiring for CDCs in the past. Staffing issues, including federal hiring freezes and background check delays, have slowed the pace of hiring for CDCs."
