    "content": "In 2017, Social Security and Medicare provided financial security to elderly and disabled individuals in the United States. 61.9 million individuals received Social Security benefits, with 69% being retired workers aged 62 or older and 14% disabled workers aged 61 or younger. Nearly 90% of the U.S. population aged 65 or older received Social Security benefits, representing about 33% of their income. For half of married elderly couples, Social Security made up 50% or more of their income, and for 23% of couples, it was 90% or more. In Medicare, 58.4 million individuals were enrolled, with 85% aged 65 or older and 15% disabled and aged 64 or younger. Total Social Security expenditures were $952.5 billion (4.9% of GDP) and total Medicare expenditures were $710.2 billion (3.7% of GDP) in 2017. In 2017, individuals could enroll in either Social Security or Medicare. Those enrolled in both programs may have financial implications. Social Security beneficiaries and Medicare Part B enrollees have their Medicare premium deducted from their Social Security benefit. Adjustments to benefits and premiums are based on different inflation measures. Social Security uses CPI-W for cost-of-living adjustments, while Medicare premiums are based on program expenditure growth. The relationship between Social Security COLAs and Medicare premium growth is discussed in this report. Congress has implemented measures to protect beneficiaries from large Medicare Part B premium increases, such as the hold-harmless provision. This provision prevents individuals from facing higher Medicare Part B premiums if it would cause their Social Security benefits to decrease. However, certain groups of beneficiaries are not covered by this provision, and increases in Medicare Part D premiums are not included. The report discusses the relationship between Social Security COLAs and Medicare premiums, including the activation of the hold-harmless provision for certain beneficiaries. It also explains the projected impact of Medicare premium growth on Social Security benefits over the next 75 years. Social Security provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members, with eligibility based on earnings credits from Social Security-covered employment. To be eligible for Social Security retired-worker benefits, individuals need 10 years of Social Security-covered employment. Full retirement benefits are payable at the full retirement age, which has been raised to 67 for workers born in 1960 or later. Retired workers can start receiving benefits as early as age 62, but the benefits will be reduced. In 2017, over half of new retirees had not reached the full retirement age before claiming their benefits. Social Security benefits are also available to disabled workers, their dependents, and survivors of deceased workers. Social Security benefits are available to disabled workers, their dependents, and survivors of deceased workers, accounting for 27% of total beneficiaries in 2017. A retired worker's monthly benefit is based on past earnings, calculated using a progressive formula applied to career-average earnings adjusted for wage growth. The process involves determining the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) and computing the primary insurance amount, which provides a higher replacement of earnings for low-paid workers compared to high-paid workers. The average Social Security benefits for retired workers are adjusted based on various factors, including when benefits are claimed, pension income, and continued work earnings. In July 2018, the average monthly benefit for retired workers was $1,414.73. Social Security funds are divided into the OASI Trust Fund and DI Trust Fund, funded by payroll taxes, income taxes, and interest income. The Social Security Administration adjusts beneficiaries' monthly benefits annually to maintain purchasing power. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is announced in October for payment in January, based on the Consumer Price Index-Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W reflects inflation for clerical and wage earners, affecting 29% of the population. The Consumer Price Index-Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is used to calculate the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for beneficiaries. The COLA is based on the percentage increase in the average CPI-W from the third quarter of the base year to the third quarter of the current year. If there is deflation, the COLA will be 0.0%. In recent years, there have been instances of no COLA or low COLA due to negative or low inflation. The Social Security COLA in recent years has been low or non-existent due to low inflation rates. Medicare, established in 1965, provides health insurance for the elderly and disabled. It consists of four main programs: Part A covers hospital services, Part B covers physician services, and enrollees pay premiums and deductibles. Medicare consists of four main programs: Part A covers hospital services, Part B covers physician services, Part C (Medicare Advantage) is a private plan option that covers all Part A and Part B services except hospice, and Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Enrollees pay monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and coinsurance rates for most services. Part D plans offer standard or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits, and may also offer enhanced coverage for additional premiums. Medicare Part A coverage is available for individuals aged 65 or older who have worked in covered employment and paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters. Those not entitled to premium-free Medicare Part A can enroll but must pay a premium. Medicare Part B is a voluntary, premium-based program for those enrolled in Part A. Medicare Advantage is an alternative option for those eligible for Part A and Part B benefits. Approximately 36% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, while around 76% are enrolled in Medicare Part D. Medicare is funded through the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Part B and Part D. Funds for Medicare Advantage costs come from both trust funds. The HI Trust Fund is primarily funded by payroll taxes, and the SMI Trust Fund is funded by general revenue transfers and beneficiary premiums. Individuals receiving Social Security benefits have Medicare Part B premiums automatically deducted from their checks. Those not receiving Social Security are billed by Medicare quarterly. Standard Medicare Part B premiums are set at 25% of average per capita costs for the aged. The Medicare Part B program costs for the aged are based on estimated expenditures for the year. The monthly premium includes a contingency margin for cost variations and a $3.00 surcharge since 2016. Premiums are standard nationwide and not based on age, health, or location. The standard Medicare Part B premium in 2018 is $134.00 for individuals with a MAGI of $85,000 or less and couples with a MAGI of $170,000 or less. High-income beneficiaries pay higher premiums based on their income, ranging from 35% to 80% of the projected per capita Medicare Part B costs. Adjustments known as income-related monthly adjustment amounts are made to cover a greater percentage of Medicare Part B costs than the standard premium. In 2018, high-income Medicare Part B enrollees with a MAGI greater than $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount ranging from $53.50 to $294.60. Approximately 6% of Medicare Part B enrollees pay high-income-related premiums. Low-income enrollees may qualify for assistance through Medicare Savings Programs. Medicare enrollees may be eligible for full benefits through the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program or have their Part B premiums paid by Medicaid or the federal government. The Medicare Part D base premium is set annually based on per capita costs for prescription drug coverage. Premiums are adjusted based on bids from drug plans and the plan the beneficiary enrolls in. The Medicare Part D base premium is $35.02 in 2018, but actual premiums vary by plan. High-income enrollees may pay higher premiums based on their MAGI. The income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) is calculated based on income thresholds. The Medicare Part D high-income-related premium is determined based on beneficiary income, with higher-income beneficiaries facing a larger monthly premium adjustment. Low-income subsidies are available for some enrollees, covering the cost of monthly premiums and cost-sharing based on income levels. Low-income subsidies cover monthly premiums, deductibles, and reduce cost sharing for eligible individuals. Those with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level may qualify for partial subsidies. Social Security benefits and Medicare Part B premiums are adjusted annually, with Medicare premiums typically increasing more than Social Security benefits due to different adjustment methods. Since 2000, Social Security COLAs have ranged from 0.0% to 5.8%, with an average of 2.2%. Medicare Part B premiums have also increased annually, ranging from -13.4% to 17.4% since 2000, with an average increase of 6.1%. Since 2000, Medicare Part B premiums have fluctuated from -13.4% to 17.4%, averaging a 6.1% increase. The 13.4% decrease in 2012 was due to fewer individuals being held harmless after a 3.6% COLA. Increases in premiums have historically exceeded Social Security COLA increases, with Medicare Part B premiums growing close to 195% compared to a 50% increase in Social Security benefits since 2000. The hold-harmless provision in the Social Security Act prevents certain beneficiaries' benefit amount from decreasing due to an increase in Medicare Part B premiums. The number of individuals held harmless can vary depending on inflation rates and Medicare costs. In years with no Social Security COLA, many individuals may be affected by this provision. In 2018, 2% Social Security COLA and 28% of Medicare Part B enrollees were held harmless. In 2016, with no Social Security COLA, 70% of Medicare Part B enrollees were held harmless. The hold-harmless provision does not apply to Medicare Part D premiums, so beneficiaries may see a decrease in their Social Security check if their Medicare Part D premium increases. Some groups, like new enrollees, may receive reduced Social Security benefits due to higher Medicare premiums. New enrollees to Medicare or Social Security, high-income individuals paying income-related Medicare Part B premiums, low-income beneficiaries in a Medicare Savings Program, and certain federal employees may not be protected under the hold-harmless provision for Medicare Part B premiums. The hold-harmless provision for Medicare Part B premiums protects beneficiaries based on the relationship between premium increases and Social Security COLA. It can impact future premium amounts, as illustrated in Table 2 for a hypothetical individual retiring in 2008. The hold-harmless provision for Medicare Part B premiums can impact future premium amounts for beneficiaries. For example, in 2012 and 2018, premiums increased for certain individuals not protected under this provision. In certain years, individuals not protected by the hold-harmless provision may bear a disproportionate burden of meeting the 25% requirement for Medicare Part B premiums. For example, in 2010, approximately 70% of enrollees were held harmless, paying lower premiums, while those not held harmless faced higher costs. In 2016, approximately 70% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries were held harmless from a premium increase, while those not held harmless would have seen their premiums increase to around $159 per month. This increase was a result of premiums needing to cover 25% of expected per capita expenditures. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changed the Medicare Part B premium calculation methods for 2016. The standard premium for those not held harmless was $121.80, with higher premiums for high-income individuals. Low-income beneficiaries receiving assistance from Medicare Savings Programs have their premiums paid by Medicaid. The Medicare Trustees project that Medicare beneficiaries will use a larger portion of their Social Security benefits to pay Medicare Part B and Part D premiums in the future. For example, in 2018, the Medicare Part B and Part D premiums account for 12.4% of the average Social Security benefit; this is expected to increase to approximately 14.0% in 2028 and to 16.8% in 2092. Out-of-pocket costs are also expected to absorb an increasing amount of the average Social Security benefit, projected to increase from approximately 23.6% in 2018 to approximately 26.9% in 2028. The projected increase in average Social Security benefits, Medicare Part B and Part D benefits, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs is shown in Figure 2. The percentage of Social Security benefits used for Medicare premiums is expected to rise from 12.4% in 2018 to 16.8% in 2092. Out-of-pocket costs are projected to increase from 23.6% in 2018 to 34.5% in 2092."
