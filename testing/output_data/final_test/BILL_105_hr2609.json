Congress finds that methyl bromide is a crucial pesticide for protecting plants and agricultural products, with American farmers relying on it for over 100 different crops. There are limited safe alternatives available, with potential risks to human health and the environment. In 1992, the Montreal Protocol amended to include methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting substance. Despite its importance in agriculture and scientific uncertainties, the EPA listed methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting chemical under the Clean Air Act, freezing US production at 1991 levels and ending production by January 1, 2001. The Montreal Protocol amended in 1992 to include methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting substance, leading to a freeze in US production at 1991 levels and a complete ban by January 1, 2001. Analysis predicts a 43 percent decline in affected vegetable acreage in Florida, with estimated costs of up to $1.5 billion in five states where methyl bromide is most utilized. The Montreal Protocol amended in 1992 to include methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting substance, leading to a freeze in US production at 1991 levels and a complete ban by January 1, 2001. The definitions in this section clarify terms related to pesticide use and control, including the meaning of \"use as a pesticide\" and \"Administrator.\" It also restricts the EPA Administrator from controlling the production, importation, or export of methyl bromide for pesticide use under the Clean Air Act. The EPA Administrator may take action to regulate the consumption or use of methyl bromide as a pesticide, or require labeling of agricultural products treated with methyl bromide if viable substitutes or alternatives are available, as certified by the Secretary of Agriculture. The control would only apply to specified applications, commodities, and products as per the certification. The EPA Administrator may take action under the Montreal Protocol to regulate methyl bromide for use as a pesticide, with controls no more stringent than required by the Protocol and applicable to all parties. This includes exemptions for production, importation, export, and consumption. The EPA Administrator may regulate methyl bromide for use as a pesticide under the Montreal Protocol, with controls not exceeding Protocol requirements. All EPA rules not mandated by the Protocol are repealed. Certain regulatory provisions, like exemptions and flexibility, remain unaffected by this Act."
