    "content": "Only hospitals participating in Medicare with emergency departments are required to screen patients under EMTALA. Hospitals without dedicated emergency departments and unaffiliated emergency care providers are not subject to EMTALA. The First Circuit declined to extend EMTALA protections to a 24-hour emergency room clinic in rural Puerto Rico as it was not associated with a hospital. The First Circuit reversed a decision regarding the screening requirement under EMTALA, stating that the text of the statute is clear. HHS regulations define when an individual has \"come to the emergency department\" for screening, including cases where the patient is en-route to the hospital in hospital-owned transport. The First Circuit reversed a decision on EMTALA screening requirements, stating that regulations allow hospitals to redirect non-owned ambulances in diversionary status. However, a court ruled that EMTALA could apply to incoming non-owned ambulances, emphasizing the goal of preventing patient dumping. The majority of federal circuits interpret EMTALA as requiring hospitals to provide an appropriate medical screening exam to prevent patient dumping, even if the ambulance is not owned by the hospital. The Sixth Circuit, however, has a narrower interpretation of the statute. The Sixth Circuit has a narrow interpretation of EMTALA, requiring an \"improper motive\" for a violation. The stabilization requirement applies to all Medicare hospitals with emergency departments, and in some cases, even without one. It is triggered when a hospital discovers an emergency medical condition. Hospitals must ensure individuals are stabilized before discharge or transfer, as defined by federal regulations. Failure to detect an emergency condition may lead to civil liability under state medical malpractice claims. Unlike the screening requirement, the stabilization requirement does not qualify the care to be given. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that no \"improper motive\" is needed to show a violation of EMTALA's stabilization provisions. Hospitals may admit individuals for further treatment once an emergency medical condition is detected. The issue of whether the stabilization requirement applies after admission is disputed, with some circuits stating that once admitted, hospitals have no enforceable stabilization duties under EMTALA. However, the Sixth Circuit ruled differently in Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hospital, where a stroke victim alleged being discharged from the ICU without stabilization, violating EMTALA. The Sixth Circuit ruled that EMTALA still required stabilization before discharge, despite inpatient status. The Supreme Court declined to rule on this issue in Roberts v. Galen, but the Department of Health and Human Services intended to provide guidance through rule-making procedures. In 2002, CMS proposed extending EMTALA protections to inpatients, but reversed its position in 2003 after considering comments on the Bryant v. Adventist decision. After a screening exam, a hospital admitting an individual for emergency treatment satisfies EMTALA duties. HHS clarified that EMTALA doesn't apply if a patient needs transfer to a specialized hospital after being admitted elsewhere. The Sixth Circuit ruled that mere admission without treatment doesn't meet EMTALA requirements. In Moses v. Providence Hospital, the court found CMS regulations contrary to EMTALA, stating hospitals must provide treatment to stabilize emergency conditions before discharge. Admitting without treatment does not satisfy EMTALA, potentially leading to medical malpractice liability under state law. The CMS regulations may offer a way to avoid EMTALA liability by admitting and discharging patients, but compliance with CMS's interpretation may not protect hospitals from state law claims. Admitting emergency room patients could align with EMTALA's goal of preventing patient \"dumping.\" Once admitted, EMTALA liability may be considered unnecessary as state medical malpractice law could ensure necessary treatment. The defendant hospital in Moses sought Supreme Court review, but the Court declined, indicating a split in circuit authority on EMTALA's application to admitted patients. The Sixth Circuit's decision in Moses considered the retroactive application of CMS regulations on inpatient status, noting potential adverse effects on patient expectations. Despite alternative grounds, the court held that CMS's interpretation should not have retroactive effect in the specific case. The CMS issued a notice in 2010 to revisit EMTALA regulations on hospital obligations beyond admitting patients with emergency conditions. They requested real-world examples of admitted patients being transferred despite the hospital's ability to treat them. The stabilization requirement may override state laws allowing physicians to refuse treatment based on medical judgment. The Fourth Circuit ruled that a hospital cannot refuse to treat an anencephalic infant in respiratory distress, even if the physician believes treatment would be futile. EMTALA preempts state laws allowing physicians to refuse care they deem inappropriate. All transfers must have qualified personnel and equipment, and the receiving hospital must consent to the transfer. An individual can only be transferred to another hospital with their consent and the receiving hospital must have the necessary capacity and expertise. Medical records must be sent along with the transfer. The transferring hospital is responsible for ensuring a proper transfer and remains liable under EMTALA until it is completed. It is allowed to transfer an unstable individual if medically necessary, with a qualified medical person certifying the benefits outweigh the risks. EMTALA provides a civil remedy for harm caused by a hospital's violation. In 2009, the Sixth Circuit ruled that EMTALA provides a civil remedy for third parties injured due to a hospital's violation of screening or stabilization requirements. A hospital was sued for discharging a psychiatrically unstable patient who later murdered his wife. The defendants argued that the wife lacked standing under EMTALA since she wasn't personally denied treatment. The House Judiciary Committee issued a report stating that EMTALA allows for two types of actions for damages: one by the patient directly harmed by a hospital's failure to screen, stabilize, or transfer them properly, and the other by a medical facility receiving an improperly transferred patient. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the defendants' argument that third parties cannot sue under EMTALA, emphasizing that legislative history should not override the statute's actual wording. This interpretation could have implications for hospitals. The court's interpretation of the civil enforcement provision under EMTALA allows harmed third parties to bring civil suits against hospitals for personal harm suffered as a direct result of the hospital's actions. This could have consequences that Congress may not have anticipated."
