    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing America From Terrorist Entries Act\" or the \"SAFTE Act\". The Congress finds that US border security agencies are overwhelmed with visits, current systems are inadequate, and the USA PATRIOT Act will enhance border security to identify individuals entering and exiting the country. Most 9/11 terrorists entered with approved visas without being identified by immigration authorities. Terrorist organizations in various countries pose a threat to the United States, with individuals on the FBI's most wanted list connected to attacks on the US. Mohamed Atta, organizer of the 9/11 attacks, was able to enter and exit the US multiple times despite being on the terrorist watch list. The 9/11 hijackers were mostly Saudi citizens who entered the US on approved visas. The suspects in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing were also Saudi citizens. Yemen has been designated a haven for terrorists, with operatives responsible for the 1999 USS Cole attack. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN ALIEN IMMIGRANT AND NONIMMIGRANT VISAS. During the moratorium period, no immigrant or nonimmigrant visa for admission to the United States may be issued to an alien who is a citizen or national of specific countries listed, or was a citizen or national of those countries within 15 years of the visa application. The countries affected include Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. The moratorium prohibits issuing visas to citizens or nationals of specific countries, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, as well as any country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to countries determined by the Secretary of State to have supported international terrorism. Diplomatic visas are exempt from this restriction. The moratorium prohibits issuing visas to citizens or nationals of specific countries, including those who hold multiple citizenships. Aliens described in the restriction are ineligible for a waiver under the Visa Waiver Program. Diplomatic visas are exempt from this limitation. The moratorium period starts 5 days after the Act's enactment and ends 30 days after certification by the Attorney General. The certification must confirm full implementation of certain sections and the use of biometric data in visas. The Attorney General can grant exceptions to the moratorium for certain aliens. The Attorney General can allow the admission of certain aliens to the United States if it is in the national interest or for family unity, and if denying entry would cause extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen or lawful resident spouse, parent, or child. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES FOR PURPOSES OF DEPORTATION. Amendment to INA to broaden definition of terrorist activities for deportation. Retroactive application of the amendment to all aliens. SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT FOR PASSENGER MANIFESTS FOR FLIGHTS IN FOREIGN AIR TRANSPORTATION TO THE UNITED STATES. Section 44909 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require air carriers and foreign air carriers operating passenger flights to the United States to provide a passenger and crew manifest to the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security within 60 days of enactment. The manifest must include the full legal names of passengers and crew members. The passenger and crew manifest for flights to the United States must include full legal names, date of birth, citizenship, sex, passport number, country of issuance, visa number or resident alien card number, and any other information deemed necessary for aviation safety by the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security. Passenger and crew manifests for flights to the United States must be transmitted to the Under Secretary in advance of landing, as prescribed. The Under Secretary may also require manifests to be sent directly to other federal agencies. The Attorney General will require Federal border officials to ask individuals entering the US about their country of origin. Section 217(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to remove waiver authority for machine-readable passports implementation. Additionally, a GAO study will be conducted. The General Accounting Office will submit biannual reports to Congress evaluating reforms in the Immigration and Naturalization Service, preventing terrorists from entering the US, monitoring alien travel, cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and background checks for visa-seeking aliens. The General Accounting Office will submit biannual reports to Congress evaluating reforms in the Immigration and Naturalization Service, preventing terrorists from entering the US, monitoring alien travel, cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and background checks for visa-seeking aliens. Additionally, the effectiveness of border security measures and visa background checks for aliens seeking entry to the United States will be assessed."
