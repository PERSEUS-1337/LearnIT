    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Drill Act of 2010\". The Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 resulted in the largest oil spill in US history, costing billions in economic damages and environmental devastation. BP has spent over $4 billion in response efforts, highlighting the importance of preventive measures like acoustic switches and blowout preventers. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill cost over $20 billion, surpassing BP's $20 billion claims fund. Acoustic switches for oil wells cost around $500,000 each. SEC. 3 amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require lessees to use the best available technology and have a plan to respond to oil spills. SEC. 4 outlines requirements for existing offshore oil and gas leases. The Secretary of the Interior mandates that holders of oil and gas leases must certify the use of best available technology within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. Failure to do so may result in suspension or cancellation of the lease. The Secretary of the Interior requires oil and gas lease holders to certify a response plan for oil discharge within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Failure to comply may lead to suspension of operations. If the certification required under paragraph (1) is not made within 6 months after the enactment of the Act, the lease may be canceled. If the certification is not made within 18 months, the lease shall be canceled. The Secretary of the Interior is required to review and revise regulations for blowout preventers, emergency shutoff systems, and oil discharge prevention technology used in oil and gas drilling operations on leases under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act."
