    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act of 2002\". Congress finds that approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States have juvenile diabetes, where the immune system attacks the pancreas. Insulin-producing pancreatic islet cell transplants offer hope for a cure, improving quality of life and life span for those with the condition. Islet cell transplants are a promising development in diabetes, with 80 percent of patients maintaining normal glucose levels without insulin after 1 year. The main challenge is the limited supply of pancreases for transplantation. The Federal Government should promote policies to increase pancreas supply for research and facilitate islet cell transplantation advancements. Islet cell transplantation aims to become a standard therapy covered by insurance, moving away from being an experimental procedure. SEC. 3. Organ procurement organization certification amended to include pancreases used for islet cell transplantation or research. SEC. 4. Interagency committee on islet cell transplantation established. Establishment of the Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation within the Department of Health and Human Services, composed of representatives from various agencies and National Institutes of Health. The Committee's chairperson is from the National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases. The Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, will study federal research funding, policies affecting pancreas supply, xenotransplantation, UNOS variances, and data collection mechanisms. The Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation will develop recommendations and submit annual reports to increase the supply of pancreases for islet cell transplantation. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requests a study on the impact of islet cell transplantation on the health-related quality of life and economic outcomes for individuals with juvenile diabetes. The study will examine the health-related quality of life of juvenile diabetes patients before and after pancreatic cell transplantation, including clinical outcomes and quality of life measures. The study will assess the impact of pancreatic islet cell transplantation on health-related quality of life outcomes, including patient worry about hypoglycemia, ability to perform daily functions, and impact on family members. Cost-effectiveness analysis will compare transplantation to standard medical management for juvenile diabetes patients, considering post-treatment costs and benefits like healthcare resource utilization. The study will evaluate post-transplant health care resource utilization and long-term health care resource utilization due to diabetes complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and vascular disease leading to sight and limb loss. Indirect measures like time lost at work and productivity analysis will also be considered. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: Sums as necessary are authorized for carrying out this Act."
