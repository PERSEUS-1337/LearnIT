    "title": "AB 1890",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2016, also known as Section 1, addresses the wage gap issue where women earn $0.79 for every dollar a man earns. This gap is even wider for women of color, with African American women earning $0.60 and Latinas earning $0.55 for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men in 2015. This wage disparity resulted in a yearly average wage gap of $10,762 in 2015, totaling more than $490 billion in lost wages for working women annually. Disparities in pay for women have significant negative impacts, shortchanging them and their families by thousands of dollars annually. Pay equity is crucial for the economic security of families, with many mothers being primary breadwinners. Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental principle in the US and California, with laws prohibiting gender-based pay discrepancies. The United States Department of Labor proposed a rule for federal contractors with over 100 employees to submit an annual equal pay report. California state contractors must comply with equal pay laws and provide wage data to promote pay equity. The Legislature aims to promote pay equity, nondiscrimination, and obtain better data on pay equity. An employer seeking to contract with the state for public works or services must comply with nondiscrimination requirements and submit periodic reports on compliance. The Department will share these reports with the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls. The department may require employers to submit a nondiscrimination program and comply with specified requirements. Approval and certification of the program may be necessary. The definition of an employee for this purpose will be provided by the department. Employees in the construction industry under certain conditions may be excluded from the employer's total number of employees calculation. A nondiscrimination program must ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, including policies on employment selection procedures and employee compensation data by worker race, national origin, and sex. This includes reporting the total number of workers and wages for specific job categories. The total hours worked annually for workers in a specific job category are reported by race, national origin, and sex. Exempt employees are presumed to work 40 hours a week for full-time and 20 hours a week for part-time, unless a different standard is used by the employer. Every state contract and subcontract for public works or goods/services must include a nondiscrimination clause prohibiting discrimination based on specified factors. Contractors and subcontractors must notify labor organizations of their obligations under the clause. The clause does not apply to credit card purchases under $2,500, with an annual exemption limit of $7,500 per company for state agency credit card purchases. State agencies are responsible for monitoring and adhering to these restrictions on credit card purchases. The department will develop rules and regulations for implementing nondiscrimination programs in state contracts and subcontracts, including procedures for approval, monitoring, and enforcement. The rules will also specify the size of contracts exempt from certain provisions, circumstances where contractors may not be subject to the rules, and criteria for determining the scope of a contractor's nondiscrimination program. The department will establish procedures for coordinating nondiscrimination requirements with state and federal laws, as well as develop principles and standards for administering this section. Submission of affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination programs required by federal compliance agencies can be done with the department, serving as prima facie compliance with local ordinances. Employers are not required to submit affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination programs to local agencies for approval before becoming contractors or subcontractors. The department may recommend sanctions for violations of the section or its rules. Changes to the section do not affect exemptions in place before January 1, 2017."
