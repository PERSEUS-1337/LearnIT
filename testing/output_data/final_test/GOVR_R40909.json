The Broad Front retained majorities in both houses of Congress. Mujica's administration is expected to continue V\u00e1zquez's policies. V\u00e1zquez's presidency marked the end of 170 years of political dominance by the National and Colorado parties. President V\u00e1zquez of Uruguay followed moderate social democratic paths, advancing market-oriented economic policies while implementing social welfare programs to reduce poverty and inequality. Despite a major economic crisis between 1999 and 2002, Uruguay's economy stabilized. President V\u00e1zquez of Uruguay signed a $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the IMF to calm investor fears and improve economic stability. The agreement included fiscal surplus, low inflation, debt reduction, and structural reforms. Despite terminating the agreement in 2006, Uruguay maintained policy commitments and addressed poverty and inequality during V\u00e1zquez's term. President V\u00e1zquez of Uruguay faced criticism for prioritizing market-friendly economic policies over social welfare concerns. He implemented the National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES), providing cash transfers, food cards, homeless shelters, health coverage, and job training programs to reduce poverty. PANES was later replaced by the Plan for Social Equity, and V\u00e1zquez introduced new programs to expand opportunities. President V\u00e1zquez of Uruguay introduced programs like Plan Ceibal and Plan Cardales to expand opportunities through technology and provide social welfare. He also passed laws to prevent discrimination against workers and increased the power of unions through labor reforms. Additionally, the tax system was overhauled to be more progressive. The V\u00e1zquez Administration in Uruguay has implemented progressive tax reforms, leading to strong economic growth and significant reductions in poverty. Since 2005, the country's GDP has grown by 7% annually, debt has decreased from 66% to 26% of GDP, and investment has reached a historic high of 19% of GDP.

Despite a slowdown due to the global financial crisis, the economy rebounded in 2009. The V\u00e1zquez Administration has addressed human rights violations from the dictatorship era, with tens of thousands forced into exile and thousands imprisoned or killed. Previous governments had only created a peace commission to investigate the country's past. The V\u00e1zquez Administration initiated investigations into human rights abuses during the dictatorship era, leading to excavations of military barracks uncovering remains of the \"disappeared,\" release of dictatorship files, compensation for political prisoners, and reinterpretation of the amnesty law to exclude crimes committed outside Uruguay as part of a regional coordination plan. The V\u00e1zquez Administration in Uruguay investigated human rights abuses during the dictatorship era, leading to the uncovering of remains of the \"disappeared,\" release of dictatorship files, compensation for political prisoners, and reinterpretation of the amnesty law to exclude crimes committed outside Uruguay as part of a regional coordination plan known as \"Operation Condor.\" Former military and police members have been tried and jailed, including former dictators Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry and Gregorio \u00c1lvarez. Some security forces members criticized the government for allegedly rewriting history. Despite a failed referendum to repeal the amnesty law in 2009, a Supreme Court ruling deemed the law unconstitutional in a case involving the death of a political prisoner in 1974, potentially leading to the reopening of more cases.

The TIFA formalizes a commitment to pursue closer trade and economic ties, establishing a Council on Trade and Investment to liberalize bilateral trade and investment. In October 2008, the United States and Uruguay signed protocols on trade facilitation and public participation in trade and environment.
