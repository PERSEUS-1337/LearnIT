    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"President Harry S Truman Congressional Gold Medal Act\". President Truman served as President of the United States from 1945 to 1953, supported the United Nations, and played a key role in ending World War II. He provided aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent communist takeovers and supported free peoples resisting subjugation. President Truman played a crucial role in implementing the Marshall Plan for economic assistance in Europe, supporting West Berlin during the Soviet blockade, and establishing NATO to strengthen the Atlantic Alliance. President Truman supported measures to strengthen the Atlantic Alliance and integrate Western European countries. He fought for domestic programs to improve American lives and promote social justice, desegregated the Armed Forces to combat racism, and oversaw the reorganization of the US Government to meet postwar demands, creating key institutions like the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. President Truman's Point Four Program aimed to foster economic growth and human uplift in underdeveloped countries. He led the resistance against aggression in Korea to avoid a world war, support the United Nations, and maintain freedom. In retirement, he founded the Harry S Truman Library to educate Americans, especially young people, about their history and government. President Truman's accomplishments are recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal to be presented to Margaret Truman Daniel on the 50th anniversary of his 1st inauguration. The gold medal will be designed and struck by the Secretary of the Treasury, with an appropriation not to exceed $20,000. Additionally, duplicate medals are authorized. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal under certain regulations to cover costs. The proceeds from sales will reimburse the appropriation used for the gold medal. The medals struck under this Act are considered national medals."
