    "content": "The \"No Taxation on Device Innovation Act\" repeals the medical device excise tax and prohibits major integrated oil companies from using last-in, first-out accounting. The effective date for the amendments is after December 31, 2017. The amendment prohibits major integrated oil companies from using a specific inventory method for taxable years starting after December 31, 2017. Taxpayers affected by this change must initiate and implement a new accounting method. The amendment requires taxpayers affected by the change to implement a new accounting method with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments under section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must be spread out over a period not exceeding 8 taxable years. SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR NEW LEASES AND THE TRANSFER OF LEASES. The term \"covered lease\" refers to a lease for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico that meets specific criteria. The term \"lessee\" includes any person or entity that controls or is controlled by the lessee. The Secretary of the Interior, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, must not issue new leases for oil or gas production to a person unless they renegotiate existing leases to include royalty payments based on specified price thresholds. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits the issuance of new oil or gas production leases unless existing leases are renegotiated to include royalty payments based on specified price thresholds. A person eligible for a new lease is a lessee holding a covered lease on the date of consideration or one who transferred a covered lease after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, any person with a direct or indirect interest in or benefit from a covered lease is also eligible. The Secretary may implement separate agreements with multiple lessees of a covered lease to modify payment responsibilities, including price thresholds equal to those in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The lessee or any person with an interest in a lease cannot transfer any covered lease or its economic benefits without renegotiating payment responsibilities to include price thresholds equal to or less than those in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Secretary may agree to amend leases in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico to include price thresholds for royalty relief based on market prices. This applies to leases issued between January 1, 1996, and November 28, 2000, and aligns with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Secretary may amend leases in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico to include price thresholds for royalty relief. The new thresholds will be effective from January 1, 2018, while existing lease provisions will remain in place until December 31, 2017."
