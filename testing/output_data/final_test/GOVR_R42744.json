    "content": "Lending is risky for banks due to default and funding risks. Banks borrow short-term to fund long-term customer loans, generating profits from the spread between interest rates. Defaulting borrowers can lead to lenders being unable to repay their short-term obligations. Banks also face systemic risk. Systemic risk for lenders is the increase in correlation among individual default and funding risks, caused by a loss of confidence in the financial market. It can lead to contagion, where liquidity and payment problems spread and disrupt the market due to a sudden market retrenchment. Financial panics historically stem from uncertainty about future asset prices, especially when assets like real estate and stocks are used as collateral for numerous loans. The severity of a recession depends on the lending activity before an asset bubble bursts, leading to many loans becoming \"underwater.\" Insured depository institutions in the U.S. must comply with safety and soundness regulations, including maintaining sufficient capital reserves to mitigate default and funding risks. Banks maintain capital reserves to protect against credit, liquidity, and systemic risks. Capital is the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities, ensuring it can repay obligations even if some assets default. Basel I set guidelines for capital adequacy to prevent bank failures. The Basel Capital Accord, Basel I, established international standards for bank safety and soundness regulation to ensure consistent standards and fair competition among banking institutions. It aimed to harmonize capital reserve requirements to prevent competitive disadvantages for banks in different countries. The BCBS has no authority to enforce specific standards, but U.S. federal banking regulators generally adopt rules based on Basel I guidelines. The U.S. federal banking regulators generally adopt rules consistent with the Basel Accords, which include the Basel Capital Accord published in 1988. The regulatory framework for banking institutions includes Tier 1 capital made up of common shareholders' equity, reserves, retained earnings, and preferred stock. Banks must maintain minimum capital-asset ratios to reduce vulnerability to loan defaults. Banks must maintain minimum capital-asset ratios to reduce vulnerability to loan defaults. Tier 2 capital includes allowances for loan and lease losses (ALLL) set aside for anticipated loan losses. Loan loss provisioning increases ALLL when default risks rise, with decreases known as \"charge-offs\" when loans won't be repaid. ALLL adjustments must come from current income earnings. Stress testing assesses a bank's ability to withstand losses from severe economic downturns or systemic risks. Excess ALLL over 1.25% of risk-weighted assets is not counted as Tier 2 capital. Basel II regulations were developed to address shortcomings in asset risk weighting systems. Initially applied to the 19 largest US banking institutions, Basel II became effective on April 1, 2008. Basel II rules were delayed or waived after the 2007 financial crisis, leading to the issuance of Basel II.5 to better capture credit risk in the trading book of banks. Basel II.5 aims to improve credit risk assessment in the trading book of banks by preventing inappropriate placement of securities for favorable accounting treatment, ensuring sufficient capital buffer to mitigate lending risks. U.S. federal banking regulators have issued proposed rules on this. The U.S. federal banking regulators issued proposed rules on the adoption of Basel II.5 revisions in the United States on January 11, 2011, which were later amended and re-proposed on December 7, 2011. The final rule on the adoption of Basel II.5, also known as the market capital risk rule, was issued on June 7, 2012. In response to the financial crisis, Basel III regulatory framework reforms Basel II by revising the definition of regulatory capital and increasing the amounts banks must hold. Basel III compliance requires banks to meet enhanced requirements by 2019, with the final rule to implement most of the Basel III recommendations issued on June 7, 2012. The final rule to implement Basel III recommendations in the United States was approved on July 9, 2013, adopting provisions from the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 939 of Dodd-Frank requires the removal of regulatory references to credit ratings due to concerns about their role in the housing bubble. Section 939A mandates federal agencies to review regulations requiring credit assessments and modify them accordingly. The Collins Amendment of Dodd-Frank requires the removal of regulatory references to credit ratings and the development of consistent capital requirements for financial institutions. Small bank holding companies with less than $500 million in assets are exempt from this amendment. The Collins Amendment of Dodd-Frank mandates consistent capital requirements for financial institutions, removing regulatory references to credit ratings. Federal banking regulators must apply the same capital requirements to U.S. bank holding companies and systemically significant nonbank financial companies. Minimum risk-based capital requirements are established for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors. The capital requirements of a bank holding company must be at least as stringent as those applied to its depository subsidiary and cannot be lower than the requirements in effect when Dodd-Frank was enacted. Regulators can set higher, but not lower, ratio requirements than those for insured depositories at that time. The final rule implementing this was announced by U.S. federal banking regulators. The Collins Amendment, announced by U.S. federal banking regulators on July 28, 2011, excluded trust preferred securities from the definition of eligible Tier 1 capital for large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbanks. This requirement applied to bank holding companies with $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, with a three-year phase-out period starting on January 1, 2013. The Basel III final rule includes capital requirements with a phase-out period for institutions based on their asset size. It incorporates some BCBS recommendations and Dodd-Frank safety provisions, but not all. Dodd-Frank imposes enhanced safety requirements on banks with over $50 billion in assets and systemically important financial institutions. Additional capital requirements may be implemented in the future. The rule provides guidance on risk-weighting methodology, capital ratio levels, and enhanced capital. The Basel III final rule applies to banks and bank holding companies in the United States, with exceptions for smaller institutions. Some banking institutions will face more stringent requirements, such as advanced approaches banks with over $250 billion in assets. The Basel III final rule applies to banks and bank holding companies in the United States, with exceptions for smaller institutions. Banks with at least $250 billion in assets or significant foreign exposures must comply with additional safety and soundness requirements, including a countercyclical capital buffer and a supplementary leverage ratio. Advanced approaches banks designated as SIFIs can expect further requirements. Changes to eligible capital, risk-weighting, and stress testing are highlighted, with U.S. regulators aligning Tier 1 capital definitions with BCBS standards. The Basel III final rule applies to banks in the United States, with additional safety and soundness requirements for larger institutions. Tier 1 capital must consist mainly of common equity and retained earnings to improve quality and transparency. Mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, and holdings in other financial institutions can be included in Tier 1 capital but are limited to 15% to prevent dilution of common tangible equity. The Basel III final rule requires most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to be included in Tier 1 regulatory capital to capture a more accurate assessment of a bank's loss absorption capacity. This includes unrealized gains or losses on assets available for sale, such as securities affected by interest rate fluctuations. This inclusion may add volatility to bank capital ratios. The Basel III final rule requires most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to be included in Tier 1 regulatory capital to capture a more accurate assessment of a bank's loss absorption capacity, potentially adding volatility to bank capital ratios due to market interest rate movements. U.S. federal banking regulators are allowing banks not subject to advanced approaches rules to opt out of the AOCI requirement by the first quarterly financial report after January 1, 2015. This may be challenging for small banks with limited ability to hedge interest rate risks. The Basel III final rule requires risk-weighted assets to be multiplied by a prompt corrective action ratio to ensure capital reserves for credit risk. For example, a $100,000 mortgage with a 50% risk weight would require $4,000 in total risk-based capital for adequate capitalization and $5,000 for well-capitalized status. To be well-capitalized, a bank must hold total risk-based capital of $5,000. Federal regulators assign risk weights to all types of assets based on various categories, which are then multiplied by a minimum capital percentage to determine the required capital reserves. Banks must also apply prompt corrective action capital charges after risk weighting their assets. The assets are risk-weighted, and banks must apply prompt corrective action capital ratio charges to determine capital requirements. Compliance with capital charges indicates adequate capitalization, while exceeding these standards makes a bank well-capitalized. Failure to meet minimum capitalization requirements results in a prompt corrective action notice from regulators. Total risk-weighted capital requirements are calculated as total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The new risk weights for total risk-weighted capital charges under the final rule are as follows: banks with assets under $500 million would hold a capital buffer of $4,000; banks with more than $500 million in assets would hold $5,250; and advanced approaches banks would hold $5,250 or $6,500 depending on the countercyclical buffer. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by average total on-balance sheet assets, providing an unweighted ratio requirement for times of sudden financial risks. The U.S. federal banking regulators issued a final rule on April 8, 2014, adding a 2% capital buffer to the 3% supplementary leverage ratio for banks with over $700 billion in assets, raising the total requirement to 5%. The eight largest SIFIs must maintain a 6% ratio to avoid bonus restrictions, with the proposal effective from January 1, 2018. Liquidity is defined as the ability to sell an asset immediately without losses. Banks may face distress during periods of uncertainty when short-term rates increase relative to long-term rates, leading to funding risks. Institutions holding illiquid assets may need to compete for shorter-term liquid assets, driving up rates. Liquidating asset security holdings is an option, but if many banks do the same, the market may have more sellers than buyers. During financial uncertainty, banks may struggle to repay short-term funding obligations due to a scarcity of liquid funds. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision introduced liquidity risk ratio requirements to enhance resilience to liquidity stress, although these were not included in the final Basel III rule. In 2013, federal banking agencies proposed a rule to strengthen liquidity requirements, aligning with the BCBS's liquidity coverage ratio. The proposed rule aims to strengthen liquidity requirements for depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets by implementing the BCBS's liquidity coverage ratio. This may lead banks to hold more liquid assets instead of higher-yielding, illiquid loans, potentially impacting their ability to provide credit for economic growth. The Federal Reserve serves as a lender of last resort during liquidity shortages, questioning the necessity for banks to hold large amounts of liquid assets. Holding highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities to meet liquidity requirements could affect other financial entities. The U.S. federal banking regulators recognize that liquidity risk management is crucial for banking system stability, but holding a large concentration of liquid (U.S. Treasury) securities could increase systemic risk. Increasing safety requirements by holding more capital can help banks absorb losses and reduce vulnerability to insolvency. However, a substantial increase in risk-free asset holdings may introduce new challenges to financial stability. Banks may be hesitant to hold excess capital despite the benefits it provides in reducing insolvency risk and potential taxpayer losses. Shareholders demand higher returns on equity compared to short-term creditors, leading banks to seek a balance in capital levels. Raising capital during economic uncertainty could signal increased default or funding risks to investors. A bank may raise capital to address increasing default or funding risks, but if investors react negatively, the share price could fall, increasing the risk of bank failure. To meet higher capital requirements, a bank may shift costs to customers by raising lending rates or selling assets. This distribution of costs may slow economic recovery and credit expansion. The paradox of financial instability suggests that banks may hold enough capital to be considered well capitalized, but this may not necessarily prevent lending or restrain institutions during economic downturns. Bank capital levels are procyclical, meaning they rise during healthy economic periods and decline during financial downturns, potentially serving as a lagging indicator of distress rather than a preventative measure. Bank capital levels may be a lagging indicator of distress rather than a predictor of a systemic event. Excessive lending activity can occur when banks are overconfident due to being well-capitalized and optimistic about asset performance. A rise in aggregate lending activity, especially with correlated credit risk exposures, may indicate vulnerability to systemic risk more than higher capital requirements. Prior to the recent financial crisis, nonbank institutions and subsidiaries of bank holding companies originated many loans, leading to risks in the financial system. Raising capital requirements for depository institutions may not address these risks if lending occurs outside regulated banking systems. If non-bank lending decreases, higher bank capital requirements could impact overall lending activity. Higher bank capital requirements may increase the influence on lending activity, making credit availability more sensitive to changes in bank capitalization levels. Capital adequacy regulation mandates banks to maintain minimum capital-asset ratios, with Basel I introducing a risk weighting system to capture the relative credit risk of bank assets. This system correlates lower credit risk with liquidity, assigning lower weights to more liquid assets and higher weights to less liquid assets. For example, cash and U.S. Treasury securities are considered to have zero default risk. The risk weighting system introduced by Basel I assigns lower weights to more liquid assets like cash and U.S. Treasury securities, which have zero default risk. Loans with higher risk weights reduce a bank's capital-asset ratio, requiring them to hold more capital. Banks may adjust their asset portfolios based on fixed risk weights to maintain their capital reserves and ratios. The Basel I weighting system may not adequately differentiate between degrees of risk, leading to banks potentially favoring higher risk loans over lower risk ones. This system also fails to account for offsetting risk exposures, incentivizing banks to hold government securities instead. Banks may prioritize holding government securities like U.S. Treasuries over extending loans during economic downturns to maintain capital-asset ratios. This could lead to reduced lending in segments with severe credit shortages, such as non-OECD emerging markets or the private sector in recovery phases. Basel II revised the weighting system to allow for more risk differentiation by adding risk weight categories and proposing the use of external credit assessments. This helps address the procyclical nature of fixed weights in Basel I, which may incentivize excessive risk-taking during expansions and discourage credit availability during economic downturns. The Basel III final rule incorporates a more extensive risk weighting system that allows for better risk differentiation than Basel I. Despite the greater array of risk weights, the system still provides procyclical lending incentives for banks. Appendix B shows the capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Accord before additional elements were included by federal regulators. Basel III, Pillar 1 revises regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, increasing Tier 1 capital and common equity capital requirements. By January 1, 2015, the common equity capital requirement rises to 4.5%, and by January 1, 2019, the total minimum capital requirement increases to 10.5%. Basel III also introduces a capital conservation buffer, countercyclical capital buffer, leverage ratio, and new liquidity ratios. The Basel III framework introduces regulatory ratios known as capital charges, including the capital conservation buffer. This buffer, set at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, aims to enhance banks' resilience by requiring them to maintain capital buffers that can be drawn down during financial stress. Banks are prohibited from distributing earnings when their capital buffers are depleted, with the conservation buffer increasing annually to reach 2.5% by January 1, 2019. The countercyclical capital buffer, established by the BCBS in 2010, ranges from 0 to 2.5% of a bank's risk-weighted assets. It consists of common equity or other loss-absorbing capital and grows during economic expansions, decreasing during contractions. National regulatory authorities can determine when a buffer requirement is necessary to maintain financial stability. The leverage ratio is calculated as gross capital divided by average total on-balance sheet assets, providing a different measure of a bank's capital adequacy compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratios. The leverage ratio is a capital backstop that assigns the same credit risk to all assets, regardless of risk weights. It ensures a bank's capital buffer stays above a minimum threshold. The BCBS is testing a 3% minimum requirement for the leverage ratio, to be implemented by January 1, 2018. Additionally, the liquidity coverage ratio was established in 2010 to promote resilience to temporary liquidity disruptions. The liquidity coverage ratio requires banks to hold high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than their net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The net stable funding ratio encourages banks to rely on medium- and longer-term funding for loans. Globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) will have additional capital requirements for loss absorbency. The BCBS recommends that systemically important institutions hold an additional 1% to 2.5% of capital in common equity against risk-weighted assets by 2019. Stress tests assess banks' ability to withstand adverse economic conditions like unemployment or recession. Stress tests are conducted to assess a bank's ability to withstand adverse economic conditions such as an economic slowdown, borrower defaults, and depletion of Tier 1 capital. Dodd-Frank mandates semi-annual stress tests for bank holding companies and non-bank financial corporations with assets over $10 billion. The tests may reveal balance sheet weaknesses and require banks to hold capital levels exceeding standard ratios. The Federal Reserve issued final rules on stress tests for national banks and federal savings associations with assets over $10 billion. While smaller community banks have less stringent requirements, they are still mandated to assess their resilience to adverse economic scenarios. Federal banking regulators allow for customized stress tests based on bank size. Banking regulators have increased supervisory guidance for banks with significant concentrations in commercial real estate (CRE) due to concerns about relaxed underwriting standards. Community banks, which typically engage in CRE lending, are considered vulnerable to loan defaults and possible failure if CRE prices collapse. The guidance requires banks to submit a risk management plan if certain conditions are met regarding their CRE loan portfolio. The federal banking regulators have issued guidance for banks with significant commercial real estate (CRE) concentrations, requiring a risk management plan if certain conditions are met. The plan should outline how the bank will reduce or manage its high level of CRE concentrations. Banks may need to raise additional capital if their risk management plans are deemed unacceptable. Additionally, stress testing requirements have been established for midsize banking organizations with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion. Stress testing requirements apply to banking organizations with $10 billion to $50 billion in assets, with deadlines for reporting and financial disclosures. Dodd-Frank mandates enhanced standards for bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve initiated the Supervisory Capital Allocation Program (SCAP) in 2009 for companies with assets exceeding $100 billion, conducting stress tests under adverse economic scenarios. The SCAP program conducted stress tests for 2009 and 2010 for companies with assets exceeding $100 billion under adverse economic scenarios. In November 2011, the Federal Reserve introduced the CCAR program for institutions with over $500 billion in assets, continuing the stress testing process."
