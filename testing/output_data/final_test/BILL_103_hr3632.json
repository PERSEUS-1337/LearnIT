    "content": "The \"Safe Medications Act of 1993\" aims to establish a data bank for reporting errors in drug prescribing, dispensing, and administration. It also seeks to use this data to prevent errors, educate healthcare professionals, and inform about potential deaths related to drug therapy. Any healthcare facility where a drug error leads to a patient's death must report the error to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 10 working days. The report should include details of the error and the facility where it occurred. When a drug error results in a patient's death, the facility must report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 10 working days. The report should include details such as the facility's name and address, drug brand and generic names, manufacturer information, dosage form, patient details, diagnosis, date and time of death, lot number of drugs, error description, and how the error was discovered. SEC. 3. DATA BANK. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a data bank to receive reports of errors resulting in deaths related to drugs. The Secretary will review this information to identify trends and report it to official compendia for consideration of revising packaging and labeling requirements. Aggregate data will be reported to assist health professionals in identifying and reducing inappropriate drug use. The data bank will maintain confidentiality of reports on medication errors related to deaths and share information with relevant organizations for follow-up. Violators who falsely report, request information, or access the data bank unlawfully may face fines or imprisonment. If a person commits a violation of this subsection after a conviction has become final, they may be fined up to $25,000 or imprisoned for up to 3 years, or both. SEC. 4. PENALTIES. Any institution failing to report as required by section 2 faces a $15,000 fine per report not made. Failure to report deaths from drug errors results in mandatory exclusion from Medicare and State Health Care Programs. Within 60 days of conviction, a plan for reporting errors must be submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization is granted to appropriate necessary funds for implementing this Act and its amendments."
