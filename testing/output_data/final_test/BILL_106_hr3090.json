The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to address the restoration of approximately 350,000 acres of land withdrawn in 1917 for the benefit of Native inhabitants of Elim, Alaska. 50,000 acres were later deleted from the Norton Bay Reservation for the benefit of others, excluding the Native inhabitants of Elim.
