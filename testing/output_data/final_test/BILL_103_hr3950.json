    "content": "The \"Family and Community Endeavor Schools Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It outlines findings and purposes related to family and community involvement in schools. The Congress finds that children in poverty are at risk of academic failure due to economic challenges, poor housing, and family issues. Students from low-income families are more likely to drop out of school. Social intervention is crucial for at-risk children to improve academically. Schools play a vital role in providing educational and social services to at-risk children and their families, with community involvement enhancing their effectiveness. The purpose of this Act is to improve the overall development of at-risk children in eligible communities by involving the community in school management and incorporating mental health and social intervention services in the academic curriculum. The Secretary can award grants to local entities to assist communities in implementing programs under this Act. Grants will not be less than $250,000 per fiscal year and funds will remain available until expended. The Act requires local entities receiving funds to develop programs improving academic and social development through collaborative efforts. Optional activities include homework assistance, nutrition services, mentoring, family counseling, and parental training programs. The Secretary will define criteria for eligible communities as per section 12(3) through regulation. Grant eligibility will be determined accordingly. To be eligible for a grant, a local entity must identify an eligible community, involve various stakeholders in a community planning process, and develop a targeted strategy for at-risk children within the community. SEC. 7. APPLICATIONS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a local entity must submit an application to the Secretary with a comprehensive plan to improve at-risk children's academic and social development in schools, supported by community leaders, school districts, local officials, and other relevant organizations. The local entity applying for a grant must assure compliance with program requirements, submit annual reports, and use funds to supplement, not supplant, other resources. The local entity must supplement, not supplant, other funds and maintain separate accounting records for the program. Priority is given to entities showing effort in generating local support for the programs. The Secretary will establish a peer review panel of up to 8 members with experience in improving at-risk children's development. The panel will recommend an effective model for program requirements and evaluate assisted programs. The Secretary can conduct investigations to ensure compliance with the Act. SEC. 10. FEDERAL SHARE. The Secretary will pay 70 percent of program costs for approved applications. Non-Federal share can be in cash or in kind, with at least 15 percent from private or nonprofit sources. SEC. 11. EVALUATION. The Secretary will evaluate programs funded under the Act, focusing on academic and social achievements of children. SEC. 12. DEFINITIONS.
