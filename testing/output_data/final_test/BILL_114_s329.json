    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Act\". The Congress authorized the study of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System due to their significant natural, cultural, and recreational resources. The Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Management Plan was prepared in June 2011 to protect the river segments' outstanding values without Federal management of affected lands not owned by the United States. The Wild and Scenic Study Committee has voted in favor of Wild and Scenic River designation, with strong local support from all ten communities abutting the study area. The State of Connecticut General Assembly has endorsed the designation of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Rainbow Dam and Reservoir are located outside of the designated river segment and are deemed compatible with the designation. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to include the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook in Connecticut, totaling approximately 62 miles. The segments will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior as recreational rivers. The Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook in Connecticut, totaling approximately 62 miles, will be designated as recreational rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This includes specific segments of Salmon Brook, such as the main stem, West Branch, and East Branch. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT. The river segments designated by section 3 will be managed according to a management plan approved by the Secretary. The Secretary will coordinate with the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic Committee. Cooperative agreements may be entered into for the protection and enhancement of the designated river segment. The designated river segments will be managed through cooperative agreements with the State of Connecticut, specific towns, and local organizations. These agreements must align with the management plan and may include assistance from the United States. Zoning ordinances in the designated towns will also be considered for the designated segments. The designated river segments in Avon, Bloomfield, Burlington, East Granby, Farmington, Granby, Hartland, Simsbury, and Windsor in Connecticut will satisfy the standards of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation is prohibited for these segments, with acquisition limited to donation or consent of the owner. The designation of the Rainbow Dam and Reservoir under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not prohibit its potential future licensing as a hydroelectric generation project by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Commission may establish reasonable terms and conditions in a hydropower license to reduce impacts on scenic, recreational, and wildlife areas. The Lower Farmington River shall not be part of the National Park System or be subject to its regulations, despite being designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This designation should not impact the operation of the unlicensed hydroelectric facility at Rainbow Dam and Reservoir. SEC. 5. Farmington River, Connecticut, designation revised to 15.1-mile stretch to the confluence with the Nepaug River. SEC. 6. Definitions: \"management plan\" refers to the plan in section 2(3), and \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior."
