The President must develop and submit a regional strategy to Congress within 180 days to support efforts against the Lord's Resistance Army, protect civilians, eliminate threats, enforce the rule of law, and ensure humanitarian access in affected areas. The strategy should include a plan to protect civilians, eliminate the threat posed by the Lord's Resistance Army, and establish institutions to maintain the rule of law and prevent conflict in the long term. The regional strategy to combat the Lord's Resistance Army includes an interagency framework for diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military coordination. It also outlines diplomatic engagement with regional mechanisms, evaluation of progress, and fitting within broader policy objectives in the Great Lakes Region.

It is the sense of Congress that the President should support efforts in northern Uganda to assist internally displaced people and returnees, enhance local governance institutions, strengthen civilian police, and improve access to basic services. To address issues in northern Uganda, efforts should focus on improving the justice system, disarming former combatants, and providing programs for psychosocial trauma. Congress recommends future funding for these initiatives.

This includes establishing mechanisms to manage programs, increasing oversight, and allocating additional funds to local governments. The United States should coordinate with other donor nations to increase contributions for recovery efforts in northern Uganda and ensure transparent use of funds. Congress suggests withholding bilateral assistance to Uganda if the government is not committed to transparent reconstruction in war-affected areas. Assistance for reconciliation and transitional justice in northern Uganda is emphasized in Section 7. The sense of Congress is to support efforts in northern Uganda for transitional justice and reconciliation, including implementing mechanisms outlined in the Agreement on Accountability and Reconciliation. This includes establishing a body to investigate the conflict's history and human rights violations, and a special division of the High Court of Uganda for trials. The High Court of Uganda has a special division to try serious crimes from the conflict, a unit for investigations and prosecutions, a reparations system for victims, and support for transitional justice mechanisms. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2012 for these efforts.
