Some believe U.S. efforts to promote political reforms in China have been unsuccessful, leading to a strained relationship. The U.S. government has implemented various tactics to promote democracy and human rights in China, but their impact has been limited. Many experts argue that U.S. engagement has not led to significant political reform in China, as the leadership remains authoritarian and violations of civil liberties have increased. Economic development, fueled by trade with the United States, has strengthened the Communist government rather than empowering the people. Despite some growth in economic and social freedoms, government control over people's lives persists. The Chinese government's control over people's lives has persisted, but there are increasing opportunities for public opinion on policy and rights activism. Disagreements over progress often stem from different indicators emphasized, such as government policies, civil society actions, and human rights conditions reflect conflicting trends. The Chinese Communist Party holds power without real checks from the legislative and judicial branches, although the Constitution guarantees freedoms of speech, press, assembly, demonstration, and religion. The Chinese government restricts rights in practice, viewing them as subordinate to its authority and policy goals. It denounces foreign criticisms of its human rights policies as interference and has developed a more legalistic and accountable system. Progress has been made in enacting laws to curb human rights abuses. The Chinese government has enacted new laws to protect criminal defendants and pledged to reform labor camps, but rejects political reforms that challenge its power. It continues to crack down on social instability, independent political activity, and unsanctioned religious and ethnic groups. Harsh policies are imposed on Tibetans, Uighurs, and Falun Gong adherents. Public criticism is tolerated to some extent, but protest leaders are arrested. The Chinese government retains arbitrary authority and corruption hinders governance efforts. Awareness of civil and legal rights is growing among citizens, with activists championing human rights causes. Despite strict controls, citizens are becoming more assertive in claiming their rights, engaging in public demonstrations and utilizing the legal system. According to specialists, broad public participation in activist causes is a potent political dynamic in China today, driven by the rising middle class demanding more from the government. The middle class's involvement in local demonstrations is significant for articulating interests and central government legitimacy. Urban Chinese, the core of the middle class, value clean government, civil liberties, and are politically aware, but may be politically conservative due to dependence on the state for material well-being. Despite this, they are unlikely to agitate for democracy if their economic needs are met. Urban residents in China are cautious about pushing for democracy as long as their economic needs are met. A survey by the Pew Research Center showed a more negative view of the U.S.-China relationship in 2012 compared to 2010, but a slightly higher percentage of Chinese admire American democratic ideas. The leadership transition in China in 2013 did not signal any shift towards human rights policy changes, with analysts predicting no significant reforms soon as new leaders consolidate power. The Chinese government is facing a legitimacy crisis and a possible turning point after three decades of economic growth. Despite increased social protests, the government is focusing on improving social management and limiting repressive actions to key activists and dissidents. Analysts believe that the government will avoid a popular backlash by addressing the concerns of the Chinese people, who are becoming more politically assertive. The Chinese government is experiencing a shift in public attitude towards political reform, with disagreements within the Party on addressing economic inequality, corruption, and social welfare. Calls for democratic reform and constitutional government have been made by Party members, intellectuals, and scholars. Social protests have increased, leading to government efforts to enhance social control measures. The Chinese government has increased funding and staff for social control efforts in response to public protests against economic rights violations. Despite attempts to appear neutral or sympathetic, the government has not addressed the root causes of the issues. While grassroots democracy has been embraced by many Chinese citizens, the progression of direct elections to higher levels of government has stalled for over two decades. Recent events, such as the silencing of rights advocates like Chen Guangcheng, highlight the government's efforts to maintain political control. The PRC government has tried to silence rights advocates and dissidents, while activist networks have survived. Tibetan immolations show Beijing's tough stance on certain groups. Public protests in China focus on local economic issues. Estimates of \"mass incidents\" range from 90,000 to 180,000 annually. Unrest stems from evictions, poor factory conditions, unpaid wages, environmental degradation, abuse by urban management officers, and mistreatment of small enterprises. Activism in China reflects an assertive citizenry empowered by social media. Various groups, including women, LGBTQ+, disabled individuals, sex workers, and HIV/AIDS advocates, have demonstrated. The government has increased funding for public safety and cracked down on dissent during leadership transitions. Human rights groups reported a crackdown on petitioners, dissidents, academics, and activists in China, with up to 100,000 people affected. Two petitioners died in custody. The unrest in Wukan, Guangdong province, highlighted the power structure imbalance and government responses. Party Secretary Wang Yang was praised for resolving tensions in a flexible manner. Wukan villagers protested land grabs and inadequate compensation, leading to government officials fleeing the village. The Wukan villagers protested against land grabs and inadequate compensation, leading to a 10-day standoff with security forces. The provincial government intervened, promising to investigate the land dispute, release arrested leaders, and allow free elections for the village committee. In March 2012, new committee members were elected amid growing international interest. Some villagers in Wukan complained about corrupt development schemes and local authorities not returning their land. PRC citizens can elect officials to various levels of government, but CCP election committees control candidate lists. Independent candidates have run for local people's congresses, including academics, students, journalists, and NGO leaders. Many diverse individuals, including college students, journalists, bloggers, NGO leaders, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and farmers, have faced government harassment during election campaigns in China. This includes surveillance, intimidation, and detention, leading some candidates to withdraw. Local authorities have also pressured nominators, family members, and employers. The case of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng illustrates the mistreatment of political activists in China, with Chen enduring house arrest, lack of due process, and physical abuse for challenging authorities on disability rights and family planning issues. Chen Guangcheng, a blind legal advocate in China, faced house arrest, lack of legal representation, and physical abuse for challenging authorities on disability rights and family planning issues. After serving over four years in prison, Chen was placed under extra-judicial house arrest with restricted movements for him and his wife. Despite being blocked from communication and their children facing restrictions, Chen and his wife managed to smuggle out a video describing their forced confinement. In 2012, Chen escaped his heavily guarded home after 19 months of confinement. Chen Guangcheng, a blind legal advocate in China, escaped his heavily guarded home with the help of activists and sought refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. After negotiations, Chinese leaders allowed him to leave the country with his family for the United States to study law. His nephew, Chen Kegui, was sentenced to 39 months in prison for injuring a government official. Chen Kegui, Chen Guangcheng's nephew, was sentenced to 39 months in prison for injuring a government official during a raid on his house. He claimed self-defense as officials searched for his uncle. The Chinese government has increased security in Tibetan areas since 2008 unrest, with reports of Tibetans self-immolating in protest. The Chinese government blames the Dalai Lama, Tibetan separatists, and foreign groups for unrest in Tibetan areas and self-immolations. PRC judicial bodies warn of criminal liability for self-immolations. In 2013, Tibetans were arrested for allegedly inciting self-immolations. The U.S. expresses concern over human rights violations in Tibet and calls for peaceful expression of grievances. The major human rights violations in China include excessive violence by security forces, unlawful detention, torture, arbitrary use of state security laws against dissidents, coercive family planning policies, and state control of information. Other violations involve harassment of religious practitioners, mistreatment of North Korean refugees, and unlawful killings of individuals. In China, human rights violations include unlawful killings in state custody, torture of political detainees, arbitrary use of state security laws against dissidents, coercive actions against women, strict controls on public speech, harassment of Christians and Falun Gong adherents, and repatriation of North Korean nationals facing severe punishment. The Dui Hua Foundation estimates 20,000 to 30,000 political and religious prisoners in China, including those accused of endangering state security, Falun Gong members, Tibetans, and Uighurs. The number of people tried for endangering state security in 2011 decreased by 20% from 2010, but levels remain high compared to pre-2008 levels. The Re-education Through Labor (RETL) system in China allows police to sentence individuals for minor offenses without trial, including political reasons. Estimates suggest 2-10% of the RETL population is detained for political reasons, with Falun Gong adherents making up a significant portion in the past. The RETL population ranges from 160,000 to 260,000 people, with drug offenders being the largest group. In 2012, Tang Hui, mother of a rape victim, was sentenced to an RETL facility in Hunan province after protesting local officials. This sparked public support for reforming the RETL system, with pilot projects launched in 2011 and some offenses removed in 2013 to reduce punishment for government criticism. The Chinese government's announcement to stop sending people to RETL camps by the end of 2013 was later changed to a \"reform\" of the system. There is concern about handling current detainees and future offenders, with disagreement among Chinese leadership on how to proceed. Human rights experts fear cosmetic reforms that may lead to criminalizing non-criminal acts and increasing the formal prison population, while informal detention methods may still be used. China's system of formal and informal prisons and detention centers in China perpetuates egregious human rights violations, especially towards those who oppose the government. Political dissidents and petitioners from rural areas seeking redress for government abuses are often held in secret detention centers or psychiatric hospitals without legal protections. In China, political dissidents, petitioners, and religious worshippers have been held in psychiatric hospitals for the criminally insane, forced to take medications, and subjected to human rights violations. The Beijing government cracked down on black jails in 2011, releasing thousands of petitioners in 2012. In 2013, a Beijing court sentenced 10 people for operating a black jail. Liu Xiaobo, a political dissident, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his non-violent struggle for human rights. The Declaration of Human Rights, signed by 300 Chinese citizens, called for fundamental changes in China's political system. The Charter received around 10,000 additional signatures online before the government shut down the website. Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power\" in 2009. His wife, Liu Xia, remains under house arrest in Beijing. Liu Xia's brother, Liu Hui, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for fraud in 2013. American citizens convicted of national security-related and commercial crimes in China have caused periodic friction. Xue Feng, a U.S. citizen born in China, was arrested in Beijing in 2007 for acquiring a Chinese database on China's oil industry. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for providing state secrets to foreigners. Dong Wei, a naturalized U.S. citizen from China, was detained in 2003 for espionage and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Dong was reportedly released in 2012. In 2012, lawyers facing reprisals for politically sensitive cases, including forced closures of law offices and unlawful detention. New regulations required attorneys to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party. Jiang Tianyong, who defended Chen Guangcheng, was detained and beaten in 2012. Ni Yulan, a rights lawyer, was sentenced to prison for fraud in 2012. Ni Yulan was imprisoned in 2012 for fraud and activism, leading to permanent disability. The legal system in China remains biased against criminal defendants, with a high conviction rate and limited access to lawyers for detainees. Defense lawyers in China face challenges in accessing detained clients, reviewing case files, and collecting evidence. Article 306 of China's Criminal Law is used to deter lawyers from gathering evidence and prosecute those who advise clients to recant confessions obtained through torture. Religious freedom in China varies by region and religion, with millions openly practicing Buddhism, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Daoism, and Islam. Religious activities are protected by the PRC Constitution as long as they do not disrupt public order or health. Religious organizations in China are increasingly involved in providing social and charitable services, but the government imposes strict policies on unofficial Christian churches, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners. China has been designated as a \"country of particular concern\" for severe violations of religious freedom. Despite this, Christian worship in China, both within official bodies and outside of them, continues to grow, with an estimated 30 million worshipers in state-sanctioned churches. Many Chinese Christians practice their faith in unregistered Protestant congregations, rejecting the official Three Self Patriotic Movement church. House churches face government harassment, with leaders being detained and properties destroyed. The tensions between the state and unregistered religious organizations are evident. Local governments in China have tried to prevent followers of unregistered Protestant congregations from gathering and building their own places of worship. Members have faced arrest, detention, and punishment at work. Catholics in China are divided between those who follow the Pope and those who belong to the official Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Beijing and the Vatican have conflicting views on appointing bishops. Since 2010, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA) has ordained five bishops without Rome's approval, causing tension with the Vatican. In July 2012, Bishop Ma Daqin renounced his ties to the CCPA, leading to his house arrest and removal of title by the PRC government. Over 40 unregistered Chinese bishops are reportedly under surveillance, detained, or missing, with reports of worsening persecution of Christians in China. China has been intensifying efforts to weaken independent Christian churches by bringing members into state-sanctioned churches, detaining and sentencing Christians, and imposing restrictions on congregations and leaders. In Tibetan areas, the Chinese government faces resistance to its rule, with Tibetans viewing policies as a threat to their religion, culture, and identity. Controls on Tibetan religious life, including increased surveillance and political education campaigns, have fueled discontent. The State Department reports serious human rights abuses in Tibet, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary arrests. There are 626 Tibetan political prisoners, with grievances including domination of the economy by Han Chinese and adverse environmental effects of Beijing's projects. Hans believe PRC policies have brought positive development to the region. On March 11, 2008, 300 Buddhist monks peacefully protested in Lhasa for the release of Tibetan prisoners. This led to violent demonstrations, with Tibetans demanding independence or greater autonomy from China. The Chinese government increased security in Tibetan areas since 2008, especially during politically sensitive times. China's efforts to spur economic development in Tibet and provide greater opportunities for Tibetans have been met with resistance, including self-immolations by about 120 Tibetans since 2009. Chinese leaders blame the Dalai Lama and others for instigating unrest, leading to arrests of alleged inciters. The Dalai Lama has called the self-immolations a result of desperation in Tibet. The ninth round of talks between Beijing and representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2002 failed to bring about fundamental progress on the issue of greater autonomy for Tibet. Lodi Gyari, the Special Envoy of the Dalai Lama, resigned in 2012 due to frustration at the lack of progress by the Chinese government. He continued to view dialogue as the only way forward for Tibet. In April 2011, Tibetan exiles elected Lobsang Sangay as their new prime minister, taking on political duties from the Dalai Lama. The Chinese government refuses to engage with Sangay's government, citing it as illegal. Chinese authorities have implemented harsh policies against Uighurs in Xinjiang, where they now make up 40% of the population. The Chinese government has implemented harsh policies against Uighurs in Xinjiang, claiming it is necessary to prevent terrorism. They have conflated Uighur religious and cultural practices with subversive activities and terrorism, linking them to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Al Qaeda. In 2010, China's top leadership held a forum focused on the XUAR, producing an economic development plan but not addressing Uighur grievances. Uighur Islamic state linked to Al Qaeda carried out terrorist attacks in China. Xinjiang courts saw a 10% increase in cases of endangering state security in 2011. Uighur and human rights groups criticize PRC's religious policies restricting Islamic practices, including mosque entry for children and Quran study. Grievances also include economic discrimination, loss of ethnic identity, and lack of consultation on policies. Kashgar redevelopment efforts by the government have sparked anger among Uighurs. Many Kashgar residents believe the government's redevelopment plan is a way to control the local population and destroy Uighur culture. In 2009, Uighur demonstrators in Urumqi protested the deaths of two Uighur men, leading to a riot and violence. The government responded with a crackdown on religious activities and communication in Uighur areas. The Chinese government blocked Internet traffic in the XUAR for 10 months, blaming Uighur \"separatists\" for plotting turmoil. The World Uygur Congress, led by exiled Uighur Rebiya Kadeer, was accused of involvement. A clash in western Xinjiang resulted in the deaths of 21 people, including police and Uighurs allegedly part of a terrorist group. Authorities claimed the Uighur group possessed extremist materials. PRC authorities arrested 19 Uighur suspects after bomb-making materials were found. Uighur exile groups disputed the government's account, alleging excessive security measures. The U.S. State Department expressed regret over the violence and urged China to reduce tensions in Xinjiang. China criticized the U.S. for not condemning terrorism incidents. Falun Gong is a spiritual practice combining exercise, meditation, and moral values. It gained millions of followers in China in the late 1990s. After a government crackdown in 1999, the group was labeled a cult and forced to practice in secret. Despite a decline in security risk after 2004, Falun Gong practitioners faced intensified persecution during major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to \"transform\" adherents, leading to thousands being detained. Falun Gong followers make up a significant portion of prisoners of conscience in China, with estimates of over 15,000 individuals affected. Falun Gong practitioners have faced persecution in China, with estimates of hundreds to thousands dying in custody. Allegations of organ harvesting and harassment of lawyers defending practitioners have been reported. Prominent rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng has been detained multiple times since 2006. Prominent rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng faced torture and denial of legal counsel during his periods of detention in China. His family was warned not to speak publicly about him or his condition. China's \"One-Child Policy\" allows exceptions for ethnic minorities, rural couples with a girl as their first child, and other circumstances. The Planning Law in China does not explicitly allow abortion for One-Child Policy violations but imposes penalties like fines and job sanctions. Local officials have enforced the policy with human rights abuses like forced contraception and sterilization. Despite public calls for reform, the central government has not proposed changes to the policy. The One-Child Policy in China has led to lower fertility rates, an aging population, and gender imbalance due to sex-selective abortions. Chinese experts are calling for reform, with a recommendation to relax the policy by allowing two children per family in some provinces by 2015. The One-Child Policy in China may be relaxed to allow two children per family in some provinces by 2015 and to drop all birth limits by 2020. A case in China's Shaanxi Province in 2012, where a 22-year-old mother was forced to undergo an abortion, sparked debate on family planning policies. Labor unrest in China reflects changing dynamics between workers, enterprises, and the government due to various economic factors. In 2010, China saw a surge in labor disputes, with strikes at Foxconn, Honda, Hyundai, and other foreign-owned factories in Guangdong province. The unrest was fueled by widening income disparities, growing awareness of rights, and rising expectations among China's new generation of workers. Strikes at Foxconn were preceded by the suicides of 11 Chinese employees, attributed to demanding and stressful working conditions. Labor activists attributed the suicides to demanding working conditions. Protesters sought higher wages, improved conditions, and enforcement of labor laws, including limits on overtime. Some workers also demanded the right to elect union representatives. Chinese experts supported a greater role for the official union and collective bargaining. Legislative proposals at various levels supported the right to strike. The 2010 strikes in China were unique as they were covered by the media, led to pay raises, utilized social networking tools, and involved direct negotiations with management. In 2011 and 2012, labor protests continued in China, with workers focusing on wages and working conditions. The government remained vigilant against a national labor movement and prohibited independent unions. In 2012, poor working conditions at Foxconn factories were documented, leading to remedial measures and the election of worker representatives without management interference. New national laws governing labor were also introduced. In 2012, new national laws governing labor dispute resolution went into effect, providing more ways for workers to present grievances. Authorities in Guangdong province implemented secret ballot elections for trade union representatives in some factories in Shenzhen, but also harassed labor NGOs. Roughly 10 labor NGOs in Shenzhen were forced to close due to registration requirements. Little progress has been made nationally in collective bargaining and the right to strike. Chinese non-state entities are playing a growing role in social welfare and policy-making. In 2012, the Chinese government recognized the importance of civil society and sought to utilize it for its own purposes. Some experts believe this approach expands the space for civil society while allowing the government to shape it. Chinese NGOs are seen as valuable partners in social management and innovation efforts. Civil society actors, such as lawyers and activists, have taken risks to protect human rights and the public interest. Non-governmental organizations in China have played a significant role in promoting human rights and the public interest, despite facing government harassment. They are active in various sectors such as environmental protection, legal aid, public health, education, rural development, poverty alleviation, charity, and policy research. Some NGOs have even proposed legislation to government bodies. While Chinese leaders appreciate their contributions, they also express concerns about their autonomy, intentions, and foreign connections. In the last decade, Beijing tightened restrictions on social organizations in China due to fears of political unrest. Chinese civil society groups face challenges with legality, financing, and finding official sponsors. Many struggle to register and meet financial requirements. In the last decade, Beijing tightened restrictions on social organizations in China due to fears of political unrest. Many struggle to register and meet financial requirements. China has over 460,000 registered social organizations, with 3-4 million operating without official status. Requirements for NGOs to gain legal status were simplified in some major cities and regions in 2012. China has the world's largest number of Internet users, with extensive censorship and restrictions on freedom of speech. Many social organizations in China face challenges in registering and meeting financial requirements, with some being shut down by the government. Despite government efforts to limit media freedom, Chinese Internet users can access vast amounts of information, aiding political dissidents and civil society actors. Microblog sites like weibo have become crucial for news and free speech, even though Twitter is blocked in China. Dissident artist Ai Weiwei remains active on Twitter, defying state efforts to silence him. The Chinese government employs various methods to control online content and expression, including blocking websites and filtering keywords. Despite efforts to limit media freedom, dissident artist Ai Weiwei continues to use Twitter to communicate, bypassing state censorship. The government has the capability to block news and partially shut down the Internet, as seen in Xinjiang following ethnic unrest in 2009. Despite these restrictions, politically sensitive information still manages to circulate online due to the sheer volume of information available. The Chinese government controls online content by blocking websites, filtering keywords, and monitoring Internet service providers. Large portals and blogging services employ hundreds of people to filter discussions. The State Internet Information Office was created in 2011 to coordinate Internet oversight. Blocked sites include Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. English news sites like Voice of America and New York Times are generally accessible. Commonly barred searches and microblog postings are censored. The Chinese government controls online content by blocking websites, filtering keywords, and monitoring Internet service providers. Commonly barred Internet searches and microblog postings include references to sensitive topics like Tibet, Tiananmen Square, Falun Gong, PRC leaders, democracy, and foreign affairs. The government also hires Internet commentators to express pro-government views. Chinese Internet users can bypass government controls by using special software like proxy servers or virtual private networks (VPNs). Proxy servers and VPNs, costing around $40.00, allow some Internet users in China to bypass censorship. The government tolerates their use as long as it remains manageable. Studies show that the majority of Chinese Internet users do not use the internet for political purposes. Only a small minority, less than 10%, engage in political discussions online. Between 1% and 8% of users access proxy servers and VPNs to access censored content, both political and non-political. The Chinese government uses Internet firewalls to control online content, including pornography, gambling, and cyberattacks. Chinese netizens constantly find ways to bypass censorship, leading to new regulations like the 2012 law requiring real names for Internet accounts. The Chinese government is implementing new measures requiring real names for mobile service accounts, with legislation to delete illegal posts. Beijing is also cracking down on circumvention tools to bypass the Great Firewall, causing concern among netizens and Internet companies. Sina Weibo is resisting the real name registration, fearing service disruptions and user decline. The government claims these measures aim to improve web security by protecting personal information and combating online rumors, harassment, and spam. The Chinese government is implementing new measures to improve web security by requiring real names for mobile service accounts and deleting illegal posts. This includes cracking down on circumvention tools to bypass the Great Firewall. In response, Sina Weibo is resisting real name registration. In January 2013, journalists and citizens protested government actions at two newspapers, triggering a strike at the Southern Weekly and demonstrations at the Beijing News. The Beijing News publisher threatened to resign rather than print the government's version of events blaming \"hostile foreign forces\" for the conflict at the Southern Weekly. Experts noted the unique support for free speech shown by journalists and ordinary people during the protests. The PRC government has enacted laws to address human rights abuses, but lack of transparency and oversight limits their impact. The reforms in the Criminal Procedure Law provide greater protections against torture and coerced confessions, expanded legal defense access, longer trial deliberations, mandatory appellate hearings, and more rigorous judicial review. However, the law also allows for \"residential surveillance\" for suspects in state security cases, leaving detainees vulnerable to arbitrary treatment. The Chinese government implemented regulations in 2007 to regulate organ transplants, banning the sale of human organs and limiting donors to family members. In 2011, organ trafficking was made a crime, and in 2012, the government announced plans to end the illegal organ trade and phase out transplants from executed prisoners within five years. The number of executions in China has decreased to around 3,000 per year, with efforts to reform the death penalty system. In 2010, the Chinese government made amendments to various laws, including the Criminal Law, State Secrets Law, and State Compensation Law. The amendments aimed to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death, tighten control over state secrets, and clarify terms for state compensation. Despite hopes for reduced prosecutions, the State Secrets Law remains vague and can still be used broadly against political dissidents. The National People's Congress approved amendments to the State Compensation Law, granting citizens greater powers to obtain compensation for state violations. The Labor Contract Law of 2008 provided stronger protections for workers' rights and led to a rise in labor disputes. The 2007 constitutional amendment aimed to protect property rights, especially for private entrepreneurs and farmers at risk of land seizure by developers. The PRC government issued new measures allowing farmers to lease and sell property rights. In 2007, new rules were announced for greater government transparency and accountability, including disclosing official information. There are differing opinions on policy approaches towards human rights in China, with varying U.S. goals of promoting political change or supporting incremental progress. Balancing U.S. values and interests in the relationship remains a challenge. Possible approaches for promoting human rights in China include placing conditions on bilateral ties and inducing democratic change through engagement. U.S. administrations have used strategies like \"peaceful evolution\" and \"constructive engagement\" to further diplomatic and economic ties while advocating for open markets and democracy. President George W. Bush also saw engagement as crucial for promoting U.S. interests and freedom in China. The Obama Administration, like its predecessor, has sought bilateral cooperation with China while addressing human rights issues. President Obama emphasized the importance of freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion during a summit with President Hu Jintao in 2011. The U.S. Congress has taken steps such as sanctions, resolutions, and foreign assistance to promote human rights and democracy in China and Tibetan areas. Congress has imposed sanctions on China since the Tiananmen military crackdown in 1989, withholding support for UN Population Fund programs. Resolutions have been introduced to address human rights abuses in China, including imprisonment of political and religious figures, persecution of Tibetans, Uighurs, and Falun Gong adherents, censorship, coercive abortions, and deportation of North Korean refugees. Committees have held hearings on human rights in China, authorizing and funding democracy, human rights, and Internet freedom programs in China, and economic, cultural, and environmental programs in Tibet. The House Committees on Foreign Affairs and Judiciary, along with various subcommittees, have addressed human rights issues in China, including the crackdown on dissent, one-child policy, Internet censorship, labor conditions, and U.S. foreign assistance. Congressional bodies like the CECC and Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission have also investigated and reported on human rights conditions in China, sparking debates on the best methods to promote democracy and human rights. Policy makers have disagreed on methods to promote democracy and human rights in China. The U.S. government uses various tools like sanctions, criticism, diplomacy, international pressure, dialogue, assistance programs, Internet freedom efforts, public diplomacy, and support for dissident groups. Sanctions imposed after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 are still in effect, including restrictions on foreign aid. Congress requires support for projects in Tibet that do not encourage migration and settlement. The U.S. government supports projects in Tibet with restrictions to prevent non-Tibetan migration and property transfers. Some analysts urge more open criticism of China's human rights abuses, while others believe it could hinder reform efforts. International pressure has protected Chinese dissidents, but overt criticism may provoke hardliners in the PRC leadership. During the Obama Administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advocated for a human rights policy of \"principled pragmatism,\" emphasizing quiet diplomacy over public censure to effect change in China. This approach helped secure the release of rights advocate Chen Guangcheng while engaging in bilateral dialogues with China. President Obama also addressed human rights during his visit to China in 2009. During his visit to China in November 2009, President Obama briefly mentioned human rights and Internet freedom at a town hall meeting in Shanghai. Despite limited broadcast and censored transcripts, thousands of Chinese accessed the White House website to support Obama's call for Internet freedom. Former Secretary Clinton criticized China's Internet censorship, demanded the release of Liu Xiaobo, advocated for Ai Weiwei's freedom, and called China's human rights record \"deplorable.\" Vice-President Biden, during a 2011 trip to China, urged for greater human rights to make China more like the U.S. During the S&ED in Beijing in May 2012, former Secretary Clinton discussed key bilateral issues with Chinese officials, including cooperation on international matters like North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, the civil war in Syria, and human rights in China. She emphasized the importance of addressing areas of difference in their relationship. PRC State Councilor Dai Bingguo highlighted that no country is perfect and cautioned against using human rights as an excuse to interfere in internal affairs. The United Nations Human Rights Council was established in 2006 to replace the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The United States sponsored resolutions at the UNCHR criticizing China's human rights record, but China often blocked voting through \"no-action motions.\" China uses its soft power to reduce international pressure on human rights. The Bush Administration opposed the Human Rights Council, citing no improvements over the UNCHR and focus on Israel. The Obama Administration joined the Council in 2009. The U.N. established the Universal Periodic Review to assess human rights records of all members. The UPR Working Group reviewed China's human rights record in February 2009, with concerns raised by some countries. China has not fulfilled recommendations from its first review, including ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The U.S. is expected to take a more critical approach during China's next review in 2013. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue was established in 1990. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue was established in 1990 and was suspended in 2004 after a failed U.N. resolution. It resumed in 2008 and the Obama Administration participated in three rounds between 2010 and 2012. The 17th round took place in July 2012 in Washington, DC, including visits to the U.S. Supreme Court and other organizations. Individual cases, including Chinese dissidents, were discussed. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue resumed in 2008 after being suspended in 2004. During the 17th round in July 2012, officials discussed individual cases of Chinese dissidents, rights activists, lawyers, journalists, bloggers, NGO leaders, and religious figures. Concerns were raised about the persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang, forced abortions, and Chinese policies contributing to self-immolations in Tibet. Critics argue that the dialogue lacks benchmarks for progress and coordination with other U.S. agencies. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue lacks coordination with other U.S. agencies and transparency. Critics argue that it does not include participation from key stakeholders like Members of Congress and human rights activists. Administration officials defend the dialogue as a platform to express U.S. positions on human rights, not for negotiation.
