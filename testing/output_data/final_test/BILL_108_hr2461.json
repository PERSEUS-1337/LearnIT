The Secretary will establish an outpatient prescription drug benefit program for Medicare enrollees entitled to benefits under part A. Benefits are available for drugs dispensed between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2013, with a fiscal limitation of $400 billion over a 10-year period starting in 2004. The Secretary will establish a prescription drug benefit program for Medicare enrollees with a fiscal limitation of $400 billion over 10 years. Funding includes $22.8 billion for start-up and administrative costs. For payments for benefits in fiscal years 2005 to 2012, the amounts allocated were $25.8B, $28.9B, $32.2B, $36B, $40.2B, $44.7B, $49.9B, and $56B respectively. In 2012, $55.97 billion was allocated for benefits, increasing to $63.54 billion in 2013. The program provides benefits after beneficiaries incur out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs exceeding a specified percentage of income. The program determines income based on the previous year's tax return or an income eligibility statement provided by the Secretary. Income verification is done through an approved system. Benefits can be accessed through monthly payments or when prescription drug costs exceed a certain threshold. The Secretary allows beneficiaries to elect immediate benefits by paying monthly installments based on the threshold. Access to benefits is granted once prescription drug expenses meet the annual deductible, tracked electronically. The monitoring of expenditures under the program is done electronically through claims information and electronic transaction card system. The Secretary defines terms like 'covered outpatient prescription drugs', 'out-of-pocket costs', and 'income' based on adjusted gross income, including income from tax-exempt sources. Benefits under the program include income from tax-exempt sources, such as social security benefits and municipal bond interest. Covered outpatient prescription drugs do not include drugs with other available benefits. Secondary payor provisions apply, with no additional premium charged and no impact on existing premiums. Payment comes from the SMI trust fund. The program will pay benefits from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary will establish mechanisms to promote generic drugs and manage prescription drugs. Beneficiaries will have timely access to prescription drugs from a wide range of pharmacies. The program may use contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical benefit providers. The program may use contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical benefit providers and other qualified entities."
