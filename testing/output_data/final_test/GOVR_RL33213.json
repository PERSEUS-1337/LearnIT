    "content": "The nomination authorities, number of appointments, and criteria for service academy appointees are established by statute, federal regulations, and academy policies. Congressional nomination processes are not governed by laws or regulations as long as deadlines and information requirements are met. Each congressional office can develop its own process for managing nominations, some using a \"whole person\" approach similar to academies' criteria. Congressional offices consider various factors such as character, scholarship, leadership, physical aptitude, medical fitness, and motivation when making nomination decisions. They may require applicants to submit an application packet with self-reported qualifications and additional documentation. Each office has its own process for managing nominations, with some handling it internally and others delegating tasks to staff members. The nomination process in congressional offices involves delegating screening and development tasks to a volunteer panel, which may include educators, alumni, veterans' groups, and community leaders. The decision on the approach to use is based on factors like the number of applications, office workload, volunteer availability, and state-specific considerations. Regulations govern the use of volunteers in congressional offices, and it is common for offices to have a webpage dedicated to the service academy nomination process. Many congressional offices have a dedicated webpage for the service academy nomination process, where they provide information, application materials, deadlines, and support. Coordination with the service academies can help Members of Congress assist constituents throughout the appointment process by identifying prospective nominees, alumni, and clarifying institutional policies. The service academies encourage congressional Member offices to host Academy Days for prospective nominees. They send cadets, midshipmen, and admissions officers to these events and publicize them on their websites. Statutory requirements for congressional nominations and qualifications for nominees are outlined. A timeline of the application process is provided for reference. The report includes sample documents for congressional offices creating or revising nomination procedures, based on information from service academies and congressional websites. These documents can be customized for individual office policies and include initial contact letters, application instructions, and follow-up letters for potential nominees. The appointment and nomination criteria for service academies are established by statute, regulations, and policies. USMA, USNA, USAFA, and USMMA are governed by different authorities within the Department of Defense and Department of Transportation. USCGA does not require a congressional nomination for admission and is under the Department of Homeland Security. Allocations for nominations by Members of Congress are similar for each academy. The number of positions subject to congressional nomination at each DOD academy varies by state and territory, with nominations coming from Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and Resident Commissioners. When a position is vacant, a Member of Congress may nominate 10 individuals for consideration. When a position is vacant at a DOD service academy, a nominating Member office can make new nominations to fill any vacated positions. Typically, one appointment per DOD academy per Senator and Representative is available annually, but in some years, multiple vacancies can be filled. Appointments made by a predecessor or due to legislative redistricting are considered part of the new Member's allocation. The service academies can provide information on available appointments for Members to nominate in three categories. Members can submit nominations in three categories: without ranking, with a principal candidate and nine alternates, or with a principal candidate and nine unranked alternates. If the principal candidate is disqualified, the academies will appoint the first fully qualified, ranked alternate. If no principal candidate is specified, a fully qualified nominee will be appointed. Nominees not initially offered appointments may still receive one through noncongressional appointment authority. Nominations for academy appointments are only valid for the admissions cycle in which they were submitted. Noncongressional appointees and academy prep school students are not part of a Member of Congress's allotment. Qualified nominees not selected through congressional nominations are considered alternates for selection by the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Applicants for academy appointments can also be nominated by the Vice President and the governor of Puerto Rico. Other nomination sources are available for those with military connections, including children of career military personnel and Medal of Honor recipients. Children of armed forces personnel with certain circumstances can also seek merit-based appointments. Service secretaries can also make nominations. The President, service secretaries, and academy superintendents have the authority to nominate individuals for appointments to military academies. Members of Congress nominate individuals for the US Merchant Marine Academy. The President is the appointing authority for all DOD service academy admissions. The US Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) appoints seats in its entering class based on regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation. Each state's number of seats is determined proportionally to its representation in Congress. Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico can nominate 10 candidates per vacancy. Members of the House of Representatives can nominate candidates from anywhere within their state. Vacancies are allocated to nominees from specific territories. The appointment procedures for the US Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) are established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Additional qualifications may be set by the superintendent of USCGA. No congressional nomination is required for admission. Applicants must be U.S. citizens, meet age requirements, be unmarried, demonstrate academic preparation and leadership in extracurricular activities. To apply to a service academy, candidates must demonstrate leadership in athletics and extracurricular activities, take the SAT or ACT, be in good physical and mental health, pass medical and physical aptitude exams. Each academy has specific academic, physical, and leadership requirements for admission. Congressional offices review class profiles for test scores, rankings, and activities of admitted students. Nominees must also apply directly to the academies they seek appointment to. To apply to a service academy, candidates must demonstrate leadership in athletics and extracurricular activities, take the SAT or ACT, be in good physical and mental health, and pass medical and physical aptitude exams. Each academy requires a preliminary application to start the admissions process. Accepting a service academy appointment entails a nine-year service obligation, including four years at the academy and five years of active duty service. Sample application materials are available on the academies' websites."
