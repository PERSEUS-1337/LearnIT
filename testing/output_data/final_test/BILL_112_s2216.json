    "content": "The \"Rural Energy Savings Program Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 by adding the \"Rural Energy Savings Program\" under Subtitle E of title VI. The section aims to create jobs, promote rural development, and assist rural families and small businesses in achieving cost savings through loans for energy efficiency measures. Eligible entities include public power districts, electric cooperatives, and related entities. The section defines key terms related to the eligibility criteria for entities seeking loans for energy efficiency measures, such as eligible borrowers, energy efficiency measures, qualified consumers, and the Secretary. Eligible entities include public power districts, electric cooperatives, and related entities. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, provides loans to eligible entities for implementing energy efficiency measures to decrease energy use or costs for qualified consumers. The eligible entity receiving the loan funds must demonstrate expertise in energy efficiency measures and provide appropriate measurement and verification to ensure effectiveness and no conflict of interest. Additionally, they must revise the list of energy efficiency measures with approval from the Secretary. An eligible entity can update the list of energy efficiency measures with approval from the Secretary. Existing energy efficiency programs can be used to meet the requirements if deemed consistent with the section's purposes by the Secretary. No interest loan with repayment terms not exceeding 20 years. Repayment of advances amortized for up to 10 years. Maximum advance amount in a year is 50% of approved loan. Special advance for start-up costs determined by the Secretary. The Secretary allows eligible entities to request a special advance for new or modified programs under subsection (d). The amount of the advance cannot exceed 4 percent of the loan amount received. Repayment of the special advance is required within 10 years, with the option to defer it to the end of the 10-year period. Loans made by eligible entities to qualified consumers using funds provided by the Secretary may bear interest up to 3 percent and finance energy efficiency measures to decrease energy usage or costs. The loan purpose is to decrease energy costs for the qualified consumer without causing financial burden, not for personal property unless attached to real property, and repayment is through charges on the electric bill for energy efficiency measures. The requirement allows for voluntary prepayment of a loan and additional repayment mechanisms with appropriate risk mitigation features. An energy audit by an eligible entity is required to assess the impact of proposed energy efficiency measures on energy costs and consumption. The curr_chunk discusses efficiency measures on energy costs and consumption for qualified consumers, contractors serving as general contractors, and contracts for measurement, verification, training, and technical assistance. The Secretary offers agreements to eligible entities for energy efficiency loan demonstration projects. Qualified entities can use subcontractors for assistance in carrying out contracts. Technical assistance and training programs are developed for employees of eligible entities. The Secretary evaluates eligible entities for energy efficiency loans based on criteria such as energy audit approaches, measurement processes, employee training, and state participation. The Secretary evaluates eligible entities for energy efficiency loans based on specific criteria and aims to enter agreements within 90 days for implementation. The loans aim to reduce the need for generating capacity and serve areas with a high percentage of consumers in manufactured homes or housing units over 50 years old. The Secretary may conduct additional demonstration projects without certain criteria, as outlined in paragraph (1) of the section. The Secretary has additional authority to offer loans under this section, in addition to existing authority. The loans and expenditures will be available until expended, with new loans authorized as old ones are repaid. Regulations must be implemented within 180 days of enactment.
