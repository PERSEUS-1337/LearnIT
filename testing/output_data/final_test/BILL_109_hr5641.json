The Safe Overseas Human Testing Act requires manufacturers of new drugs or devices to conduct trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. Institutional Review Boards oversee the research plans and informed consent forms to protect human participants. Researchers must implement safeguards to protect participants' rights and welfare. The FDA relies on Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to ensure that manufacturers inform human participants of risks and benefits in clinical trials and obtain voluntary consent. Foreign clinical trials may be accepted by the FDA even if they do not meet US IRB and ethical requirements. Foreign clinical trials in developing countries may not meet stringent US standards, leaving participants vulnerable to unethical practices. Researchers take advantage of weak regulatory systems and illiteracy rates to test experimental drugs on uninformed individuals. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and the Office of the Inspector General highlighted ethical issues in international clinical trials in developing countries, emphasizing inadequate regulatory protections for participants. The Inspector General recognized concerns about foreign IRBs' lack of experience and monitoring practices. Recommendations include collecting more data on foreign IRBs and clinical investigations. Existing laws allow manufacturers to profit from uninformed patients in developing countries. On June 10, 2004, the FDA proposed replacing the requirement for foreign clinical studies to adhere to the Declaration of Helsinki with a new requirement to comply with good clinical practice (GCP). Pharmaceutical companies support this change, but organizations like the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Public Citizen oppose it due to concerns about patient protection. The FDA proposed replacing the Declaration of Helsinki requirement with good clinical practice in foreign clinical studies, which has support from pharmaceutical companies but opposition from patient advocacy groups. The FDA has not finalized the proposed rule as of June 15, 2006. The United States policy aims to control the export of test articles for clinical investigations involving human participants to promote public health and safety, prevent harm to foreign policy, and maintain credibility as a responsible trading partner. Measures are in place to protect public health. To implement the policy on exporting test articles for clinical investigations, an export license approved by the President is required. The President can use the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 for this purpose. Criteria for the export license include identifying the clinical investigation and obtaining certification from an institutional review board. To export test articles for clinical investigations, an export license approved by the President is required. The criteria include securing certification from an institutional review board and submitting it to the President. Reporting requirements to congressional committees are also mandated annually. The President's approval is required to export test articles for clinical investigations, with reporting requirements to congressional committees annually. The report must include applicant names, approved applicants, and destination countries for each export license application. Definitions for terms like \"application for research or marketing permit\" and \"appropriate congressional committees\" are also provided. The term \"clinical investigation\" refers to experiments involving a test article and human subjects, with results intended for submission to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for research or marketing permit application. The term \"clinical investigation\" excludes experiments that must meet specific regulations regarding nonclinical laboratory studies. The term \"destination country\" refers to where test articles are exported, while \"human subject\" includes individuals participating in research as recipients of test articles or controls. The term \"institution\" encompasses any public entity. An institution is defined as any public or private entity in the US or another country. An institutional review board (IRB) is a group designated by an institution to review and approve biomedical research involving human subjects to protect their rights and welfare. IRB approval is the determination made by an IRB that a clinical investigation can be conducted. The term \"test article\" refers to any drug, biological product, medical device, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if introduced into interstate commerce."
