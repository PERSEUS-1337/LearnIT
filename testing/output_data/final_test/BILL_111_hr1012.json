    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility Safe Closure Act of 2009\". Since the United States began its Global War on Terrorism, terrorists have been detained at Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility (GTMO), Cuba, which is the only complex in the world capable of safely holding high-security risk individuals. GTMO provides maximum security, multiple levels of confinement, and medical care not widely available. It is also the largest source of human intelligence in the war on terror. New intelligence collected from detainees at GTMO is crucial in fighting terrorists globally. It includes information on al-Qaida's structure, terrorist presence in various regions, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, recruitment methods, and terrorist skill sets. The Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) at GTMO is a unique facility providing secure location for detainees, access to classified information, defense lawyers, prosecution, and media. There are two lawyers for every charged detainee and 127 healthcare professionals for detainee health care. Since 2002, over 520 detainees have left Guantanamo for other countries, with a ratio of 1 health care professional for every 2 detainees. GTMO is operated by the Department of Defense, using only approved interrogation techniques. Detainees are treated humanely, with no solitary confinement or waterboarding. Treatment and oversight exceed maximum-security prisons worldwide. Approximately 245 detainees from over 30 countries remain at GTMO, including terrorist trainers, financiers, bomb makers, and recruiters. They fall into three categories: those cleared for release but with no country willing to accept them, those awaiting trial, and those deemed high threats to the US or from certain countries. The Pentagon claims that 61 released GTMO detainees have returned to the fight. Said Ali al-Shihri, involved in the bombing of the US Embassy in Yemen, was released to Saudi Arabia, went through a rehabilitation program, and is now the deputy leader of al-Qaida in Yemen. In 2007, the Senate passed a resolution stating that Guantanamo detainees should not be released into American society or transferred to facilities in American communities. President Obama ordered the closing of GTMO prisons within a year, but the US is still in a global war on terror and will likely detain terrorists elsewhere if GTMO is closed. SEC. 3 prohibits the use of funds to transfer enemy combatants from Guantanamo Bay to the United States or coordinate with other agencies for such transfers. SEC. 4 prohibits the use of certain closed Department of Defense facilities to house enemy combatants. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from using closed facilities for housing enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay. Additionally, the construction, improvement, or modification of any facility in the US or its territories for housing detainees from Guantanamo is also prohibited."
