    "content": "Surrogate models can accelerate approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) by modeling the discrepancy between simulated and observed data with a Gaussian process. Bayesian optimal design strategies are developed to parallelize expensive simulations and quantify uncertainty in the ABC posterior. ABC is used for Bayesian inference when the likelihood function is unavailable or costly to evaluate, with applications in genomics, epidemiology, and climate science. Surrogate models like neural networks and Gaussian processes are used to improve the sample-efficiency of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) in costly simulations such as in genomics, epidemiology, and climate science. Gaussian processes are employed to model the discrepancy between observed and simulated data. Bayesian optimal design methods are proposed to enhance sample-efficiency in this framework. In this work, batch simulation methods are developed to improve sample-efficiency in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) by decreasing wall-time needed for inference. The accuracy of posterior distribution summaries for decision making is important when computational resources are limited, but this aspect has not been explicitly addressed in earlier work. We propose a numerical method to propagate uncertainty in the discrepancy to ABC posterior summaries, termed Bayesian ABC. This framework improves sample-efficiency in ABC by reducing wall-time for inference. Bayesian ABC aims to quantify the penalty of reporting a wrong ABC posterior, using a loss function based on the discrepancy between the unnormalized ABC posterior and its estimator. The optimal estimator is the mean, and the expected integrated variance (EIV) acquisition function is computed using greedy optimization and importance sampling. The expected integrated MAD (EIMAD) acquisition function is developed using importance sampling, along with heuristically-motivated batch methods as baselines. Pointwise marginal uncertainty of the unnormalized ABC posterior is used for selecting simulation locations, but understanding the accuracy of the final estimate is challenging due to the nonlinear dependence on the infinite-dimensional quantity f. A simulation-based approach is proposed for computing the distribution of the ABC posterior expectation or marginals. The text discusses a simulation-based approach using GP sample paths and importance sampling to compare sequential and batch acquisition methods. Two real-world simulation models are used for comparison, with ABC-MCMC used to compute the ground truth ABC posterior. The quality of approximations is measured using the total variation distance over repeated simulations. The Lorenz model is described as a coupled stochastic differential equation representing slow weather variables' dynamics and their dependence on unobserved fast weather variables. The model involves a coupled stochastic differential equation with two parameters estimated from timeseries data. Results are shown in Fig. 1(a) with uncertainty quantification in Fig. 1(b-c). Batch size effects are depicted in Fig. 2(c). The bacterial infections model describes transmission dynamics in day care centers with intractable likelihood function. Parameters are estimated using true data and uniform priors. Discrepancy is formed as in Gutmann and Corander (2016). Discussion: The study compared different methods for obtaining posterior approximations in a limited simulation budget. EIV and EIMAD were found to produce more stable and accurate estimates compared to MAXV and MAXMAD. Batch strategies showed similar evaluation locations as sequential methods, indicating potential time savings for costly simulations. The uncertainty in the ABC posterior expectation converged towards the true expectation despite slight GP misspecification. The ABC posterior marginals of the bacterial infection model contain uncertainty after 600 iterations, which our approach quantifies rigorously. Developing more effective methods for computing these uncertainty estimates is a future research topic. The EIMAD acquisition function can be shown to be similar to EIV, with T as Owen's T function and MAD representing mean absolute deviation. The EIMAD acquisition function, similar to EIV, uses Owen's T function and mean absolute deviation (MAD). A heuristic approach from BO is proposed for computing acquisition functions like MAXV and MAXMAD, which can be computed analytically using variance and MAD, respectively. The heuristic approach from BO is proposed for parallellising MAXV and MAXMAD strategies. Acquisition functions are obtained as integrands of specific equations. Uncertainty quantification of the ABC posterior involves MCMC sampling from the instrumental density. Key details of the algorithm and experiments are briefly described. Initial GP model fitting locations are sampled from a uniform prior. The algorithm involves using initial points, basis functions, and a squared exponential covariance function. Owen's T function values are computed using a specific algorithm. The ABC posterior estimate is computed using different equations for MAXV, EIV, RAND, and MAXMAD, EIMAD strategies. Adaptive MCMC is used for sampling from the ABC posterior estimates. The ABC posterior estimate is computed using different equations for MAXV, EIV, RAND, and MAXMAD, EIMAD strategies. TV denotes the total variation distance between the estimated ABC posterior and the true one, computed numerically over 50 repeated runs. Mahalanobis distance is used as the discrepancy for the Lorenz model. The simulation model was run 500 times to estimate the covariance matrix of the six summary statistics by Hakkarainen et al. (2012). The paper aims to approximate any given ABC posterior with a limited simulation budget. The discrepancy for the bacterial infections model was defined by Gutmann and Corander (2016) using L1-distances. The ABC posterior was obtained using a similar approach as Numminen et al. (2013) with slight variations in the algorithm and data set comparison. The figures show initial and additional points selected using different acquisition functions, with the total variation distance between true and estimated ABC posteriors indicated in the title. Fig. 5 and 6 display estimated ABC posterior densities for the Lorenz and bacterial infections models, showcasing accuracy with limited simulations. Results from the sequential EIV method using 600 iterations for the Lorenz model and 620 simulations for the bacterial infections model are presented. Fig. 7 illustrates uncertainty quantification for the bacterial infections model, indicating some uncertainty in the exact shape of the ABC posterior despite accurate estimation at the last iteration."
