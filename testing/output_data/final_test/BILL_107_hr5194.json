Congress recognizes the importance of water as a vital resource for sustaining life, agriculture, transportation, energy production, and various other uses. Through legislative acts like the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Congress has aimed to restore and maintain the integrity of water resources. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act aims to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the United States by protecting intrastate waters and regulating discharges of pollutants. This is crucial for the interconnected hydrologic cycles and overall health of aquatic ecosystems. The term \"waters of the United States\" encompasses all waters subject to federal regulation, including wetlands and isolated bodies of water. Wetlands and other water bodies play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the aquatic environment. The waters of the United States, including intrastate and isolated waters, filter pollutants and provide crucial habitat for flora and fauna, contributing to the biological integrity of the aquatic environment. More than half of the duck population and amphibian species in the United States breed in these waters. Destroying, polluting, or altering small stream channels can have negative effects on entire watersheds, including introducing pollutants to larger streams and rivers, impacting interstate commerce. Protection of the waters of the United States, including intrastate and isolated waters, is crucial for preventing harm to interstate commerce and maintaining a robust navigation system. Thousands of businesses and communities rely on wetlands and these waters for protection. Protection of wetlands and intrastate waters is essential for preventing flooding, which damages public infrastructure and private properties. Millions of people rely on these waters for filtering and recharging drinking water supplies, and polluted or depleted water sources can limit economic growth and harm human health. Intrastate and isolated waters are crucial for agriculture, recreation, and economic activities in the United States. Discharges of pollutants into these waters are mainly linked to commercial or economic activities. Activities that involve filling wetlands for various purposes like road construction, residential development, and waste disposal have a significant impact on interstate commerce. Discharging pollutants into US waters is also linked to commercial activities such as industrial production, transportation, agriculture, and resource extraction, as recognized by Congress in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Congress recognized the need for national water quality standards to protect aquatic ecosystems in the US and prevent businesses from profiting at the expense of environmental standards. States have the right to prevent water pollution, as outlined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Water Pollution Control Act allows States to manage programs to prevent pollution and protect water quality, in line with international treaties. Protecting the quality of and regulating activities affecting the waters of the United States is essential for safeguarding Federal land, including parkland, refuge land, and other federally owned land, as well as the various waters within that land. This is in accordance with international treaties such as the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals and the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere. Protecting Federal land and waters from pollutants and degradation is necessary to safeguard the quality of the waters of the United States. The purposes of this Act are to provide protection to waters of the United States, regulate activities affecting these waters, and restore their integrity. The Act also defines \"waters of the United States.\" Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1362) is amended to redefine \"waters of the United States\" to include various bodies of water subject to the legislative power of Congress. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act include changing references from \"navigable waters of the United States\" to \"waters of the United States\" throughout the Act."
