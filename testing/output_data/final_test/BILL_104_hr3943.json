The new section allows a taxpayer to claim a child credit amount for each qualifying child based on earned income. The credit amount is limited by the earned income amount and initial phasedown amount. The credit percentage and earned income amount are determined by the sum of the initial phasedown amount and the final phasedown amount. The credit percentage and earned income amount for qualifying children are as follows: 1st and 2nd child - 12.5% and $8,000, 3rd child - 4% and $25,000, 4th child and beyond - 3.33% and $30,000. The initial phasedown amount is determined based on the taxpayer's income exceeding $75,000 for individuals ($110,000 for joint filers) or $210, whichever is lower. The final phasedown amount is calculated as 2 percentage points for each $2,500 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds the threshold amount for the year. The section defines terms like earned income and qualifying child for tax purposes, with specific thresholds and percentages applied. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item after section 35. Section 35A allows for a credit for dependents under 18 years of age. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
