    "content": "The Act of 1998 is known as the \"Learning Differences Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that disability is a natural part of the human experience, including physical, mental, and cognitive impairments. Learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, affect the ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, reason, or perform math. 2,600,000 out of 5,100,000 children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act have learning disabilities. Around 2% of undergraduate students nationwide report having a learning disability. Individuals with learning disabilities require different teaching strategies to develop their talents and perform to their capacity. More individuals with learning disabilities can benefit from postsecondary education with appropriate programs and accommodations. Civil rights laws protect individuals with disabilities in higher education, and exemplary institutions exist to support students with learning disabilities. The Act aims to support higher education institutions experienced in serving students with learning disabilities by demonstrating and sharing effective teaching strategies and accommodations for individuals with disabilities in postsecondary education. The Secretary of Education can award grants to 5 institutions of higher education for projects to ensure equal educational opportunities for individuals with learning disabilities in postsecondary education. Grants will be awarded competitively for a 3-year period. Eligible entities must be described in section 4 of the Act. Entities eligible for grants under this Act are higher education institutions with experience in serving individuals with learning disabilities. Required activities are outlined in section 5. Entities eligible for grants under this Act are higher education institutions with experience in serving individuals with learning disabilities. Recipients of the grant must use the funds to develop innovative approaches for postsecondary education, synthesize research on services for individuals with learning disabilities, conduct training sessions for personnel, and prepare and disseminate products. The grant recipients must prepare and disseminate products based on their activities, coordinate findings with other similar products, and participate in conferences and professional networks related to postsecondary education for individuals with learning disabilities. The Secretary of Education will prioritize grants based on national geographic distribution, with a preference for historically Black colleges or universities meeting specific criteria. $10,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 1999 through 2001 to implement this Act."
