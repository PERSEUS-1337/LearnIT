Congress finds that the Treaty of 1868 between the United States and the Navajo Tribe of Indians provides for the education of the Navajo Nation citizens.

Dine College applies Dine Philosophy to enhance student learning. The US has a responsibility to provide educational opportunities for the Navajo Nation. Dine College's infrastructure is deteriorating, posing risks. The Act aligns with Executive Order 13592 to support Navajo educational needs. The Act aims to ensure self-determination for the Navajo Nation and people, strengthen their institutions of higher education, and improve economic and social conditions through education and training.
