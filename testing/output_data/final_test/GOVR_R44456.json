    "content": "The Bureau of Reclamation operates the Central Valley Project in California, delivering water to farms, municipal users, wildlife refuges, and fish and wildlife needs. The project includes dams, reservoirs, power plants, canals, and other facilities. The Central Valley Project in California delivers 70% of its water to urban users and 30% for irrigation. The Bay-Delta is a hub for water deliveries. After five years of drought, conditions improved in 2017 with less than 1% of the state in severe drought. In 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown mandated a 25% statewide reduction in water use for nonagricultural users due to severe drought conditions. The State Water Resources Control Board adopted a new regulation for water conservation, and the governor lifted the statewide drought emergency in April 2017 while maintaining water-saving measures. Reclamation provided estimated water allocations for Central Valley Project contractors for water year 2017. In water year 2017, most CVP water contractors received a 100% allocation, with some initially receiving lower allocations that were later revised upward. Legislation from the 114th Congress directed pumping to maximize water supplies for the CVP and allowed for increased pumping during high water events. The 115th Congress is considering legislation that proposes changes to CVP operations, including the GROW Act. This report provides a summary of recent hydrologic conditions in California and their impact on state and federal water management, with a focus on deliveries related to the federal CVP. It also addresses issues pertaining to CVP operations and the implementation of WIIN Act provisions. As of April 18, 2017, less than 1% of California was in severe drought, a significant improvement from previous years due to heavy rain and snowfall. Rainfall and snow-water content were well above average, with statewide snow-water equivalent at 164% of historical average. Water levels at California's largest reservoirs also rebounded in 2017. In 2017, California's largest reservoirs saw water levels rebound, with all five reservoirs at over 100% of historical average and 73%-99% of total capacity. The reservoirs serving the CVP had storage double from 4.9 million to over 9 million acre-feet by mid-March. Water allocation debates in California focus on the CVP and SWP projects supplying water to agricultural and municipal users statewide. The CVP and SWP pumps in California supply water to Central and Southern California. The CVP covers 400 miles from Redding to Bakersfield, providing water to agriculture, wildlife refuges, and M&I water users. Over 9.5 million acre-feet of water per year is potentially available for delivery from the CVP to its contractors. In a normal water year, the CVP delivers much less than the maximum contracted amount, with approximately 7 million acre-feet of water made available to CVP contractors. The largest contract holders by percentage include CVP's Friant Division contractors (24%), Sacramento River Settlement Contractors (22%), CVP SOD water service contractors (22%), and San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors (9%). In recent years, Reclamation has reduced water deliveries to many CVP contractors due to drought and other factors. For the 2017 water year, Reclamation expected 8.8 million acre-feet of water supplies, with most senior water rights contractors receiving 100% of their CVP water supplies. NOD CVP agricultural and M&I water service contractors were also expected to receive their full contract allotments in 2017. Water service contractors and Friant Division contractors were expected to receive their full contract allotments in 2017. Most CVP SOD agricultural water service contractors initially received 65% of contracted supplies, which was later revised to 100% in April 2017. SOD M&I contractors initially received a 90% allocation for 2017, also revised to 100%. Reclamation attributed the lower initial allocation for SOD agricultural water service contractors to a conservative estimate of water supplies for the year. Reclamation increased the 2017 allocation for CVP SOD contractors to 100%, with a carryover limit of 150,000 acre-feet for 2018. Environmental restrictions were expected to have a minimal impact on water cutbacks. The SWP, another major water project in California, is also in operation. The SWP, operated by California's DWR, provides water to M&I and some agricultural users. SWP water deliveries increased in 2016 and 2017. DWR estimated meeting 60% of requested deliveries in 2016 and increased the 2017 allocation estimate to 85%. Drought conditions and regulatory restrictions affected sectors and areas in California. Total statewide farm receipts declined sharply in 2015 and 2016. In 2015 and 2016, California experienced a significant decline in statewide farm receipts, leading to cutbacks, water rationing, and wildfires. Despite agriculture's reduced share of the state's economy, it remains the nation's largest producer in terms of cash farm receipts. California's farm and ranch receipts totaled $47 billion in 2015, down from previous years. Attention is focused on CVP and SWP allocations in 2017 and beyond due to lingering effects of past challenges. In 2015, California's farm receipts totaled $47 billion, down from previous years. The drought led to cutbacks, water rationing, and wildfires. Some agricultural users saw receipts grow, while others had to fallow land or purchase supplemental hay and grain. Water flows are critical for agriculture, hydropower, recreation, and fish and wildlife, with warm water temperatures causing losses in salmon runs and Delta smelt populations. The survey indicates a record low population of 13,000. Recent rains may benefit salmon and smelt, but poor ocean conditions in 2015 and 2016 will impact adult returns for coho and Chinook salmon, making 2017 returns uncertain. Drought poses risks to recreational activities, fisheries, and wetlands critical for migrating birds. State and federal regulations complicate water supply allocations from CVP and SWP projects. State and federal regulations impact water supply allocations from CVP and SWP projects, with restrictions to protect habitat, endangered species, and water quality. In wet years, pumping restrictions under the ESA may have a higher impact on exports than water quality restrictions. Reclamation estimated a 62,000 acre-feet reduction in CVP deliveries in 2014 due to ESA restrictions. In 2014, CVP deliveries saw a reduction of 62,000 acre-feet due to ESA restrictions, and an additional 176,300 acre-feet reduction from water quality restrictions. In 2015, ESA restrictions accounted for approximately 144,800 acre-feet of CVP delivery reductions. DWR estimated ESA restrictions led to a 47,000 acre-feet reduction in SWP deliveries in 2014 and a 92,000 acre-feet reduction in 2015. Ongoing cutbacks to CVP contractor allocations have drawn criticism towards Reclamation's operation of the project. Some users feel less reliance on carryover water in San Luis Reservoir is needed if more water supplies were certain during drought years. Debates have focused on factors beyond drought causing water curtailments, such as endangered species and water quality requirements. Proposals to amend Reclamation's directives for the CVP operation have been suggested to provide more water to contractors, including altering regulatory requirements under the ESA. Some propose water conservation, recycling, and increased storage to provide more water and avoid species extinction. Congress has enacted drought-related provisions to benefit CVP and SWP, including additional funding for western drought response. The WIIN Act of 2016 incorporated provisions from California drought-related bills, allowing higher pumping levels during temporary storm events if it doesn't harm listed species. Supporters argued for operational changes to the CVP. Supporters of CVP operational changes in the WIIN Act argued that it could provide additional water to users and improve management flexibility. Opponents raised concerns about potential negative effects on species' survival and water supply management efforts. Notable provisions aimed to increase water supplies during limited pumping periods, with increased communication and transparency influencing operational decisions in winter 2016-2017. The WIIN Act made operational changes to the CVP in 2016-2017, aiming to increase water supplies and management flexibility. However, the impact on water allocations in wet years like 2017 was minimal. The 115th Congress is expected to consider new legislation, such as the GROW Act, which includes provisions from previous congresses. Congress may also oversee CVP operations and WIIN Act implementation."
