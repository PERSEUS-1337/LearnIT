    "content": "The \"Firefighters Pay Fairness Act of 1994\" aims to improve pay equality, recruitment, and retention of Federal firefighters. It also encourages career advancement and training opportunities for these firefighters. Section 5504 of title 5, United States Code is amended to define the pay period for employees covering 2 administrative workweeks. The term 'employee' includes those in executive agencies, the judicial branch, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Botanic Garden, the Library of Congress, and individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia. The definition of a firefighter includes duties related to controlling and extinguishing fires. For pay computation purposes, the annual rate of basic pay for firefighters is used to calculate payment for employment. For pay computation purposes, the annual rate of basic pay is used to calculate payment for employment during administrative biweekly work periods. The rules for converting the annual rate to hourly, daily, or biweekly rates are specified. Rates are computed to the nearest cent, counting one-half and over as a whole cent. For computation purposes, if an employee who is not a firefighter performs firefighting duties during a biweekly pay period, their pay will be calculated using their annual rate of basic pay. Rates are computed to the nearest cent, rounding one-half and over as a whole cent. SEC. 4. OVERTIME. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 exempts certain employees from overtime provisions, such as firefighters under section 7(k). The Office of Personnel Management will determine overtime hours for other employees to ensure they are not paid less. Firefighters subject to section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act will receive overtime pay for hours exceeding 106 in a biweekly period at one and a half times their hourly rate. These payments will be considered part of basic pay for retirement and other benefits as provided by law. The amendment limits the payment of other premium pay for employees subject to section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and overtime calculations under subsection (d) of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 5. Minimum pay rate for firefighter promoted to supervisory position. Chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code is amended to include a new section 5385, which establishes a minimum pay rate for firefighters promoted to supervisory positions. The position must be paid at a basic rate equal to or greater than the employee's annual aggregate rate of pay, including basic pay and regularly scheduled overtime pay. The new section 5385 of Chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code establishes a minimum pay rate for firefighters promoted to supervisory positions, based on their annual aggregate rate of pay. This applies to firefighters who are promoted to supervisory roles and no longer fall under the provisions of section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Section 4109 of title 5, United States Code is amended to ensure firefighters selected for training are paid at their basic rate and overtime. Chapter 45 is amended to include a new subchapter for awarding firefighters with special skills and certifications. Section 4531 defines 'firefighter' and 'firefighting duties'. Section 4532 allows agencies to award cash up to 5% of basic pay to firefighters or employees with special skills like handling hazardous materials. Regulations for awards are determined by the agency head or through negotiations. The bargaining provisions for special skills or certifications include procedures for ascertaining skills, criteria for determining payment, and any other necessary provisions. The provisions of the Act, including award authority and effective dates, outline the process for awarding firefighters with special skills and certifications. The effective dates for different sections range from the first pay period after 60 days of enactment to October 1, 1994."
