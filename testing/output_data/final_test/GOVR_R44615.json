    "content": "President Trump's Executive Order 13783, issued on March 28, 2017, aims to promote domestically produced energy resources by rescinding the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan. This plan included initiatives like the Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, focusing on controlling methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. The order also requires agencies to review and potentially revise regulations that burden domestic energy production. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is specifically tasked with reviewing volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases regulations. EPA is reviewing emission standards for oil and natural gas sector and MSW landfills, following Executive Order 13783 to reconsider certain requirements. The Obama Administration updated EPA's oil and natural gas sector and landfill methane rules in August 2016. Judicial challenges have influenced the rules, with the D.C. Circuit granting EPA's requests to pause challenges. EPA has faced restrictions in staying requirements under review. This report examines legal issues related to methane regulations, including statutory authority, challenges, reconsideration, and stays. It covers CAA Section 111 and Section 307 requirements, oil and natural gas sector rules, and MSW landfill methane rules. EPA issued the regulations being reconsidered. The EPA issued regulations addressing methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources and MSW landfills under CAA Section 111, which requires establishing standards of performance for listed source categories. These standards reflect the best system of emission reduction that has been adequately demonstrated, taking into account the cost of achieving the reductions. EPA must consider cost, health impacts, and energy requirements for emission reductions. After issuing standards for new sources, EPA must require states to submit plans for existing sources. These \"emission guidelines\" must be followed by states when implementing standards. Congress mandates EPA to consider the same factors for both new and existing sources. EPA's authority is limited under Section 111(d)(1)(A). EPA's authority under Section 111(d)(1)(A) is limited when issuing emission guidelines for existing sources. The agency must regulate pollutants for existing sources if they are not already regulated as criteria pollutants or hazardous air pollutants. For example, methane emissions from existing MSW landfills can be addressed under Section 111(d) once standards are issued for new sources. EPA's authority under Section 111(d) is currently challenged, with emission guidelines previously issued for various sources including MSW landfills, fossil fuel-fired power plants, and other industrial facilities. EPA must convene a reconsideration proceeding if certain conditions are met. The EPA must hold a reconsideration proceeding if certain conditions are met, including demonstrating that the objection to a final rule could not have been raised during the public comment period for the proposed rule. If reconsideration is granted, the petitioner is entitled to the same procedural rights as if the information had been available during the rule proposal. Denial of the petition can be reviewed judicially, and the effectiveness of the rule may not be automatically postponed unless a stay is granted by the EPA or a court for up to three months during reconsideration. The EPA may grant a three-month stay for reconsideration of rules in the oil and natural gas sector to limit emissions of VOCs and methane. This sector is a major emitter of these pollutants in the US. In response to petitions for reconsideration, EPA proposed a rule to revise and update standards for methane emissions in the industry. EPA revised the 2012 NSPS in 2016 to address methane emissions from oil and gas sources, expanding coverage and setting standards for various emission sources. The 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs regulate methane emissions from oil and gas sources, with estimated reductions of 510,000 short tons of methane by 2025. The standards apply to equipment, processes, and activities in the production, processing, transmission, and storage phases of oil and natural gas systems constructed or modified after July 17, 2014. EPA estimated costs of $530 million and \"climate benefits\" of $690 million by 2025. EPA withdrew an Information Collection Request (ICR) in 2017 related to regulating methane emissions from existing oil and natural gas sources. This decision came after pressure from state attorneys general and governors. EPA has not indicated if or when the ICR will be reissued, leading to potential legal action from states, cities, and environmental groups. EPA granted administrative petitions for reconsideration of aspects of the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs, including fugitive emissions requirements for low production well sites and criteria for alternative means of emission limitations. EPA found it impracticable for petitioners to object to these requirements during the public comment period. EPA granted reconsideration of aspects of the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs, including fugitive emissions requirements and criteria for alternative emission limitations. Petitioners were unable to object during the public comment period. EPA identified issues with PE certification requirements and technical infeasibility determinations. EPA acknowledged the lack of cost information related to PE certification. EPA has initiated an administrative reconsideration proceeding to address compliance requirements related to PE certification and fugitive emissions in the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs. The agency plans to prepare a notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment on these issues and may potentially revise other aspects of the emission standards. EPA must follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures if the rule is revised. The EPA initiated a reconsideration process for the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs, staying parts of the rule until August 31, 2017. The D.C. Circuit later ruled that the 90-day stay was unauthorized and vacated it. The majority of the court vacated the stay imposed by the EPA on the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs, stating that the stay was a reviewable \"final agency position\" affecting regulated parties' rights. Judge Janice Rogers Brown dissented, arguing that the stay was not a final agency action. Judge Janice Rogers Brown dissented, stating that the stay on the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs was not a final agency action as it did not compel compliance or impose legal requirements. The majority of the court rejected EPA's argument that it had inherent authority to issue the stay, emphasizing that EPA can only act within delegated authority from Congress. They found that EPA's reliance on Section 307(d)(7)(B) for the stay was limited to situations where the agency was required to reconsider the rule. The majority of the court reviewed EPA's reconsideration decision on the stay of the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs. They determined that reconsideration was not mandatory as industry groups had ample opportunity to comment on the issues raised. Therefore, EPA was not authorized to issue the three-month stay, leading to the conclusion that the decision to impose the stay was \"arbitrary.\" The court found EPA's decision to impose a stay on the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs as \"arbitrary\" and \"capricious,\" leading to the vacating of the stay. This decision could impact future cases challenging EPA's authority to issue temporary stays under CAA Section 307(d)(7)(B) when reconsidering a rule. The agency is required to reconsider a rule, and some federal agencies have been struck down by courts for attempting to use the Administrative Procedure Act to stay rules. For example, a federal district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs alleging that the Bureau of Land Management violated the APA by postponing compliance dates for methane emissions regulations. The EPA proposed to extend the stay of certain requirements for two years, stating it is \"necessary.\" The EPA proposed a longer stay to reconsider requirements, seeking comments on legal authority and challenges in implementing the stayed requirements. EPA did not identify the legal authority for the stay and issued a notice of data availability for additional input. EPA is considering extending compliance periods for the requirements under reconsideration. EPA is reconsidering the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs and seeking comments on legal authority. The agency argues that staying or extending compliance deadlines is within its authority under the Clean Air Act. The public comment period for the NODAs closed in December 2017. The underlying rule is also being challenged in court by various parties. The 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs are being challenged in court by eleven states, the city of Chicago, and environmental advocacy groups supporting EPA. The case has been consolidated with North Dakota v. EPA, with litigation paused for the agency to review the rule. Potential legal issues include a challenge to EPA's authority to issue the NSPSs under CAA Section 111. The 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs are being challenged in court for EPA's failure to make the required \"endangerment finding\" for methane from the oil and gas sector under CAA Section 111. EPA listed \"crude oil and natural gas production\" as a source category in 1979 based on this finding. In the final rule, EPA relied on its 1979 \"endangerment finding\" for \"crude oil and natural gas production\" as authority to issue new NSPSs for methane and VOC emissions. EPA stated that a separate \"endangerment finding\" for methane was not needed due to the 2009 Endangerment Finding for motor vehicles addressing emissions of GHGs. The final rule expressed standards as limitations on methane emissions. The final rule included a new \"endangerment finding\" based on scientific analyses, determining that the source category contributes significantly to air pollution endangering public health. Petitioners challenge the finding as arbitrary and claim EPA unlawfully expanded regulation to include additional emission sources. EPA established limitations on methane emissions in the final rule. EPA's final rule on oil and gas production did not expand the source category, despite challenges from petitioners. The 1979 listing broadly covered the industry, including compressor stations, and the agency argued that smaller emissions points were already encompassed. The EPA's final rule on oil and gas production did not expand the source category, despite challenges from petitioners. The 1979 listing broadly covered the natural gas industry, including production, processing, transmission, and storage of oil and natural gas. The agency previously evaluated emissions from various segments of the natural gas industry, such as production and processing. Smaller sources emitting less than 100 tons of emissions could be subject to NSPSs, even though the 1979 listing was classified under \"major source categories.\" The 1984 proposed NSPSs aimed to limit VOC emissions from specific equipment in the natural gas production industry. The EPA's final rule on oil and gas production broadened the source category to include production, processing, transmission, and storage of oil and natural gas. EPA addressed concerns about ambiguity by revising the category listing to encompass the entire oil and natural gas industry. The EPA's final rule on oil and gas production expanded the source category to cover the entire oil and natural gas industry. The court granted EPA's request to hold cases in abeyance as they review and reconsider the rule. Landfills emit gases containing methane, carbon dioxide, and various nonmethane organic compounds. EPA listed municipal solid waste landfills as a category of stationary sources in 1996. The EPA listed municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills as a source category in 1996, addressing NMOCs and methane emissions. In 2014, EPA proposed updates to the NSPSs for MSW landfills and sought public input on updating emission guidelines for existing landfills. In 2016, updated NSPSs were published to reduce landfill gas emissions from MSW landfills built after July. The EPA updated NSPSs in 2016 to reduce landfill gas emissions from MSW landfills. The revised guidelines lowered the emission threshold for gas capture requirements and updated monitoring requirements. The EPA updated NSPSs in 2016 to reduce landfill gas emissions from MSW landfills. The rule included monitoring updates, expanded approved uses for treated landfill gas, and clarified definitions. By 2025, 115 new or modified landfills would need to comply with the emission control requirements. Active landfills emitting over 34 metric tons of NMOCs annually must install gas collection systems. Closed landfills follow a 1996 threshold of 50 metric tons per year for control installation. The revised standards will apply to 731 existing open and closed landfills, compared to 638 under the 1996 requirements. The EPA updated NSPSs in 2016 to reduce landfill gas emissions from MSW landfills, with new rules effective since October 28, 2016. In May 2017, EPA granted petitions for reconsideration of certain requirements in the revised MSW landfill NSPSs and emission guidelines. The 2016 rules added Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring procedures for certain landfills to comply with emission control requirements. The EPA granted petitions for reconsideration of certain requirements in the revised MSW landfill NSPSs and emission guidelines in 2017. The final rule imposed restrictions on the use of Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring method without public comment, reducing flexibility. The EPA granted petitions for reconsideration of certain requirements in the revised MSW landfill NSPSs and emission guidelines in 2017, reducing flexibility by imposing restrictions on the use of Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring method. EPA has convened an administrative reconsideration proceeding to address issues raised by petitioners and plans to prepare a notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment. The effectiveness of both rules was stayed for three months starting from May 31, 2017, due to the integral nature of Tier 4 monitoring provisions. The 2016 rules for MSW landfills NSPSs and emission guidelines are currently in effect during the reconsideration process. Environmental groups have filed a petition challenging the three-month stay of the rules in the D.C. Circuit, with final briefs due on February 26, 2018. The court is addressing standing and mootness issues now that the stay has expired. The challenge to the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs stay argues that EPA exceeded its authority and the stay is arbitrary and capricious. Industry trade associations and waste management companies challenged EPA's 2016 MSW landfills emission guidelines in court, which are now being reconsidered by the agency. The petitioners have challenged EPA's authority to revise emission guidelines for existing MSW landfills under CAA Section 111(d). The core legal argument questions whether EPA can update emission standards under Section 111(d) without a mandated review period. EPA's implementing regulations for Section 111(d) emission guidelines are being questioned. EPA's implementing regulations for Section 111(d) emission guidelines address revisions to adverse public health effects, compliance times, and state plan revisions. The agency has discretionary authority to review emission guidelines when necessary, citing the gap-filling nature of CAA Section 111(d) to regulate air pollutants not covered elsewhere. EPA argues that it would be illogical to prevent existing sources from updating pollution controls as the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) evolves over time. EPA argues for the authority to update air pollution controls for existing sources as the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) changes over time, citing regulatory agencies' power to adapt rules to the nation's needs. The agency, under the Trump Administration, is using a similar argument to delay compliance timelines for the 2016 Oil and Gas NSPSs. EPA's authority to revise Section 111(d) emission guidelines has not been questioned previously. Some argue that Congress intentionally did not provide for similar review and revision as with Section 111(b) NSPSs. The EPA argued that Congress did not specifically preclude them from updating emission guidelines. The legislative history of CAA Section 111 does not discuss the review of emission guidelines, but emphasizes the need for EPA to consider evolving techniques for setting standards. The EPA can review and revise emission control standards to encourage constant improvement in pollution prevention technology, as mandated by the Clean Air Act amendments. This includes utilizing available technology and promoting the development of new techniques. Section 111(d) emission guidelines require EPA to establish a procedure similar to Section 110 for states to submit plans for existing source air pollutant standards. States must adopt and submit state implementation plans for NAAQS enforcement, reviewed every five years by EPA. The EPA revises NAAQS every five years, requiring states to update their SIPs. Section 111(d) also mandates state plans for existing source standards, similar to NAAQS enforcement. Congress may have intended for EPA to revise Section 111(d) guidelines and state plans like NAAQS and SIPs under Sections 109 and 110. The EPA's authority to review and revise Section 111(d) emission guidelines for existing sources is being challenged in litigation. If upheld, this could lead to future revisions requiring additional emission reductions based on new analysis. Litigation on MSW landfill emission guidelines is on hold pending EPA's review."
