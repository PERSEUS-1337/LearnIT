    "content": "Medical malpractice has been a topic of congressional attention during crisis periods in the mid-1970s, mid-1980s, and early 2000s due to sharp increases in insurance premiums, difficulties in finding coverage, and providers leaving areas. While the current medical liability insurance market is not in crisis, issues with affordability and availability persist. Issues with the affordability and availability of malpractice insurance persist, especially in certain regions and physician specialties. Concerns about medical malpractice claims may lead to defensive medicine practices, increasing healthcare costs. The malpractice system also faces challenges with equity, access, compensating patients, deterring substandard care, and promoting patient safety. Public policy measures to address insurance market disruptions have been debated. The HEALTH Act and other proposals aim to address issues with the tort and insurance systems in medical malpractice cases. The 112th Congress introduced H.R. 2 to repeal P.L. 111-148 and passed H.R. 5 for medical liability reform. Medical liability reform legislation, H.R. 5, was introduced by Representative Phil Gingrey in 2011. The bill passed the House and was reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In the Senate, similar bills S. 218 and S. 1099 were introduced but have not been acted upon. The introduced medical liability reform legislation, including H.R. 5, S. 218, and S. 1099, would preempt certain aspects of state medical malpractice laws. The bills aim to address medical malpractice and product liability, with a focus on provider medical malpractice. They define a \"health care lawsuit\" broadly and propose uniform statutes of limitations and caps for damages and fees, while allowing states some flexibility. The legislation would grant states flexibility by not preempting state laws that provide greater protections for health care providers and organizations from liability. An amendment was adopted to eliminate a provision allowing juries to consider \"collateral source benefits\" in H.R. 5. The amended version of H.R. 5 allows for punitive damages in health care lawsuits if the product causing harm was misbranded, adulterated, contaminated, mislabeled, or improperly stored. CBO estimates a 0.5% decrease in health spending and a $57 billion reduction in the federal budget deficit over 10 years. The amended version of H.R. 5, known as the HEALTH Act, retained the collateral source rule, resulting in savings. The full House considered H.R. 5 under H.Res. 591 in 2012, including Title I of the Protecting Access to Healthcare Act. The bill also included a new Title II to repeal provisions of the ACA related to the Independent Payment Advisory Board, with CBO estimating a $45.5 billion reduction in the federal budget deficit over 10 years. Four amendments were adopted during floor consideration, two of which impact civil liability protections. Two key amendments affecting civil liability protections for health care providers were adopted during floor consideration of H.R. 5. H.Amdt. 989, introduced by Representative Charlie Dent, extends FTCA coverage to certain health care providers under EMTALA. H.Amdt. 991, introduced by Representative Cliff Stearns, also impacts civil liability protections. The House adopted three key amendments related to civil liability protections for health care providers under H.R. 5. One of the amendments, H.Amdt. 991, grants limited civil liability protection to health care professionals volunteering in response to federally declared disasters or public health emergencies. Another amendment, H.Amdt. 990, removes the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust exemption for health insurers. H.R. 5, as amended, passed the House with a vote of 223-181. The report accompanying H.Con.Res. 112 includes language on reforming medical malpractice insurance. The budget resolution supports changes to laws governing medical liability, including limits on damages. Committees were instructed to submit legislation reducing the federal deficit, with significant deficit reduction targets. H.R. 5652, introduced by Representative Paul Ryan, included recommendations from various committees. Paul Ryan introduced H.R. 5652 on May 9, 2012, which included recommendations from various committees, including the HEALTH Act. The bill aimed to reduce the deficit by $48.6 billion from 2012-2022. It passed the House on May 10, 2012. The President's FY2012 budget called for reforming the medical malpractice system to lower costs and improve patient outcomes. The President's FY2012 budget requested $250 million in grants for states to reform medical malpractice disputes. The grants would support the creation of health courts with specialized judges and medical experts to determine injury causes and compensation ranges. States could also establish safe harbors for providers adhering to certified clinical standards. The curr_chunk discusses efforts to provide funding for physicians, hospitals, and providers who follow certified clinical practice guidelines and electronic health records. It suggests a \"safe harbor\" for non-negligence, grants for establishing rules after medical errors, and support for disclosure and apology protocols. Grant funding could also be used for safety officers and training in disclosure and apology. The funding could support safety officers, training of health care personnel in disclosure and apology protocols, and mediation programs for compensation. States could use grants for legal reforms like modifying malpractice awards and allocating responsibility for payments. These grants were not funded in FY2012, and the FY2013 budget does not include language on general medical malpractice reform. However, it includes a request for $250 million for Department of Justice grants. The FY2013 budget includes a request for $250 million for Department of Justice grants to reform medical malpractice disputes, as in FY2012. The ACA encourages states to develop alternatives to civil litigation for medical malpractice claims. President Obama directed HHS to award grants for safety officers, training, and mediation programs. In September 2009, President Obama directed HHS to award grants to states for patient safety approaches and medical liability reforms. AHRQ awarded $25 million to states in June 2010 under this directive. ACA Section 10607 authorized $50 million for demonstration grants to states for alternatives to tort litigation in resolving disputes over healthcare provider injuries. States must develop alternatives promoting dispute resolution and reducing healthcare errors. The grant promotes the collection and analysis of patient safety data related to resolved disputes. States must demonstrate that their alternative increases availability of prompt resolutions, encourages disclosure of errors, and does not conflict with state tort law. Medical malpractice insurance premiums add little to the direct cost of health care relative to total health care spending, but tort reform may result in savings over time by reducing indirect costs to the system. In 2009, medical malpractice insurance premiums totaled $10.2 billion, while health expenditures were $2.6 trillion in 2010. Indirect costs, such as defensive medicine, have been estimated to be higher than direct costs. Some synthesis studies suggest that national estimates of defensive medicine costs are unreliable. A recent analysis estimated the total cost of defensive medicine in 2008 at $45.6 billion. The CBO's analysis of federal tort reforms in H.R. 5 projected a potential reduction in national health care spending by 0.4%-0.5%, equivalent to $9 billion to $11 billion in 2010. This estimate includes the impact of lowering medical malpractice insurance premiums and reducing health care service utilization. Some studies found a 4%-9% reduction in hospital spending for Medicare patients with heart disease in states with tort reforms. Another study showed a 3%-4% decrease in personal health care expenditures. The CBO estimated that federal tort reform could save $34 billion to $48 billion from 2011 to 2021 in various healthcare programs. Federal tort reform could save up to $48 billion from 2011 to 2021, leading to an increase in federal revenues of $6 billion to almost $10 billion. Combining the impact on mandatory health spending and tax revenues, the reform could reduce the federal budget deficit by approximately $40 billion to $57 billion over 10 years. Addressing medical malpractice issues is complex due to interactions of health care, tort, and insurance systems. Improving patient safety and reducing medical errors may decrease injuries that lead to malpractice claims. Improving patient safety and reducing medical errors may decrease injuries that lead to medical malpractice claims, potentially benefiting the medical malpractice insurance system by lowering premiums and improving access to insurance. States and the federal government play a role in reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through regulating medical licensure and practice standards. Inconsistencies in regulatory standards across states could have a negative impact on patient safety. Data collection efforts are crucial for tracking and analyzing medical errors. The existence, scope, and robustness of data collection efforts to track and analyze medical errors vary between states. Federal patient safety policies can be implemented through voluntary and mandatory approaches, such as national-level medical error reporting systems and quality standards for institutional providers. Concerns about liability in the malpractice system may lead to defensive medicine practices. Defensive medicine practices in healthcare may lead providers to avoid high-risk services to reduce liability risk, potentially resulting in increased healthcare spending on unnecessary services or decreased access for certain patients. The provision of unnecessary healthcare services can also harm patients directly. While studies have found evidence of defensive medicine, measuring its impact is challenging. Factors like physician payment systems and financial incentives contribute to over-provision of healthcare services, along with failure to adhere to evidence-based practices. The tort system compensates for medical errors by providing monetary compensation to those injured due to substandard healthcare. Some argue it efficiently compensates and deters errors, while others believe it is arbitrary and ineffective in addressing medical malpractice issues. Jury verdicts vary significantly, with many valid claims going unfiled and filed claims not always due to negligence. Liability insurance protects providers from the direct costs of medical malpractice by spreading the costs across a wide base of providers. Some providers may practice without malpractice insurance, potentially impacting the wider healthcare system. Medical malpractice claims can take a long time to resolve due to delays in recognizing claims and deliberations. Liability insurance for medical malpractice claims can be delayed in resolution due to the time lag in recognizing claims and court deliberations. The uncertainty in estimating future claims and investment returns can lead to volatility in premiums. State regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 results in market variations and data discrepancies. The NAIC aggregates some insurance data, but there are still gaps in potentially useful information. The NAIC aggregates insurance data, but many potentially useful data on medical malpractice claims are not collected or available. Recent trends in the medical malpractice insurance market show encouraging signs, but it is unclear if they are long-term or part of a cycle. The link to state or federal policies is also uncertain. The cyclical experience of medical malpractice insurers is reflected in aggregate data analyzed by the NAIC. From 1992 to 1998, direct incurred losses were stable, varying from $3.18 billion to $4.46 billion. However, from 1998 to 2003, losses grew steadily to $8.46 billion, coinciding with a crisis period. From 2003 to 2010, losses fell every year to $3.52 billion, with 2011 slightly higher at $3.66 billion. Premiums roughly followed losses, but have not fallen as much in recent years. The loss ratio reflects this uneven trend. The loss ratio for the medical malpractice insurance industry has fluctuated over the years, with a significant decrease in recent times. In 2010, the loss ratio was at its lowest in nearly two decades, indicating higher profits for insurers. Despite the low loss ratios, increased competition in the market may not be happening as quickly as expected. In 2009, there were 10,739 paid medical malpractice claims in the United States\u201427.6% fewer than in 2003. Paid claims represent only a part of total claims, with a majority either dropped or settled through litigation. Roughly 80% of cases that went to trial resulted in the alleged wrongdoer being exonerated. Only two states, Massachusetts and New Mexico, saw an increase in paid medical malpractice claims between 2003 and 2009. Between 2003 and 2009, there was a significant decrease in paid medical malpractice claims in the United States, with only Massachusetts and New Mexico experiencing an increase. The average claim paid in 2009 was $323,273, up from $289,891 in 2003, reflecting a similar rate of increase as medical inflation. However, there was considerable variance across states, with Kansas averaging $155,622 per claim and Wisconsin averaging almost $761,000 per claim. Sixteen states saw a decline in their average claims paid, ranging from 5% to 50%. Between 2003 and 2009, there was a significant decrease in paid medical malpractice claims in the United States, with only Massachusetts and New Mexico experiencing an increase. The average claim paid in 2009 was $323,273, up from $289,891 in 2003, reflecting a similar rate of increase as medical inflation. Averages may not fully reflect circumstances in particular states or among particular high-risk specialties. Some states appear to have sticky premiums, that is, premiums that have not fallen despite a reduction in the number of claims. Providers have been successful at identifying the causes of medical injuries and reducing them through quality improvement efforts. Providers have successfully identified causes of medical injuries and reduced them through quality improvement efforts, leading to a decrease in medical malpractice lawsuits and lower premiums. Anesthesiology deaths have significantly declined, and malpractice insurance premiums for anesthesiologists have decreased by over 40% since 1985. Evidence shows that improvements in patient safety result in fewer malpractice claims, as seen in a recent RAND Corporation study in California. In 2010, Virginia Mason Medical Center was recognized for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety, leading to a significant decrease in medical malpractice premiums. Premiums have dropped by 52% since 2005, saving millions of dollars. Other healthcare systems have also achieved similar outcomes by focusing on quality improvement and error prevention. Some argue that hospitals need to internalize the costs of errors to improve quality and reduce errors."
