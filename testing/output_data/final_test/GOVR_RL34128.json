    "content": "The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for promoting and regulating railroad safety in the U.S. Reauthorization of the FRA is being discussed in Congress due to concerns about the need for further progress in rail safety, despite improvements in some measures. In the 110th Congress, reauthorization of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has been discussed in both the House and Senate. Various proposals, including the Federal Railroad Safety Accountability and Improvement Act (H.R. 1516 and S. 918) and the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2095), have been introduced. The latter bill was approved by the House of Representatives on October 17, 2007. The Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security introduced the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007 (S. 1889). The bill was reported out on March 3, 2008, after a managers' amendment was adopted. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent on August 1, 2008, substituting S. 1889 for H.R. 2095. Major provisions include changes to rail hours of service law, positive train control implementation deadlines, and new requirements for highway-rail grade crossings. The nation's railroad sector includes freight and passenger rail systems, with roughly 570 freight railroads and 118 passenger, commuter, and excursion railroads. These organizations employ around 235,000 people and operate roughly 220,000 miles of track. The freight railroad industry is divided into three classes, with 7 railroads in the top category, Class I. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 largely deregulated the freight rail industry. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated the freight rail industry, leading to extensive consolidation. Employment decreased from 480,000 in 1980 to 235,000 in 2006, while freight revenue ton-miles increased significantly. The miles of road operated in freight service decreased, but the number of train-miles operated increased. Passenger-miles also increased. The safety record of the industry improved between 1980 and 1994, but the rate of improvement has leveled off since then. Since 1994, the rate of train accidents has varied from 3.5 to 4.4 per million train miles, with concerns raised about the need for further improvement in rail safety. Grade-crossing collisions and resulting injuries and deaths have shown little improvement since 2003. Most rail-related deaths are due to pedestrians trespassing on rail lines and motorists colliding with trains at highway rail grade crossings. FRA classifies train accidents into five categories: human factors, track and structures, equipment, signal. The FRA classifies train accidents into five categories: human factors, track and structures, equipment, signal and train control, and miscellaneous. Human factors and track conditions are the main causes of train accidents, with examples including improperly positioned switches, moving rail cars without checking for safety, and defective track components. Without further reductions in accidents, the number of incidents and resulting deaths and injuries is expected to increase due to higher train traffic. The Department of Transportation predicts a 50% increase in freight moved by rail between 1998 and 2020, leading to more train traffic and potential accidents. The FRA's role in rail safety includes assessing operations, creating safety regulations, and enforcing compliance to prevent accidents and injuries. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) enforces federal rail safety laws and regulations, including those related to track condition, equipment, signal systems, maintenance at grade crossings, accident reporting, and more. With around 800 employees, including 430 inspectors, FRA oversees an industry with over 235,000 employees, 220,000 miles of track, and 1.3 million pieces of equipment. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees a vast rail network with 158,000 signals and switches, and 1.3 million freight cars and equipment. FRA conducts 63,000 inspections annually, focusing on high-risk locations based on accident data. Their core safety budget is around $200 million, with a traditional approach of regulating rail design and worker behavior. Inspections enforce compliance with minimum standards but do not assess overall safety risk management by railroads. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is adopting new approaches to supplement its traditional safety program by targeting inspections based on quantitative risk assessments and implementing risk management initiatives. One such initiative is the Confidential Close Call Reporting Program pilot project, which allows employees to report near-miss incidents confidentially to improve safety. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has implemented a new safety action plan in response to accidents in 2004 and 2005. The plan aims to reduce train accidents caused by human factors, employee fatigue, improve track and hazardous materials safety, strengthen safety compliance, and increase highway-rail grade crossing safety. The plan has been praised by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for providing a reasonable framework for improving rail safety. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has introduced a new safety action plan to address accidents and improve rail safety. The plan includes initiatives to reduce train accidents caused by human factors and employee fatigue. However, the full impact of these initiatives may not be known for several years. The plan also focuses on improving track and hazardous materials safety, strengthening safety compliance, and increasing highway-rail grade crossing safety. The effectiveness of FRA's inspection and enforcement programs in achieving safety goals is still uncertain. Key issues in the reauthorization debate include addressing employee fatigue and implementing new train control technology. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has introduced a new safety action plan to address accidents and improve rail safety. This includes initiatives to reduce train accidents caused by human factors and employee fatigue. The FRA estimates that fatigue is a contributing factor in 25% of serious train accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has identified fatigue as a factor in at least 18 rail accidents since 1984. Congress enacted legislation in 1907 to limit the amount of employee fatigue in the rail industry. The rail hours of service limits for train operating personnel and signalmen were established in 1907 by Congress to regulate work hours and rest periods. These limits are set in law and have not been substantially changed since 1969. Currently, train crews can work a maximum of 12 hours with 10 hours of rest required, or 8 hours of rest if working less than 12 hours, allowing for a maximum of 432 hours of work per month. The current rail hours of service rules allow train crew workers to work up to 432 hours a month, much higher than limits for commercial pilots, truck drivers, and maritime workers. However, most rail workers average between 125 to 175 hours a month, with only a small percentage exceeding 200 hours. The FRA and NTSB have acknowledged that the current regulations are outdated and do not address modern fatigue concerns. The FRA has raised concerns about the inadequacy of the current rail hours of service rules in controlling fatigue. The NTSB has recommended changes to the regulations, but DOT has not been able to respond due to statutory limitations. Issues include insufficient rest periods and schedules conflicting with circadian rhythms, with workers having limited time for personal tasks and uncertainty about their next shift. Rail employees may have as little as 5 to 6 hours of rest before returning to work due to short off-duty periods and uncertain work schedules. This can lead to difficulties in effectively utilizing available rest time between shifts. The unpredictability of train crew work schedules, influenced by labor agreements and prioritizing factors like seniority, makes it challenging for employees to plan their off-duty time effectively. Employees facing inadequate rest can decline work calls but risk disciplinary action. Research shows that humans, like most mammals, follow a circadian rhythm of approximately 24 hours for sleep and wake cycles. The current hours of service rule for rail workers may conflict with their circadian rhythms, leading to difficulty in getting adequate rest. Workers are on a rotating schedule that disrupts their circadian rhythm, impacting their performance and physiological functions. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) uses a fatigue model developed by researchers to estimate the level of fatigue experienced by workers based on various factors. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) uses a fatigue model to predict employee fatigue levels based on factors like time of day, recent sleep, and hours awake. FRA encourages rail companies to use this model for crew scheduling and supports efforts to address sleep disorders among rail employees. Railroads and rail labor cooperate to address fatigue, with some companies providing undisturbed rest periods after work shifts. Efforts to address fatigue in the rail industry have faced challenges due to factors like demand variability, staffing issues, and collective bargaining agreements. Only a small percentage of affected employees currently have access to programs for more predictable work schedules. Even successful voluntary programs are at risk of being changed or eliminated as industry conditions evolve. Both rail managers and workers have incentives that hinder efforts to address fatigue effectively. Efforts to address fatigue in the rail industry are hindered by incentives for both rail managers and workers to maintain the current hours of service system. Voluntary attempts to address fatigue are likely to face resistance due to the flexibility and income opportunities provided by the current system. The existing hours of service regime is deeply intertwined with labor agreements, making changes in this system challenging and potentially disruptive to negotiated provisions. The hours of service regime in the rail industry may impact provisions and upset the balance of interests achieved through negotiation. Limbo time occurs when a train crew reaches the work time limit but has not yet reached the release point. During limbo time, the crew must stop the train and wait for a replacement crew to arrive for transport to the final release point. This time is neither considered on-duty nor off-duty time under the hours of service law. Limbo time, a concept introduced in 1969 amendments to the rail hours of service law, occurs when a train crew reaches the work time limit but has not yet reached the release point. This time is not considered on-duty or off-duty, leading to concerns about employee fatigue and the adequacy of rest periods after long shifts. Rail labor requested that transportation time be considered on-duty, but railroads objected due to scheduling difficulties. Limbo time was introduced in 1969 to ensure train crews have adequate rest periods before their off-duty period begins. The time spent waiting with the train for transportation to its release point is considered limbo time, a concern for employee fatigue. The rail industry's changing conditions have exacerbated the issue since the 1960s. The rail industry has undergone significant consolidation, with a few major companies dominating operations over larger territories. Train crews now cover greater distances during shifts, leading to potential limbo time where transportation may not be readily available. Industry-wide data on limbo time is lacking, but the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen presented data showing an increase in limbo time for train crews at one Class I railroad. The incidence of limbo time for train crews at a Class I railroad has been increasing. Between 2001-2006, the number of crews with work tours exceeding 14 hours rose from 32,000-33,000 to 75,000-80,000 a year. Crews with work tours exceeding 15 hours increased from 12,000 to 35,000-38,000 a year. There were instances where crews spent at least 8 hours in limbo, resulting in shifts lasting at least 20 hours. Fatigue remains a challenge despite preventive measures. Positive train control (PTC) technology can help prevent collisions, derailments, and injuries by intervening when train crews operate improperly or fail to comply with signals. PTC serves as a backup system to reduce human error resulting from fatigue or other factors, improving safety in the early morning hours when human performance is impaired. Positive train control (PTC) systems vary in complexity and sophistication, aiming to prevent train collisions by automatically assuming control when crew fails to comply with signals. NTSB and Congress have shown interest in PTC since 1990, with Congress providing funding for development and testing. Since 1994, Congress has allocated $40 million to FRA for PTC prototype systems in Illinois, Alaska, and Eastern railroads. In 1997, the Rail Safety Advisory Committee found that the safety benefits of PTC did not justify the high costs of implementation. Estimated costs for Class I railroads ranged from $1.2 billion to $7.8 billion over 20 years, with safety benefits estimated at $500 million to $850 million. FRA established a performance standard for PTC in 2005 but has not mandated implementation, citing nonsafety benefits. In 2005, FRA noted that PTC systems offer public benefits but mandating them based on safety benefits alone is not justified. NTSB highlighted the need for PTC systems after the 2004 Macdona, Texas accident. Defective track was the leading cause of train accidents in 2006, leading to derailments. The number of derailments increased from 1,816 in 1996 to 2,138 in 2006. Following a derailment in upstate New York in 2007, an audit of CSX track found 78 defects and one serious violation. The FRA plans to extend the audit to other railroads in New York state and target inspections based on risk factors and past data. New technology, like automated track geometry inspection vehicles, is being used to improve track inspections. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has expanded its track inspection fleet with new vehicles to comply with federal standards and prevent derailments. These new vehicles will triple the track inspection capacity to nearly 100,000 miles annually. FRA has also acquired a joint-bar inspection system to detect cracks that can lead to accidents. Collisions between trains and vehicles at railroad crossings are a significant cause of rail-related fatalities. There are approximately 240,000 railroad crossings, with 150,000 being public crossings. The number of collisions and fatalities at grade crossings has decreased significantly over the past few decades, despite the increase in train and highway traffic. Train miles traveled have increased by 24%, while road vehicle miles traveled have increased by 26%. Collisions at grade crossings decreased by 42% from 1994 to 2006, but the trend of improvement has leveled off in recent years. Some question the need for additional Congressional action. Some question the need for additional Congressional action regarding grade crossings safety. Public crossings are required to have warning devices, with passive devices like crossbuck signs and pavement markings. Train operators must sound the horn when approaching a crossing. Around 63,000 out of 150,000 public crossings have automated warning devices installed to warn motorists of approaching trains. Maintenance of these devices is the responsibility of railroads. The Federal Highway Administration provides $220 million annually to states for safety improvements to grade crossings based on risk assessment. Most urban crossings have automated warning devices, but over 80,000 public rail-highway crossings lack them due to cost constraints and concerns about liability. The Federal Highway Administration provides funding for safety improvements at grade crossings. One method to reduce accidents is by closing crossings, although this can be costly and inconvenient for communities. The goal of reducing public and private grade crossings has not been fully achieved, with some progress made in closing crossings. Operation Lifesaver is a national program supported by the FRA for railroad safety education. FRA supports Operation Lifesaver, a national railroad safety education program aimed at reducing grade-crossing accidents by educating the public about dangers and promoting safe driving behavior. The program operates in 49 states and the District of Columbia, with volunteer trainers giving 30,000 presentations annually. FRA relies on accident reports from railroads for analysis, with most collisions attributed to motorists' incautious behavior. The DOT Inspector General has recommended FRA to supplement these reports. The DOT Inspector General recommended that FRA enhance accident reports with additional sources like police reports and eyewitness accounts to better assess collision causes and railroad safety compliance. FRA conducted a pilot study to evaluate the benefits and costs of using independent sources for analyzing crossing collisions. The results of the study were not yet public in late July 2007. Inspector General also suggested steps for FRA to reduce grade crossing collisions and fatalities, including ensuring prompt reporting of serious collisions by railroads for investigation. FRA's involvement in grade crossing collision investigations includes requirements for railroads to clear obstructions near crossings, update information on grade crossings and warning devices, and develop plans for dangerous crossings. Hearings have been held in Congress on rail safety reauthorization issues, with bills introduced but no action taken yet. Representative James Oberstar introduced the Federal Railroad Safety Accountability and Improvement Act, but it has not progressed in Congress. Representative James Oberstar introduced the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2095) in the House, while Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007 (S. 1889) in the Senate. Both bills underwent amendments and were reported out of their respective committees in 2007 and 2008. The Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2095) was introduced by Representative James Oberstar and the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007 (S. 1889) was introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg. Both bills underwent amendments and were reported out of their respective committees in 2007 and 2008. The Administration's reauthorization proposal included converting the rail hours of service law to a regulation and creating a safety risk reduction program within FRA to improve railroad processes and safety outcomes. The Administration proposed allowing FRA to monitor railroad radio communications without consent to ensure safety rule compliance and investigate accidents. No action has been taken on this legislation, and Congress may focus on other laws in the FRA reauthorization debate. The Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2095) was introduced by Representative James Oberstar. H.R. 2095, introduced by Representative James Oberstar, proposes significant changes to FRA's safety programs, including renaming it the Federal Railroad Safety Administration (FRSA). It addresses employee fatigue by increasing minimum rest period length to 10 hours and limiting limbo time accrual. The bill was marked up by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and adopted by the House on October 17, 2007. The bill proposed by Representative James Oberstar, H.R. 2095, aims to improve railroad safety by addressing employee fatigue, increasing rest periods to 10 hours, limiting limbo time accrual, setting minimum training standards, and increasing the number of safety inspectors. It also requires railroads to develop fatigue management plans, implement positive train control, and make safety improvements at grade crossings. The bill proposed by Representative James Oberstar, H.R. 2095, aims to improve railroad safety by addressing employee fatigue, increasing rest periods to 10 hours, limiting limbo time accrual, setting minimum training standards, and increasing the number of safety inspectors. It also requires railroads to develop fatigue management plans, implement positive train control, and make safety improvements at grade crossings. Additionally, the bill would establish new civil penalties, increase existing penalties for non-compliance with safety regulations, authorize $1.1 billion over four years for FRA's safety programs, and create three new grant programs for Operation Lifesaver, positive train control systems, and emergency improvements to grade crossings. The bill authorizes $18 million for a tunnel construction project in Pueblo, Colorado for safety training. It also requires assistance for families of rail accident victims and mandates regulations for railroads in nonsignaled territory to prevent misaligned switches. Amendments added during House consideration include provisions on mechanical and brake inspections of rail cars in Mexico. The bill includes provisions for tunnel construction in Pueblo, Colorado, assistance for rail accident victims' families, and regulations for railroads in nonsignaled territory. It also addresses mechanical and brake inspections of rail cars in Mexico, requiring certification of comparable standards to U.S. inspections. The Administration opposes certain provisions such as hours of service regulations and mandated positive train control adoption. The Senate passed bill S. 1889, introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg, which authorizes $1.5 billion for FRA over six years, creates new grant programs for rail safety, increases safety personnel, and requires positive train control technology by 2018. The bill from 2008-2013 mandates positive train control technology by 2018, increases rest time for rail employees, limits limbo time, and allows FRA to monitor radio communications for safety compliance and accident investigations. Administration proposed giving FRA authority to revise rail hours of service laws. The Administration proposed allowing DOT to enforce fatigue management plans by railroads as an alternative to hours of service regulations. H.R. 2095 would increase minimum off-duty periods and require railroads to submit fatigue management plans to reduce employee fatigue and accidents. The bill would also increase the minimum off-duty period from eight to 10 hours and mandate a 24-hour rest period every seven days. The bill aims to reduce the maximum weekly work hours for rail employees from 100 to 78, with a minimum rest period of 24 hours every seven days. It also prohibits any communication that would disturb an employee's rest during the minimum rest period. Additionally, it requires 48 consecutive hours off duty after six consecutive workdays, with a cap of 276 hours per month for on-duty and limbo time. The bill proposes reducing the maximum weekly work hours for rail employees to 78, with a minimum rest period of 24 hours every seven days. It also mandates 48 consecutive hours off duty after six consecutive workdays, with a cap of 276 hours per month for on-duty and limbo time. The Department of Transportation (DOT) would have the authority to approve alternate hours of service plans developed by rail labor and management, waive communication restrictions during rest periods for efficient operations, and regulate hours of service for commuter and intercity passenger rail employees. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) opposed the bill's provisions amending hours of service limits, emphasizing the complexity of addressing fatigue prevention within this context. FRA urged for authority to revise hours of service law based on fatigue science. H.R. 2095 allows FRA to regulate hours of service but not increase on-duty time. Administration opposed House-passed H.R. 2095 as overly prescriptive. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) supported revising the hours of service law to address fatigue concerns among railroad workers. They acknowledged the need for adequate rest time and efforts to combat fatigue. While AAR agreed with increasing minimum rest time to 10 hours and restricting nonemergency communications during rest periods, they objected to the provision mandating 24 consecutive hours off duty every seven days as inconsistent with railroad operations. AAR supported revising the hours of service law to address fatigue concerns among railroad workers. They requested an extension to require 24 consecutive hours off duty every eight days and changes to fatigue management plan requirements. Rail labor organizations also supported revisions to ensure undisturbed rest periods for employees. The Administration bill did not propose direct changes to limbo time, but it may be affected by the regulatory process of revising the hours of service regime. The House-passed version of H.R. 2095 limits limbo time accrual to 10 hours per month, phased in over two years. The Senate-passed version would limit limbo time to three hours per day. The Senate bill's overall limit of 276 hours of work by an employee each month includes limbo time in calculating the total hours worked. The Administration objected to the limbo time provision of the House-passed H.R. 2095, contending that crew safety is not compromised if they are relieved of duties during limbo time. The FRA is concerned about the impact of limbo time on employee fatigue and reclassifying it as on-duty time would shift the focus from safety to labor standards. The FRA Administrator urged for authority to develop hours of service regulations based on a scientific understanding of fatigue, while the AAR argued against reclassifying limbo time as on-duty time due to potential scheduling issues and increased costs. The railroads proposed addressing safety-related fatigue from limbo time by providing additional time off and setting a monthly maximum of 276 on-duty hours for train operating employees. The railroads propose a monthly maximum of 276 on-duty hours for train operating employees, with limbo time counting towards that limit. Rail labor groups support reclassifying limbo time as on-duty time to prevent abuse. United Transportation Union's National legislative Director suggests a 10-hour limit per month on limbo time to effectively eliminate it. The Administration bill did not address PTC. The House-passed H.R. 2095 would require each Class I railroad to submit a plan for implementing a PTC system by December 31, 2014, with a possible 24-month extension. The Secretary would review compliance and report to Congress by December 31, 2011. H.R. 2095 also includes a grant program for train control technologies without specified funding levels. The Senate-passed H.R. 2095 mandates... The Senate-passed H.R. 2095 requires railroads with inadequate safety performance to submit a risk reduction plan for implementing a PTC system by December 31, 2018. A safety technology grant program with $10 million annual funding is included, providing a 50% match for train control technologies. The Administration has concerns about mandating PTC implementation by a set deadline, citing unproven safety benefits and technology. The Administration requested greater flexibility for the Secretary of Transportation to oversee the implementation of positive train control technology. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) supports deploying PTC on high-density main lines based on available funds, but objects to setting a fixed deadline due to the variety of control systems. AAR suggested railroads provide an implementation plan within 12 months, with a potential timetable established later. The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen testified in support of PTC deployment. Rail labor groups support PTC deployment but express concerns about its implications for train crew size. They fear railroads may reduce crew size to one person with PTC technology. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen generally supports PTC as a supplement to existing train control methods. House-passed H.R. 2095 would require FRA to increase the number of rail inspectors. The House-passed H.R. 2095 requires FRA to increase the number of rail inspectors to at least 800 by 2012 and purchase specific inspection vehicles. Senate-passed H.R. 2095 mandates an increase in safety-related FRA employees, acquisition of necessary inspection vehicles, and a study on track inspection practices. Rail labor groups support the proposed increase in FRA safety personnel. The FRA has acquired automated track inspection equipment to identify flaws that human inspectors may miss. The Administration bill includes provisions to update FRA's grade crossing inventory and encourage new technologies to prevent accidents at rail crossings. H.R. 2095 would require railroads to provide toll-free telephone support. H.R. 2095 would mandate railroads to provide toll-free telephone numbers at grade crossings for reporting safety device malfunctions and blocked crossings. It also requires the removal of visual obstructions, updates to the FRA's grade crossing inventory every four years, and authorizes funding for Operation Lifesaver and emergency grade crossings. The Senate-passed H.R. 2095 includes provisions for grade crossing safety improvements, such as a grant program for emergency grade crossings and toll-free numbers for reporting safety issues. Rail labor supports these measures, while AAR requests clearer regulations on visual obstructions and nationwide uniformity. Congress has shown interest in toll-free numbers for reporting emergencies at grade crossings since 1994. In 1994, Congress directed FRA to conduct a pilot program on the effectiveness of grade crossing safety programs, with results showing safety benefits. FRA and NTSB recommend railroads to provide toll-free numbers at each crossing. About 50% of crossings have emergency notification systems. States have varying requirements for removing visual obstructions near crossings. The Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Hazard Elimination formula program allocates $220 million annually for safety improvements at crossings."
