    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in three separate federal departments. Title I provides funding for Department of the Interior agencies, Title II for the Environmental Protection Agency, and Title III for agencies in other departments and related entities. This report focuses on FY2014 enacted appropriations for these agencies. The report compares FY2014 enacted appropriations for Department of the Interior agencies, Environmental Protection Agency, and other related entities with FY2013 and FY2012 appropriations. Appropriations are complex due to large budget requests with numerous changes for congressional consideration. The report does not provide detailed information on specific agencies or accounts. The report does not provide detailed account-level information or information on budgetary reorganizations. None of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 had been enacted as of October 1, 2013. No interim continuing resolution had been enacted to provide appropriations for projects and activities covered by the bills. Contact key policy staff for funding details for individual accounts or programs. During the government shutdown in October 2013, a short-term continuing resolution (CR) was enacted on October 17, 2013 (P.L. 113-46) to fund projects and activities at FY2013 levels. The CR provided exceptions for Wildland Fire Management and extended appropriations for FY2014 until January 18, 2014. Agencies were generally prohibited from spending funds in advance of appropriations during this time. During the government shutdown in October 2013, agencies were generally prohibited from spending funds in advance of appropriations. Exceptions allowed some agency functions to continue for emergencies. Agencies in the Interior bill developed plans for FY2014, summarizing activities that would cease and continue during a lapse in appropriations. Plans included the number of employees expected to be retained and furloughed. For example, a DOI overview plan estimated that 58,765 employees would be furloughed out of 72,562 in pay status. National Parks and Wildlife Refuges would be closed, and public access restricted during a lapse in appropriations. During a government shutdown, agencies in the Interior bill developed plans for FY2014, outlining activities that would cease and continue. Wildlife Refuge Systems would be closed, public access restricted, and nonemergency activities on public lands terminated. U.S. Geological Survey's scientific work would be halted, only emergency response activities conducted by the Office of Surface Mining. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement would ensure drilling safety, but renewable activities and five year plan work would be terminated. Bureau of Indian Affairs offices would suspend most activities, but required payments to beneficiaries would continue. Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians would maintain minimum operations to issue checks to beneficiaries.

Bureau of Indian Affairs offices would suspend most activities, but required payments to beneficiaries would continue. Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians would maintain minimum operations to issue checks to beneficiaries. Additional details for each DOI agency were included in agency-specific plans. The cessation or curtailment of some activities and services, such as the closure of national park units, was controversial among some Members of Congress and the public. In FY2014, appropriations for agencies in the Interior bill varied widely due to agency responsibilities, funding sources, and priorities. Funding for a small subset of agencies accounted for most of the total, with three agencies receiving 60.1% of the total enacted appropriations. Additionally, more than three-quarters of the total appropriation was allocated to five agencies, including the EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service. In FY2014, appropriations for DOI agencies varied widely, with the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs receiving nearly half of the total budget. The Forest Service and Indian Health Service also received significant funding, while several agencies had appropriations of less than $80 million each. The FY2014 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $30.12 billion, a 1.5% increase from FY2013. This included various appropriations and reflected reductions under the President's sequester order. The FY2014 appropriation was a 6.4% increase from FY2013, excluding supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. The FY2014 appropriation for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $30.12 billion, a 1.5% increase from FY2013. This included increases and decreases for different agencies, with a total decrease of $217.8 million for all DOI agencies and a decrease of $278.4 million for EPA. Despite the overall decrease for DOI agencies, most received increased appropriations for FY2014. The Bureau of Indian Affairs received the largest dollar increase in appropriations for FY2014. The overall decrease in EPA appropriations reflected various changes in agency accounts, programs, and activities, with the biggest decrease in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account. This decrease was mainly due to supplemental appropriations for disaster relief in FY2013. STAG grants include Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund capitalization grants for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The FY2014 appropriations for water infrastructure projects aimed to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act and meet health goals. The largest increase was for the Environmental Programs and Management account. The Forest Service and Indian Health Service saw significant funding boosts for wildfire suppression and clinical services, respectively. Table 1 shows the appropriations for each agency and title within the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill for FY2013 and FY2014. The FY2013 full-year appropriations and reimbursements for fire transfers, as well as supplemental appropriations for disaster relief, are detailed in data columns.

The President's proposal included varied funding levels for different agencies, with the Forest Service receiving $4.84 billion and the Indian Health Service over $4 billion. Fourteen agencies would have received less than $80 million each, with six proposed at less than $10 million each.
