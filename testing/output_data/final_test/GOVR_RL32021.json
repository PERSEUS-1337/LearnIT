    "content": "The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) was launched in April 2001 with a request for $882.29 million in FY2002 economic and counternarcotics assistance for Colombia and six regional neighbors. $731 million was designated for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) assistance under the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI). The program focused on training and equipping counternarcotics battalions in Colombia, with a larger portion of assistance directed towards economic and social programs compared to previous aid. The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) aimed to assist regional countries affected by illicit drug and insurgency activities. The three overarching goals were democracy, development, and drugs. This included promoting democracy, economic development, and reducing the supply of illegal drugs to the United States. Critics argued that the initiative overemphasized military efforts. The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) aimed to assist regional countries affected by illicit drug and insurgency activities. Critics argued that it overemphasized military efforts. In 2001, the FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriation Act provided $782.82 million for the ARI, with $625 million designated for the ACI. Additionally, a $35 million transfer was allowed from the State Department's International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account to the ACI. The FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriation Act provided funding for counter-terrorism purposes in Colombia and Ecuador, including support for police, equipment, training, and counter-kidnapping. Congress fully funded the President's request for Colombia with human rights conditions and granted broader authority for new activities. The FY2002 Foreign Operations Appropriation Act provided funding for counter-terrorism purposes in Colombia and Ecuador, including support for police, equipment, training, and counter-kidnapping. The FY2002 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (H.R. 4775) approved by legislators in late July 2002, and signed into law (P.L. 107-206) on August 2, 2002, provided authority for the use of INCLE and Department of Defense funds to combat narcotics trafficking and terrorist organizations like FARC, ELN, and AUC. President Bush also requested the extension and broadening of the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) to give duty-free treatment to products from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. In late 2001, Congress completed action on the President's request for the Trade Act of 2002, which was signed into law on August 6, 2002. The act extended preferential tariff treatment to designated Andean countries through December 31, 2006, and included products previously excluded. President Bush submitted a FY2003 budget request of $979.8 million for the Andean Regional Initiative, with a focus on counternarcotics assistance for Colombia. This included funding for training and equipping a Colombian army brigade to protect an oil pipeline. In late 2001, Congress completed action on the President's request for the Trade Act of 2002, extending preferential tariff treatment to Andean countries. President Bush's FY2003 budget requested $979.8 million for the Andean Regional Initiative, focusing on counternarcotics assistance for Colombia, including training and equipping a Colombian army brigade to protect an oil pipeline. Congress approved an omnibus spending package, H.J.Res. 2, incorporating funding and reporting requirements for the Andean Regional Initiative and Colombia. A total of $835.5 million was allocated, with $700 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, a reduction of $31 million from the President's request. The conference agreement allowed for the transfer of up to $31 million from the State Department's International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Additionally, up to $93 million in Foreign Military Financing funds could be transferred for assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces. Congress provided authority for a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, terrorist organizations, and to protect health and human welfare. The Conference Report authorized the transfer of funds to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and the Colombian Armed Forces to combat narcotics trafficking and terrorist groups. The expanded authorities would cease if the Colombian military fails to restore government authority and human rights in areas controlled by paramilitary and guerrilla organizations. The Report calls for the Secretary of State to report changes in policy within 90 days of enactment, including new procedures and operations in areas under paramilitary and guerrilla control. Congress maintained caps on military personnel and civilian contractors in Colombia at 400 each, with exceptions for search and rescue operations. As of late November, there were 278 military personnel and 373 civilian contractors in Colombia supporting Plan Colombia. During 2003, the number of military personnel and civilian contractors in Colombia fluctuated between 208 and 396 and 247 to 400, respectively. The U.S. civilian contractor number decreased from 400 to 373 due to departures. In November, there were around 600 foreign national contractors, mostly Colombian nationals. Section 564 allows for the distribution of funds for Colombia's military, with conditions related to human rights violations. A certification by the Secretary of State would release assistance to the Colombian military. The Secretary must certify Colombian military compliance with obligations to receive funding. The first certification in July 2003 released $30 million, with a second one nearing completion in November. Congress prohibits visas for those supporting FARC, ELN, or AUC. Aerial fumigation must meet health and environmental guidelines. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-10) withholds 80% of funding for herbicides until a report is issued ensuring compliance with EPA standards. The report also includes provisions for the return of helicopters used for illegal activities and addresses the Air-Bridge Denial Program following an incident in Peru. The resumption of U.S. support for a Peruvian air interdiction program, associated with drug trafficking and resulting in deaths, requires certification from the Secretary of State and Director of Central Intelligence to prevent accidents. The program was resumed in August after protocols were agreed upon to prevent accidental shootdowns. Additionally, the Bush Administration requested $75 billion for military operations, relief, and reconstruction activities in Iraq and global war on terrorism in FY2003. The Administration requested funding for reconstruction activities in Iraq, global war on terrorism, safety of U.S. diplomats and citizens abroad, support for U.S. allies, and homeland security measures. This included $34 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, $34 million for Drug Interdiction in Colombia, and an unspecified amount for Foreign Military Financing for 19 countries, including Colombia. President Bush requested $990.7 million for the Andean Regional Initiative countries in FY2003. The State Department's International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funding includes the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI). The requested ACI funding of $731 million is allocated to Colombia and Peru for various programs including alternative development, humanitarian assistance, and narcotics interdiction. The State Department's International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funding includes allocations for Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela. Bolivia is allocated $91 million, Ecuador $35 million, Brazil $12 million, Panama $9 million, and Venezuela $5 million for various programs including alternative development, humanitarian assistance, and narcotics interdiction. Funding also includes amounts for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs. The funding request includes $2.5 million in FMF funding and $200,000 in IMET funds for Colombia, with a focus on counter-terrorism operations and protecting key infrastructure like the oil pipeline. The funding will provide training, weapons, night vision goggles, and communications equipment to elite mobile brigades, Special Forces, Colombian Navy, and Air Force. It also includes the purchase of interdiction boats, AC-47 gunships, and C-130 aircraft. FY2004 FMF funding will continue to support the Colombian Army Brigades tasked with protecting the oil pipeline. The funding request includes $47.8 million in Development Aid for several countries in South America, $43.4 million in Child Survival and Health programs, $35 million in Economic Support funds for democratic institution building, and $21 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance in the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, $45 million will be spent in Colombia from the State Department Air Wing Account. The Administration also requested $817.4 million in Department of Defense counternarcotics funds for worldwide programs. The Defense Department requested a lump sum for counternarcotic programs worldwide under various sections. In FY2000, $128.5 million was allocated in addition to funds appropriated under Plan Colombia legislation. The Andean Regional Initiative aimed to assist seven countries in the Andean region. The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) built on the Plan Colombia legislation to address coca and heroin cultivation in Colombia. Assistance was expanded to Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela, and Panama to counter potential spill-over effects. The region is crucial to the United States due to the threat primarily in border areas with Colombia. The Andean Regional Initiative (ARI) focuses on drug-producing countries like Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru, as well as oil-producing countries like Venezuela and Ecuador. These countries have strong trading relationships with the United States and are part of the Andean Community economic integration pact. The Andes mountain range poses geographical obstacles to integration, but the ARI countries are linked together economically. Colombia, part of the Andean Regional Initiative (ARI), is one of the most populous countries in Latin America with a diverse population. It faces challenges with drug cultivation due to its rugged terrain. Despite a tradition of democracy, Colombia struggles with violence, guerrilla insurgency, and drug trafficking. Colombia has faced challenges with drug trafficking since the 1960s, involving leftist guerrillas, rightist paramilitary groups, and independent drug traffickers. The main groups include FARC and ELN on the left, and AUC on the right, with accusations of human rights abuses and collusion with the Colombian Armed Forces. Additional paramilitaries like Metro Block have also been involved in the conflict. During the Pastrana Administration (1998-2002), U.S. involvement in Colombia deepened as President Pastrana initiated peace talks with FARC and ELN guerrilla groups. The $7.5 billion \"Plan Colombia\" was developed with international support, but funding fell short of goals. During the Pastrana Administration, the international community supported Plan Colombia with a $1.3 billion assistance package approved by the U.S. Congress in 2000. Most of the funding went towards counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, including support for Colombian Army battalions. However, Pastrana's peace efforts with the FARC were hindered by various factors, such as a lack of consistent negotiation strategy and guerrilla interest in peace talks. During the Pastrana Administration, peace talks with the FARC failed, leading to increased guerrilla activity and deteriorating security in major cities. President Pastrana terminated the talks in 2002 after the FARC kidnapped Senator Ingrid Betancourt. The Uribe Administration focused on defeating guerrilla insurgents, paramilitaries, and narcotics trafficking, with Alvaro Uribe winning the presidency in 2002. Upon taking office in 2002, President Uribe won with an outright majority and took a hard-line approach to negotiations, refusing to engage with groups involved in terrorism. The FARC responded with increased armed activities, including threats to mayors, armed confrontations with paramilitary groups, and bombings in urban areas. President Uribe took steps to address Colombia's complex problems, including declaring a state of emergency with controversial measures. The Uribe Administration introduced legislation to give security forces permanent powers to tap phones and search homes without warrants. President Uribe announced plans to increase the military and police size through a war tax on wealthy individuals and businesses. He also implemented a \"civilian informers\" program and enlisted 10,000 peasant soldiers to augment the regular armed forces. Additionally, Uribe authorized widespread aerial fumigation of coca crops, which was challenged in court. The government should suspend aerial fumigation until an Environment Management Plan is in place. President Uribe's administration plans to continue fumigation while appealing a decision. Approval has been granted for a referendum to cut government spending, restructure Congress, and prohibit re-election of corrupt officials. The referendum is set for October 25, 2003, coinciding with elections. FARC threatened violence against candidates, resulting in 25 deaths and 160 withdrawals. In the municipal elections, 25 candidates were killed and 160 withdrew their names. The referendum items failed due to insufficient voter turnout, despite receiving majority support. President Uribe took some issues to the Colombian Congress for support, especially those related to the budget. Uribe appointed a commission to explore dialogue with the AUC, following a meeting with AUC leadership in October 2002. The AUC declared an indefinite cessation of hostilities in part due to Uribe's stance against guerrillas. The Bush Administration requested the extradition of two top AUC leaders. The Colombian government requested the extradition of AUC leaders in 2002, but later reached an agreement for their demobilization by 2005. The AUC, formed in the 1980s, has an estimated 10,000 to 13,000 members. There are concerns about the demobilization of other self-defense groups not under the AUC umbrella. Some fighters are negotiating separately with the government, while others are not participating at all. Colombia is a major source of cocaine and heroin, with President Uribe linking the drug trade and guerrilla insurgency as interconnected issues. The US provided funding for Colombia to combat drug trafficking and terrorism, targeting groups like FARC, ELN, and AUC. Uribe emphasized aerial eradication and alternative measures to address the drug trade. The Plan Colombia eradication spraying program began in December 2000 with operations in Putumayo. Despite early indications of increased coca cultivation in 2001, there were reported decreases in 2002. Coca cultivation decreased from 420,000 acres in 2001 to 357,000 acres in 2002. Opium poppy cultivation also declined by 24% in 2002. Aerial fumigation has been controversial due to environmental and health concerns. Critics argue that the alternative development program in Colombia, aimed at helping farmers transition to growing substitute crops after eradicating illicit crops, has faced delays and challenges. The program has been hindered by inadequate security in coca-growing areas and the government's limited ability to carry out sustained interdiction operations. Despite these obstacles, the program has benefited 20,128 families and led to the planting of nearly 39,000 acres of licit crops in previous coca and poppy areas. The Colombian government reported that 38,000 families in 33 municipalities signed voluntary eradication pacts, but less than a third have received compensation and many are still growing coca. Alternative development programs are said to support aerial eradication efforts, with increased resources devoted to alternative development by the Uribe Administration. Glyphosate herbicide was certified as safe in 2002. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency certified glyphosate herbicide as safe in 2002, confirming its application rates in Colombia. However, concerns persist among Colombians about health risks from aerial fumigation. Ecuador has also raised issues about damage to crops and health from the program. The U.S. policy debate focuses on program effectiveness, human rights, and expansion. Supporters argue that Colombia, a friendly democracy, is under siege by armed forces fueled by drug money. They advocate for expanding military assistance to combat leftist guerrillas and strengthen security forces. Opponents argue against U.S. policy, citing concerns about the counterdrug program. Opponents of U.S. policy argue against the repressive military approach in the counterdrug program in Colombia. They advocate for economic and social aid, human rights protection, and negotiated solutions to combat the root causes of the conflict. They believe that forcing coca farmers to abandon their crops will only push them towards armed groups or displacement. Some argue for a \"Colombianization\" of the program, with Colombians conducting aerial spraying and counternarcotics activities. Others believe Colombia should do more to fight terrorism and drug trafficking before expanding U.S. involvement. Some suggest assistance should focus on improving the economy and providing employment for Colombians. Debate in the United States has also centered on these issues. The debate in the United States has focused on allegations of human rights abuses by Colombian Armed Forces, FARC, ELN, and paramilitary groups. Colombian security forces have ignored paramilitary activities, despite human rights abuses. Efforts have been made to break ties between the Colombian military and paramilitary groups, with support for a Human Rights Unit within the Attorney General's office. Some criticize the unit's effectiveness and leadership, advocating for stricter enforcement of legislative conditions to prosecute armed forces members committing human rights violations. The U.S. Secretary of State must certify that the Colombian military is prosecuting human rights violators and breaking ties with paramilitaries. Certifications issued in 2003 and 2004 are criticized for not adequately reflecting the human rights situation. Concerns in the United States have been raised by incidents where U.S. citizens were killed or kidnapped in the region, such as the 2001 shooting down of a private aircraft carrying American missionaries in Peru. The \"Air-Bridge Denial Program\" was halted in Peru and Colombia due to concerns about drug trafficking flights. It resumed after safety enhancements were certified on August 18, 2003. The program's involvement raised worries about a prolonged commitment in Colombia's civil conflict following the loss of U.S. civilian contractors and aircraft since February 2003. The Air-Bridge Denial Program in Peru and Colombia was halted and then resumed after safety enhancements. Several U.S. civilian contractors and aircraft were lost in crashes and hostile fire incidents. Concerns also arose regarding U.S. policy on the International Criminal Court jurisdiction for U.S. citizens. The American Service Members Protection Act of 2002 required countries to sign \"article 98 agreements\" to prevent the ICC from pursuing U.S. personnel. Colombia signed an agreement on August 8, 2003. Colombia received $860.3 million in funding under Plan Colombia, with a portion allocated for military anti-drug efforts. Colombia received $435.4 million in State Department funding for various assistance programs, including counternarcotics, economic and social programs. Additionally, under the Emergency FY2002 Supplemental, there were allocations for police support, counter-terrorism equipment, and training, as well as funding for counter-kidnapping training. The enacted legislation allocated $6 million for infrastructure protection for the Cano-Lim\u00f3n Cove\u00f1as oil pipeline in Colombia. In FY2003, the Administration requested $537 million in funding for Colombia, including $439 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) and $98 million for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to train and equip a Colombian army brigade. Congress reduced the request by $5 million, providing $93 million in FMF funds for the oil pipeline and $433 million in ACI funding. In the FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental, Congress approved $105.1 million for Colombia, including funds for the ACI, Drug Interdiction, and Counter-Drug Activities. In FY2004, the Administration requested $573 million for Colombia, with $463 million allocated for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI). Congress provided $731 million for the ACI in the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Bill. President Alejandro Toledo leads Peru, which shares a border with Colombia and has a population of 27.5 million. President Alejandro Toledo, elected in 2001 with a promise to end corruption and stabilize the economy, faced challenges with strikes, protests, and low popularity. He labeled drug trafficking a national security issue and established a drug czar for Peru. President Bush visited Peru in 2002 to enhance cooperation on counternarcotics and counter-terrorism. However, U.S. military aid to Peru was suspended in 2003 due to a disagreement over the International Criminal Court jurisdiction. An investigation was launched into a 2001 incident where a Peruvian military plane shot down a small plane, killing an American missionary woman and her infant daughter. The U.S. suspended surveillance of drug-related flights in Peru and Colombia after an accident. President Bush mentioned ongoing talks with Peru on procedures for anti-drug surveillance flights. Resumption of the aerial interdiction program with Colombia was announced in 2003, but arrangements with Peru were still pending. Peru, the second largest cocaine producer, has seen success in counternarcotics efforts through joint operations with the U.S. Despite a temporary suspension of drug eradication programs in 2002, coca production has decreased significantly. However, there was an 8% increase in production in 2002, though still below 1995 levels. Peru temporarily suspended its drug eradication program in the Upper Huallaga Valley in early July 2002 but resumed it in September 2002 to be eligible for Andean Trade Preference Act benefits. Peruvian officials expressed concerns about spillover effects of illicit drug activities from Colombia, denounced illicit coca and poppy plantings, and international arms trafficking to FARC guerrillas in Colombia. They denied permanent FARC presence in Peru but acknowledged temporary crossings into border areas. In response to security threats, Peru relocated military bases from its border with Ecuador to the border with Colombia. The 2002 bombing near the U.S. Embassy in Lima raised fears of guerrilla groups. Peru received funding for helicopters and interdiction. In FY2002, Peru received $142.5 million in ACI funds for counternarcotics and alternative development. In FY2003, Peru is set to receive $128.1 million in ACI funds. No funds were requested for Peru in the FY2002 supplemental. Bolivia received $116 million in ACI funds for counternarcotics and alternative development in FY2004. Despite not sharing a border with Colombia, Bolivia's progress in reducing illegal coca production could be at risk. The country has made significant strides in coca cultivation reduction in the past. Bolivia has experienced political stability since the mid-1980s, with significant economic reforms leading to social dislocations. The country is tied to the region through the Andean Community and as an associate member of Mercosur. Forcible eradication of coca has caused social discontent and tensions over class and ethnicity, potentially leading to political instability in the country. President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Losada, a 72-year-old wealthy businessman and leader of the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR), began his five-year term in August 2002 with only 22% of the vote. Evo Morales, a 42-year-old Aymara and leader of the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party, came in second. The election went to the Bolivian Congress due to the lack of a majority victory, where a coalition between the MNR and the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) secured S\u00e1nchez de Losada's presidency. Jaime Paz Zamora, the fourth place winner and former president, faced protests during S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's presidency. Confrontations erupted over government eradication efforts, leading to S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's resignation in 2003. Carlos Mesa, a former Vice President, succeeded him after months of protests by indigenous and workers groups. The new President of Bolivia faces challenges governing a politically fractured society, amidst protests over economic marginalization and natural gas exports. U.S. relations with Bolivia have historically focused on controlling coca production for counternarcotics efforts. The United States has supported Bolivia's counternarcotics efforts by providing significant assistance, including debt forgiveness for development and food projects. President Hugo Banzer's \"Dignity Plan\" aimed to eliminate illegal coca cultivation and narco-trafficking by 2002, leading to successful interdiction operations and eradication efforts. However, forced eradication has been criticized as a social and political disaster in some areas. The Dignity Plan in Bolivia aimed to eliminate illegal coca cultivation, but faced challenges including human rights abuses and protests from coca growers. Despite some success in eradication, replanting continues to be a problem. President Quiroga initially supported the program but backed down after violent protests. Bolivia's coca cultivation is now half of its 1995 levels, with a legal allowance for traditional use up to 12,000 hectares. Bolivia has signed an article 98 agreement exempting U.S. citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, pending consideration before the Bolivian Congress. The Bush Administration waived the withholding of U.S. military aid from Bolivia in July 2003. Bolivia received funding from the FY2000 Plan Colombia emergency supplemental funding, including $25 million for regional interdiction assistance and $85 million in alternative development assistance. Additionally, Bolivia received $87.6 million in ACI funds for drug interdiction and eradication, as well as alternative development. Bolivia received $91 million in ACI funding for FY2003, with $49 million for interdiction and eradication, and $41.7 million for alternative development. For FY2004, the Administration requested $91 million in ACI funds, with $52.5 million for interdiction and eradication, and $38.5 million for alternative development. Additionally, there were allocations for Child Survival and Health funds, Development Assistance, Economic Support Funds, and Foreign Military Financing. Ecuador, with a population of 13.2 million, is the eighth most populous country in Latin America. President Lucio Gutierrez, elected in 2002, has implemented austerity measures and obtained financial assistance from the IMF to address debt issues. Colombian guerrillas reportedly cross into Ecuador for rest and medical treatment. Ecuadoran officials have uncovered and destroyed cocaine labs in the border region, where Colombian refugees and paramilitary fighters are causing issues. The FARC is accused of kidnappings in Ecuador, prompting Ecuador to reinforce its border with Colombia. President Gutierrez states that the Colombian conflict is negatively impacting Ecuadoran peasants. The armed conflict in Colombia is affecting Ecuadoran peasants in border areas, with concerns about aerial fumigation harming the environment and health. Colombian President Uribe thanked Ecuador for hosting Colombians fleeing violence and promised to eradicate terrorism. Ecuador cooperates with the US in counternarcotics efforts, including a 10-year agreement for a forward operating location in Manta for aerial counterdrug operations. Some in Ecuador fear the impact of this cooperation on human rights. Some human rights groups and politicians in Ecuador fear that the Manta facility could be used to support operations against guerrillas in Colombia. Ecuador faces possible U.S. sanctions for not exempting American citizens from the International Criminal Court. Ecuador received $20 million in U.S. assistance for drug interdiction and alternative development efforts. In addition to previous U.S. assistance, Ecuador has received significant funding for counternarcotics efforts, including $61.3 million for a Forward Operating Location in Manta. For FY2002, Ecuador received $25 million in ACI funding, $6.9 million in Development Assistance, and $15 million in Economic Support Funds. Under FY2003 ARI allocations, Ecuador is set to receive nearly $30.9 million in ACI funding, $7.1 million in Development Assistance, $15.5 million in Economic Support Funds, and $1 million in Foreign Military Financing. Brazil, the largest and most populous country in Latin America, shares a border with Colombia's isolated Amazon region. The country's population is 174.5 million, with most inhabitants concentrated in the southeastern areas and along the Atlantic coast. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party became President in 2003 after winning the election decisively. The US provided $35 million in funding for interdiction, law enforcement, and alternative development in FY2004, along with additional funds for various programs in Ecuador. President Lula da Silva won the second-round presidential election in October 2002 with support from various parties. He aims to implement sound economic policies and prioritize eliminating hunger in Brazil. He is working towards creating a strong South American bloc by merging Mercosur and the Andean Community. Brazil sees these integration efforts as beneficial for negotiations with the United States for a Free Trade Area of the Americas by January 2005. President Lula da Silva visited Washington, D.C. to strengthen ties with the United States, agreeing to enhance cooperation in various areas. Brazil did not agree to exempt U.S. citizens from the International Criminal Court, leading to potential sanctions. Brazil is a conduit for drug transit from Colombia to Europe and the US. In 2002, a federal counter-narcotics law was passed. Brazil has concerns about the Amazon region and has implemented the Amazon Vigilance System to monitor the area. Operation Cobra was launched for heightened vigilance. Brazil has launched Operation Cobra with air force and navy support to deal with spillover effects from Colombia, including FARC incursions along the border. In late 1998, the FARC captured a city on the Colombian border, forcing Colombian troops into Brazilian territory. In another incident, a plane from Suriname carrying arms for FARC guerrillas made an emergency landing in Brazil. In early March 2002, FARC forces exchanged gunfire with Brazilian military forces. Brazil announced in late June 2003 an increase in troops in states bordering Colombia. In August 2003, a strange incident was reported. In August 2003, French officials landed a C-130 plane in Brazilian territory without informing authorities to rescue Ingrid Betancourt, a former Colombian presidential candidate held captive by FARC guerrillas. Brazil received limited Plan Colombia assistance, with allocations for law enforcement, child survival, and health funds. For FY2003, Brazil is set to receive $6 million in law enforcement funding, $9.8 million in child survival and health funds, and $6.4 million in development assistance. The Administration requested $12 million for Brazil in FY2004. Venezuela, Colombia's neighbor, is the fourth largest crude oil supplier to the US. Led by President Hugo Chavez, the country underwent political changes with a new constitution. Chavez was initially popular but saw a decline in popularity by mid-2001. After facing declining popularity due to perceived ineffectiveness and leftist agenda, Chavez was briefly ousted in 2002 but restored to power with military support. A general strike in 2002-2003 failed to force early elections, leading to a political crisis resolved through negotiations in May 2003. The agreement signed on May 29, 2003, aimed to resolve the political crisis in Venezuela. Implementation of the accord, which may lead to a recall referendum for President Chavez, is seen as a crucial first step for achieving political stability. Under Chavez's government, there have been tensions in U.S.-Venezuelan relations, with Chavez using anti-U.S. rhetoric and criticizing U.S. military actions in Afghanistan. Chavez's actions led to strained relations with the United States, including being excluded from a meeting with Andean leaders in Peru in March 2002. In July 2003, Venezuela faced sanctions due to concerns about the guerrilla conflict in Colombia spreading to its territory. There were incidents of Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries entering Venezuela, causing tensions in Colombian-Venezuelan relations. President Chavez denied supporting Colombian guerrillas, and promised to increase border patrols to prevent incursions. The Senate Foreign Operations Bill for FY2004 includes provisions related to Venezuela. The Senate Foreign Operations Bill for FY2004 includes a provision denying Venezuela assistance if it is found to be supporting Colombian terrorist organizations. Venezuela is a key transit route for drugs from Colombia to the US and Europe. Despite policy disagreements, the Chavez government has cooperated with the US in counternarcotics efforts, receiving $5 million in ACI funding in FY2002. Venezuela received $2.1 million in ACI funding for law enforcement and justice programs in FY2003, along with $500,000 in Economic Support Funds. The Administration requested $5 million in ACI funding for FY2004. Panama, separated from Colombia by the Darien Gap, has a population of 2.8 million and a strategic history. Panama, with a population of 2.8 million, is led by President Mireya Moscoso. The country's history is influenced by its strategic location and the Panama Canal. Despite economic difficulties and new responsibilities for the canal since the U.S. withdrawal in 1999, U.S.-Panama relations remain friendly. Panama refused to allow the U.S. to retain a military presence for counternarcotics surveillance, leading to the development of substitute locations for such activities. Panama exempted U.S. citizens from the International Criminal Court jurisdiction before President Moscoso's 2003 visit to Washington, D.C. The country faces cross-border incursions by Colombian groups and has seen the emergence of paramilitary groups with Colombian support. Panama is a major transshipment point for illicit drugs, especially cocaine, and a hub for money-laundering activities. Despite not producing illicit drugs, Panama cooperates with the U.S. in counternarcotics efforts and has seized significant drug shipments. In early 2002, a U.S.-Panama maritime anti-drug agreement was enforced, with Panama seizing significant amounts of illicit drugs and enforcing anti-money laundering legislation. Panama received funding for border control and law enforcement, with allocations for FY2002 totaling $5 million in ACI funding, $4.5 million in Development Assistance, and $4.2 million in Economic Support Funds. For FY2003, Panama is set to receive $4.5 million in ACI funds, $4.9 million in Development Assistance, $3 million in Economic Support Funds, and $1 million in Foreign Military Financing. The Administration requested $9 million in ACI funds for FY2004. In 2003, Congress passed various appropriation measures related to the Andean region, including the FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental for Iraq operations and the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Bill. The bill was signed into law in January 2004. Both the House and Senate had reported versions of the FY2003 Foreign Operations Appropriation bill by the end of 2002. In 2003, Congress passed an omnibus spending package, H.J.Res. 2, incorporating 11 unfinished bills. The House and Senate approved the bill, which included $835.5 million for the Andean Regional Initiative, with $700 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. President Bush later requested $74.7 billion for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq. In 2003, Congress approved $74.7 billion for military operations in Iraq and global counterterrorism efforts, including funding for Colombia. The House passed H.R. 1559 on April 3, 2003, with most of the President's request. The Senate passed the bill on April 7, 2003, after making amendments. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental, S. 762, was signed into law on April 16, 2003, providing $34 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $5 million for displaced persons in Colombia.
