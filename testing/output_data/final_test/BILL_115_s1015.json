    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2017\" and defines terms like \"Commission,\" \"covered dialing code,\" and \"N11 dialing code.\" It also includes provisions for studies and reports. The Commission, along with the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will conduct a study to explore the feasibility of using an N11 dialing code for a national suicide prevention hotline. The study will also assess the effectiveness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, particularly in addressing the needs of veterans. The Commission will consider N11 dialing codes, consult with the North American Numbering Council, and review information provided by the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Additionally, a SAMHSA study and report will assist the Commission in conducting the study. The Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use will analyze the potential impact of designating an N11 dialing code for a suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system, reporting to the Commission within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This analysis will cover the impact on suicide prevention, crisis services, and other suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotlines. To assist the Commission, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will study and provide recommendations for improving the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Veterans Crisis Line within 180 days. Recommendations may include increased public education, awareness, and improved infrastructure and operations. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will study and report on the effectiveness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line within 180 days. The Commission will then submit a report with recommendations on implementing a national suicide prevention hotline system within 1 year. The Commission will submit a report with recommendations on implementing a national suicide prevention hotline system to relevant Senate and House committees. If a dialing code is recommended, the report will also outline logistics and estimate associated costs. The report will recommend changes in translation networks and cell site analysis by wireless carriers, along with costs incurred by States and localities. It will also provide a cost-benefit analysis comparing the recommended dialing code with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and make additional recommendations for improving the Lifeline. The report will recommend increased public education and awareness, as well as improved infrastructure and operations. The Senate passed the bill on November 7, 2017, as attested by Julie E. Adams, Secretary."
