The Act references the Small Business Administration and the Small Business Act for definitions. Section 5 of the Small Business Act is amended to include Small Business Emergency Procurement Flexibilities. This allows the Federal Government to quickly purchase goods and services during emergencies while promoting small business utilization. The guidelines for this were issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in 2003. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy ensures that the Guidelines encourage small business procurement flexibilities, address all available options for small businesses, periodically update the Guidelines, and publish them accordingly. The Administrator shall develop ongoing government-wide training on small business emergency procurement flexibilities and designate at least one official for this purpose. The Administrator will designate at least one official to provide advice on small business procurement flexibilities during disasters or emergencies. SEC. 4. Paperwork reciprocity for small disaster contractors ensures small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals benefit from certification reciprocity between Federal and Federally-funded programs. SEC. 5. Hurricane Katrina and Rita small business contracting data mandate comprehensive data on small business participation in contracts related to the 2005 hurricanes. SEC. 6. Disaster area HubZones designation. SEC. 6. Disaster area HubZones designation includes areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita of 2005 as designated by the Administrator. The Administrator will establish a contracting outreach and technical assistance program for small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005 within 90 days of this Act's enactment. The Administrator may fulfill the requirement by acting through the Administration, designated small business officials, and other government entities or organizations as determined appropriate. SEC. 8. SMALL BUSINESS BONDING THRESHOLD. The Administrator may guarantee surety against loss for procurement related to Hurricane Katrina or Rita, up to $5,000,000. Upon request, the guarantee amount can be increased for reconstruction efforts by other Federal agencies. The Administrator can provide security against loss for contracts up to $10,000,000 at the time of bond execution. SEC. 9. FAIR SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION. The Administrator and Federal agencies must aim to award 30% to small businesses for prime contracts and 40% for subcontracts related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita recovery efforts. SEC. 10. PROTECTION OF SMALL BUSINESS RESERVATION. SEC. 10 amends the Small Business Act to adjust the dollar ceiling for small business reservations in contracts involving special emergency procurement authority.

The subcontracting plan required under this subsection must be negotiated within 30 days of contract award, with no more than 50 percent of payments allowed until compliance is achieved. SEC. 14. CONTRACTING PRIORITY FOR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. Section 15(d) of the Small Business Act is amended to prioritize contracting for disaster relief to local small businesses in designated disaster areas with concentrated unemployment or underemployment. Executive agencies are also required to give priority in awarding contracts. The agency must prioritize awarding contracts and subcontracts for disaster relief to local small businesses by using preferential factors, restricted competitions, preference requirements in subcontracting plans, and assessments of liquidated damages. Priority shall be given to local small business concerns in the awarding of contracts and subcontracts for disaster relief in any Federal procurement and any procurement by a State or local government made with Federal disaster assistance funds. The term 'declared disaster' refers to specific events like Hurricane Katrina of 2005, while 'disaster area' encompasses any State or area affected by a declared disaster. The term 'local small business concern' refers to a small business with a principal office and majority of workforce in the disaster area preceding a declared disaster. A local small business concern must be capable of performing a substantial proportion of any contract or subcontract for disaster relief within the disaster area for a declared disaster. SEC. 15. RELIEF FROM TEST PROGRAM. Amendment to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program Act of 1988 exempts contracts related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita relief from the program."
