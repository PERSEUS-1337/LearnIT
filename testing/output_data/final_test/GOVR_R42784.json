    "content": "This report addresses China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, focusing on implications for U.S. strategic interests. The key question for Congress is how the U.S. should respond to China's activities in the region, including island-building and base-construction in the Spratly Islands. The report also questions whether the Trump Administration has a suitable strategy and resources to counter China's actions and defend U.S. interests in the area. In this report, Congress's decisions on U.S. strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly regarding China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, could have significant implications. The terms first island chain and second island chain are used to describe the geographical boundaries of China's near-seas region. The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) dispute between China and the United States revolves around the regulation of foreign military activities in coastal states' EEZs. The South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS) disputes involve China and neighboring countries, impacting U.S. interests due to strategic alliances with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, security policies related to Taiwan, and partnerships with Southeast Asian nations like Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Chinese bases in the South China Sea (SCS) and forces operating from them could help create a defended operating sanctuary for China's sea-based strategic deterrent force of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). In a conflict with the United States, these bases would be vulnerable to attack, but attacking them would tie down U.S. forces, delaying their use elsewhere in a larger conflict. Chinese bases in the South China Sea could potentially delay U.S. forces in a conflict, allowing China to control fishing and oil exploration, intimidate neighboring countries, enforce air defense zones, project military presence, and aim for regional dominance in Eurasia. Chinese bases in the South China Sea could complicate US military intervention in a crisis with Taiwan, fulfill defense treaties with Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, operate forces in the Western Pacific, and prevent China from becoming a regional hegemon. This could lead to a reevaluation of defense programs and foreign policies in the region. China may be using disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea to sow doubt among US allies. China is using disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea to raise doubts among US allies about the dependability of the United States as an ally, potentially leading to a crisis or conflict with neighboring countries like Japan or the Philippines. This could weaken the US-led regional security architecture and increase Chinese influence in the region. China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea challenge the principle of not using force to settle disputes between countries, potentially leading to a shift towards \"might makes right\" in international relations. This could weaken the US-led regional security architecture and increase Chinese influence in the region. Freedom of operations in international waters, also known as freedom of the seas, encompasses all rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea and airspace for military and commercial ships. China's actions in the South China Sea challenge this principle. China's actions in the South China Sea challenge the principle of freedom of the seas, which could have broad implications for international law and sovereignty over the world's oceans. China's position on coastal states regulating foreign military activities in their EEZs could impact U.S. naval operations globally, affecting the ability to defend various U.S. interests overseas. U.S. Navy's legal right to operate freely in EEZ waters is crucial for their missions worldwide. The South China Sea is crucial for U.S. naval operations globally, impacting the ability to defend U.S. interests overseas. Restrictions in the area could require significant changes in military strategy or foreign policy goals. The SCS is a major shipping route, with $3.4 trillion worth of trade passing through annually, linking the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea could influence assessments on its approach to settling disputes, views on international law, and its role as a major world power. Oil and gas exploration in these areas could involve U.S. firms and impact world oil prices. China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea could impact its stance on international law and its role as a major world power. Territorial disputes in the region could affect U.S.-China relations and have broader implications. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea involve multiple countries, including China, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Japan. These disputes have led to diplomatic tensions and incidents at sea. Other land features in the seas are also in dispute, with additional maritime territorial disputes in the Western Pacific not involving China. China is involved in maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, leading to confrontations at sea involving various vessels and military aircraft. There is a dispute with the United States over China's right to regulate foreign military activities in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) beyond territorial waters. The United States and most countries believe that coastal states can regulate economic activities in their EEZs but not foreign military activities. China and some other countries disagree. China and some other countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, and Venezuela, believe that coastal states have the right to regulate foreign military activities in their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) beyond 12 nautical miles. This is in contrast to the United States and most countries, who believe that coastal states can only regulate economic activities in their EEZs. Some countries, including China, North Korea, and Peru, assert the right to regulate foreign military activities in their EEZs. Disputes over this have led to incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters. Incidents involving Chinese and U.S. military forces in international waters include a collision between a Chinese fighter and a U.S. Navy EP-3 aircraft, a Chinese navy ship forcing a U.S. Navy cruiser to change course, a risky intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 aircraft by a Chinese fighter, and other confrontations. The DOD characterized recent incidents involving Chinese and U.S. military forces as very dangerous and unsafe. These incidents include Chinese fighters flying within 50 feet of a Navy EP-3 aircraft in the South China Sea. The growing efforts of claimant States to assert their claims have led to an increase in air and maritime incidents, with China's maritime agencies engaging in unsafe activities in the East and South China Seas, targeting U.S. military aircraft and vessels. China's expansive interpretation of jurisdictional authority in international waters and airspace has led to unsafe incidents with U.S. forces. Despite some positive results in U.S.-China military diplomacy, there have been troubling incidents, such as a Chinese fighter crossing under a U.S. aircraft in the South China Sea. The PLAN has implemented international standards like CUES, reducing unsafe intercepts. A recent incident in the SCS involved a close encounter between a U.S. Navy destroyer and a Chinese destroyer near Gaven Reef. The Chinese ship came within 45 yards of the U.S. destroyer, requiring evasive action. The Chinese ship issued a warning to the Decatur, threatening consequences if it didn't change course. US officials deemed the actions of the Chinese ship as \"unsafe and unprofessional.\" The US Navy has had 18 unsafe encounters with Chinese military forces in the Pacific since 2016. In 2017, the Trump administration saw the most unsafe encounters with Chinese forces, including intercepts of Navy surveillance planes. The US Navy had 18 incidents, while the Air Force had one. In comparison, there were 50 unsafe encounters with Iranian forces since 2016. China challenges foreign military activities in its maritime zones. China has long challenged foreign military activities in its maritime zones, but the PLA has started conducting similar activities in other countries' maritime zones, showing a lack of commitment to international law. Despite being a party to UNCLOS, China's domestic laws restrict military activities in its EEZ, while the PLA operates in other countries' EEZs. In 2017, the PLAN conducted military operations in Japan's EEZ. In 2017, the PLAN conducted air and naval operations in Japan's EEZ, monitored testing of a THAAD system in the U.S. EEZ, and observed a multi-national naval exercise in Australia's EEZ. PLA operations in foreign EEZs are expanding beyond Northeast and Southeast Asia, raising questions about China's right to regulate foreign military activities in its EEZ under UNCLOS. Accepting China's sovereignty claims over islands in the SCS or ECS could potentially allow China to extend its EEZ zone for military regulation. China claims the right to regulate foreign military activities in its EEZ, separate from territorial disputes in the SCS and ECS. The EEZ dispute has led to past U.S.-Chinese incidents at sea and is as significant as maritime territorial disputes. China's approach to maritime disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea is characterized by asserting and defending territorial claims, strengthening its position, and employing a whole-of-society strategy to achieve national goals. This has led to incidents at sea and has the potential to impact U.S. military operations globally. China's approach to maritime disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea involves a whole-of-society strategy that includes diplomatic, economic, military, and civilian elements. China is persistent, patient, and tactically flexible, using a \"salami-slicing\" strategy to gradually change the status quo in its favor. This includes a \"cabbage strategy\" of consolidating control over disputed islands. China's island-building and base-construction activities in the South China Sea (SCS) have raised concerns among U.S. observers about China gaining effective control of the region. China's strategy in the SCS is seen as a form of gray zone operations, involving creeping annexation and a \"talk and take\" approach. These activities began around December 2013 and were publicly reported in May 2014. China's island-building and base-construction activities in the South China Sea began around December 2013 and were publicly reported starting in May 2014. China occupies seven sites in the Spratly Islands, with significant developments at Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef. These efforts dwarf those of other countries in the region. China's island-building activities in the South China Sea, particularly at Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef, have focused on infrastructure construction to enhance China's presence and control in the region. This includes the milestone of landing civilian and military aircraft on these reclaimed features in 2016. China has completed construction on its three largest outposts in the Spratly Islands, including new airfields, large port facilities, and fighter-sized hangars. Once all facilities are complete, China will have the capacity to house up to three regiments of fighters in the region. Additionally, shore-based infrastructure has been completed on China's four smallest outposts in the Spratlys. China has installed land-based naval guns on its four smallest outposts in the Spratly Islands - Johnson, Gaven, Hughes, and Cuarteron Reefs. The projects are said to improve living conditions, safety of navigation, and research, but analysts believe China is enhancing military and civilian infrastructure to strengthen control in the South China Sea. This will allow for a more flexible and persistent coast guard and military presence, improving China's ability to detect and challenge rival activities. China's construction in the Spratly Islands showcases its capacity to strengthen control over disputed areas and challenge other claimants. Hangars built on the islands can support up to 24 fighters for force projection operations. China has also deployed electronic jamming equipment, missiles, and electronic warfare assets in the South China Sea. China's construction in the Spratly Islands demonstrates its ability to enhance control over contested areas and confront other claimants. Chinese activities in the South China Sea include stationing a search and rescue ship at Subi Reef and gaining de facto control over Scarborough Shoal. These actions have raised concerns among U.S. observers. Concerns among U.S. observers since late 2013 include China's announcement of an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea, patrols by Chinese Coast Guard ships at the Senkaku Islands, Chinese pressure on the Philippine military at Second Thomas Shoal, fishing regulations in the South China Sea enforced by China, and a growing Chinese civilian presence in the region. China asserts its maritime claims in the South China Sea with navy ships, coast guard cutters, and maritime militia vessels. The China Coast Guard is the world's largest and has increased in size significantly in recent years. China regularly uses its coast guard ships to assert and defend its maritime claims, especially in the East China Sea. China defends its maritime claims in the East China Sea with navy ships and coast guard cutters, using the China Coast Guard for assertive actions to reduce escalation risks. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is deployed for situations with heightened escalation risks, while the People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) is utilized for sovereignty enforcement actions. China primarily relies on civilian maritime law enforcement agencies in disputes, with the PLAN in a protective capacity for potential escalations. The China Coast Guard has expanded and modernized its forces, enhancing China's maritime capabilities. The China Coast Guard (CCG) has significantly increased and modernized its forces since 2010, with a fleet size more than doubling to over 130 large patrol ships. These newer ships are larger and more capable, equipped with helicopter facilities, high-capacity water cannons, and guns ranging from 30-mm to 76-mm. The CCG also operates over 70 fast patrol combatants and more than 400 coastal patrol craft, enhancing its capacity for extended offshore operations in disputed areas. The China Coast Guard (CCG) has expanded its fleet significantly since 2010, adding over 130 large patrol ships equipped with advanced capabilities. By 2020, the CCG plans to increase its patrol ships and combatants by 30 before stabilizing construction. Control of the CCG was transferred to the Central Military Commission in July 2018. China's navy and CCG conducted joint patrols in disputed waters, expelling foreign fishing vessels. China also utilizes the People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia to defend its maritime claims, which some view as a key component of China's maritime forces. The People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM) is a key component of China's maritime forces for asserting its claims in the South China Sea. It is the only government-sanctioned maritime militia in the world and has ties to China's armed forces. The PAFMM is a subset of China's national militia, organized around towns, villages, and enterprises, with varying compositions and missions reflecting local conditions and skills. The PAFMM in the South China Sea plays a significant role in coercive activities to achieve China's political goals without fighting. They train with and support the PLA and CCG in safeguarding maritime claims, protecting fisheries, and providing logistic support, search and rescue, and surveillance. The Chinese government subsidizes local organizations to operate militia ships for \"official\" missions outside their regular roles. The PAFMM has been involved in various military campaigns and coercive incidents over the years. China is expanding its state-owned fishing fleet for the maritime militia force in the South China Sea, with Hainan Province ordering the construction of 84 large militia fishing boats. China's definition of freedom of navigation focuses on commercial cargo ships passing through international waters, contrasting with the broader U.S./Western definition. China's definition of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea differs from the U.S./Western definition, focusing on commercial cargo ships. China has interfered with non-Chinese fishing vessels, which some see as a violation of freedom of navigation. Ambassador Zhao Jianhua stated that while China respects freedom of navigation, it will not allow foreign military ships and planes to intrude in its territory. China's stance on freedom of navigation in the South China Sea differs from the U.S./Western view. China warns foreign military planes not to intrude into its territory, stating that freedom of navigation must be observed in accordance with international law. Adm. Sun Jianguo has rejected freedom of navigation for military ships, going against the views of the United States and other nations. Adm. Sun Jianguo of China opposes military freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, stating it challenges international law. China warns against military ships intruding into its territory, in contrast to the U.S. and other nations' views on freedom of navigation. At the Munich Security Conference, experts from China discussed the South China Sea issue and refuted misinterpretations of international law. Beijing and Washington have differing views on freedom of navigation in the disputed waters. At the Munich Security Conference, experts from China discussed the South China Sea issue and refuted misinterpretations of international law, particularly regarding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the freedom of navigation. China emphasized the importance of abiding by UNCLOS and clarified that freedom of navigation does not equate to freedom of military operations. China's ambassador to the UK criticized the US Freedom of Navigation Program as a distortion of international law. He argued that there are no issues with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, with over 100,000 merchant ships passing through without any problems. The ambassador suggested that the focus on \"safeguarding freedom of navigation\" could be a pretext for military intervention or stirring up trouble in the region. China's ambassador to the UK criticized the US Freedom of Navigation Program as a distortion of international law, arguing that there are no issues with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. He warned against outside intervention and urged respect for China and ASEAN efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region. China's ambassador warned against outside intervention in the South China Sea, criticizing countries for sending warships and aircraft to create trouble. He emphasized that this behavior threatens China's security and regional peace, calling it a serious infringement on China's sovereignty. China's ambassador criticized outside intervention in the South China Sea, warning that sending warships and aircraft threatens China's security and regional peace. He emphasized that freedom of navigation should not be used as an excuse to infringe upon other countries' sovereignty, stating that such actions must be stopped to maintain tranquility in the region. The U.S./Western definition of freedom of navigation is broader, including operations by commercial and military ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace. China supports freedom of navigation but with its own narrow definition, preferring bilateral talks for maritime territorial disputes to avoid internationalizing the issues. China's larger size gives it an advantage in bilateral meetings, and it resists multilateral approaches to resolving disputes. China prefers bilateral talks for maritime territorial disputes to avoid internationalizing the issues. China resists U.S. involvement in disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, viewing the U.S. as an outsider seeking to stir up trouble. China resists U.S. involvement in South China Sea disputes, depicting U.S. actions as stirring up trouble. The Philippines has raised concerns with China over warnings to stay away from disputed territories. Chinese radio warnings were issued to Philippine military aircraft patrolling near artificial islands in the South China Sea. The warnings were meant to intimidate pilots conducting surveillance in the West Philippine Sea. In late January, a Philippine air force plane received a threatening message from Chinese forces, warning it to leave immediately to avoid misunderstandings. Chinese radio warnings were issued to Philippine military aircraft patrolling near artificial islands in the South China Sea, specifically Gaven Reef. Philippine officials have raised concerns over the radio transmissions, which are suspected to originate from Chinese-occupied artificial islands in the Spratlys. This new problem emerged after China transformed disputed reefs into islands using dredged sand. Chinese radio warnings were issued to Philippine military aircraft near artificial islands in the South China Sea, originating from Beijing-held artificial islands with advanced equipment. US Navy observed an increase in radio queries but stated they do not affect operations. Communication with regional navies, including China, is mostly professional, with any issues addressed through diplomatic and military channels. The U.S. position on territorial and EEZ disputes in the Western Pacific, including the SCS and ECS, supports peaceful resolution without coercion or use of force, freedom of seas, and opposes claims that restrict lawful uses of the sea. The U.S. takes no position on sovereignty claims over disputed land features in the SCS and ECS. The United States supports peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, opposes coercion or use of force, and believes claims should be consistent with international law. Large-scale land reclamation for militarization is not conducive to peace and stability in the region. The United States supports peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, opposes coercion or use of force, and believes claims should be consistent with international law. U.S. military surveillance flights in international airspace above another country's EEZ are lawful under international law, and the United States plans to continue conducting these flights as it has in the past. The Senkaku Islands are under the administration of Japan, and unilateral attempts to change the status quo raise tensions and do nothing under international law to strengthen territorial claims. U.S. Navy ships challenge what the United States views as excessive maritime claims and carry out assertions of operational rights as part of the U.S. Freedom of Navigation (FON) program. The U.S. supports peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea, opposes coercion, and challenges what it sees as excessive maritime claims through the Freedom of Navigation program. This program involves diplomatic and operational activities by U.S. Navy ships globally, including challenging Chinese claims related to straight baselines and airspace jurisdiction. China's actions in the South China Sea have led to a more dominant position in the region, making it difficult for weaker nations to resist Beijing's influence. This was evident when Vietnam yielded to Chinese pressure shortly after a visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier. During the USS Carl Vinson's visit to Vietnam, the Vietnamese government canceled a major oil drilling project in disputed South China waters under Chinese pressure. This highlights the shifting dynamics in the region as China's strength and dominance continue to grow, raising concerns among Western military strategists about China's ability to block US and ally activities in the region. China's installation of sophisticated weapons on reclaimed islands further complicates the situation. China's acquisition of new weapons poses a significant challenge to the U.S. Navy and other potential enemies in the South China Sea. This has raised concerns among neighboring countries with competing territorial claims in the region. The U.S. has been sailing warships through these waters to challenge China's claims, but China's increasing confidence and installation of sophisticated weapons on reclaimed islands have further escalated tensions. China's island-building strategy in the South China Sea is causing seismic regional change. China is seen as winning the confrontation with the US in the region, where Beijing asserts its dominance. Despite the US being a military superpower, China is making it clear that it calls the shots in its backyard. There is little appetite in Washington to challenge this assumption. An April 9, 2018, article from a Chinese media outlet highlights China's growing influence in the South China Sea, where it conducted naval drills while US carrier battle groups passed by. China's strategic situation in the South China Sea is shifting in its favor, with strengthened facilities and negotiations narrowing the power gap with the US. US Navy Admiral Davidson highlighted China's actions in the region during a Senate hearing. China is strategically enhancing its presence in the South China Sea through force posture initiatives, including the Belt and Road Initiative. Despite claiming non-military use, China is developing advanced air forces with new fighters, bombers, UAVs, and anti-air missiles. Emphasizing joint operations, Chinese air forces are expanding their activities in the Western Pacific and South China Sea. China has significantly expanded its military capabilities in the South China Sea by constructing radar, electronic attack, and defense facilities on disputed islands. These developments pose a growing risk to U.S. military operations in the region. China began building military bases in the South China Sea in 2013, using dredging efforts to create manmade islands and enhance its presence. China has constructed military facilities on manmade islands in the South China Sea, including hangars, barracks, and storage facilities. Despite President Xi's 2015 assertion of no militarization, these bases are now complete and ready for occupation. Once occupied, China can extend its influence and challenge U.S. presence in the region. China has built military facilities in the South China Sea, allowing them to control the region short of war with the US. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) enables China to expand its military reach globally, potentially pressuring nations to limit US military presence. This poses a threat to international norms, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. China's policies in the South China Sea challenge the international order by restricting naval and air forces' rights and freedoms. China's neighbors fear the establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone in the region. Boosting China's missile defense system in the South China Sea would allow it to restrict movement and squeeze supply lines of smaller claimant states with modest military capabilities. The lack of a robust response from the United States and its allies suggests that the sovereignty dispute in the region has become a foregone conclusion due to China's view of the issue as a core security matter. The sovereignty of South China Sea waters is seen as inevitable due to US ambivalence towards Chinese military actions, ASEAN states' acceptance of China's claims, and Beijing's focus on national security. As China gains naval dominance, traditional rules may become less relevant, emphasizing the idea that 'might is right.' China's increasing military dominance in the South China Sea is a cause for concern as it has developed capabilities to threaten Southeast Asian states in the future. Chinese militarization activities aim to establish a strategic strait in the region by deploying military power at both ends of the sea. China aims to control the South China Sea, turning it into a strategic chokepoint and zone of anti-access/area denial. Through its navy, coast guard, armed fishing vessels, and military bases on artificial islands, Beijing has gained de facto control of the region, limiting the freedom of action for military competitors like the US Navy. China's control over the South China Sea has significant implications for the United States and its allies. Chinese vessels shadow every freedom of navigation transit, showcasing Beijing's quick response capabilities. It is crucial for the US to determine its priorities in its relationship with China and make tough decisions on which values to defend. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned of consequences if China does not change its actions in the South China Sea. China's control over the South China Sea has significant implications for the United States and its allies. Chinese President Xi Jinping has gained strategic advantages in the region, including control over shipping routes and resources. The US defends freedom of navigation but has not effectively countered China's consolidation of control in the area. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned of consequences if China does not change its actions in the South China Sea. China has exerted control over the South China Sea, pressuring neighboring countries like Vietnam to halt oil exploration in their exclusive economic zones. The US and other countries have failed to support these nations against Beijing's threats. China is also militarizing the area, deploying missiles and pressuring other countries for \"joint development\" agreements. China has deployed missiles and military equipment to artificial islands in the South China Sea, undermining international law and upsetting the regional balance of power. The US administration's failure to address Beijing's actions is seen as a serious mistake, with countries adjusting their strategic calculations in China's favor. This shift in power dynamics hurts US interests in the region. The US is concerned about China's actions in the South China Sea, particularly its island-building activities. Congress is questioning the Trump Administration's strategy to counter China's gradual strengthening of its position in the region. China's approach to the maritime disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea involves asserting and defending territorial claims, strengthening its position over time, and employing a comprehensive strategy that includes diplomatic, economic, military, and civilian elements. China's integrated strategy in the South China Sea and East China Sea involves persistence, patience, flexibility, and willingness to absorb costs. The effectiveness of a one-dimensional, intermittent, or insufficiently resourced U.S. response is questioned. U.S. goals may include fulfilling security commitments in the region. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of fulfilling U.S. security commitments in the Western Pacific, maintaining the U.S.-led security architecture, and defending principles such as peaceful dispute resolution and freedom of the seas. These efforts aim to maintain a regional balance of power favorable to the United States and its allies. The curr_chunk discusses specific U.S. goals in responding to China's actions in the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS), including dissuading China from further base-construction activities and military buildup in the SCS. The curr_chunk outlines U.S. goals in responding to China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, including discouraging island-building, declaring an ADIZ, and pressuring Philippine military presence. The U.S. aims to deter China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, including discouraging island-building, declaring an ADIZ, and pressuring Philippine military presence. In the context of the SCS arbitration case, it is crucial to align actions with policy goals and consider the potential contributions of allies like Japan, the Philippines, Australia, the UK, and France, as well as partner countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. The U.S. aims to deter China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, including discouraging island-building and pressuring Philippine military presence. Key questions include the effectiveness of actions by allies and partner countries like Japan, the Philippines, Australia, the UK, France, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India in response to China's actions. Additionally, the willingness of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte to take action regarding the South China Sea and its implications for U.S. response strategies are important considerations. During the Obama Administration, the United States took actions to address China's island-building activities in the South China Sea, including reiterating its position on maritime territorial claims, providing maritime security assistance to countries like the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and strengthening security cooperation with Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore. During the Obama Administration, the United States took actions to address China's island-building activities in the South China Sea, including signing agreements with the Philippines for increased access to bases, joint military exercises, relaxing limits on arms sales to Vietnam, and operating maritime patrol aircraft from Singapore. Critics have argued that the Obama Administration did not react strongly enough to China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Critics of the Obama Administration's response to China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea argue that it did not do enough to oppose China's island-building activities, provide clear legal justifications for freedom of navigation operations, enforce tribunal awards, or impose strong costs on China. They believe this lack of strong opposition may have encouraged and accelerated China's actions. The Trump Administration took substantial and proportionate actions to deter China from island-building and base-construction activities at Scarborough Shoal, disregarding China's declared ADIZ over the ECS, and preventing China from declaring an ADIZ over the SCS. They imposed political and reputational costs on China and worked with allies to strengthen the U.S.-led security architecture in the region. Additionally, they increased defense and intelligence cooperation with Vietnam and Indonesia. The United States has accused China of \"provocative militarisation\" in the South China Sea and will continue sending vessels to carry out freedom-of-navigation patrols. China's actions are contesting international law and putting a strain on the global system, according to a top US adviser on Asia policy. The US will back up freedom-of-navigation operations in the region. The United States is committed to conducting freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea to uphold international law. China's militarization of the region has raised concerns, with the US warning of consequences for such actions. China's behavior is seen as a challenge to the rule-based order and the US will defend the rule of law. The White House is aware of China's militarization of the South China Sea and has raised concerns with China about it. There will be consequences for China's actions, although specific details were not provided. Additionally, China was disinvited from the 2018 RIMPAC exercise due to its actions in the region. Some argue against inviting China to the 2018 RIMPAC exercise, believing it would reward China for its actions in the ECS and SCS. They suggest that the benefits of observing Chinese naval forces are outweighed by the risk of China gaining valuable information. On the other hand, supporters believe that including China in RIMPAC exercises helps maintain a positive relationship with China's navy. Including China in RIMPAC exercises helps maintain a positive relationship with China's navy, providing opportunities to encourage adoption of U.S. and Western norms. The value of observing China's naval forces outweighs the risk of China gaining valuable information. The United States has withdrawn China's invitation to participate in the 2018 RIMPAC exercise due to China's militarization of the South China Sea, including deploying anti-ship missiles and bomber aircraft. This decision is in line with the commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The United States has called on China to remove military systems from the disputed South China Sea islands, citing violations of promises made by President Xi. The Pentagon rescinded China's invitation to an international military exercise in response to Beijing's refusal to stop militarizing the region. The Pentagon decided to withdraw China's invitation to the Rim of the Pacific exercise due to China's militarization of the South China Sea islands. Chinese officials criticized the decision, calling it unconstructive. China has deployed anti-ship missiles, SAM systems, and electronic jammers in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea, raising tensions. The Pentagon's move is seen as a minor blow to the PLA Navy's prestige and a signal to Beijing to stop militarizing the area. The Trump administration needs a strategy in the Indo-Pacific region to influence maritime activities. The Trump administration rescinded an invitation to China for naval exercises in the South China Sea due to concerns about China's militarization of the region. There was internal debate about the decision, with State Department officials hoping for diplomatic interventions while Pentagon officials wanted to impose a cost on China. The United States is considering increased naval patrols in the South China Sea to address the situation. The United States is considering intensified naval patrols in the South China Sea to challenge China's growing militarization of the waterway. This could involve longer patrols, larger numbers of ships, and closer surveillance of Chinese facilities in the area. U.S. officials are also urging allies to increase their naval deployments in response to China's military buildup in the region. The United States is considering intensified naval patrols in the South China Sea to challenge China's growing militarization of the waterway. Critics argue that these patrols have little impact on Chinese behavior and mask the lack of a broader strategy to deal with China's dominance in the region. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis warned of consequences for China's actions, while National Security Adviser John Bolton stated the U.S. would oppose any agreements with China. John Bolton, the U.S. national security adviser, warned against agreements between China and other South China Sea claimants that restrict international shipping. He emphasized that American naval vessels will continue to sail through the disputed waters, serving as a caution to Southeast Asian leaders, especially the Philippines. China has been pushing for veto power over military exercises in the region, but Bolton stated the U.S. supports negotiations for a code of conduct as long as the outcome is mutually acceptable to all countries involved. Some observers are concerned that the Trump Administration's focus on North Korea has distracted from the situation in the South China Sea, allowing China to increase its gains. There are also worries that the focus on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China could divert attention from China's actions in the region. At a hearing, DOD witnesses confirmed that the U.S. had not conducted a freedom of navigation operation within 12 nautical miles in the South China Sea. The United States had not conducted a freedom of navigation operation within 12 miles of a Chinese-occupied land feature in the Spratly Islands since 2012, sparking a debate over whether such an operation should be conducted. Opponents feared it could antagonize China, while supporters argued it was necessary to uphold navigational rights and remain consistent with the U.S. position on disputed land features in the South China Sea. The Obama Administration considered conducting a freedom of navigation operation near disputed land features in the South China Sea, despite concerns about raising political stakes unnecessarily. China's intentions to militarize its occupied sites in the Spratly Islands were also noted. The Obama Administration decided to conduct a freedom of navigation operation near the Chinese-occupied Subi Reef in the South China Sea. There was confusion among observers about the legal basis for the operation and concerns that it could imply U.S. acceptance of Chinese sovereignty over the reef. The Obama Administration conducted multiple freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, near various Chinese-occupied features. The Trump Administration, as of early May 2017, had not conducted any announced FON operations in the SCS. The Trump Administration initially appeared hesitant to conduct FON operations in the South China Sea, despite proposals from the Navy. However, they conducted an FON operation on May 25, 2017, and have since carried out multiple additional operations. China has objected to each operation, sending Navy ships to warn US ships to leave the area. The U.S. Navy has conducted multiple freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, including in the Spratly and Paracel islands. These operations have led to encounters with Chinese Navy ships sent to warn them off. Additionally, the U.S. Pacific Command has set a schedule for naval patrols in the region to counter China's maritime claims. The U.S. Pacific Command plans to conduct freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese maritime claims. This marks a departure from previous ad hoc approaches, aiming to establish a more regular schedule for patrols. The U.S. Pacific Command plans to conduct more regular freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese maritime claims. The new plan aims to provide a predetermined way of conducting patrols, including multi-domain patrols using U.S. Navy warships and military aircraft. This approach is in line with the Trump administration's strategy of giving commanders flexibility in determining the U.S. posture. The USS John S. McCain conducted a patrol around Mischief Reef, one of Beijing's fortified artificial islands in the Spratlys archipelago. Two P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft flew above the McCain during the operation. The Trump administration is increasing the frequency of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, challenging Chinese maritime claims. The Trump administration has increased the frequency of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, focusing on freedom of navigation and international law. Despite criticisms of the Obama administration's approach, the fundamentals of U.S. South China Sea policy remain unchanged. The Trump administration has increased freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, emphasizing the U.S. Navy's presence and commitment to navigation freedom. The frequency of these operations raises questions about their location, frequency, and legal rationale. One U.S. specialist on international law of the sea explains that features in the water whose sovereignty is disputed are challenged by other claimant states with clearer colonial rule. The nation, not the land, is sovereign, which is why there is no territorial sea around Antarctica. The United States is not obligated to observe requirements of a theoretical territorial sea as it has not recognized Chinese title to the features. If the U.S. does not recognize any state having title to the feature, it may treat the feature as terra nullius. The U.S. is not obligated to observe a theoretical territorial sea around disputed features in the water. U.S. warships have the right to transit within 12 nm of Chinese features as an exercise of high seas freedom. Other states are not required to follow rules of a nation with disputed sovereignty over features, as it legitimizes their claim. \"It is unclear whether features like Fiery Cross Reef are rocks or low-tide elevations submerged at high tide, making it difficult to determine their natural state after China's transformation. States with ownership over naturally formed rocks can claim a 12 nm territorial sea, while mid-ocean low-tide elevations do not qualify for any maritime zone. Artificial islands and installations do not generate maritime zones in international law, but owners can maintain a 500-meter vessel traffic management zone for navigational safety.\" The legal basis for conducting Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations within 12 miles of Chinese-occupied sites in the South China Sea includes options such as disputing sovereignty, citing high seas freedom under the Law of the Sea Convention, or considering the sites as low-tide elevations prior to land reclamation. The legal basis for conducting Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations within 12 miles of Chinese-occupied sites in the South China Sea includes options such as disputing sovereignty, citing high seas freedom under the Law of the Sea Convention, or considering the sites as low-tide elevations prior to land reclamation. A second option would be to state that the site or sites are not entitled to a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, allowing U.S. warships to transit within 12 nautical miles as an exercise of high seas freedom. Another option is to conduct the operation under the right of innocent passage within a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea. Alternatively, not providing a public rationale for the operation could create uncertainty for China and other observers regarding the exact U.S. legal rationale. The first public notice of a FON operation in the Trump administration challenged China's claim of a territorial sea around Mischief Reef. The U.S. warship conducted a military exercise near the artificial island, indicating high seas freedoms were exercised. The U.S. exercise of high seas freedoms near Mischief Reef challenges China's sovereignty claims. The Pentagon clarified that it does not recognize a territorial sea around Mischief Reef, incorporating this rejection into a routine FON operation. Mischief Reef is not entitled to a territorial sea due to lack of sovereignty and distance from Palawan Island. Even if it were a naturally formed island, title must be determined through negotiation or litigation, not just by China's claim. The concept of a territorial sea is based on state sovereignty and the establishment of baselines. Without baselines, no territorial sea can be claimed. The Dewey transit reflects the high seas nature of the waters, unlike the USS Lassen operation. The Dewey transit challenges China's claim of sovereignty over Mischief Reef, reflecting its high seas nature. President Obama's declaration in 2016 emphasized the final and binding decision by the Annex VII tribunal. The United States will include the Dewey transit in its annual list of FON operations for fiscal year 2017. The Dewey transit challenges China's claim of sovereignty over Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, asserting the US view that the arbitration ruling is final and binding. It is seen as a freedom of navigation operation and a challenge to Beijing's contested claims in the region. The Dewey transit challenges China's claim of sovereignty over Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, asserting the US view that the arbitration ruling is final and binding. Washington is not passive as Beijing expands its maritime reach, with some welcoming the more muscular US response. However, it is unclear if a FONOP was actually conducted, leading to muddled messaging. Clarifying the distinction between FONOPs and freedom of navigation is crucial, especially in the Spratlys. The Dewey transit challenges China's sovereignty over Mischief Reef in the South China Sea, asserting the US view that the arbitration ruling is final and binding. It is unclear if a FONOP was conducted, leading to muddled messaging. Clarifying the distinction between FONOPs and freedom of navigation is crucial, especially in the Spratlys. The routine exercise of freedom of navigation is the most appropriate way to use the fleet in support of U.S. and allied interests. The U.S. should have conducted routine operations to exercise navigational freedoms around Mischief Reef instead of possibly conducting a FONOP. China has not made any legal claim that the U.S. can challenge in the Spratlys, as no state has specified its maritime entitlements around the features it occupies. China has made ambiguous claims over water space in the South China Sea. China has made ambiguous claims over water space in the South China Sea, including issuing the notorious 9-dashed line map and making cryptic references to potentially claiming the entire Spratly Island area. These actions, which include using straight baselines contrary to international law, infringe on international navigational rights and have been subject to American FONOPs. However, China has never specified baselines in the Spratlys, leaving uncertainty about where it will claim a territorial sea in that area. The U.S. Navy should exercise high seas freedoms around the Spratly Islands instead of conducting formal FONOPs due to the lack of specific legal claims by China. Conflating routine naval operations with FONOPs politicizes the issue, blurs the message to China, and reduces the program's effectiveness globally. The confusion surrounding the USS Lassen's FONOP in 2015 dominated discussions about China's conduct in the South China Sea. The discussion around FONOPs in the South China Sea became a symbol of U.S. opposition to Chinese policy. Despite other naval operations in the region, FONOPs were seen as the primary means to push back against Chinese assertiveness. The decision not to conduct a FONOP around Scarborough Shoal, where China had no clear territorial claim, is a welcome signal to China. The importance of routine operations in the Pacific theater as a more effective way to signal opposition to Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, rather than relying solely on formal FONOPs. The consistent practice of free navigation is key in responding to Chinese actions, especially in areas like the Spratly Islands where China's legal claims are questionable. In order to support U.S. policy goals, it is crucial to align actions with specific objectives. U.S. freedom of navigation operations can defend the principle of freedom of the seas, but may not directly support other goals. Actions taken by the U.S. aim to impose costs on China in the East and South China Seas to deter certain activities. Cost-imposing actions can take various forms such as reputational, institutional, or economic measures. Additional actions in the Western Pacific are being considered to further deter China's activities. Expanding cost-imposing actions beyond the Western Pacific can utilize different elements of U.S. power, potentially escalating tensions with China. Such actions can also lead to reciprocal costs between the U.S., China, and their allies. Some observers suggest stronger actions against China in the South China Sea, including clarifying U.S. response under mutual defense treaties. The U.S. is considering stronger actions in the South China Sea, including increasing naval operations near Chinese-occupied sites, strengthening security cooperation with allies, and imposing costs on China for its actions. The U.S. is considering stronger actions in the South China Sea, such as inviting Taiwan to participate in the 2018 RIMPAC exercise. Concerns remain about potential conflicts with neighboring countries like Japan or the Philippines, and the U.S. obligations under security treaties. Congress may question if U.S. officials have taken sufficient steps to prevent territorial disputes from escalating into conflicts. The United States is ensuring common understanding with Japan and the Philippines on security treaties regarding potential actions in maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Communication with China on potential U.S. actions has been balanced between ambiguity and explicitness. The United States is ensuring common understanding with Japan and the Philippines on security treaties regarding potential actions in maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Communication with China on potential U.S. actions has been balanced between ambiguity and explicitness. The key questions revolve around the impact of the treaties on behavior and deterrence among the involved parties, as well as the incorporation of crisis scenarios into DOD planning. Another issue for Congress is the potential impact of China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea. The potential impact of China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea on whether the United States should join UNCLOS was discussed during the 112th Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on this issue, with supporters arguing that the treaty's provisions align with U.S. navigational rights. Becoming a party to UNCLOS would solidify the U.S. position on navigational rights in EEZs, giving the U.S. a stronger voice in discussions and the ability to call on China to adhere to the treaty's provisions. ASEAN member states support U.S. membership in UNCLOS as a means to resolve maritime disputes. Relying on customary international law alone is insufficient to protect U.S. interests in these matters. Opponents argue that relying on international law, such as UNCLOS, to defend U.S. interests in maritime disputes may not adequately protect navigational rights in EEZs and could lock in inadequate descriptions of these rights. Becoming a party to UNCLOS may not help resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea due to China's expansive maritime claims. The United States can support ASEAN countries and Japan in maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea without becoming a party to UNCLOS. This can be done through citing customary international law, U.S. naval deployments, and having allies defend U.S. positions on EEZ issues at UNCLOS meetings. H.R. 5515, as reported by the House Armed Services Committee, includes a section on modifying and extending the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative. The Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative is being modified and redesignated as the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, with the inclusion of India as a covered country. (D) India is added as a covered country under the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, with the Secretary of Defense authorized to include additional foreign countries for assistance and training purposes, subject to certification to Congress for increasing maritime security. The House agreed to amend H.R. 5515 to extend the deadline to September 30, 2023 for the annual report on military and security developments involving China. This amendment aims to enhance maritime security and awareness in the Indo-Pacific region. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 is amended to include activities in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Indian Ocean region. The United States policy emphasizes freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with planning and executing routine air and naval presence missions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 emphasizes freedom of navigation in international waters and airspace. It requires the planning and execution of routine air and naval presence missions worldwide, including freedom of navigation operations in accordance with international law. The Act also calls for collaboration with regional partner countries and allies. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 emphasizes freedom of navigation in international waters and airspace, requiring routine air and naval presence missions worldwide. An amendment to the Act renames the 'Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative' to the 'Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative' and expands the region to include the Indian Ocean. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are added as recipient countries for assistance and training.

The committee supports efforts under the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative to enhance regional partners' capabilities in controlling maritime territory and deterring adversaries. The Department of Defense has utilized authority to support partner capacity-building efforts through training, sustainment support, and multilateral engagements. Increased resources will be needed for long-term capacity building efforts in the future. The committee supports enhancing regional partners' capabilities in maritime security through the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, including the addition of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India. The initiative is extended through 2025 to demonstrate commitment to allies and partners in the region. The committee supports enhancing regional partners' capabilities in maritime security through the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, including the addition of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India. They encourage the Department to utilize security cooperation authorities under section 1241 of the National Defense Authorization Act to enhance capabilities of security partners in South and Southeast Asia. Section 1245 of S. 2987 prohibits the participation of China in RIMPAC naval exercises due to destabilizing activities in the South China Sea. The committee supports enhancing regional partners' capabilities in maritime security through the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, including the addition of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and India. They encourage the Department to utilize security cooperation authorities under section 1241 of the National Defense Authorization Act to enhance capabilities of security partners in South and Southeast Asia. Section 1245 of S. 2987 prohibits the participation of China in RIMPAC naval exercises due to destabilizing activities in the South China Sea. The Government of the People's Republic of China's adversarial actions threaten the maritime security of the United States and our allies, leading to a call for reevaluation of their involvement in multilateral exercises until behavior changes. The Secretary of Defense must certify China's cessation of land reclamation activities, removal of weapons from sites, and establishment of a consistent track record for participation in RIMPAC exercises. The Administration objects to China's participation in RIMPAC naval exercises, stating it limits DOD's options on China and ability to act in the national security interest of the United States. Section 1251 of S. 2987 requires a report on China's military activities in the South China Sea. The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, must submit a report to Congress and the public on China's military and coercive activities in the South China Sea following any significant reclamation or militarization activity by China. The report must include a narrative and images of the activity. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on China's military activities in the South China Sea, which may include a classified annex. If the report is released to the public, it must be in unclassified form. The Secretary may waive the public release requirement if it poses a national security risk, but must notify Congress within 48 hours. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on China's military activities in the South China Sea, with the option of a classified annex. If public release is waived due to national security concerns, Congress must be notified within 48 hours. The committee recommends a provision for a report on China's military and coercive activities in the South China Sea, to be submitted to Congress and made public promptly after significant activities by China in the region. The committee urges the Secretary of Defense to selectively declassify China's activities in the South China Sea and provide declassified imagery to the State Department for distribution to the media and Southeast Asia. (Page 300) Section 1086 of the conference report on H.R. 5515 / P.L. 115-232 of August 13, 2018 addresses this issue. Section 1086 of H.R. 5515 / P.L. 115-232 declares the United States' policy to operate in oceans and airspace worldwide as allowed by international law. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with conducting regular air and naval missions, including freedom of navigation operations, to uphold this policy. Section 1252 of H.R. 5515 expands and redesignates the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative to the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative, aiming to enhance maritime security in the region through assistance and training. The expansion of the region to receive assistance and training now includes the Indian Ocean. Recipient countries of assistance and training now include Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India is now eligible for payment of certain incremental expenses. The extension of the section now goes until December 31, 2025. Section 1259 of H.R. 5515 prohibits the participation of China in RIMPAC naval exercises. The Secretary of Defense must certify that China has ceased land reclamation activities in the South China Sea, removed weapons from reclamation sites, and stabilized the region for four years to participate in RIMPAC naval exercises. A national security waiver can be granted by the Secretary if deemed in the interest of the United States. The Secretary of Defense can grant a national security waiver if it benefits the United States. Section 1262 of H.R. 5515 requires a report on China's military activities in the South China Sea to be submitted to congressional committees and made public. The Secretary of Defense can grant a national security waiver for the release of a report on China's military activities in the South China Sea to congressional committees and the public. The report must include details on significant reclamation, territorial claims, and militarization activities, along with corresponding images. Reports to Congress must be unclassified, with the option for a classified annex, while reports released to the public must be in unclassified form. The Secretary of Defense may waive the release of a report on China's activities in the South China Sea if it poses a national security risk. Congressional committees must be notified within 48 hours of any such waiver. The term ''appropriate congressional committees'' refers to the congressional defense committees, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Section 1262 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit quarterly reports on China's activities in the Indo-Pacific region to these committees, allies, and partners. Waivers for national security risks can be granted for releasing these reports. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on China's military activities in the South China Sea to the congressional defense committees and the public immediately after significant events, in coordination with the Secretary of State. The conferees urge the Secretary of Defense to provide timely information on China's activities in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific region, including selective declassification of provocative military actions. Section 1288 of H.R. 5515 modifies reporting requirements for freedom of navigation. SEC. 1288 of H.R. 5515 modifies reporting requirements for freedom of navigation, expanding the committees involved in oversight. The strategic context from a U.S. perspective is briefly discussed in the appendix. The international security environment has shifted from the post-Cold War era to renewed great power competition with China and Russia. China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea reflect this shift, raising uncertainty about the future U.S. role in the world since World War II. The U.S. role in the world since World War II has been one of global leadership, promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights while opposing authoritarianism and regional hegemons. The Trump Administration's statements and actions have raised uncertainty about the future U.S. role. The Trump Administration's actions have sparked speculation about changing the U.S. role in global affairs, which could impact foreign policy, including maritime disputes with China. Discussions on U.S. security now focus on grand strategy and geopolitics, considering global rather than regional strategies. Geopolitics involves how world geography influences international relations. From a U.S. perspective on grand strategy and geopolitics, the focus is on preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia to protect core U.S. interests. This goal has guided U.S. military and diplomatic operations in recent decades. The Trump Administration's national security strategy and defense strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing countering their military capabilities. This strategy, known as \"2+3,\" addresses challenges from North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups. Additionally, the concept of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) has been highlighted. The Trump Administration's focus on great power competition with China and Russia includes the concept of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), which refers to the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and countries bordering those two oceans. China's naval capabilities are seen as a challenge to U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific. China's naval capabilities are viewed as a challenge to U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific, with observers seeing it as part of a broader Chinese military challenge to U.S. dominance. The United States has security policies related to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and bilateral security treaties with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. Additionally, there are other countries in the Western Pacific that are considered U.S. security partners. The 1960 U.S.-Japan treaty on mutual cooperation and security states that an armed attack against Japan's territories would be a danger to both parties' peace and safety. The U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to honor all treaty obligations, including the Senkaku Islands under Japan's administration. The U.S. takes no position on the sovereignty dispute between China, Taiwan, and Japan. The 1951 U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty states that an armed attack in the Pacific Area on either party would be dangerous to its peace and safety, and they would act to meet the common dangers. Article V includes an armed attack on the metropolitan territory or island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific. The United States reaffirms its obligations under the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty, particularly in the Pacific. Filipino and U.S. officials have issued statements regarding the treaty's application to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Additionally, international treaties like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea govern activities in the world's oceans. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994, establishing Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and territorial waters. 168 nations are party to the treaty, including China and most countries bordering the South China Sea and East China Sea. The United States is not a party to the convention. The United States announces decisions to promote and protect its ocean interests in accordance with international law, recognizing the rights of other states while asserting its own navigation and overflight rights worldwide. The United States proclaims an Exclusive Economic Zone within 200 nautical miles of its coast to exercise sovereign rights over living and nonliving resources. This is in line with international law and the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The 1972 Convention on Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) is a binding treaty that applies to all vessels on the high seas and connected waters. It involves China, the United States, and over 150 other countries, regulating rules for preventing collisions at sea. The State Department emphasized the importance of a common understanding between the United States and China regarding rules for operational air and maritime interactions to prevent accidents at sea. They highlighted the existing international rules, including the 1972 International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), as sufficient for ensuring navigation safety. The U.S. will continue to urge China to incorporate these rules into their incident-management tools. The US will continue to stress the importance of operational air and maritime rules with China to prevent accidents at sea. The DOD reported a close proximity incident between a PLA Navy vessel and a US Navy vessel in the South China Sea. The US Navy vessel was conducting lawful military activities beyond the territorial sea. The PLA Navy vessel's maneuver forced USS COWPENS to stop to avoid collision, violating international maritime rules. In 2014, the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) was agreed upon by 21 Pacific-region navies, including China, Japan, and the United States. The Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) is a nonbinding agreement that establishes safety procedures, communications, and maneuvering instructions for naval ships and aircraft during unplanned encounters at sea. It aims to reduce the risk of incidents during such encounters and supplements the 1972 COLREGs Convention. However, critics argue that CUES only regulates communication in unplanned encounters and does not address incidents in territorial waters or apply to fishing and maritime law enforcement vessels. The Department of Defense is considering expanding the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) to include regional law enforcement vessels and Coast Guards to reduce the risk of unintentional conflict. U.S. Navy officials and officials from Singapore and Malaysia support this idea. The U.S. Coast Guard and China Coast Guard have committed to pursuing an arrangement during Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit in 2015. The U.S. Coast Guard and China Coast Guard are working on an arrangement similar to the Rules of Behavior Confidence Building Measure for at-sea encounters. The U.S. Navy is urging China to adhere to a code of conduct to prevent miscalculations during naval encounters. The U.S. Navy is urging China to adhere to a code of conduct to prevent miscalculations during naval encounters, citing a recent incident in the South China Sea. The Code of Unplanned Encounters at Sea aims to reduce the chance of incidents between Pacific nations. China's Ministry of National Defense signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in November 2014 regarding rules of behavior for safety of air and maritime encounters. The MOU references various international agreements and included annexes for surface-to-surface and air-to-air encounters. In October 2018, 18 nations, including the U.S. and China, agreed to guidelines for potentially dangerous military aircraft encounters. The guidelines for potentially dangerous military aircraft encounters were broadened by an in-principle agreement reached by 18 nations, including the U.S. and China. The agreement aims to mitigate incidents and collisions in tense areas, with a focus on setting norms for aerial encounters. The in-principle agreement reached by 18 nations, including the U.S. and China, aims to mitigate incidents and collisions in tense areas by setting norms for aerial encounters. The agreement includes guidelines on clear communications and avoiding unprofessional encounters and reckless maneuvers, although enforcement and geographic specifics are lacking. This agreement is seen as a step towards confidence-building in military crises or encounters. The parties in the South China Sea reaffirm commitment to freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes, avoiding use of force and exercising self-restraint in activities to maintain peace and stability. China and ASEAN have been working towards a binding Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea since 2011. In March 2017, China announced the completion of the first draft of a framework for the COC, which was met with satisfaction by both parties. Negotiations are ongoing, but a final text has not yet been agreed upon. On May 18 and 19, 2017, China and ASEAN agreed on a framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. The document will be kept internal for now to avoid external interference. China emphasized the importance of regional rules to protect common interests. Liu Zhemin called for negotiations to be free from outside interference, possibly directed at the United States. Southeast Asian ministers discussed the issue on August 3, 2017. The Southeast Asian ministers meeting this week are set to endorse a non-binding framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, avoiding the issue of Beijing's activities in the region. Analysts and diplomats are concerned that China's support for the code of conduct is a tactic to delay while strengthening its military capabilities. The framework is broad and lacks specifics, urging a commitment to the \"purposes and principles\" of the agreement. The Southeast Asian nations and China endorsed a non-binding framework for a maritime code of conduct in the South China Sea, setting parameters for future discussions. Analysts have differing views on the agreement, with some seeing it as a positive step towards cooperation and others viewing it as a move in favor of China's territorial ambitions. The framework for a maritime code of conduct in the South China Sea was endorsed by Southeast Asian nations and China, setting parameters for future discussions. China's concession to the agreement is seen as a positive step towards cooperation in the region. Beijing has stepped up naval patrols and built artificial islands in the South China Sea to enforce its claims. The framework for the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea was endorsed by ASEAN and China, but lacks details and mirrors the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. The Code of Conduct for the South China Sea has not been fully implemented yet. The framework lacks key details like the phrase \"legally binding,\" geographical scope, and enforcement mechanisms. China's prolonged negotiations on the COC have raised concerns about a \"talk and take strategy.\" Negotiations between China and ASEAN over South China Sea claims have been slow. Recently, a framework for a code of conduct was agreed upon, seen as progress by ASEAN. Calls for a legally binding code date back to 1996. China's negotiations have been criticized for being drawn out. China agreed to expedite talks on a draft framework for a code of conduct in the South China Sea, to be presented to ASEAN and Chinese foreign ministers in August. The framework lacks enforcement mechanisms, reflecting China's reluctance to be bound by legal agreements. This approach allows China to appear cooperative without limiting its actions, while ASEAN sees progress in the negotiations. The COC process is seen as a \"holy grail\" by Mr. Storey, with concerns that China may use it to legitimize its actions in the South China Sea. Challenges include China using the talks to delay and divert focus, including vague language in the COC to justify its actions, and claiming diplomatic success while pursuing its own agenda. If China fills the document with vague articles, it may have little impact on its behavior. The COC process is crucial, but there are concerns that China could abuse it by filling the document with vague articles to justify its actions in the South China Sea. Regional actors should be cautious and insist on negotiating a real COC with effective dispute management mechanisms, rather than settling for a superficial agreement just for the sake of progress. Asian nations and China have agreed on a draft code of conduct for the disputed South China Sea, showing progress through talks despite regional tensions. The agreement was announced at a meeting of Asean foreign ministers in Singapore, with talks expected to be long and complex without a set timetable. Yi Xianliang, Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, emphasized the complexity and sensitivity of the ongoing talks on the South China Sea code of conduct. He stated that setting a timetable for the talks is unrealistic and that progress should be made gradually. Yi also mentioned concerns about certain countries pushing for the code to be legally binding, highlighting the complexity of the issue. China is pushing for a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea, but the draft text shows deep divisions among claimants. The draft includes provisions such as restrictions on joint military exercises with countries outside the region. The complexity of the issue is highlighted by concerns about legal procedures and potential collision between Washington and Beijing. China is proposing restrictions on ASEAN nations' ability to cooperate with countries outside the region in the marine economy. The United States is concerned that these restrictions would limit ASEAN's sovereignty and harm the broader international community. China is seeking a veto over military exercises between ASEAN countries and other nations. China is trying to limit American influence in the region, particularly in the South China Sea. The United States is calling for transparent and consultative discussions on the South China Sea code of conduct with the international community. Progress has been made on a single draft negotiating text for the code of conduct. The agreement on a single draft negotiating text for the South China Sea code of conduct is an important step in managing disputes to avoid conflict. However, the draft text lacks key elements such as a geographically defined scope, a dispute settlement mechanism, and provisions on fisheries and oil and gas development. A comprehensive COC signed by all ASEAN members and China is needed to effectively manage the disputes in the region. The draft text for the South China Sea code of conduct lacks key elements such as a geographically defined scope, a dispute settlement mechanism, and provisions on fisheries and oil and gas development. A comprehensive COC signed by all ASEAN members and China is needed to effectively manage the disputes in the region. The Philippines stated that the rules intended to prevent conflict in the South China Sea need not legally compel countries to follow them, which is an issue of importance for the Chinese government. During bilateral talks in Davao City, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. and Chinese counterpart Wang Yi discussed the South China Sea code of conduct. ASEAN aims for a legally binding COC, while China prefers a \"binding\" agreement. Locsin suggested a standard of behavior for ASEAN nations and governments. Wang stated China's commitment to the code, whether legally binding or not, and hopes for negotiations to conclude before Manila's term as ASEAN-China coordinator ends. The South China Sea code of conduct is being discussed by ASEAN and China. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that a rulebook should be finished in three years, with China not seeking hegemony or expansion. Talks have been ongoing for years, with the aim of managing tensions in the disputed area. The South China Sea code of conduct talks have been ongoing for years, with China accused of delaying progress. In 2016, a tribunal awarded in favor of the Philippines in a case against China over maritime entitlements. China refused to participate in the arbitration, stating the tribunal lacked jurisdiction. The tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines in a case against China over maritime entitlements. China did not participate in the arbitration, but the tribunal found jurisdiction and issued an award strongly in favor of the Philippines. The ruling stated that China's nine-dash line claim had no legal basis, limited territorial sea entitlement for land features in the Spratlys, and found China in violation of the Philippines' sovereign rights. The tribunal's award in favor of the Philippines in a case against China over maritime entitlements is binding under UNCLOS, but there is no mechanism for enforcing it. The United States has urged compliance, but China has declared the ruling null and void. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has not sought to enforce the award, which found that the Convention allocates rights to maritime areas and does not recognize historic rights or the 'Nine-Dash Line'. The Tribunal concluded that China's historic rights to resources in the South China Sea were extinguished if incompatible with exclusive economic zones in the Convention. China did not historically exercise exclusive control over the waters or resources in the area falling within the 'nine-dash line'. Features above water at high tide generate a 12 nautical mile territorial sea, while submerged features do not. The Tribunal found that none of the Spratly Islands claimed by China could generate extended maritime zones beyond 12 nautical miles due to their inability to sustain human habitation or economic life. It was also determined that the islands collectively could not generate maritime zones as a unit. The Tribunal found that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, as they are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China. China violated the Philippines' sovereign rights by interfering with fishing and petroleum exploration, constructing artificial islands, and restricting access to traditional fishing rights at Scarborough Shoal. The Tribunal found that China violated the Philippines' sovereign rights by interfering with fishing and petroleum exploration, constructing artificial islands, and restricting access at Scarborough Shoal. China also caused severe harm to the marine environment in the Spratly Islands by engaging in large-scale land reclamation and harvesting endangered species. The Tribunal found that China's recent actions, including large-scale land reclamation and construction of artificial islands, have aggravated the dispute with the Philippines. China's activities have caused irreparable harm to the marine environment and violated obligations during dispute resolution proceedings. China's actions in the South China Sea have caused harm to the marine environment and violated international law. Despite initially dismissing the arbitral panel's ruling as \"a piece of waste paper,\" China is now partially abiding by it. China partially abides by the ruling on the South China Sea, imposing fishing bans and occupying Mischief Reef in violation. Despite some changes in behavior, China still maintains control over certain areas like Scarborough Shoal. China Coast Guard ship blocks entrance to lagoon west of the Philippines, but fishing still occurs. China refrains from drilling for oil and gas beyond UNCLOS limits. Beijing shows signs of adjusting legal stance in South China Sea, moving towards compliance with UNCLOS ruling. China is making efforts to comply with UNCLOS ruling in the South China Sea, removing objections to other countries fishing and drilling in the area. Despite not fully complying yet, China is taking the tribunal ruling seriously. The Philippines won a legal victory in the South China Sea, but China has turned it into a policy victory by maintaining aggressive policies without facing sanctions. The Obama Administration and the lack of enforcement of international law are to blame for China's success. Both the Philippines and the U.S. had options to raise the costs of China's non-compliance, but chose not to press the issue. China refused to accept the arbitral award in the South China Sea, dismissing it as \"waste paper\" with no binding force. The U.S. missed an opportunity under President Obama to change regional dynamics in its favor. An eight-page essay praised President Xi Jinping for dismissing the South China Sea Arbitration ruling as \"waste paper\". Two years later, China is consolidating control over the area while the U.S. fails to support neighboring countries' rights under the tribunal's ruling. Southeast Asian countries are yielding to Beijing's influence. China's \"lawfare\" tactics in the South China Sea are often overlooked, with a focus on its military buildup. The Chinese Society of International Law argues that China can claim maritime zones based on groups of features, not just individual ones. However, the Convention on the Law of the Sea specifies that only archipelagic states can draw straight baselines for maritime zones. China's arguments on maritime zones and baselines in the South China Sea are unlikely to convince legal experts. Beijing is targeting political and business elites in Southeast Asia, offering a legal justification for its claims. The U.S. has been quiet on a 2016 tribunal decision due to Philippine President Duterte's pro-China stance and concerns about its own exclusive economic zones. The Trump administration's failure to challenge China's claims in the South China Sea undermines international law and shifts the balance of power in the region. The Philippines remains divided on how to leverage its arbitration award against China, with President Duterte downplaying its relevance. President Duterte initially set aside the arbitration award to improve relations with China, hoping for investments and resource-sharing. However, other Philippine leaders are taking a tougher stance to resist China's expansion in the South China Sea. The Stratbase-Albert Del Rosario Institute hosted a forum where former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario accused China of wrongdoing. Former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario accused China of trying to dominate the South China Sea through force and coercion, defending the arbitration award as a victory against China's expansion agenda. He criticized the Duterte administration for acquiescing to China and not raising the arbitration award in multilateral fora. Vice President Leni Robredo, a key opposition figure, indirectly criticized Duterte's policy in the South China Sea in her keynote address at an event hosted by the Stratbase-Albert Del Rosario Institute. Interim Supreme Court Chief Justice Antonio Carpio criticized Duterte for not leveraging the arbitration award against China, calling for negotiations with other Southeast Asian claimant states and expanding maritime entitlement claims in the South China Sea. Tarpaulins saying \"Welcome to the Philippines, province of China\" were seen in Metro Manila. Tarpaulins with Chinese flag and characters saying \"Welcome to the Philippines, province of China\" were seen in Metro Manila, sparking outrage on social media. Presidential spokesperson blames government enemies for the banners, which were taken down by authorities. Duterte previously joked about Philippines becoming a province of China. Protesters rallied in front of Chinese and Philippine Consulates, demanding China leave Philippine territory in the West Philippine Sea. The rally coincided with the UN's ruling against China's claims, celebrated by Filipino American Human Rights Advocates. They criticized President Duterte for supporting China's actions. China's 'steal, steal, steal' approach to Philippine territories in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) criticized by Filipino American Human Rights Advocates. They accuse Duterte of prioritizing loans and investments from China over Philippine sovereignty. The group also alleges China's involvement in illegal drug trade in the country. Demand for China to respect UN Tribunal's decision granting full sovereignty to the Philippines in the EEZ, including the West Philippine Sea. China's approach to Philippine territories in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) criticized by Filipino American Human Rights Advocates for dismantling military facilities in the Spratly islands. China's use of the nine-dash line map in the South China Sea (SCS) exceeds territorial waters claimable under international law. China claims sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea and adjacent waters based on the nine-dash line map, which predates the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The map is maintained by the Chinese government and Taiwan also shows the nine line segments. China submitted a document to the United Nations in 2009 asserting its indisputable sovereignty and sovereign rights over the relevant waters. China's claim of sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea is based on the nine-dash line map, which has varied in the number of dashes over time. The map is used by China to assert its maritime claims, while maintaining ambiguity to preserve flexibility and make it challenging for other parties to challenge these claims. China claims sovereignty over island groups inside the nine line segments in the South China Sea, as specified in its domestic Law on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. China implemented fishing regulations in 2014, indicating administrative control over the area. Chinese scholars published a new map in 2018 to reinforce and expand China's territorial claims in the region. Chinese researchers claim a newly discovered map with a solid \"continuous national boundary line and administrative region line\" proves China's territorial sea border in the South China Sea. The map, not endorsed by the Chinese government, asserts sovereignty over the enclosed sea area. Researchers are proposing a new continuous boundary line in the South China Sea to clarify China's claims in the disputed waters. The proposed line would split the Gulf of Tonkin, extend into waters claimed by Malaysia, and finish near Taiwan, potentially strengthening China's sovereignty claims. The current ambiguous 'nine-dash line' has caused uncertainty in China's territorial claims in the region. Researchers are proposing a new continuous boundary line in the South China Sea to clarify China's claims in the disputed waters. The proposed boundary would define the exact area China claims in the region, including contested waters like the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands. The purpose of the boundary is both scientific and political, aiming to strengthen China's sovereignty claims. The proposed continuous boundary line in the South China Sea aims to clarify China's claims in the disputed waters for scientific and political reasons. China would claim rights to various activities within the boundary, while other countries' access would be open for discussion. This would help China better plan and protect its national interests in the region. The continuous boundary line in the South China Sea aims to clarify China's claims in the disputed waters for scientific and political reasons. It was generated based on historic evidence and aims to reduce the risk of conflict with other countries. The nine-dash line is no longer sufficient for China's increasing activities in the region. The researchers found a map with a black line indicating the sovereign boundary and a red line showing China's administrative power in the South China Sea. They published a detailed description in a domestic academic journal, recommending the use of a continuous U-shaped boundary line instead of the nine-dash line. This new boundary line aims to express China's sovereignty more vividly and accurately. The old map with a black line indicating the sovereign boundary and a red line showing China's administrative power in the South China Sea could add legal weight to China's claim in the region. However, the dash lines do not represent the Chinese government's position. China's strategy for the South China Sea is focused on achieving peace, stability, and prosperity, sharing natural resources with other countries, and leaving disputes to be resolved in the future. The continuous U-shaped boundary line recommended by researchers aims to express China's sovereignty more vividly and accurately. The Chinese government has no plans to change the dash lines on official maps in the South China Sea, according to an expert. Tensions in the region have eased, with neighboring countries avoiding direct confrontation with China. A new legal tactic was unveiled by China to assert its claim in the South China Sea. China's new \"Four Sha\" lawfare narrative asserts ownership of strategic South China Sea areas, including the Pratas Islands, Paracels, Spratlys, and Macclesfield Bank. This narrative, revealed by Ma Xinmin of the Foreign Ministry, aims to promote Beijing's claim in the region. China asserts sovereignty over the Four Sha island groups in the South China Sea through legal claims, including historical territorial waters and an Exclusive Economic Zone. U.S. officials expressed surprise at China's new tactic during a meeting in Boston. The State Department notice did not mention this new Chinese lawfare tactic. China's Four Sha claim in the South China Sea has important diplomatic and political implications, but its legal significance is uncertain. Critics argue that the new legal justifications are no more lawful than China's previous Nine-Dash Line claim. The challenge lies in effectively explaining why this shift does not strengthen China's legal claims in the region. China's Four Sha claim in the South China Sea includes the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha island groups. China asserts various maritime rights based on these islands, but the legal basis for these claims is uncertain. China's new legal strategy for the Four Sha claim in the South China Sea is weaker than the Nine-Dash Line as it violates UNCLOS. Despite its legal weaknesses, China may benefit from trading the Nine-Dash Line for the Four Shas due to diplomatic reasons. China's adoption of UNCLOS terminology for the Four Shas claim in the South China Sea may be a strategic move to reduce foreign criticism and shape the law of the sea. However, the legal justification for the Four Shas is as weak as the Nine-Dash Line claim, raising doubts about China's intentions in the region. The legal justification for China's Four Shas claim in the South China Sea is weak, similar to the Nine-Dash Line claim. Comparisons with U.S. actions in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico show significant differences in approach. The U.S. does not contest foreign naval forces operating beyond the 12-mile limit in waters. Scot Marciel discussed China's actions in the South China Sea and U.S. vessel activities in international waters. In March 2009, the USNS Impeccable was conducting routine operations in the South China Sea when Chinese fishing vessels harassed it, risking the safety of both sides and interfering with freedom of navigation. The U.S. protested these actions to China, emphasizing the need for dialogue to resolve differences and avoid risky ship-to-ship confrontations. China's actions raised concerns about its legal authority over vessels in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and its unsafe behavior towards other ships. China's view of its rights in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is not supported by international law. The U.S. has emphasized that its vessels will continue to operate lawfully in international waters. Robert Scher, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, stated that any nation's attempt to limit high seas freedoms within an EEZ is rejected. Customary international law guarantees all nations the right to exercise high seas freedoms in the EEZ. The United States asserts that navigational rights and freedoms within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are equivalent to those on the high seas, crucial for the global economy and international peace. Military activities in the region are routine and in line with international law. China's view on regulating foreign activities in the EEZ is not supported by international law. The position on whether coastal states have a right under UNCLOS to regulate foreign military activities in their EEZs could impact U.S. naval operations globally. Claimable EEZs include key U.S. Navy operating areas in the Western Pacific, Persian Gulf, and Mediterranean Sea. Observers note China's resistance to U.S. military operations in its EEZ, highlighting potential tensions if roles were reversed. The U.S. Navy's position on foreign military activities in its EEZ is influenced by historical acceptance of other countries' rights to operate freely in international waters. The 1982 Law of the Sea Convention expanded the territorial sea limit, but the U.S. still recognizes high seas freedoms for military operations beyond that limit. President Reagan accepted the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, extending the territorial sea limit to twelve nautical miles. He declared that the U.S. would respect traditional ocean uses and high seas freedoms in its Exclusive Economic Zone. The PLA Navy has been conducting military activities in other nations' EEZs without permission. China has been conducting naval activities in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of other countries, including the United States. The PLA Navy participated in the RIMPAC exercise in 2012 and 2014, with one instance involving an uninvited intelligence-gathering ship in the U.S. EEZ off Hawaii. This activity contradicts China's stance on foreign military activities in its own EEZ. The head of U.S. Pacific Command stated that China's surveillance ship off Hawaii could have a positive impact on U.S. operations in the Pacific. Adm. Samuel Locklear emphasized that military operations in another country's Exclusive Economic Zone are within international law. China's decision to send a surveillance vessel during RIMPAC exercises raises questions about its stance on international navigation rights. China's surveillance ship off Hawaii questions China's stance on international navigation rights in EEZ waters. The presence of the spy ship suggests a potential double standard in China's military activities, complicating relations with the U.S. China should clarify its position to avoid perceptions of inconsistency. The USN has shown restraint in response to the Chinese vessel's presence in its EEZ. US policy allows surveillance operations in an EEZ as long as they stay outside the 12-nautical mile territorial sea. This stance has been consistent since the Cold War, with the US showing similar restraint towards Soviet and Chinese surveillance activities. China's recent surveillance ship presence at RIMPAC raises questions about its stance on international navigation rights. China sent a surveillance ship to observe RIMPAC, contradicting its previous stance on surveillance activities. The US supports freedom of navigation and SROs in international waters, while China opposes such activities in its EEZ. China claims its actions are legal and different from foreign powers' operations in its EEZ. The PLAN declined to provide information, directing inquiries to China's Defense Ministry. China's Defense Ministry stated that Chinese vessels have the right to operate in waters outside of other countries' territorial waters, based on a legal reading that emphasizes domestic laws. China interprets the UNCLOS as granting jurisdiction to enforce its laws in its EEZ to protect national security, economic rights, and environmental protection. China interprets UNCLOS to justify its actions in its EEZ for national security, economic rights, and environmental protection. China's domestic laws support this stance, unlike the U.S. China's approach is seen as legally problematic due to lack of reciprocity in international law. French commentator highlighted China's confidence in shaping the Law of the Sea regime to suit its preferences. China is shifting from rules-based to relations-based objections, promoting its EEZ approach politically rather than legally. Beijing's surveillance operations in undisputed U.S. EEZs signal an important shift. China's surveillance operations in U.S. EEZs indicate a significant shift, but it does not guarantee increased flexibility in the East or South China Seas. Chinese commentary supports the view that Beijing will oppose U.S. SROs, citing them as incompatible with the stable Sino-American relationship. The Obama Administration must ensure that Chinese expectations for \"new-type Navy-to-Navy relations\" do not lead to a reduction in U.S. SROs. China's military activities in foreign EEZs suggest a legal basis for such operations, prompting the need for China to clarify its stance. China must clarify its stance on its surveillance operations in U.S. EEZs to avoid international resentment and maintain its relationship with the U.S. Failure to do so may result in accepting U.S. surveillance missions in its claimed EEZ. China's actions suggest a double standard that contradicts its promotion of reciprocity, respect, and cooperation in the international system. Clarification from Beijing is crucial to understanding its legal interpretation and potential implications. In September 2014, a Chinese surveillance ship operated in U.S. EEZ waters near Guam during a U.S. military exercise. The U.S. spokesperson stated that military operations in international waters are a fundamental right for all nations. Observers have suggested options for strengthening U.S. actions in response to China's actions in the SCS and ECS. Recent articles by various authors discuss actions in the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS), focusing on the need for the U.S. to respond to China's maritime activities. Topics include defending embattled waterways, strengthening the U.S.-Philippine alliance, challenging Beijing's maritime aggression, and revealing China's maritime militia. Discussions also touch on America's Indo-Pacific budget shortfall.
