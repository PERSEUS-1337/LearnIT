    "content": "The national debt growth is a central issue in federal policy making. The Budget Control Act was signed in 2011 to address long-term debt issues. The Super Committee failed to reach agreement, leading to automatic spending cuts in FY2013. The fiscal cliff concerns in FY2013 led to retaining tax cuts and increasing spending, resulting in higher budget deficits. This report explores ways to reduce the deficit by addressing immediate issues from the Budget Control Act and extended tax cuts, as well as long-term decisions on debt control through trade-offs in defense, entitlements, support for governments, and tax increases. The Budget Control Act (BCA) was a result of negotiations to increase the debt ceiling and reduce the deficit. It included caps on discretionary spending, mandatory spending reductions, and savings in interest, estimated to reduce deficits by $916 billion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. Additionally, a joint committee was tasked with finding an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. The joint committee tasked with finding an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years failed to reach an agreement by the deadline, leading to automatic spending cuts (sequestration) taking effect on January 1, 2013. Concerns arose about the fiscal cliff, which included the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and other temporary tax cut and expenditure provisions scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. The fiscal cliff, initially a concern due to short-run contractionary effects on the economy, saw some relief with the American Taxpayer Relief Act making most Bush tax cuts permanent. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 increased discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, sparking debate on how to address budget issues without front-loading deficit reduction during economic recovery. Some believed deficit reduction should not be front-loaded during economic recovery, as the economy was still below potential. By October 2014, the unemployment rate was 5.8%, close to full employment, but labor force participation and long-term unemployment remained below prerecession levels. The Congressional Budget Office reported an output gap of 3.5%. Critics of the budget plan in 2011 argued it did not consider current economic conditions adequately. The budget plan is seen as a step towards addressing long-term budget challenges. As the debt-to-GDP ratio grows, interest payments become more burdensome. CBO projects that a sustained reduction in the deficit is needed to stabilize debt levels. Delaying the reduction would require larger cuts in the future. The need to not move too slowly can affect optimal deficit reduction approaches. Changing entitlements for the elderly is difficult, so benefit changes should be adopted in the near term but applicable to the future. Addressing the unsustainable federal budget deficit involves choices on government goods, services, and transfers worth paying for. The federal government provides a wide range of services such as air traffic control and border security, but nondefense spending only makes up a small portion of the budget. Transfers, including interest payments, account for the majority of federal spending, making it challenging to address the deficit by cutting nondefense services alone. Defense spending constitutes about 20% of federal spending. To address budget shortfalls, transfer payments to individuals like Social Security and Medicare may need to be reduced, along with transfers to state and local governments. Taxes may need to be raised or a combination of these measures. The surge in debt is recent and tied to the recession, suggesting it is temporary. The recent surge in debt is linked to the recession and may require reductions in transfer payments like Social Security and Medicare, along with potential tax increases. The growth in transfers to the elderly and healthcare spending will contribute to unsustainable deficits. Different deficit reduction approaches will impact available choices, with constraints on tax increases likely leading to significant cutbacks in social programs. The analysis highlights that cutting direct provision of domestic government goods and services alone cannot solve the issue of unsustainable deficits. Transfers and payments to persons and state/local governments make up the majority of federal spending. Defense spending has decreased as a share of output, while nondefense spending has been relatively stable. The recent surge in debt may necessitate reductions in transfer payments and potential tax increases. Spending on programs for the elderly and healthcare has been rising, contributing to the recent increase in debt. Debt held by the public rose from 33% of GDP in 2001 to 74% by FY2014, projected to reach 106% or more by FY2039. The problem with the debt lies in the recent recession and its aftermath, not in prolonged deficits in the past. The rising debt, projected to reach 106% of GDP by FY2039, is mainly attributed to increasing spending on health and Social Security. The pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in Social Security and Medicare trust funds, posing concerns about financing. To address the deficit, significant cuts in mandatory spending or tax increases are necessary, including reforms to entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Tax expenditures may be a reasonable source of new revenue if not used to lower rates. Addressing the Social Security trust fund shortfall with tax increases would help accommodate longer lives. Cutbacks in transfers to state and local governments may shift the burden of providing services to subnational governments. Government spending and taxes aim to provide for public goods and correct market failures. The federal government provides public goods like defense, while state and local governments offer various programs and income support. Intergovernmental transfers play a crucial role in budget evaluations, with states receiving federal funds and providing transfers to local governments. The U.S. budget divides spending into categories such as public goods, transfers, discretionary, and mandatory. It also discusses taxes, tax structure, and trust funds. This approach helps address concerns about budget proposals and the impact on state and local governments. In the U.S. budget, spending is divided into categories like discretionary, mandatory, and by function (defense, education, etc.). Only 29% of government spending in 2007 involved direct provision of goods and services, with the rest being transfers. Government spending in the U.S. budget in 2007 involved direct provision of goods and services, transfers to persons, state and local governments, interest payments, and subsidies. Federal government spending was 20.6% of output, with only 6% allocated to public and quasi-public goods. Defense spending accounted for 3.9%, nondefense for 2.1%, and total nondefense discretionary spending was 3.6% of GDP. By the third quarter of 2014, consumption spending decreased to 5.6% of output, while transfers and interest payments increased. Nondefense goods and services spending was 2.6% of GDP, and defense spending was 3%. Discretionary spending in FY2014 was 6.9% of GDP, with defense at 3.4% and nondefense at 3.5%. In 2007, state and local government spending was 14% of output, with total government spending at 32% of output. State and local spending included 50% for goods and services, 39% for transfers to persons, 9% for interest payments, and 1% for subsidies. By the third quarter of 2014, state and local spending net of federal transfers was 11%, totaling 34% for all governments. Goods and services provision accounted for 66%, transfers for 25%, and interest for 8%. In 2007, government production of goods and services was 16% of output, with federal government share at 6% (38% of total government share). By 2014, the federal share of nondefense provision was 17%, declining to 15% with federal share remaining at 6%. Total government civilian employment is 16% of nonagricultural employment, with federal government at 2%, state government at 4%, and local government at 10%. The share of federal government spending on public goods has declined over time, from 9% of GDP in 1971 to 6% in 2007. This decrease is mainly due to reduced defense spending. Government involvement in the economy, specifically in providing public goods, fell by a third between 1971 and 2007. Transfers to individuals and state/local governments increased significantly during this period. Spending rose by another 2% of GDP by 2014. Spending increased by more than a third by 2014, with a rise in transfers to persons and a decline in consumption. Budget accounts classify spending as mandatory or discretionary, with subcategories. Discretionary spending is determined annually and divided into defense and nondefense categories. Mandatory spending includes programs like Social Security and Medicare, referred to as entitlements. Since 1971, defense spending has fluctuated as a percentage of output, declining after the Vietnam War, rising in the 1980s, and then falling again before increasing due to conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nondefense discretionary spending has remained more stable, with a slight increase in the late 1970s. Nondefense discretionary spending includes education, transportation, income security, health research, veterans' benefits, international aid, and administration of justice. Nondefense discretionary spending includes funding for education, transportation, income security, health research, veterans' benefits, international aid, and administration of justice. About 15% is allocated to international aid, 9% for administration of justice including border security and law enforcement agencies, 6% for the environment and natural resources, and 5% for general space and science programs. Nontransfer domestic spending is 2% of GDP, with less than half of total discretionary nondefense spending going towards transfers like highway funds and grants to state and local governments. Cuts in any one program area would be small due to the modest share of output each area represents. Total spending on federal domestic enforcement programs, including immigration, border patrol, federal courts, prosecutors, prisons, and the FBI, is only three-tenths of 1% of output. Mandatory spending has increased over time, particularly for Medicare and Social Security due to rising healthcare costs, benefit changes, aging population, and longer life expectancy. Medicaid also benefits the elderly significantly. The rise in Medicaid benefits for the elderly is influenced by increased life spans and costs. Other mandatory programs for low-income individuals, retirees, and federal workers have remained constant or declined. The recession may have caused an increase in some programs between FY2007 and FY2013. Total spending as a share of output has remained stable, but the federal government's share in health and elderly programs has increased. The federal government's share of output in health and programs for the elderly has increased, while declining in almost every other category. In 2007, 64% of spending was for human resources, 20% for defense, 9% for interest, and 7% for other functions. These ratios remained similar in FY2013. Tax revenue sources, their growth over time, differences in structure and distribution, tax expenditures, and specified revenue sources for spending are discussed. Table 4 shows major revenue sources and their changes. Table 4 outlines the major revenue sources and their fluctuations over time. Individual income tax, the largest revenue source, remained stable as a percentage of GDP in FY1971, FY2007, and FY2013. Revenue growth occurred in the 1970s due to bracket creep, reaching 9.4% in FY1981. Reagan Administration tax cuts led to a decline to 7.6% in FY1992, with a slight increase after the 1993 Clinton Administration tax hike. Strong economic performance in the late 1990s saw a ratio of 9.7% in FY2001, followed by a decline in the early 21st century due to the George W. Bush Administration tax cuts. Total taxes also fluctuated, ranging from 17.1% in FY1977 to 20.6% in FY2001. The revenue sources have fluctuated over time, with individual income tax remaining stable as a percentage of GDP. Corporate taxes have also varied, while payroll taxes have slightly declined. Excise taxes have decreased significantly, and other revenue sources have remained consistent. Income taxes are the main revenue source for federal spending. Income taxes are the main source of revenue for federal spending, with payroll taxes being the next-largest source. Payroll taxes have flat rates with an earnings cap for Social Security, and increasing rates or eliminating the earnings cap are options to increase revenues from this source. Social Security taxes are linked to benefits. Tax revenues for Social Security come from income and payroll taxes, with progressive elements in benefit formulas. Medicare payroll taxes qualify for Medicare HI coverage, while excise taxes, like those on alcohol and tobacco, fund transportation needs. Tax expenditures result in revenue losses from special tax benefits in the income tax code. In FY2007 and FY2014, tax expenditures significantly reduced individual and corporate income tax receipts, with estimates showing a 39% and 44% decrease respectively. The increase in corporate tax expenditures is mainly due to deferring taxes on foreign source income. Tax expenditures have historically been around 7.5% of GDP, accounting for about 36% of total government direct spending in FY2007. Tax expenditures in FY2014 were 6.9% of GDP and 39% of government spending. They are considered transfers and subsidies, similar to mandatory spending, and differ from direct government spending in terms of budget function. The majority of tax expenditures are for physical resources, with a significant portion allocated to commerce and housing. Tax expenditures in FY2014 were 6.9% of GDP and 39% of government spending, considered transfers and subsidies. The majority is for physical resources, with a significant portion allocated to commerce and housing, reflecting special benefits for capital income and housing. General government receives a large share due to tax-exempt bonds and itemized deductions for state and local taxes. These benefits also extend to health and income security through exemptions for health insurance and retirement benefits. The government funds services through trust funds, with only a few being significant for budgetary reform. Social Security and Medicare HI trust funds rely on payroll taxes, while some funds rely on general revenues. The largest trust funds are for Social Security, divided into Old Age and. The largest trust funds for Social Security and Medicare are financed by payroll taxes. These funds can hold assets and earn interest. Medicare SMI is funded by premiums and general revenues. Table 6 shows revenue inflow and benefit payments for the trust funds. In FY2007, benefits exceeded taxes in the HI fund. In FY2007, benefits exceeded taxes in the HI fund, and by FY2013, benefits in all three funds exceeded outlays. Social Security benefits are indexed to wages and have grown due to increasing longevity. Revenues tend to be a relatively constant share of output, but were increased in the mid-1980s. Medicare expanded significantly in scope during this period. Table 7 shows income and outflow for the SMI trust fund, which was equally financed by premiums and federal contributions in FY1971. The financing of Medicare has shifted towards general revenues, with premiums now accounting for a smaller percentage of funding. Medicare Part B premiums are set at 25% of the cost, while Medicare D premiums are higher. Medicare programs have grown over time, with MSI growing faster than HI. There is a debate on whether to continue financing Social Security and Medicare HI from payroll taxes, as future benefits are expected to exceed receipts and deplete assets. The Social Security trust fund is projected to run out of assets in 2033, and the Medicare HI trust fund in 2030. To maintain separate funding sources, any shortfall in these programs will require increases in the payroll tax. In 2001, a surplus of $5.6 trillion was projected for the next 10 years. The projected surplus of $5.6 trillion for the next 10 years turned into a deficit of $6.2 trillion, mainly due to changes in revenues and spending, including the Bush tax cuts. The CBO baseline is a benchmark for policymakers to consider policy changes, not a projection of future deficits. In FY2007, the baseline did not account for expected tax cuts and projected discretionary spending to grow with inflation but not with output. Debt held by the public was 28% of output in FY1971 and began to rise in the early 1980s due to a combination of factors. Debt rose due to a recession, lower income taxes, and higher defense spending, reaching 49.3% of GDP by FY1993. After a tax increase and spending caps in 1993, debt declined to 32.5% by FY2001. However, it began to rise again, reaching 36.9% in FY2005, mainly due to lower income-tax revenues and increased defense spending. Medicare spending increased due to higher payments to physicians, leading to a rise in debt during the recession. Spending rose while revenues declined, contributing equally to the deficit increase by FY2010. Measures to combat the recession and automatic stabilizer effects further increased the deficit during this period. The deficit increased by about 2.5% of output between FY2007 and FY2010 due to higher spending on income-support programs and discretionary domestic spending, along with a decrease in income taxes. The slow economic recovery led to a further rise in the deficit to 74% in FY2014, with projections for stabilization before another increase. The debt accumulated quickly due to the recession and measures taken to combat it. The current debt level quickly accumulated due to the recession, not excessive deficits. Future debt problems will arise from population aging and rising health costs. The debt is projected to stay at 74% of GDP for several years before increasing to 78% in FY2024. The debt is projected to stay at about 74% of GDP for a number of years before growing to 78% in FY2024. The CBO also uses an alternative baseline where the debt will reach 87% of GDP in FY2024, including increased discretionary spending and higher Medicare payments. Programs for the elderly and health programs are expected to become more costly over time, with interest payments also increasing as deficits persist and interest rates rise. The forecast for revenues shows an increase to 18.4% of GDP by FY2024. CBO's long-run budget analysis highlights pressures from a more realistic baseline, especially for health programs. Table 12 displays spending, revenues, and debt-to-output ratios under the CBO extended baseline. Comparing this with the alternative baseline, which may be a more accurate representation of current policy, shows differing assumptions on income taxes and revenue constraints. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases more steeply under the alternative baseline, reaching 17% of GDP in FY2039 with a primary deficit of 7%. Various proposals were made to address the budget deficit during 2011 and 2012, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget identifying 32 different proposals. Projections for some plans' effects on revenues and spending relative to GDP are also presented, based on 2012 data. The plans presented in 2012 aimed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, with varying spending, taxes, and deficits relative to output. Spending-to-GDP ratios ranged from 18% to 25%, taxes-to-GDP ratios varied from 18% to 22.5%, and deficits ranged from 0% to 4% of output. A sustainable debt level can still exist with a continuing deficit as long as it does not grow faster than GDP. Table 14 shows five widely discussed plans along with the CBO standard baseline projection at that time. The House Republican Budget Plan, the President's Framework, the bipartisan Fiscal Commission, and two private plans (the Galston-MacGuineas plan and the Debt Reduction Task Force) were among the five plans discussed in 2012 to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. These plans had varying spending, taxes, and deficits relative to output, with most showing spending rising constantly but falling relative to current law projections. The House Republican Budget Plan, the President's Framework, the bipartisan Fiscal Commission, and two private plans aimed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2012. These plans involved varying spending, taxes, and deficits relative to output, with most showing spending rising but falling relative to current law projections. The proposals raised issues regarding discretionary spending cuts, maintaining trust fund revenues for Social Security and Medicare, sustaining tax revenues, and preserving entitlement programs for the elderly and low-income individuals. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of discretionary spending on long-term growth, with a focus on defense and nondefense spending. It highlights the potential for budget savings by targeting discretionary spending, which has been declining as a percentage of GDP. Defense discretionary spending has decreased since FY1971, and nondefense discretionary spending is projected to reach a low point by FY2024. The CBO baseline already accounts for a decline in discretionary spending as a percentage of output. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of discretionary spending on government services, emphasizing that recent history shows higher spending levels in the past. Various deficit reduction proposals envision lower levels of discretionary spending relative to GDP, without specifying specific cuts. The proposals for reducing discretionary spending did not specify specific cuts, making it unclear how programs like prisons, grants for special-needs children, or highway projects would be affected. The Fiscal Commission suggested cuts 18% below the CBO baseline, but even significant reductions may not close the deficit gap. For example, their proposed cuts would only reduce overall spending by about 1.3 percentage points of GDP. Table 13 shows a 17% GDP gap between spending and taxes by FY2039 if current policies continue. Closing this gap may require cuts in spending, including entitlements, tax revenue increases, or a combination. CBO's 2011 study proposed cuts in discretionary spending, such as eliminating grants for low-income students' educational opportunities, limiting college grants for the neediest students, and cutting funding for community service programs. Since its inception in the 1930s, Social Security has been financed through a trust fund mechanism with benefits funded by payroll tax contributions. Payroll taxes are flat rate with a cap on income covered, which falls lower in the income distribution due to increasing income disparities. Benefits are progressive, linked to contributions, and viewed as a pension with retirement income earned through wages. Currently, the Social Security trust fund is facing financial challenges as benefits are outpacing payroll taxes. The trust fund is using its assets and is projected to become insolvent by 2033, with only enough income to cover about three-fourths of benefits. If taxes cannot be increased, the trust fund's sustainability is at risk. If payroll taxes are not increased, the link between contributions and earnings may need to be abandoned or benefits will have to be cut to restore solvency. Some plans propose cutting Social Security benefits and raising taxes, mainly by adjusting the payroll cap. These plans aim to preserve the structure of the program, while others focus on making the trust fund solvent. The Medicare HI trust fund, like Medicare in general, has been impacted by demographics and rising healthcare costs. The plans for Medicare, Medicaid, and new health mandates suggest ways to find savings and increase taxes to address the growth in health care expenditures per capita. Most proposals aim to raise tax revenue to historical levels or higher, with one plan suggesting a fixed percentage of GDP to limit government spending. Limiting government revenues relative to GDP can constrain the scope of government, leading to pressure on major entitlements like Social Security and health spending. With revenues around 18.4% of GDP, only 0.4% is left for other programs, compared to 9.3% in FY2014. This could result in significant constraints on defense, nondefense discretionary, and other mandatory programs. The Republican Budget Committee's plan aimed to set tax levels at 18% and spending at 20% of GDP in 2020, which was 4 percentage points lower than the CBO baseline. To achieve this, they proposed significant reductions in spending, especially in nondefense discretionary programs, totaling $5.8 trillion lower in the first 10 years. This included a 34% reduction in nondefense spending by 2021 compared to the CBO baseline. The Republican Budget Committee's plan aimed to reduce spending significantly, with a 34% cut in nondefense spending by 2021 compared to the CBO baseline. The plan included repealing parts of the health care legislation, converting Medicaid payments to states into a block grant, and making other mandatory spending changes. Medicaid benefits would have to decline or states would shoulder more financial burden. Medicare would be converted to a voucher system after 2021. The Republican Budget Committee's plan aimed to reduce spending significantly by converting major entitlements into fixed payments constrained to grow with inflation. This approach would control the deficit and debt without raising taxes, requiring major changes to government programs for health care and other entitlements. The Republican Budget Committee's plan aims to reduce spending by converting major entitlements into fixed payments tied to inflation to control the deficit and debt without raising taxes. However, maintaining entitlement programs would likely require tax increases due to their unsustainable current formulation and revenue shortfalls. The effects of entitlement programs on the deficit can be seen in various scenarios in Table 12, 13, and 14. Tax increases may be necessary to sustain Social Security and health benefit payments due to the current unsustainable levels of spending. Social Security benefits are expected to rise from 4.9% to 6.3% of output by FY2035, with costs remaining relatively constant beyond that point. The funding problem stems from increased life span, not the baby boom generation, and benefits are projected to settle down at slightly over 6%. Unlike health care, Social Security benefits are not expected to continuously grow. The Social Security program faces a funding problem due to increased life span, with benefits projected to settle slightly over 6% of GDP. Various options such as tax increases, benefit cuts, and raising the retirement age are suggested to address the long-run insolvency, with a focus on higher taxes rather than lower benefits for adjustment. The Social Security program's funding issue due to increased life span is addressed by considering tax increases over benefit reductions in the long term. The burden of tax increases falls on younger generations during the transition period. Rising costs in healthcare, including Medicare and nursing home expenses under Medicaid, pose challenges due to continuous growth and varying perspectives on the quality of care provided. Rising healthcare costs may reflect better medical care and individual preferences, but inefficiencies in the system could lead to unjustified increases. Maintaining benefits may require tax options like raising rates, broadening the income tax base, increasing other taxes, or introducing new taxes. Tax options for maintaining benefits include raising rates, broadening the income tax base, increasing other taxes, and introducing new taxes like a carbon tax. The barriers for rate increases are mainly political, and historical top tax rates have been higher. Policy makers face challenges in implementing changes due to technical and political barriers, especially with difficult-to-eliminate tax expenditures. Some tax expenditures are challenging to eliminate due to technical, social, and political reasons. For instance, the exclusion of employer health insurance is the largest individual tax expenditure, accounting for 11% of total revenue foregone. Designing an inclusion for this benefit is complex as the value of insurance varies based on factors like age. Eliminating or scaling back popular deductions like the home mortgage interest deduction could also face political resistance. Employee ages impact income imputation, especially for firms with older employees. Defined benefit pension plans pose challenges in allocating benefits. Eliminating tax expenditures could help reduce the deficit by increasing income-tax revenues by 15%. Some proposals aim to increase income-tax revenues by about 15%, potentially raising revenues by 1.6% of GDP in FY2021. Changes to payroll and excise taxes, such as removing the earnings cap or expanding the tax base, could also be considered to boost revenue and extend solvency for the Social Security trust fund. Proposals to raise revenue for Social Security trust fund include taxing benefits like pensions, increasing gasoline and alcohol taxes, and introducing new taxes like value-added taxes, carbon taxes, and taxes on sugary beverages. These measures aim to extend solvency and generate additional funding for highways. Proposals to raise revenue for Social Security trust fund include taxing benefits like pensions, increasing gasoline and alcohol taxes, and introducing new taxes like value-added taxes, carbon taxes, and taxes on sugary beverages. These changes would likely add to the progressivity of the system by affecting high-income individuals more. Some proposals would address the budget deficit by reducing transfers to state and local governments. The reduction in discretionary spending could impact transfers to state and local governments, particularly in areas like education, transportation, and community development. Medicaid, a significant program administered by state and local governments with federal transfers, is proposed to be restricted to a block grant under the House Republican Budget. Federal transfers to state and local governments make up 2.8% of output and 21% of their receipts, with additional benefits from tax expenditures like deductions for state and local taxes and exclusions for interest on bonds. The reduction in discretionary spending could impact transfers to state and local governments, potentially shifting the burden of spending from federal to subnational governments."
