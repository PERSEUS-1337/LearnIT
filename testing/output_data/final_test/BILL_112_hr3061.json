    "content": "The Act titled \"Flexibility and Access in Rebuilding American Fisheries Act of 2011\" extends the time period for rebuilding certain overfished fisheries. Section 304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to allow for a maximum rebuilding period of 10 years, with exceptions based on stock biology, environmental conditions, or international agreements. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for a 10-year rebuilding period, which can be extended under certain circumstances such as when the cause of fishery decline is outside the Council's jurisdiction or when sustaining fishing communities is necessary. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for a 10-year rebuilding period, which can be extended if there is evidence of positive rebuilding trends in multi-species fish stocks or substantial changes to biomass rebuilding targets after the plan has taken effect. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for a 10-year rebuilding period for fish stocks, which can be extended if there is evidence of positive rebuilding trends or changes to biomass targets. The Secretary evaluates progress to end overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks by reviewing factors beyond commercial and recreational fishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for a 10-year rebuilding period for fish stocks, extendable based on positive rebuilding trends or biomass target changes. Factors beyond fishing, like coastal development and predator-prey relationships, are considered in evaluating stock rebuilding. If the Secretary deems it necessary, the maximum rebuilding time may include the initial 10-year period plus additional time based on specific criteria. The term 'on a positive rebuilding trend' refers to a significant increase in fish stock abundance since the rebuilding plan was implemented. It includes the expected time to rebuild the stock without fishing mortality and the mean generation time of the stock. SEC. 3. COMMITTEE REPORTS. Section 302(g)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require each scientific and statistical committee to submit an annual report to its Council on the process and information used in providing scientific advice. The report must evaluate the quality and quantity of available scientific and biological information, as well as the quality of each stock assessment used for the committee's recommendations. The committee's recommendations are based on information such as acceptable biological catch, uncertainty considerations, justification for variations from maximum sustainable yield, and social/economic impacts. Additionally, the report includes recommendations for management measures consistent with national standards. The committee's recommendations aim to decrease uncertainty, improve scientific information quality, and ensure consistency with national standards in management measures. Each Council must submit reports to the Secretary and make them public. The scientific and statistical committee's reports must be made public by each Council. Annual catch limits are established under SEC. 4. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to consider data on recreational fishermen and ensure that overfishing does not occur. Additionally, the authority to suspend annual catch limits is added. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1854) is amended to allow the Secretary to suspend annual catch limits in a fishery under certain conditions, including when the fishery is not overfished, stocks affected by overfishing are rebuilt, and scientific advice is uncertain. SEC. 5. FISHERY IMPACT STATEMENTS; ANNUAL IMPACT STATEMENTS. (a) Impact on Coastal Businesses.--Section 303(a)(9) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include coastal businesses dependent on fishing industries.\n(b) Annual Impact Statement.--Section 302(h) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a new paragraph regarding annual impact statements. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include an annual impact statement requirement, prepared in consultation with the fishing industry advisory committee, to assess adverse economic impacts on fishermen and coastal businesses. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a provision for the mitigation of adverse impacts identified in the annual impact statement. The Secretary is required to report to Congress annually on mitigation efforts and make recommendations for improving Federal fisheries programs to support sustainable fisheries and economic vitality in coastal businesses dependent on the fishery. SEC. 6. STUDY ON RECREATIONAL FISHERIES DATA. Section 401(g) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a study on program implementation by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The study will assess recreational survey methods and evaluate the effectiveness of the programs described in the section. The Secretary must evaluate the implementation of recommendations from a report and examine limitations of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey and the Marine Recreational Information Program. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within one year."
