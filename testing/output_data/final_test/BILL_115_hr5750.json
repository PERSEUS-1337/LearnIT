    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"E-bonding for Immigration Integrity Act of 2018\" and requires a bond. Prior to arriving at a US port of entry, an alien seeking admission must post a bond determined by the Secretary if they are a nonimmigrant in specified visa categories or have a visa overstay rate above 1.5%. The Secretary will establish the bond amount for each visa category within a year of the enactment of this section. The Secretary will annually review and adjust bond amounts for nonimmigrants in specified visa categories or with a visa overstay rate above 1.5%. Aliens must post the bond electronically with a qualified bonding agent. The bonding agent can release the bond upon notification from the US embassy or consulate in the alien's country. An alien may be required to post a bond if they overstayed their visa or did not return to their country of origin. If the alien changes their status to a nonimmigrant category that requires a higher bond, they may need to post an additional bond. The United States Embassy or consular office will collect necessary records for bond enforcement. This section becomes effective 120 days after the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. VISA OVERSTAY RATE CATEGORIES. The Secretary will identify visa overstay rates for different categories of nonimmigrant aliens in the previous year. SEC. 4. E-BOND ENFORCEMENT FUND. SEC. 4.
