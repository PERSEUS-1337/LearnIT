    "content": "Agricultural operations are often exempt from many environmental laws in the US, such as the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. However, large intensive animal raising operations are an exception to this exemption. The livestock industry, including concentrated feeding operations and feedlots, is a significant part of livestock production separate from cropland agriculture. Some large animal feeding operations are regulated under the Clean Water Act to prevent water pollution from animal waste. However, regulations have not been updated to reflect changes in the industry over the past few decades, leading to concerns about waste disposal as facilities grow in size. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed Clean Water Act rules for waste discharges from large animal feeding operations in response to environmental concerns. The Clinton Administration proposed revisions in December 2000, and the final regulations were issued by the Bush Administration in December 2002, sparking controversy among livestock and poultry groups. The final revised rules for waste discharges from large animal feeding operations were issued in December 2002 by the Bush Administration. Livestock and poultry groups opposed the rules due to cost concerns, while environmental groups generally supported them. States were divided on the issue, with some favoring a national approach and others preferring flexibility. The final rules were seen as less stringent than the proposal, influencing how interest groups responded. This report outlines the background, perspectives of key interest groups, and potential congressional issues related to the implementation of the revised rules. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1997 Census of Agriculture estimates 1.2 million farms with livestock and poultry in the United States. About 238,000 are animal feeding operations (AFOs), with 95% being small businesses raising fewer than 300 animals. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are less than 5% of AFOs but raise over 40% of U.S. livestock in confined facilities. Livestock raising in the U.S. has become more concentrated in fewer but larger operations. From 1982 to 1997, the total number of livestock operations decreased by 24%, with a 27% decrease in operations with confined livestock. The number of animals raised at large feedlots increased by 88%, and the number of large feedlots/CAFOs increased by more than 50%. Swine and poultry operations have seen the most significant changes, with a 12-fold increase in swine raised at large AFOs and a 218% increase in poultry production at the largest operations. Geographically, the greatest concentration is now in Oklahoma, Arkansas, North Carolina, northern Iowa, and southern Minnesota. Poultry production at large operations increased 218% in the same time period, with geographic concentration in southeastern and coastal states, Minnesota, western coastal states. Animal manure is used beneficially on farms to fertilize crops, but the trend towards raising livestock on large feedlots has led to more extensive problems with waste disposal. Manure nutrients exceed land capacity in high production areas like central northern states, West Coast, Arizona, and scattered areas in the Southeast. In 1997, USDA reported that 66,000 operations had farm-level excess nitrogen and 89,000 had farm-level excess phosphorus. Areas with excess farm-level nutrients are linked to regions with increasing numbers of confined animals, particularly poultry farms. USDA warns of potential runoff and water quality issues in areas where manure nutrients exceed soil capacity. Operations may export manure to surrounding properties, but the number of counties with excess manure nutrients has still increased. The number of counties with excess manure nutrients has increased by approximately 60% since 1982. In 1997, 165 counties had excess manure nitrogen, and 374 counties had potential excess manure phosphorus. Poultry operations comprised 82% of the operations with farm-level excess nitrogen, and poultry, dairy, and swine operations comprised nearly 90% of those with farm-level excess manure phosphorus. Animal waste, if not properly managed, can be transported over the surface of agricultural land to nearby lakes and streams. Animal waste from agricultural operations can contaminate groundwater and surface water, leading to human health and ecological impacts. Agriculture is the leading contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes, with animal feeding operations identified in 29 states as a source of impairment. The primary pollutants from animal waste are nutrients, particularly nitrogen. The primary pollutants in animal waste are nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), organic matter, solids, pathogens, odorous compounds, salts, and trace elements. These pollutants can impact water through various pathways like runoff, direct discharges, leaching into soil and groundwater, and releases to air. Manure pollutants can lead to ecological impacts such as fish kills in surface waters. Excess nutrients in animal waste can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by causing algae blooms, reducing sunlight penetration, and depleting oxygen levels, impacting fish and shellfish habitats. EPA reports show that agricultural activities are a leading source of lake impairments. Livestock manure contains over 150 pathogens, including E. coli and Salmonella, posing risks to human health. Contaminants in manure, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Giardia, can lead to infections in humans through swimming or boating. Toxins from algae in shellfish like oysters can also affect people. Manure can contaminate drinking water with nitrates, posing health risks like nitrate poisoning, especially in infants. EPA identifies nitrates as a common agricultural contaminant in drinking water. Nitrate contamination from livestock operations has led to poisoning, particularly in infants. The Clean Water Act focuses on regulating point sources of pollution, but nonpoint sources like runoff from farm and ranch land are becoming a larger share of water pollution problems. Nonpoint sources of pollution, such as runoff from agricultural activities, construction sites, and residential areas, contribute to water contamination. While most agricultural activities are considered nonpoint sources, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are classified as point sources and must adhere to regulations under the Clean Water Act. EPA has issued regulations defining CAFOs and their permit requirements to prevent the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. CAFOs must adhere to regulations under the Clean Water Act, with permits issued for a fixed term not exceeding five years. NPDES permits set limits on pollutant discharges into waterways, issued by EPA or authorized states. Currently, 45 states are authorized to administer the permit program. The Clean Water Act allows states to impose additional requirements on permittees and regulate more types of operations than federal NPDES rules. NPDES permits for CAFOs can be individual or general, with general permits increasingly used due to the large number of facilities. EPA's regulations define a CAFO based on animal confinement, number of animals, and pollutant discharge into waterways. A CAFO is classified based on the number of animal units it holds, with facilities holding more than 1,000 animal units automatically considered a CAFO. Facilities with 300 to 999 animal units are also classified as CAFOs if pollutants are discharged into waterways. Operations with fewer than 300 animal units may be designated as CAFOs if they significantly contribute to water pollution. The 1974 regulations imposed a zero discharge limitation on regulated operations, allowing discharge only in the event of the worst 24-hour storm in a 25-year period. These regulations did not specifically address discharges to surface water or leaching to groundwater. By the 1990s, problems with the CAFO regulatory system were widely recognized, limiting its effectiveness in preventing environmental issues from livestock production. Less than 30% of CAFOs had CWA permits, with regulations historically focusing on industrial and municipal dischargers rather than agricultural sources. The CAFO regulatory system faced challenges in the 1990s due to limited coverage under the Clean Water Act. Many agricultural operations were exempt from obtaining discharge permits, leading to unregulated waste management practices. Inspections and enforcement activities were also lacking, contributing to environmental issues from livestock production. Inspections and compliance enforcement activities were limited, often triggered by citizen complaints or accidental releases. The EPA's oversight of states was found to be inconsistent, leading to inadequate implementation of regulations for CAFOs. State programs for regulating feedlots vary in complexity and effectiveness, involving a mix of federal and state laws. State regulation of AFOs and CAFOs involves federal and state laws, with variations in approaches and jurisdiction among different state-level agencies. Forty-five states are authorized by EPA to regulate CAFOs under the NPDES program, while some states have separate non-NPDES programs for CAFO regulation. EPA retains responsibility for issuing permits in states not authorized to administer the NPDES program. State programs regulating AFOs and CAFOs vary widely in defining CAFOs, permit conditions, waste management plans, and enforcement procedures. EPA found that state non-NPDES AFO programs are often more stringent and cover smaller facilities. Some states choose not to use NPDES permits, but the GAO found inconsistent implementation of CWA requirements by states. The GAO found inconsistent and inadequate implementation of CWA requirements by states authorized to administer CAFO permitting. Permits did not meet all EPA requirements, with some states not issuing any permits to CAFOs, leaving facilities unregulated. EPA stated that non-NPDES permits greatly exceeded NPDES permits, not meeting approval standards and lacking federal enforceability. EPA was sued in the early 1990s for failing to revise Clean Water Act permit regulations, leading to a court-ordered schedule for issuing revised rules. The EPA was under a court-ordered schedule to issue revised Clean Water Act rules for CAFOs and other industries. The Clinton Administration proposed rules in December 2000 to clarify conditions for CAFO permits and restrict waste application. EPA asked for public comment on two alternative approaches. The EPA proposed two alternative approaches for defining CAFOs: one with a three-tier structure and clearer criteria, and another with a two-tier structure. The estimated number of operations needing permits would increase under both options. The EPA proposed new regulations for CAFOs, with a focus on permitting requirements for operations. Around 7,400 middle-tier operations may be affected but could avoid permitting by certifying they are not CAFOs. The proposal also includes extending permitting to new livestock categories and implementing site-specific nutrient management plans. A co-permitting system is suggested to cover not just growers but also corporate owners. The EPA proposed new regulations for CAFOs, focusing on permitting requirements. There was a 120-day public comment period, followed by an additional 75-day period. EPA held nine public hearings to review the proposal. Final rules were released in December 2002 after a thorough review of public comments. In November 2001, EPA published a Notice of Data Availability considering changes to certain aspects of the proposed CAFO rules. EPA considered changes to proposed CAFO rules, including alternative definitions for \"concentrated\" feedlots and state flexibility to opt-out. In July 2002, EPA discussed three additional issues for potential regulatory thresholds. The Clinton Administration-proposed rules for chicken operations with dry litter management practices aimed to lower the number of facilities defined as CAFOs. Livestock and poultry groups opposed the rules, citing economic burden on farmers, while environmental groups generally supported the proposal. EPA was considering new financial data to evaluate the economic effects of regulatory options. The EPA was reviewing public comments on a regulatory proposal to address animal waste pollution in waterways and groundwater. States were divided on whether to strengthen EPA rules or have greater state flexibility. Congress showed interest in the revised rules, with a focus on impacts and costs on animal agriculture producers. The EPA issued final revised CAFO regulations on December 11, 2002, focusing on impacts and costs on animal agriculture producers, especially small producers. The regulations retained much of the structure from the 1970s rules, including the definition of a CAFO and the three-tier structure based on the number of animals housed at the facility. The final rules eliminated the use of the term \"animal.\" The final revised CAFO regulations eliminated the term \"animal unit\" equivalents and replaced it with numbers of animals in each sector. All CAFOs now have a duty to apply for an NPDES permit, removing previous permitting exemptions. Poultry operations are now subject to clarified regulations, applying to all types of poultry. The revised CAFO regulations now apply to all types of poultry operations, including large broiler and dry layer feeding operations, as well as stand-alone immature animals like swine and heifers. This resulted in an estimated 2,198 additional regulated facilities and 488 newly regulated operations. EPA estimated that a total of 12,813 animal feeding operations should have NPDES permits under the previous rules, including 8,438 large facilities and 4,375 medium facilities. The final rules expanded the coverage of CAFO regulations to include all types of poultry operations and stand-alone immature animal operations, adding an estimated 2,554 operations. This accounted for 34% of all large and medium animal feeding operations in the United States. The rules also maintained the prohibition of discharges from CAFOs except in specific circumstances, with new sources in certain categories required to meet more stringent design standards. The final rules for CAFO regulations expanded coverage to include poultry and veal categories, with stricter design standards for storage structures. Existing CAFOs can request permit limits based on alternative technologies. Best Management Practices (BMPs) were included for land application and animal production areas to prevent pollution from nonpoint sources. The final rules for CAFO regulations expanded coverage to include poultry and veal categories, with stricter design standards for storage structures. Best Management Practices (BMPs) were included for land application and animal production areas to prevent pollution from nonpoint sources, such as specified setbacks, vegetated buffers, and nutrient management plans for managing manure and process wastewater. The final rules for CAFO regulations require manure analysis for nitrogen and phosphorus content annually, and land application areas to be analyzed every five years for phosphorus content. Compliance schedule mandates time frames for operations to apply for permits, with existing CAFOs expected to have permits already. Newly defined CAFOs must apply for permits before a specified date, and new sources must seek permit coverage 180 days before commencing operations. Existing CAFOs are required to develop and implement nutrient management plans. The final rules for CAFO regulations require manure analysis for nitrogen and phosphorus content annually, and land application areas to be analyzed every five years for phosphorus content. Compliance schedule mandates time frames for operations to apply for permits, with existing CAFOs expected to have permits already. Newly defined CAFOs must apply for permits before a specified date, and new sources must seek permit coverage 180 days before commencing operations. States with existing NPDES permitting programs must adopt state rule revisions to reflect the federal rules within one year. States which needed to amend or enact a statute to conform with the rules were required to make needed rule changes within two years. EPA decided not to include requirements for co-permitting of entities that exercise \"substantial operational control\" over the CAFO. The final rules for CAFO regulations require zero discharge to groundwater, nutrient plans by certified experts, and permit re-certification every five years. EPA expects environmental benefits such as improved water quality, reduced fish kills, and lower livestock mortality. EPA estimates a 23% reduction in nutrient loadings and a 6% reduction in sediment loadings. The final rules for CAFO regulations aim to reduce nutrient, sediment, and metals discharges by 23%, 6%, and 5% respectively. EPA estimates annual economic benefits ranging from $204 to $355 million. Compliance costs for CAFOs are estimated at $326 million annually. The total incremental compliance costs for CAFOs are estimated at $326 million annually, with large CAFOs accounting for $283 million, medium CAFOs for $39 million, and designated facilities for $4 million. Federal and state permitting authorities are projected to incur $9 million per year in costs. The proposed rules would result in annual incremental costs of $831-$930 million for CAFO operators and $6-8 million for permitting authorities. EPA concluded that the rules are economically achievable, with no projected facility closures in the veal, dairy, turkey, and egg laying sectors. However, some existing facilities in the beef cattle, heifer, hog, and broiler sectors may experience financial stress. Some existing facilities in the beef cattle, heifer, hog, and broiler sectors may face financial stress due to new requirements. EPA estimates that 285 large CAFOs, or 3% of all, could be at risk of closure. Among the affected facilities, 6,200 are small businesses, making up 40% of all impacted operations. Small businesses in the broiler sector are most prevalent among large CAFOs, while hog, dairy, and broiler sectors have the majority of small businesses in medium CAFOs. Approximately 262 small business CAFOs, or 4% of all affected, are vulnerable to closure. The final rules for CAFOs, particularly small business beef cattle operations, retained the previous definition and numerical categorization of regulated facilities. EPA rejected the proposed two-tier structure, citing disruption to ongoing programs. They also did not adopt new conditions for determining when a facility with 300 to 999 animals is a CAFO, as it would impose substantial permitting burdens and costs on operations above 300 animals. The final rules for CAFOs maintained the previous definition and categorization of regulated facilities, with some differences in EPA's discussions of the proposed and final rules. EPA stated that permits had been issued for approximately 2,270 facilities under the 2000 proposed rules, while in the final rules, the number of permitted facilities was 4,100 as of 2002. EPA noted that close to 60% of all manure generated by confined animal operations is now regulated. The final rules for CAFOs maintained the previous definition and categorization of regulated facilities. An estimated 49% of total manure would be controlled by retaining a CAFO definition threshold of 1,000 animals, increasing to 64% to 72% under alternative regulatory options. Differences in estimated pollutant reductions and manure control between proposed and final rules were not fully explained. The final rules included more poultry operations and stand-alone animal operations, impacting the amount of manure controlled. Evaluating impacts of changes is difficult due to unclear baselines in both proposed and final rules. The final rules for CAFOs maintained the previous definition and categorization of regulated facilities. Evaluating impacts of changes is difficult due to unclear baselines in both proposed and final rules. The baseline assumptions varied between full compliance and partial compliance, affecting the estimated pollutant reductions and manure control. The final rules for CAFOs were less stringent than the December 2000 proposal, with significant differences in estimated pollutant reduction. The EPA conducted more extensive modeling during rule review, leading to differences in the proposal and final rules. These differences were not adequately explained in the final rules but are crucial for evaluating the regulation. The final rules for CAFOs were viewed as less stringent than the December 2000 proposal, influencing how interest groups responded. Agriculture industry groups found the rules workable, pleased with scaled-back requirements. Some questioned EPA's authority. States sought flexible approaches and welcomed the retention of the status quo. Concerns were raised about resource adequacy for implementation. Environmentalists contended that the final rules were not adequate. Environmentalists criticized the final rules for CAFOs, stating they relied too much on voluntary measures and lacked strict compliance with national standards. Legal challenges were filed by environmental and agriculture industry groups in various federal courts. The EPA was faulted for omitting a provision that would have required zero discharge from CAFOs to ground water with a direct hydrologic connection to surface water. This connection involves the exchange between surface impoundments and surface water through underground corridors or ground water. The proposal would have mandated CAFOs to determine and monitor such connections. The final rules for CAFOs were criticized by environmentalists for not including a provision for zero discharge to ground water with a direct hydrologic connection to surface water. The proposal would have required monitoring of ground water up gradient and down gradient to ensure zero discharge. Environmentalists also objected to the omission of special requirements for restricting waste application to frozen, snow-covered, or saturated soil. EPA explained that site-specific variables influenced pollutant discharges to surface water. Industry groups disputed environmentalists' concerns about the final rules for CAFOs, arguing that a national technology-based standard is not suitable due to site-specific variables. Environmental advocates criticized the rules for not requiring performance standards aligned with the best available technology, particularly in regards to the use of lagoons and sprayfields. They believe these outdated methods pose risks to public health and the environment, advocating for the injection or incorporation of manure waste into the soil instead. Industry groups disputed environmentalists' concerns about the final rules for CAFOs, arguing that stringent national standards requiring zero discharge would lead to the use of lagoons and holding ponds for wastewater storage. They urged the EPA to adopt rules that encourage alternative technologies and allow CAFOs to treat wastes to a quality level that does not harm lakes or streams. The final rules maintained a nominal zero discharge standard but also allowed CAFOs to request permits for site-specific alternative technologies. The EPA's final rules for CAFOs allowed for site-specific alternative technologies to be used, which environmentalists criticized as potentially harmful to the environment. They were also disappointed that the rules did not address emissions of air pollutants from AFOs, which can include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter. Scientists believe these emissions pose environmental concerns but not significant public health risks. Some air emissions from AFOs are important locally (hydrogen sulfide, odor) and nationally or globally (ammonia, methane). Industry groups argue for air abatement technologies before regulations. A 2002 report recommended improved estimation of key air pollutants from AFOs and coordinated research to eliminate undesirable air emissions. Nitrogen emissions from production areas are substantial, requiring control strategies to decrease emissions. The report emphasizes the need for immediate implementation of control strategies to decrease emissions from AFOs. EPA estimates that new rules will reduce hydrogen sulfide and methane emissions, but not ammonia emissions significantly. Livestock operators face costs for complying with new regulations and federal support is needed to meet requirements. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial assistance to livestock and crop producers for conservation practices. Funding increased from $200 million to $1.3 billion per year by FY2007, with 60% targeted at livestock practices. Livestock operators of all sizes, including large CAFOs, are eligible for funding to control manure runoff. Livestock operators, including large CAFOs, are eligible for EQIP funding with a payment limit of $300,000 in any six-year period. 60% of funds are allocated for cost-sharing to livestock producers, with incentives for developing nutrient management plans. Other assistance programs are administered by USDA, EPA, and SBA. EPA summarized these programs in a 2002 report. The SBA administers a pollution control loan program for small and large animal feeding operations. EPA Clean Water Act programs can be used by AFOs but not by CAFOs. A 2003 GAO report found that states and EPA are not equipped to implement the program, leading to resource and administrative challenges. States reviewed by GAO cannot hire additional staff and would need to reassign personnel from other programs. EPA will also have to redeploy staff resources. The GAO report highlighted EPA's limited oversight of state CAFO programs and recommended increased oversight to ensure proper adoption of new requirements. State agencies rely on Section 106 grants for financial assistance in implementing the NPDES permit program. However, budget constraints may hinder states from fulfilling their responsibilities under the revised rules without impacting other important activities. EPA will need to redeploy staff resources to address these challenges. Agricultural interests stress the importance of farmers as stewards of the environment, relying on natural resources for their livelihoods. They are concerned that regulatory requirements may harm the industry's economic viability compared to international competitors. While some industry groups find the final rules workable with increased resources, many object to certain elements that remain unchanged from the initial proposal in December 2000. Some industry groups and agriculture organizations raised concerns about EPA's authority to impose certain requirements in the regulations, such as eliminating the permitting exemption for facilities that discharge only during large storm events. They also questioned the need for CAFOs to apply for permits and challenged EPA's legal basis for requiring permits from CAFOs that claim not to discharge pollutants. Additionally, there were doubts about EPA's assertion that many CAFOs are discharging without permits and some argued that voluntary programs are effectively managing the issue of excess manure. Some objected to burdening CAFOs with proving no discharge into waterways and argued against requiring permits without evidence of actual discharge. Industry commenters disputed EPA's authority to regulate land application of manure, claiming it falls under nonpoint source discharge. EPA believes regulatory controls are necessary due to significant discharges from land application areas. Environmental groups criticized EPA for omitting provisions in the final rules, including co-permitting requirements. Environmental advocates criticized EPA's decision not to require co-permitting of both farmers and large companies in the livestock industry. They also wanted a lower threshold for defining CAFOs to increase uniform controls. The final rules were seen as limiting public involvement and oversight by not mandating publicly available nutrient management plans. The EPA's final rules for CAFO permits do not require publicly available nutrient management plans, which environmental advocates wanted to be enforceable. Agriculture industry groups argued that public access could hinder innovation and lead to lawsuits. The revised rules only mandate annual nutrient management reports to be public, providing information on animal numbers and manure handling. Nutrient management plans are not required to be developed by certified experts or approved by authorities, allowing farmers more flexibility. The revised CAFO rules allow farmers to set their own requirements without technical or permitting authority involvement, presenting challenges for the animal agriculture industry, states, and EPA. Funding requests have increased, especially from feedlot operators seeking EQIP funds, but concerns remain about the payment limit and compliance. States and EPA also face difficulties in meeting new program requirements. The EPA and states struggle to meet new program responsibilities due to budget constraints. Research is needed for pollution prevention at animal feeding operations, with a focus on encouraging new technologies and practices that pose less environmental risk. EPA believes storage lagoons and sprayfields are the most widely used technologies. Researchers may benefit from a program established by the 2002 farm bill for innovation grants in environmental protection. The EPA and states are struggling to meet new program responsibilities due to budget constraints. Research is needed for pollution prevention at animal feeding operations, focusing on innovative nutrient management technology systems for AFOs. The National Research Council's 2002 report recommended aggressive research on air emissions from AFOs. Oversight of implementation is crucial, with a focus on regulating feedlot wastes. The commitment of EPA, USDA, and states to implement new requirements will be key, along with the need for federal legislation. Legislation may be needed to clarify Congress' intent and expectations regarding the management of animal waste and its environmental impacts. Questions have been raised about whether the EPA has the authority to regulate the land application of wastes. Some suggest amending the Clean Water Act to provide guidance on key issues, while others believe that additional legislation may be necessary to address gaps in the current rules, such as co-permitting or technology standards. Another legislative vehicle, such as the farm bill, could also be considered. Some believe that the farm bill administered by USDA might be a better option for addressing animal waste management issues."
