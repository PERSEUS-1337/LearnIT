    "content": "Under the United States Constitution, Congress has limited authority in domestic relations, with state policy guiding decisions. Despite this, Congress uses indirect approaches to pass federal laws impacting family law. The Constitution delegates family law matters to states, as stated in Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo. The Supreme Court has limited review under the Supremacy Clause to determine if Congress has required state law to be preempted. States have primary authority to legislate in family law, including marriage, divorce, and child welfare, due to the lack of national considerations in this area. This has led to substantial variation between states on these topics, although there is now more uniformity than in the past. States have diverse regulations in family law, including marriage, divorce, and adoption. Differences exist in community property laws, fault-based divorces, spousal support, and adoption eligibility for homosexuals and unmarried couples. The laws in different states vary regarding adoption eligibility for unmarried couples, including same-sex couples. States also have different statutes on access to adoption records for adoptees and birth relatives. Constitutional amendments in the past aimed to establish uniform national marriage and divorce laws, but none were adopted. The proposal for uniform national marriage and divorce laws did not receive enough votes in Congress, leading to a shift away from federal intervention in family matters. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has suggested uniform laws on various family law topics, many of which have been adopted by states. Federal legislation like the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act allows for federal intervention in certain areas. Congress has enacted legislation such as the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to address family law issues. These laws authorize federal intervention in custodial interference cases and same-sex marriage matters. Additionally, Congress has established funding programs for states to comply with requirements in areas like child abuse and adoption before receiving federal money. This report examines the constitutionality of Congress legislating on family law matters. Congress has the authority to legislate on family law questions, guided by constitutional principles that limit governmental entities. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects parents' rights to make decisions about their children. Courts recognize a fundamental right to privacy, covering areas like contraception, abortion, marriage, and education. These aspects of \"private family life\" are constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court has long recognized the protection of personal choice in marriage and family life under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Various cases have established a private realm of family life that the state cannot interfere with, including decisions on maternity leave rules. The Supreme Court struck down local maternity leave rules, statutes on foreign language instruction and mandatory public school attendance, and a local ordinance regulating extended family living arrangements. These decisions upheld parents' rights in education and family life under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has recognized the right to privacy in family matters, extending to married couples using contraceptives and minors in Carey v. Population Services International. In Roe v. Wade, the Court limited governmental authority on abortions, protecting a mother's privacy rights during the first trimester and allowing intervention only for her health in the second trimester. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that a state's interest in regulating abortions becomes compelling only after the fetus becomes viable, typically at the end of the second trimester. This decision was reaffirmed in subsequent cases, including Planned Parenthood of S.E. PA v. Casey, where the Court held that spousal notification requirements for abortions constituted an undue burden on a woman's right to choose. The Supreme Court upheld four aspects of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 as constitutional, including definitions of \"medical emergency,\" record-keeping requirements, informed consent, and parental consent with a judicial bypass option. The Court also recognized the right to marry as a guarantee of due process, striking down miscegenation statutes in Loving v. Virginia. The Equal Protection Clause limits governmental authority in domestic relations issues. The Equal Protection Clause limits governmental authority in domestic relations issues by applying different levels of scrutiny based on the nature of the discrimination. For example, statutes targeting quasi-suspect classes like gender or illegitimacy are subject to intermediate scrutiny, where the statute is presumed invalid unless it is substantially related to a sufficiently important governmental interest. The Supreme Court applies different levels of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause for statutes targeting quasi-suspect classes like gender. Statutes must be substantially related to an important governmental interest to be upheld. Examples include Orr v. Orr, where alimony obligations on husbands were found unconstitutional, and Nguyen v. INS, where citizenship rules based on parent gender were upheld. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of closed records statutes regarding adult adoptees seeking information on their birth parents. Courts have consistently upheld these laws citing the privacy rights of birth parents and the state's interest in a functioning adoption system. Congressional authority is limited by the enumerated powers clause in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers specified general subject categories for federal action, such as war-making, defense, commerce, coinage, and the judicial system. Most family law questions are not covered by these enumerated powers, so federal legislation in this area is typically tied to other federal interests. For example, states have primary authority over adoption, but federal legislation may be based on immigration or Indian affairs. States retain general authority over child welfare. The federal government can regulate child pornography that moves in interstate or foreign commerce or is shipped through the mail. Congress can supersede state action, defer to state judgments, or legislate in between. Former spouses' entitlements to pensions under federal retirement programs vary depending on the program. The federal government can regulate child pornography that moves in interstate or foreign commerce or is shipped through the mail. Congress can supersede state action, defer to state judgments, or legislate in between. Former spouses' entitlements to pensions under federal retirement programs vary depending on the program. States are authorized to treat civil service and military retirement payments the same way they treat other pensions. Acts governing foreign service and Central Intelligence Agency pension division allow for a pro rata division formula based on marriage/service length, with deviations possible by court order or mutual agreement. States have the freedom to interpret federal statutes as they see fit, subject to constitutional considerations, until Congress clarifies its intent. The State of California argued in McCarty v. McCarty that its courts had the authority to grant a divorced wife a share of her husband's military pension, but the Supreme Court disagreed citing congressional power over federal salaries and benefits. Congress has the authority to regulate military pensions under Article I, Section 8, Clause 14 of the Constitution. The McCarty court recognized the plight of ex-spouses of retired service members and invited Congress to legislatively change the situation. Congress then enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, allowing states to divide pensions according to state laws. Congress generally defers to state judgments in divorce cases involving federal employee pensions, with only the Foreign Service Act and CIA Retirement Act suggesting division formulas. The Social Security Program, Foreign Service Act, and CIA Retirement Act offer division formulas for pensions of former spouses. Former spouses of annuitants with ten or more years of service can receive 50% of the pension at age 62 if not remarried. Voluntary division of annuities was possible with mutual agreement. Certain former spouses are entitled to survivor annuities from various government agencies. Service annuitants are entitled to survivor annuities. Federal payments, including wages, pensions, and tax refunds, can be garnished for alimony and child support. Congress uses its taxing power to establish social policies, such as promoting marriage neutrality through tax provisions like the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Tax deductions for child care expenses under the Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 reflect congressional acknowledgment of the need for both parents to work or support the family. Divorcing couples have various tax options that can impact post-divorce finances, with alimony being deductible and taxable while child support is not taxable. Tax laws reference adoption and treat adopted children the same as natural born children. The Bankruptcy Code can impact family lives, prohibiting discharge of alimony and child support payments. Other provisions may affect timing of bankruptcy petitions in relation to divorce filings. Indian tribes have extensive power to regulate domestic relations among tribal members, with federal recognition of Indian custom marriage for inheritance purposes. State and federal courts generally recognize Indian custom marriage and divorce for all other purposes, and tribal law governs property relations of husband and wife, or parent and child. Some tribes defer to state authority for marriages and divorces, with federal law allowing states to have jurisdiction over civil cases involving Indians in Indian country with tribal consent. This authority includes marriage, divorce, and adoption, as recognized under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 372a. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) aims to protect the best interests of Indian children and promote the stability of Indian tribes and families. It establishes federal standards for the removal and placement of Indian children, with tribes retaining jurisdiction over custody proceedings. Indian adoptees are entitled to receive information about their background upon turning 18. Upon reaching age 18, Indian adoptees can access information about their birth parents' tribal affiliation to protect their tribal rights. The only federal statute addressing adoption record confidentiality uses indirect methods when Congress lacks direct authority in domestic relations. These methods include the Commerce Clause, funding nexus, Uniform State laws, \"Sense of Congress\" resolutions, and the Full, Faith & Credit Clause. Congress is authorized by Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution to regulate commerce among states. Congress can regulate interstate aspects of certain family law matters, such as locating non-custodial parents who fail to pay child support or have abducted their children, using the Commerce Clause and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980. The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) addresses parental kidnapping cases and interstate flight to avoid prosecution. Extradition treaties may be used for felony cases, and the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction helps in locating and returning abducted children. In 1992, Congress passed the Child Support Recovery Act (CSRA) to address interstate child support obligations. Appellate courts have upheld the CSRA as a constitutional exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. The court concluded that Congress has the authority to intervene and help states in matters beyond their limited territorial jurisdiction. Congress can use the Commerce Clause to prevent the frustration of obligations related to interstate economic activity. The public child welfare system is responsible for protecting children when families are unable to do so, with states primarily administering services and policy while the federal government provides funds with conditions attached. The federal government provides funds to states for child welfare programs, authorized by Congress's spending power. States can choose to accept or reject the funds, but if accepted, they must adhere to the conditions imposed by Congress. Most funds for child welfare come through the Social Security Act, including capped grants for services and entitlement funding for foster care and adoption assistance. The Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) authorizes grants to states for child protective services systems, imposing detailed requirements on state participants. This includes mandating reporting of child abuse, investigation by authorities, provision of services to endangered children, immunity for good-faith reporters, confidentiality of records, cooperation between agencies, and other measures to prevent and treat child abuse. The Federal Child Support Enforcement Program (CSE) provides various services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, child support orders, support payment collection, and medical support enforcement. All states and territories operate CSE programs and receive federal matching funds. The program aims to assist in identifying, preventing, and treating child abuse and neglect cases. State requirements for child support services include automated registries of support orders and a centralized collection unit. Applicants must cooperate in establishing paternity or obtaining support payments, facing penalties for noncompliance. Non-cooperation can result in a 25% benefit reduction or removal from the program. Collection methods include income withholding, intercepts of tax refunds, liens, and reporting to credit bureaus. Civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and non-support laws are in place. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for non-custodial parents who fail to financially support their children. The Personal Responsibility and Work Reconciliation Act of 1996 required states to implement procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. The law required states to withhold licenses of individuals who owe child support or fail to comply with legal orders. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws promotes uniformity in state laws and has drafted acts related to child support enforcement and custody recognition across states. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) was adopted by all states due to Congress's welfare reform in 1996. It allows state courts to enforce child support orders from other states as if they were entered in their own state. UIFSA provides rules for establishing, enforcing, and modifying interstate child support orders. UIFSA implements the \"one-order system,\" where only one state's order governs an obligor's support obligation. It governs jurisdiction for interstate child support proceedings, while custody proceedings are governed by the UCCJA or UCCJEA and the PKPA. Forwarding a UIFSA proceeding to a state without custody jurisdiction does not subject the petitioner to custody claims. The court hearing a UIFSA proceeding cannot link support payment to visitation compliance. Despite the UCCJA's adoption, states often assert jurisdiction to modify custody decrees, hindering national recognition. Non-custodial parents may seek modification in another state, leading to new decrees. The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 (PKPA) addresses the issue of conflicting custody decrees between states, preventing frustration and expenses for parents. It clarifies jurisdiction for modifying child support and custody orders in interstate disputes, but does not apply to instate disputes. The PKPA supersedes conflicting state laws in jurisdictional guidelines for custody, visitation, and support. Uniform acts like UIFSA, UCCJA, UCCJEA focus on enforcement rather than specifying court order content. Domestic relations laws, even when specific, result in varied outcomes due to unique case facts, granting wide discretion to judges. Courts have wide discretion in domestic relations cases, making it hard to predict outcomes. Appeals are challenging based on \"abuse of discretion\" grounds. Uniform laws like UIFSA, UCCJEA, and UCCJA aim to bring consistency in interstate child support and custody orders. Congress uses \"Sense of the Congress\" resolutions for desired results. \"Sense of the Congress\" resolutions lack legal binding force but aim to encourage states to adopt certain policies. For example, H.Con.Res. 67 advocated for grandparents' rights to visit their grandchildren after divorce or death of parents. Some states have enacted specific grandparent visitation laws as a result. Grandparent visitation laws vary by state, with some states allowing visitation in cases of divorce, annulment, or separation. A few states permit visitation even over parental objections, while most states do not enforce grandparent visitation if both parents are fit and object. The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution addresses the recognition of laws across states. The Full Faith and Credit Clause ensures interstate recognition of final judgments, including child custody and support orders. While rarely used for marriages, courts typically recognize out-of-state marriages. Courts recognize out-of-state marriages without reference to the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Marriages are seen as civil contracts created by the States, with duties and benefits attached. The general rule is to look at the law of the place where the marriage was celebrated for validation. Many states recognize marriages validly contracted elsewhere. Several states have adopted laws similar to the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act, recognizing out-of-state marriages that were valid at the time of the contract. However, some states have passed legislation prohibiting recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) also prohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriages and allows states to refuse recognition of such marriages. The Full Faith & Credit clause applies to divorces, as seen in the Supreme Court cases Williams I and Williams II. In Williams I and Williams II, the Supreme Court clarified the Full Faith and Credit Clause's application in divorce cases. The cases involved couples obtaining divorces in Nevada, then facing prosecution in North Carolina for bigamous cohabitation. Nevada's assumption of the parties' domiciliary status justified the divorce's validity and recognition. In Williams II, the Court ruled that a divorce decree from one state could be challenged in another if the issuing court lacked jurisdiction. The couple's return to North Carolina after their Nevada divorce led the North Carolina court to declare the divorce void due to lack of jurisdiction. This rule, modified by Sherrer v. Sherrer, states that a spouse cannot later contest a divorce for lack of jurisdiction if they participated in the proceeding and the court ruled on it. The divorce court ruled it had jurisdiction, allowing for bilateral divorce where both parties participate or consent. Uniform divorce laws and shorter residency requirements decrease the need for seeking favorable jurisdictions. Challenges may arise with foreign divorce decrees, as the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not apply to them. The rule of comity governs the recognition of foreign divorce judgments in the United States. New York is the only state that recognizes bilateral foreign divorces, even if its own jurisdictional requirements are not met. No state recognizes unilateral foreign divorces. Congress has the authority to require national recognition of divorce decrees under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, but has not done so yet. The Full Faith and Credit Clause allows for national recognition of divorce decrees, but Congress has not exercised this authority yet. Senator Pat McCarran introduced bills to require all states to recognize divorce decrees meeting specific criteria. The Full Faith and Credit Clause allows for national recognition of divorce decrees meeting certain criteria, but Congress has taken minimal action in enforcing this. Senator Pat McCarran introduced bills in 1952 and 1953 to require states to recognize divorce decrees, but they did not become law. Only five times has Congress passed legislation to mandate states to give full faith and credit to specific acts, records, and proceedings. The Full Faith and Credit Clause requires states to recognize certain acts, records, and proceedings. This includes child custody decrees and child support orders from other states. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act of 1994 mandates states to enforce child support orders issued by the child's home state. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act of 1994 ensures that child support orders from one state are recognized and enforced in another state. The law allows for modification of the order under certain circumstances, prohibits retroactive changes, and requires states to recognize domestic violence protection orders issued by sister states. The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act of 1994 extends protection orders to all states, requiring them to give full faith and credit to child custody, child support, and protection orders from other states. Congress also passed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, which differs in critical aspects from the previous act. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) allows sister states to ignore laws from other states regarding same-sex marriage. Congress enacted DOMA to address concerns that the legalization of same-sex marriage in one state would impact various laws and policies nationwide. Between 1917 and 2001, there were 33 proposed constitutional amendments and 12 bills introduced to give Congress authority over marriage and divorce laws. Senator Arthur Caper sponsored most of these proposals, all aiming for uniform laws nationwide. Since 1917, there have been numerous proposed amendments and bills to grant Congress authority over marriage and divorce laws, but none have been enacted. Legislation in the 107th Congress aimed to define marriage as between a man and a woman. While Congress lacks direct authority in domestic relations without a constitutional amendment, it has impacted family law through indirect means like the commerce clause and appropriations powers. There is currently little support for a national marriage and divorce law imposed by Congress on states. Federal involvement in family law is likely to continue in areas where resources can be used more efficiently than at the state level, such as tracking parental kidnappers. The spending power can influence state approaches, with higher funding levels increasing state compliance. While family law cases require individualized approaches, state domestic relations laws are becoming more uniform. National uniformity in family law may increase even without federal intervention. National uniformity in family law may increase even without federal intervention, as states retain primary authority in this area."
