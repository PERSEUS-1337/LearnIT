ELECTION OF POOLING METHOD OF DETERMINING FOREIGN TAX CREDIT IN CERTAIN CASES.\" is about the election of a pooling method for determining foreign tax credit in specific cases. The text chunk discusses an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding a special rule for domestic corporations acquiring 80 percent of a foreign corporation before December 31, 1986. It involves the determination of post-1986 undistributed earnings and foreign income taxes of the acquired foreign corporation. The text chunk discusses the election allowed for domestic corporations acquiring 80 percent of a foreign corporation before December 31, 1986. The election involves determining the accumulated earnings and profits, foreign income taxes paid, and making the election by the due date for filing the tax return. The election for domestic corporations acquiring 80 percent of a foreign corporation before December 31, 1986, involves meeting ownership requirements and making an irrevocable election by the tax return due date. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. A domestic corporation may make the election allowed under section 902(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code within 120 days of the date of enactment if certain conditions exist for the taxable year. The period of limitations for assessment, collection, and filing a claim for refund under the Internal Revenue Code must not have expired. Additionally, if there is a pending petition to the Tax Court regarding the proper amount of tax due, a final decision has not been made yet. The proper amount of tax due for the taxable year is the subject of a civil action for refund before a Federal district or the Federal Court of Claims, and a final decision has not yet been made."
