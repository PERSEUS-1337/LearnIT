The Executive Compensation Tax Reform Act of 2002 regulates loans from employers to employees for purchasing a principal residence in connection with work. Section 7872 applies to excessive loans, with rules for determining below-market loans. If subsection (a)(1) applies to a loan made by an employer to an applicable employee, the employer is treated as having made a supplemental wage payment to the employee equal to the principal amount of the loan. Repayments by the employee reduce the amount treated as compensation for tax purposes. The reduction in repayment amount under section 7872 shall not exceed the compensation amount for tax purposes and can be carried over to future years. An \"applicable employee\" includes officers, directors, or 5-percent owners of the employer at the time the loan is made.

The amendments in Sec. 7872A apply to employment loans made to executives, with effective dates for loans made after enactment and refinancings of loans made before that date. Additionally, certain sales of company stock by corporate insiders are subject to excise tax on golden parachute payments under SEC. 4.

The term 'corporate insider' refers to an individual subject to section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A 'transfer-restricted 401(k) plan' is a qualified cash or deferred arrangement where participants cannot freely sell employer stock held in their account. This subsection applies to such plans.

INCLUSION IN INCOME OF CERTAIN DEFERRED AMOUNTS OF INSIDERS OF CORPORATIONS WHICH EXPATRIATE TO AVOID UNITED STATES INCOME TAX. This section adds a new provision regarding unrealized gain on stock options of insiders of corporations that expatriate to avoid US income tax. In the case of a corporate insider of an expatriate corporation, their gross income for the taxable year when the corporation becomes expatriate includes the net unrealized built-in gain on options to acquire stock. Definitions include 'corporate insider' as per Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 'expatriate corporation'. The term 'expatriate corporation' refers to the acquiring corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction where a nominally foreign corporation acquires substantially all properties. In a corporate expatriation transaction, if more than 80 percent of the acquiring corporation's stock is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation, certain ownership requirements apply. In some cases, the ownership requirement may be lowered to 50 percent for nominally foreign corporations. In a corporate expatriation transaction, a foreign corporation is considered as such if it lacks substantial business activities in the foreign country where it is created, and its stock is publicly traded in the US. This definition also includes partnership transactions. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' refers to a transaction where a nominally foreign corporation acquires properties of a domestic partnership, with more than 80 percent of the acquiring corporation's stock held by former partners of the partnership. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a foreign corporation acquiring assets of a domestic partnership, with over 80% of the acquiring corporation's stock owned by former partners of the partnership. Special rules apply to treat related transactions as one transaction. The term 'nominally foreign corporation' refers to a corporation that would be considered foreign if not for certain conditions. Net realized built-in gain pertains to the amount that would be taxable if stock options were exercised. The expanded affiliated group excludes stock held by members of the acquiring corporation. The term 'expanded affiliated group' refers to an affiliated group without considering certain sections. The amendments in this section apply to corporate expatriation transactions completed after the enactment of this Act and taxable years ending after that date."
