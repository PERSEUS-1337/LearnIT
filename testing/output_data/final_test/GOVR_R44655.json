    "content": "The 114th Congress debated gun control proposals after two mass shootings in 2015 and 2016. The shooters were possibly influenced by radical Islamic views. One shooter had been watch-listed as a suspected terrorist but was removed before buying a firearm. Debate focused on giving the Attorney General authority to deny firearms to \"dangerous terrorists,\" expanding background check requirements, and providing grants to authorities. The 114th Congress debated gun control proposals after mass shootings in 2015 and 2016, with a focus on background checks and denying firearms to \"dangerous terrorists.\" Congress did not pass these proposals but included provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act related to mental incompetency determinations and firearms transfer eligibility. The report provides background on federal gun control laws, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968. The VA has been providing records on beneficiaries deemed \"mentally incompetent\" to the FBI for firearms background checks since 1998. This determination also classifies them as \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the Gun Control Act. The VA is required to notify beneficiaries of these determinations under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The VA is required to notify beneficiaries of mental incompetency determinations and potential loss of gun rights. The 21st Century Cures Act codified VA procedures related to this issue. President Obama called for a \"No Fly, No Buy\" act after the San Bernardino shooting. Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced a bill to prevent individuals posing a risk of air piracy or terrorism from possessing firearms. The proposal aimed to prevent individuals on terrorist watchlists from transferring firearms, but it was not introduced in Congress. The Department of Justice started screening individuals against terrorist watchlists for firearms background checks after 9/11. The \"Terror Gap\" proposal, introduced by Senator Lautenberg and Representative King, aimed to authorize the Attorney General to deny firearms transfers to individuals deemed \"dangerous terrorists.\" Senator Feinstein reintroduced the proposal in the 114th Congress, and it was debated in the Senate as an amendment to the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. Notably, the proposal did not mention specific terrorist watchlists maintained by the federal government. The \"Terror Gap\" proposal, along with related amendments, did not call for a blanket prohibition on all individuals on terrorist watchlists from obtaining firearms. Instead, it allowed for a terrorist watchlist check during background checks, potentially leading to a determination of a \"dangerous terrorist\" by the Attorney General. Senator Cornyn proposed judicial review of such determinations, while Senators Manchin and Toomey aimed to amend the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to involve state and local authorities in firearms regulation. The Manchin-Toomey amendment aimed to expand federal firearms background check requirements to cover private, intrastate transfers between non-gun dealers in public forums. Senator Grassley's amendment included provisions to improve background checks but did not expand requirements. The Grassley amendment proposed increasing penalties for certain violations of the Gun Control Act and modifying mandatory sentencing provisions. Efforts to bring gun control proposals to the floor for debate were unsuccessful in both the Senate and House of Representatives. After the Orlando mass shooting in 2016, Democrats pushed for gun control legislation, but faced opposition. In the House, Representative John Lewis and other Democrats tried to bring gun control legislation for consideration, but were unsuccessful. In the Senate, Senator Murphy's amendment to expand federal background check requirements was rejected on procedural grounds. The Senate rejected the Manchin-Toomey amendment and a procedural motion on an amendment by Senator Grassley. Several other amendments were considered, all related to denying firearms to individuals deemed dangerous terrorists by the Attorney General, but none would have banned gun possession based solely on being on the \"No Fly\" list. The Senate rejected multiple amendments related to denying firearms to individuals deemed dangerous terrorists by the Attorney General, including the \"Collins compromise.\" Despite a failed motion to recommit the bill with the compromise language, it was unlikely to successfully amend the bill. House Democrats occupied the House floor before the July 4, 2016, recess to push for gun control votes. Speaker Paul Ryan expressed partial support for addressing the issue. In response to efforts to address gun control legislation, Speaker Paul Ryan supported bringing counterterrorism legislation to the House floor, while House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy proposed the \"Terror Gap\" bill (H.R. 5611) with provisions for firearms and terrorist watchlist screening. However, Democrats' attempts to amend the bill with gun control-related amendments led to a breakdown in bringing the bill before the Committee on Rules. Legislative action in the 114th Congress was focused on providing an FY2016 appropriation until December 2015. During the 114th Congress, legislative action focused on providing an FY2016 appropriation for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The House passed amendments to prevent certain gun control measures, but they were not included in the final appropriations bill. For FY2017, the Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed a bill to provide ATF with $1.259 billion. During the 114th Congress, legislative action focused on providing funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The Senate proposed a bill (S. 2837) with $1.259 billion for ATF, while the House Committee reported a bill (H.R. 5393) with $1.258 billion. The Administration requested increased funding for \"gun safety,\" most of which was included in the bills. However, Congress did not provide $10 million for gun violence research. Congress has prohibited the CDC from advocating or promoting gun control since FY1997, extending this limitation to the Department of Health and Human Services in subsequent fiscal years. President Obama signed a Continuing Appropriations Act in 2016, extending gun control limitations. The debate between gun control advocates and gun rights advocates remains divisive in the US. Gun control advocates believe that firearms contribute to violence, especially in cases of intimate partner attacks, gang violence, and suicides. Gun control supporters argue that the high level of gun violence in the United States is disproportionate compared to other industrialized nations. They believe that progressive gun control laws have successfully reduced crime and other forms of gun violence. On the other hand, gun rights supporters see firearms as a necessary means of self-defense against criminals and during times of civil unrest. Gun rights supporters believe that firearms possession by law-abiding Americans can deter crime and view armed self-defense as a natural right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. They see guns as essential for individual freedom, security, and as a means to prevent oppressive governments. Gun rights views have been reinforced by Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Second Amendment as guaranteeing citizens the right to possess firearms. The Second Amendment guarantees law-abiding citizens the right to possess a handgun for self-defense. Federal laws like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act regulate firearms commerce, with states having varying levels of restrictions. The ATF enforces federal laws related to firearms and issues licenses to firearms-related businesses. The ATF issues licenses to firearms manufacturers, dealers, and collectors, monitoring their compliance with federal and state laws. They maintain a distributed system of firearms transfer records for tracing firearm origins. ATF agents assist in criminal investigations and make technical judgments on firearms. The National Firearms Act (NFA) regulates firearms, including weapons designed to expel projectiles by explosive action. It excludes antique firearms and aims to control dangerous and unusual firearms like machine guns and short-barreled shotguns. There are over 300 million firearms in the US available for private possession. The National Firearms Act (NFA) regulates firearms, including machine guns and short-barreled shotguns. It taxes and regulates the manufacture and distribution of such weapons, requiring registration with the Attorney General. Machine guns have been banned from private possession since 1986, except for those legally owned and registered before that date. As of November 2007, there were approximately 182,600 machine guns available for transfer to civilians in the United States based on the ATF-maintained National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record (NFRTR). A machine gun is defined as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. To deal in NFA firearms, a person must be a federally licensed gun dealer under the Gun Control Act. To deal in NFA firearms, a person must be a federally licensed gun dealer (FFL) under the Gun Control Act of 1968 and a special occupational taxpayer (SOT) under the NFA. NFA firearms, also known as Class III weapons, are subject to a $200 manufacturing tax and a $200 transfer tax for each transfer. Transfers require ATF approval and a tax stamp on the transfer document. Private individuals can acquire NFA firearms through approved transfers to another person or an FFL. ATF approval is required to transfer NFA firearms within the same state or to an FFL in another state. It is illegal to possess an unregistered NFA firearm, punishable by fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of the firearm. The purpose of federal firearms regulation is to aid law enforcement in reducing crime and violence without burdening law-abiding citizens. The Gun Control Act (GCA) aims to regulate firearms commerce without burdening law-abiding citizens. It requires federal licensing for those in the firearms business, prohibits certain sales, sets age and criminal record restrictions, and mandates record-keeping for gun sales. The Gun Control Act requires federal licensing for those in the firearms business, known as federal firearms licensees (FFLs), who engage in the regular trade of firearms for profit. Conducting business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit is a key factor in determining if someone is considered a firearms dealer under federal law. Under current law, federal firearms licensees (FFLs) are required to verify the eligibility of unlicensed persons through background checks before transferring firearms to them. Unlicensed individuals are generally prohibited from engaging in interstate firearms transactions, while FFLs can conduct interstate transfers among themselves without background checks. Licensees may transfer long guns to unlicensed out-of-state residents face-to-face, but not handguns. No restrictions on interstate transfer of ammunition since 1986. A federal firearms license is required to manufacture or import ammunition. FFLs can do business at gun shows or events related to firearms. FFLs are required to submit multiple sales reports to the Attorney General for purchases of two or more handguns within five consecutive business days. They must maintain records on all acquisitions and dispositions of firearms and respond to ATF agents requesting firearms tracing information within 24 hours. ATF agents may inspect their business premises, inventory, and gun records without search warrants under certain circumstances. Unlicensed persons are generally prohibited from acquiring firearms from out-of-state sources, except for long guns acquired from FFLs at gun shows held in the state where the FFL's licensed premises are located. Unlicensed persons are prohibited from transferring firearms to non-residents. Internet-initiated transfers are subject to federal laws. FFLs cannot transfer long guns to under 18 or handguns to under 21. It is illegal for unlicensed persons to transfer handguns to under 18. Possession of handguns by under 18 is also illegal, with exceptions for certain activities. Under current law, there are nine classes of persons prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition, including convicted felons, fugitives, drug users, mentally ill individuals, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced citizens, individuals under restraining orders, and those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. Persons prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition include those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. The Attorney General can consider petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore eligibility for firearms transfer and possession. Funding restrictions have limited this process since FY1993. The Attorney General can consider petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility for those prohibited from possessing firearms. Funding restrictions have limited this process since FY1993. ATF regulates the U.S. firearms industry to prevent the diversion of firearms from legal to illegal channels. Congress provided other avenues of relief for individuals \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. ATF's relationships with the firearms industry and gun-owning community have caused tension and congressional oversight. Special Agents and Investigators can inspect FFL inventory and records without warrants in specific scenarios related to criminal investigations or record-keeping compliance. The ATF uses firearms transfer records maintained by FFLs to trace guns and uncover illegal activities like gun trafficking. The GCA is aimed at combating gun trafficking, especially interstate trafficking. ATF's strategy focuses on preventing convicted felons and drug traffickers from obtaining firearms. The ATF aims to reduce firearms trafficking and violent crime by preventing convicted felons, drug traffickers, and juvenile gang members from acquiring firearms through various illegal activities. These activities include straw purchasing, trafficking by corrupt licensed dealers, trafficking by unlicensed dealers, trafficking in stolen firearms, and trafficking of secondhand firearms from private venues. Almost all illegal firearms used criminally in the US were diverted from legal channels. ATF combats firearms-related crime through industry regulation and criminal investigation, with a focus on preventing \"straw purchases.\" \"Straw purchases involve an individual posing as the buyer to acquire a firearm for someone else, violating the Gun Control Act. The purchaser must fill out an ATF Form 4473 and provide identification. Making false statements during a firearms transfer is a federal offense under the GCA.\" Making false statements during a firearms transfer is a federal offense punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment. It is also illegal to make false statements regarding records that FFLs are required to maintain, with violations punishable by up to five years of imprisonment. Straw purchases can be difficult to detect as the true intent is only revealed during a subsequent transfer to the actual buyer, who may be prohibited from owning firearms. The straw purchaser may be involved in illegal firearm transactions, either with a prohibited person or to avoid a paper trail. Violations of federal laws can lead to up to 10 years of imprisonment for both the straw purchaser and the prohibited person. Individuals can buy multiple firearms and give them away as gifts, as long as the recipients are not prohibited or underage. They can also buy and sell firearms as long as it is not their primary source of income, without needing a federal license. No background checks are required for intrastate firearms transfers. If a suspected straw purchaser is seen leaving a licensed gun dealer and immediately transferring the firearms to another person, there is reasonable suspicion. The actual buyer would only be guilty if they sponsored the straw purchase. Illegal arrangements are often revealed when the straw purchaser admits to buying the firearms for a non-prohibited person. The illegality may not be apparent until the actual buyer's true intentions are revealed, such as selling or smuggling the firearms across state or international borders. During illegal firearm transactions, suspicious behavior by straw purchasers, such as making multiple cash purchases of semiautomatic firearms from the same licensed gun dealer, can raise concerns. These actions prompted an ATF investigation, as dealers were wary of potential negative consequences if the firearms were traced back to them. Licensed gun dealers have the discretion to refuse sales if they suspect illicit activity. It is illegal for unlicensed individuals to transport or receive firearms into their state of residence from another state. Similarly, it is unlawful to deliver firearms to unlicensed individuals in a different state. Violations can result in fines and/or imprisonment. Smuggling firearms is also prohibited under U.S. law. The Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits the smuggling of firearms and other merchandise contrary to U.S. law, with violations punishable by fines and/or up to 10 years of imprisonment. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires background checks for unlicensed persons seeking firearms from federal licensees, excluding private transactions not engaged in the business. State laws may cover possession, registration, and licensing of firearms owners. The Brady Act included interim and permanent provisions for background checks on handgun acquisitions. The Brady Act requires background checks for unlicensed persons seeking firearms from federal licensees. The Act includes interim and permanent provisions for background checks on handgun acquisitions. The FBI activated the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to facilitate firearms-related checks. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established to conduct background checks on non-licensee applicants for handgun and long gun transfers. The system provides three outcomes: \"proceed,\" \"denied,\" or \"delayed,\" with a three-day waiting period for further investigation before a transfer can proceed. The FBI conducts background checks for most states, with a 90-day period for NICS adjudication. If a person is found to be prohibited, ATF is informed for firearms retrieval. Some states act as points of contact for background checks, where gun dealers contact a state agency, which then contacts the FBI. The FBI and state/local agencies conducted over 202 million NICS transactions from 1999-2014. FBI conducted 93.5 million transactions, while state/local authorities in POC states conducted 109.1 million. 93.5 million FBI transactions resulted in 1.17 million denials (1.2%). Some POC state background checks involved multiple transactions. FBI does not report total state/local firearms denials, but BJS collects and analyzes data on this annually. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) analyzes data on firearms-related background checks under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. BJS reported 74.1 million individual background checks from 109.1 million POC state NICS transactions, resulting in 1.34 million denials. Overall, 167.5 million firearms-related background checks were conducted from 1998 to 2014, with 2.5 million denials. FFLs are not informed of the reason for denials, but denied individuals can challenge the decision. Under the Brady background check process, a denied person can challenge the accuracy of the record. The denying agency must respond within five business days. False positives can occur, but the FBI has implemented measures to reduce them, such as the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF). The DOJ established the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) to help prospective firearms transferees with similar names to prohibited persons. The VAF allows individuals to authorize the FBI to keep their information to prevent future delays in transfers. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was passed after the Virginia Tech tragedy to encourage states to provide records to the Attorney General for background checks. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 incentivizes states to provide records to the Attorney General for background checks on individuals disqualified from acquiring firearms, including those with domestic violence convictions and mental health adjudications. The Act allows the Attorney General to offer grants, waive match requirements, or reduce law enforcement assistance grants based on states' compliance with bringing disqualifying records online. Additionally, the Act authorizes grants to improve electronic access to necessary records for NICS background checks, with the Attorney General required to report annually to Congress on federal compliance. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on federal compliance with the act's provisions. The grant program under the act is known as the \"NICS Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP).\" Appropriations documents refer to it as \"NICS improvement\" or the \"NICS initiative\" program. Section 103(e) authorizes appropriations for FY2009 through FY2013, with grants to be made in line with the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP). Additionally, 3% to 10% of each grant must be allocated for a relief from disabilities program for individuals adjudicated mentally defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows individuals adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution to petition for restoration of their gun rights. Grants are available to states for improving state court computer systems and criminal history dispositions, with a portion set aside for tribal governments. States must be certified by ATF to be eligible for grants. Additionally, states providing at least 90% of disqualifying records may be eligible for a waiver of the 10% match requirement under NCHIP. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows individuals with mental health issues to petition for restoration of gun rights. States must provide estimates of NICS-related disqualifying records to be eligible for grants. Some states did not provide sufficient estimates for the NCHIP 10% matching grant waiver, leading to potential reductions in Byrne JAG grants. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows individuals with mental health issues to petition for restoration of gun rights. States must provide estimates of NICS-related disqualifying records to be eligible for grants. The Attorney General could withhold up to 3% of JAG funding for states not meeting certain record percentages from 2011 to 2013, up to 4% from 2013 to 2018, and 5% after 2018. Congress continued to appropriate funding for these purposes in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 allows individuals with mental health issues to petition for restoration of gun rights. States must provide estimates of NICS-related disqualifying records to be eligible for grants. Congress appropriated funding for the NICS Initiative in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, with specific allocations for grants under P.L. 110-180. The House Committee on Appropriations directed grants under NCHIP authorities to focus on improving records added to NICS in FY2015. The Department of Justice prioritized funding under NARIP authorities to make all states NIAA compliant. Penalties would be applied to noncompliant states. The Senate did not address the reward and penalty provisions of P.L. 110-180 in their reports. The Senate debated gun control-related amendments in December 2015 and June 2016, including authorizing the Attorney General to deny firearms transfer to suspected terrorists and expanding background check requirements. Table 2 shows the amendments to two bills, H.R. 3762 and H.R. 2578. Discussions also included proposals to study \"mass violence\" and funding for ATF. President Obama called for legislation to prevent known or suspected terrorists on the \"No Fly\" list from acquiring guns after the San Bernardino shooting. The \"Terror Gap\" proposal was reintroduced in Congress, sparking similar calls for action after the Orlando nightclub shooting. Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government updated its terrorist screening procedures in 2004 by modifying NICS background check procedures to include terrorist watchlist queries. Information on NICS-generated matches is passed to the FBI Counterterrorism Division for verification. The U.S. government updated terrorist screening procedures post-9/11 by modifying NICS background checks to include terrorist watchlist queries. Questions arose regarding incorporating watchlist checks into background checks, maintaining firearm transfer records temporarily for counterterrorism investigations, and granting the Attorney General authority to deny transfers based on watchlist matches. Several legislative proposals have been introduced since the 109th Congress regarding the retention of firearms-related transfer records and prohibiting individuals on the terrorist watchlist from possessing firearms. Senator Feinstein proposed the Terror Gap bill as an amendment to the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, but it was rejected by the Senate. Senator Cornyn offered an alternative amendment requiring the Attorney General to file an emergency petition with a court for jurisdiction. The Attorney General must file an emergency petition with a court before prohibiting a firearms transfer to a \"dangerous terrorist.\" President Obama urged Congress to prevent those on the no-fly list from buying guns. Representative Thompson filed a discharge petition on H.R. 1076 with 173 signatures. Thompson also tried to amend the Red River Private Property Protection Act with the language of H.R. 1076, but the motion was ruled out of order. The chair ruled a motion out of order on H.R. 1076 as it was not relevant to the bill, with a vote of 246-182. Senator Murphy advocated for \"No Fly, No Buy\" and \"universal\" background check proposals. The Senate considered amendments related to firearms and explosives background checks during the FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Amendments included the No Guns for Terrorists Act and the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of 2016. In the Senate, amendments related to firearms and explosives background checks were considered, including the No Guns for Terrorists Act and the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of 2016. However, none of these amendments were passed, and H.R. 2578 was set aside by Senate leadership. In the House, Representative John Lewis led a 26-hour \"sit-in\" to push for gun control bills, but instead, counterterrorism bills were brought to the floor by Speaker Paul Ryan. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy introduced the Homeland Safety and Security Act (H.R. 5611) with provisions addressing gun background checks and terrorist watchlists, but the bill did not receive floor action. The Senate and House considered amendments related to firearms transfers to \"dangerous terrorists,\" with differing levels of redress and remedy. The Cornyn amendment proposed judicial review prior to denial, while the McCarthy bill required notification and judicial oversight at the time of denial. These proposals were part of discussions during consideration of a Health Care Reconciliation bill and FY2017 Department of Justice. The Senate considered amendments to expand federal background check requirements for private firearms transfers on December 3, 2015, and June 16, 2016. These amendments aimed to increase information sharing on individuals ineligible to possess firearms. Amendments included the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015, Protecting Communities and Preserving the Second Amendment Act of 2015, Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016, and Protection Communities and Preserving Act. The Senate considered amendments to expand federal background check requirements for private firearms transfers in response to the Newtown, CT mass shooting. The Administration supported expanding background checks following President Obama's plan to reduce gun violence. Intrastate transfers between unlicensed persons are not covered by federal recordkeeping or background check provisions, but may be regulated by state laws or local ordinances. Proponents of greater gun control see intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons as a loophole in the law, especially at gun shows. Congress amended the Gun Control Act in 1986 to allow FFLs to transfer firearms to unlicensed persons at in-state gun shows, and in 1994, the Brady Act required background checks for unlicensed persons buying from FFLs but not for intrastate transfers between unlicensed individuals. During Senate consideration of the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act (H.R. 3762) in December 2015, Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey proposed an amendment (S.Amdt. 2908) to require background checks on intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons, including those at gun shows or online listings. This was seen as a comprehensive background check proposal. In the House, Representatives Peter King and Mike Thompson introduced a similar measure. In the House, Representatives Peter King and Mike Thompson introduced the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 1217). The Manchin-Toomey amendment (S.Amdt. 2908) aimed to amend the Brady Act to authorize $100 million annually for NCHIP and require states to provide records on prohibited persons to the FBI or face JAG funding reductions. States failing to meet benchmarks would face reductions in JAG funding. The Manchin-Toomey amendment (S.Amdt. 2908) proposed reductions in JAG funding for states that failed to submit plans to provide records on prohibited persons. The amendment also aimed to reshape the NARIP program and authorize $100 million annually for FY2016-FY2019 for assessments, policies, and background checks. Senator Christopher Murphy offered an amendment (S.Amdt. 4750) to expand federal background check requirements for firearms sales, capturing private, intrastate transfers under a wider set of circumstances than the Manchin-Toomey amendment. The Murphy amendment, titled \"requiring a background check for every firearm sale,\" expands federal background check requirements for firearms sales, including private, intrastate transfers under specific circumstances. It mirrors the Fix Gun Checks Act introduced by Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Jackie Speier. Senator Grassley also proposed amendments to reshape the NARIP program. Senator Grassley proposed amendments to reshape the NARIP program by authorizing appropriations for mental health records exclusively and requiring states to provide prohibiting records to the FBI. The Manchin-Toomey, Grassley, and Murphy amendments aimed to address mental incompetency and firearms eligibility issues, but were blocked by the Senate. Congress later included a provision in an enacted bill regarding VA mental incompetency determination procedures. The Obama Administration also published related regulations. Opposition to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 centered around concerns about veterans with PTSD being affected. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD may have their gun rights revoked if found to be a danger, but PTSD alone is not a disqualifying factor for gun control. The Veterans' Medical Administration rarely submits disqualifying records to the FBI for inclusion in NICS, even for veterans involuntarily committed for posing a danger. The state, not the VA, may be responsible for reporting ineligibility to the FBI. Under the Gun Control Act (GCA), the state where a court resides would refer disqualifying records to the FBI. The Attorney General can consider petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility, but funding restrictions limit this process. Without P.L. 110-180, restoring firearms eligibility requires civil rights restoration, expunging criminal records, or receiving a pardon. Under P.L. 110-180, the VA must inform veterans and beneficiaries if a fiduciary is appointed on their behalf, leading to a loss of firearms eligibility. They can seek administrative relief to restore gun rights by demonstrating they no longer have a disqualifying condition. According to the BJS and FBI data, the VA referred the majority of mental defective files to the FBI. Some Members of Congress question why other federal agencies, like the Social Security Administration, refer very few such files. The VA refers firearms-related disqualifying records on veterans with fiduciaries to the FBI, which some Members of Congress view as unwarranted for those who served honorably. The VA policy of referring firearms-related disqualifying records on veterans with fiduciaries to the FBI is seen as enhancing public safety. Opposition to the policy decreased between 1998 and 2007, showing that veterans rarely sought firearms after being deemed mentally incompetent. The policy aims to protect veterans and others from potential harm if they were to acquire and misuse a firearm due to mental incompetency. The Manchin-Toomey amendment aimed to prevent the VA from sharing records of mentally incompetent veterans with the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index without certain notification and review conditions being met. It required the VA to notify beneficiaries of their mental incompetency determination, explain the implications on firearms eligibility, and provide the right to request a review by a board established by the VA or a court. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs was required to establish a review board within 180 days to assess the mental incompetency status of beneficiaries upon request. The Manchin-Toomey amendment aimed to establish a review process for mentally incompetent veterans to determine their firearms eligibility. A VA beneficiary could request a review from a board or court to assess their ability to safely possess firearms. Until this review process was complete, the individual would not be considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for firearms eligibility purposes, and the Secretary would not be allowed to make a NICS referral during this period. The Manchin-Toomey amendment required VA beneficiaries to request a review within 30 days to avoid being considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" The Secretary couldn't make a NICS referral until after this period. Additionally, beneficiaries already deemed mentally incompetent would receive notice of an opportunity for review and appeal within 90 days of enactment. The amendment required the Secretary to review and revise policies for determining mental incompetence among beneficiaries, ensuring those who voluntarily assign financial management to a fiduciary are not labeled as \"adjudicated mentally defective.\" Senator Manchin submitted a similar amendment in 2016, but it was not voted on. The Grassley amendments to H.R. 3762 and H.R. 2578 aimed to prevent the VA from sharing records of mentally incompetent veterans with the FBI for NICS without judicial approval. They also sought to change the terminology from \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to \"mentally incompetent\" in relevant laws. The Grassley amendments aimed to restrict the sharing of records of mentally incompetent veterans with the FBI for NICS without judicial approval. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan favored mental health reform over gun control legislation, emphasizing the importance of determining who should not have access to guns due to mental incapacities. The House considered the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 (H.R. 2646) sponsored by Representative Tim Murphy, which did not address mental incompetency and gun control directly. On the Senate side, the Mental Health Reform Act of 2015 (S. 1945) sponsored by Senator Bill Cassidy was a potential legislative vehicle. Senator Cornyn's Mental Health and Safe Communities Act of 2015 (S. 2002) could also be considered, including a provision amending the Gun Control Act of 1968. In December 2016, Congress included a provision in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) that codified elements of the VA's implementation of NIAA. Section 14017 of this act amended 38 U.S.C. with a new Section 5501A to prohibit the VA Secretary from making certain determinations of mental competency about VA benefits claimants, unless specific conditions are met. The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision that allows VA benefits claimants to present evidence from their healthcare providers and have counsel present during a hearing to contest a determination of mental incompetency by the VA. This provision was part of President Obama's plan to reduce gun violence by identifying potentially dangerous individuals who should not have access to firearms. The Social Security Administration (SSA) published draft rules addressing mental incompetency and firearms eligibility, stating that individuals adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to a mental institution are ineligible to possess firearms. The term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" includes those deemed a danger to themselves or others due to mental illness or incompetence. Individuals found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility are defined as committed to a mental institution involuntarily. The term \"mental institution\" includes various facilities for mental health diagnoses. The Department of Health and Human Services proposed a rule to address HIPAA Privacy Rule barriers for sharing mental health records with the FBI. ATF also proposed a rule to clarify the definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" to include various court findings related to mental illness. The ATF proposed a rule to clarify the definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" in criminal cases, including findings of mental illness by a court. The rule also addresses involuntary commitments for mental health treatment, excluding voluntary admissions or temporary observations. The Social Security Administration proposed a rule to identify individuals receiving Disability Insurance benefits who meet the definition of \"adjudicated mental defective.\" The VA has been making similar determinations since 1998 based on disability claims and mental impairments. The SSA published a final rule on December 19, 2016, with an effective date of January 18, 2017, regarding individuals with mental impairments receiving Disability Insurance benefits.
