    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Access to Affordable Health Care Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress makes findings regarding the lack of health insurance among Americans, with a focus on small firms facing higher costs and being less likely to offer coverage to their employees. The Employee Benefit Research Institute found that in 1998, 27.4% of private sector workers in firms with fewer than 10 employees received health insurance from their employers, compared to 66.5% in firms with 1,000 or more employees. The purpose of the Act is to provide tax incentives to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses, encouraging them to offer coverage and discouraging dropping coverage due to rising costs.
