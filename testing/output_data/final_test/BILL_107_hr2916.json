    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honoring the Passengers and Crew of United Flight 93 Act\". The Congress finds that on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 with the intention of using it as a weapon to crash into the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Several passengers on the flight learned about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon through phone conversations with their loved ones. United Airlines Flight 93 passengers and crew recognized the danger and planned to prevent the aircraft from being used as a weapon. They fought to regain control from terrorists, leading to the crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, saving lives in the Nation's Capital. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to United Airlines Flight 93 passengers and crew for their heroic actions in preventing the aircraft from being used as a weapon, ultimately leading to the crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The President is authorized to award posthumously a gold medal to the United Airlines Flight 93 crew members and passengers for their heroic actions in preventing the aircraft from being used as a weapon.
