It lists provisions set to expire between the report date and the end of the 114th Congress. Certain provisions are excluded if they are transitional, routine, or modified by congressional action. For example, changes in Medicare payment policy under the ACA are not considered expiring provisions. The ACA established a five-year Community Care Transitions Program under Medicare starting in 2011, funding eligible hospitals and community-based organizations for transition services. Medicare payment modifications are reviewed annually, but not all changes are considered expiring provisions. Services with statutorily required payment reductions do not require Congressional attention. The ACA established a five-year Community Care Transitions Program under Medicare in 2011, funding eligible hospitals and organizations for transition services for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions.

The program expires after December 31, 2015, but the Secretary can extend it if quality of care improves and Medicare spending decreases. Physicians are paid through a fee schedule, with additional bonuses for certain activities like quality achievements and electronic prescribing. The ACA established bonus payments for physicians practicing in underserved areas, with a 10% bonus on select evaluation and management and general surgery codes under the Medicare fee schedule for five years. This bonus applies to primary care service codes such as office visits, nursing facility visits, and home visits.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) clarified a policy requiring direct physician supervision for outpatient therapeutic services in hospital outpatient departments. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) and small rural hospitals raised concerns about the supervision requirements. CMS instructed Medicare contractors not to enforce the supervision requirements for therapeutic services in CAHs for CY2010 and CY2011. In response to concerns raised by CAHs and small rural hospitals, CMS extended nonenforcement of direct supervision policy for outpatient therapeutic services through CY2013. An independent review process was established in 2012 to advise CMS on supervision level changes. CY2013 was the final year for nonenforcement, as required by P.L. 113-198. The nonenforcement instruction for Medicare's direct supervision requirement for outpatient therapeutic services at CAHs and small rural hospitals was extended through CY2015.

The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, established by HIPAA in 1996, provides stable funding for Medicare program-integrity activities conducted by various agencies including the HHS Secretary, OIG, DOJ, and FBI. The annual amount necessary for HCFAC activities is determined jointly by the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General, with specific guidelines on fund transfers from the Hospital Insurance trust fund outlined by SSA. The HCFAC program, funded by various acts including HIPAA and ACA, provides stable funding for Medicare program-integrity activities conducted by CMS, OIG, DOJ, and FBI. Funding was established and appropriated through various acts, with annual adjustments for inflation and additional appropriations allocated until FY2020. Additional funding was also allocated through the HCERA in varying amounts in FY2011. The HCFAC program received $250 million allocated from FY2011 to FY2016. An additional $20 million authorized for FY2016 expires after September 30, 2016.

The requirement expired after December 31, 2014.
