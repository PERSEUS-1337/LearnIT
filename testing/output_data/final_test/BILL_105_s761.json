    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Compliance Act of 1997\". Congress finds that approximately 145,000 Federal employees have disabilities, making up 7.5% of the workforce. Despite the requirement in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for accessible technology, there is no enforcement mechanism, leading to uneven accessibility for employees. The Individuals With Disabilities Act of 1988 requires compliance with section 508 guidelines of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Technology-Related Assistance Act link to these guidelines is expected to expire in 1998. The Act aims to strengthen federal agency compliance with section 508 guidelines and require states to comply with them. Federal agencies must provide certification of compliance with electronic and information technology accessibility guidelines under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 508(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires each Federal agency to comply with established guidelines for electronic and information technology accessibility. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish certification procedures for agencies to submit compliance certifications annually by September 30. The head of each Federal agency must submit a certification to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by September 30 annually. The Director will review the certifications and notify agencies of their compliance status with established guidelines. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will assist and monitor Federal agencies not in compliance with established guidelines. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is amended to require states to comply with electronic and information technology accessibility guidelines. This includes providing assurances that states or recipients of funds will adhere to section 508(a) guidelines. The effective date for this amendment is 1 year after the enactment of the Act."
