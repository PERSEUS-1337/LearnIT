    "content": "The \"Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act\" establishes a database for non-dramatic musical works and sound recordings. The \"Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act\" establishes a database for nondramatic musical works and sound recordings, including information such as title, copyright registration date, and owner identification. The \"Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act\" requires the inclusion of specific information in a database for musical works and recordings, such as international codes, artist names, album titles, catalog numbers, and other relevant details. The database must be made publicly accessible without charge in a current technological format by the Register of Copyrights. The Register of Copyrights may update technical requirements for the database to ensure accessibility. Remedies for infringement of musical works without required information are limited to actual damages and injunctive relief. The limitation on remedies for infringement of musical works without required information only applies to specific entities such as establishments, food service establishments, terrestrial broadcast stations, and entities operating under certain statutory licenses. In an infringement action, the court must consider the infringer's reliance on information from the database when granting relief. The Register of Copyrights will establish technical requirements for a database under subsection (a) to ensure it is publicly available on a website hosted by the Copyright Office. The Register of Copyrights will establish a working group of technical experts to ensure the database is accessible, searchable, and exportable in various formats. The Register of Copyrights will establish a working group to identify and recommend performance objectives, technical capabilities, and standards for the database. The group will consist of individuals or organizations representing owners, licensors, users, licensees, consumers, and public interest entities. A report on their activities must be submitted to the Register of Copyrights within 9 months of the enactment of this section. The working group established by the Register of Copyrights will submit a report on their activities and recommendations, which will be made public for comment within 14 days. The Register of Copyrights may appoint an employee to assist the group and provide technical support. The initial meeting of the working group must occur within 90 days of the enactment of this section. The Register of Copyrights will review and update the technical capabilities of the database every 3 years, with public notice and comment required for any necessary revisions. A new item is added to the table of sections for chapter 7 of title 17, United States Code. The amendments for the \"711. Nondramatic musical works and sound recordings database\" will take effect 18 months after the enactment of this Act."
