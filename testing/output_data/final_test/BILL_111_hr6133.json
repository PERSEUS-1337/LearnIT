    "content": "The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" is introduced to amend the Truth in Lending Act by adding a new section, 129B, which focuses on prompt decisions regarding short sales. The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" requires servicers of residential mortgage loans to respond to a mortgagor's written request for a short sale within a 45-day period. The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" mandates that servicers must respond to a short sale request within 45 days. If no response is given, the request is considered approved. This does not apply to mortgages with pre-existing written agreements for short sale approval. The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" requires servicers of residential mortgage loans to make a decision on a short sale within 45 days. Definitions for \"residential mortgage loan\" are provided in the act. The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" defines key terms such as securitization vehicle, servicer, and short sale in relation to residential mortgage loans. The \"Prompt Decision for Qualification of Short Sale Act of 2010\" applies to written requests for short sales on residential properties where the proceeds are less than the remaining mortgage amount and require authorization from the securitization vehicle, investment holder, or servicer."
