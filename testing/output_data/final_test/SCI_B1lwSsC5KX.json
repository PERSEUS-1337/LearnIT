    "content": "Convolutional neural networks use strategies like data augmentation and drop-out to prevent over-fitting. This paper explores membership inference, detecting if an image was used during training. It introduces a method to infer membership even when top layers are not available, showing lower layers still contain training sample information. Experiments on Imagenet and YFCC-100M subsets with VGG and Resnet architectures support these findings. The widespread adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for recognition tasks was triggered by Krizhevsky et al. (2012). Various works have analyzed ConvNets from different perspectives, including DeconvNet for visualizing filter activations and strategies like weight decay, dropout, and data augmentation to prevent overfitting. However, the complex issue of overfitting and its relationship to optimization are still not fully understood. In this paper, the authors analyze the interplay of overfitting and memorization in high-capacity classification architectures, specifically focusing on the privacy issue of membership inference in ConvNets like ResNet-101 trained on Imagenet. They aim to determine if specific images were used to train a model to protect privacy and intellectual property. Previous works have shown a close relationship between overfitting and privacy of training images, highlighting the importance of addressing this issue. The text discusses how classifiers can determine if an image was used during training by exploiting dataset biases. It proposes a method to detect if a network has been trained on validation images, which is crucial for preventing competitors from artificially inflating accuracy scores. Additionally, a new membership inference setting is introduced that focuses on intermediary layers of a network, extending the inference to transferred and fine-tuned models. The text introduces a statistical test to detect dataset biases in trained convnets and identify if validation images were used during training. It also presents a membership inference test for intermediary layers of networks, extending to transferred and fine-tuned models.

It also presents a membership inference test for intermediary layers of networks, extending to transferred and fine-tuned models. The work focuses on distinguishing explicit from implicit memorization capabilities of neural network architectures. In MacKay (2002), a single-layer neural network can memorize random patterns. The sender transmits binary labels using the network's weights, and the receiver reconstructs the labels. The model's VC-dimension is d, allowing perfect fitting for n \u2264 d. MacKay shows that fitting is possible for n \u2264 2d, but almost impossible for n > 2d, with a capacity of 2 bits per parameter. The practical memorization capacity of ConvNets is challenging to determine. The practical memorization capacity of ConvNets is challenging to determine. Recent works evaluate how networks can fit random labels, showing they can perfectly fit them in simple cases like small datasets or Imagenet without data augmentation. This memorizing property is exploited in a privacy context to watermark networks. Random labeling and data augmentation have been used for training networks without annotated data. Other works explore learning indexes as an alternative to traditional structures like Bloom Filters or B-trees, with neural nets sometimes outperforming B-trees on real-world data. Recent works show that neural networks can outperform cache-optimized B-trees on real-world data, reminiscent of works on associative memories and distributed representations. The issue of implicit memorization and privacy risks in learning systems is highlighted, with concerns about releasing trained classifiers due to the potential extraction of valuable information. The privacy implications of machine learning systems, particularly in determining if an image or dataset was used for training, are discussed in relation to differential privacy. Guaranteeing privacy in learning systems requires good generalization to avoid overfitting. Recent works have addressed \"membership inference\" for images to determine if they were used for training, highlighting the connection between privacy and overfitting. Some training images are more vulnerable to privacy breaches, with strategies proposed to identify them. Privacy issues in generative models have also been analyzed. These works were evaluated on small datasets like CIFAR10, but our work aims to be closer to realistic conditions. The analysis of a pre-trained network will be referred to as an \"attack\" by an \"attacker\". The pre-trained network, known as \"attack,\" is used by an \"attacker\" to perform dataset bias and inference. Previous studies have shown that a simple classifier can accurately predict the dataset of an image. The paper proposes a dataset inference method based on a membership inference test. Various public image collections are used in the study, including Imnet1k with 1000 balanced classes, Imnet22k with 21783 unbalanced classes, and Yfcc100M with 99.2M photos. In this study, various public image collections are used, such as Imnet1k, Imnet22k, Yfcc100M, Tiny images BID18, and CIFAR10. The datasets have been sanitized to avoid duplicate images or overlapping images between the train and test sets. The goal is to assess set membership for a set of fresh samples using binary labels. Membership inference methods are discussed for groups of images and individual images. The first case assumes all elements belong to the same set, while the second case infers set membership independently for each element. Section 4 covers methods for groups of images without labels, considering setups with positive and negative samples or only positives. Section 5 focuses on individual images, where both the image and label are available. The general framework of the membership inference methods used in Section 5 is described, connecting with explicit datasets like Imnet1k, Imnet22k, Yfcc100M, Tiny images BID18, and CIFAR10. The goal is to assess set membership for fresh samples using binary labels. The text discusses membership inference methods for individual images in Section 5, focusing on predicting set membership based on image features and labels. The optimization problem involves learning a model that predicts membership from image features and labels, considering the difference in feature distributions between training and held-out sets. The challenge lies in the independence of set membership from image content, but it is dependent on image features. The text discusses membership inference methods for individual images, focusing on predicting set membership based on image features and labels. The optimization problem involves learning a model that predicts membership from image features, considering the difference in feature distributions between training and held-out sets. The model is trained to separate images based on their features, approximating the set membership function. This approach differs from random label fitting and bears similarity to GANs with key differences in optimization techniques. The text discusses membership inference methods for individual images, focusing on predicting set membership based on image features and labels. A mini-max optimization is used, with the discriminator trained to separate generated samples from \"true\" samples. Experiments vary the number of positive samples to measure model fitting accuracy. VGG-type architectures are tested on TinyImages, and VGG-16 and Resnet-101 on Imagenet. Data augmentation impacts model performance. The impact of data augmentation on model performance is observed in experiments using Imagenet architectures. Models trained on data-augmented images perform better than those trained on plain images. Fitting a data-augmented model is easier than fitting a higher number of samples. Data augmentation also affects membership inference models similarly. Experiments on Imagenet architectures show that models can fit a large number of samples with data augmentation. Detecting if a dataset was used to train a model is challenging, especially distinguishing datasets with similar statistics. Attacks are conducted using the softmax layer's maximal activation as features. This relates to the model's confidence and correct class probability. Membership inference of individual images has been studied in this context. The probability of the correct class is as good as the model's output in determining if an image was seen by the model. The confidence distribution of different sources varies, with Imnet1k-train showing high confidence. Two attack scenarios are considered on the model f \u03b8, comparing discriminating Imnet1k-train and Imnet1k-val to easier attacks on different sources. In the second scenario, samples with m = 1 are analyzed to check for distribution differences in the validation set. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance is used to compare confidence distributions and detect leakage. The attacker computes the K-S distance between samples and sets S 0 or S 1 to determine similarity. The K-S distance is used to compare samples and assign them to the closest source. Results show that with a small number of samples, image collections can be distinguished. Networks with higher capacity are easier to test. Publicly available validation set labels can reveal if part of the set was used for training. The proposed attack involves using a two-sample K-S test to detect leakage of validation set data in model training. The null hypothesis assumes the validation and test sets have the same distribution, with the K-S distance used to determine if this holds true. Experiments on Imagenet with Resnet-18 and VGG-16 were conducted to validate the approach. In experiments on Imagenet, Resnet-18 and VGG-16 were used with varying numbers of images per class in the validation set. The K-S test showed significant leakage detection with 10 images per class, while 5 or fewer images did not show leakage. This section addresses membership inference in trained models, where the attacker must determine if an image was used in training. The study extends traditional attacks to a new setup where upper layers are not available, providing baselines for VGG16 and Resnet models. The literature distinguishes two types of membership inference attacks: all-layers and final-output. A new setup, partiallayers, is designed for transfer learning, where only a certain number of bottom layers are available for attack. Three disjoint sources of data are assumed: a public set, a private set, and an evaluation set. The attacker has access to the lower layers of the model trained on the private set and the public set for the attack. The attacker uses the public set to retrain missing layers. Imnet1k is split into two halves for evaluation. Membership inference is tested by comparing predictions on private and evaluation sets. A simplistic attack predicts training set membership based on correct class prediction. The attacker proposes a heuristic based on loss value to determine training set membership, which is better than random guessing. The accuracy of the heuristic is proportional to the overfitting gap between training and held-out sets. The threshold for determining membership is estimated using samples or simulated by training models with known splits. In the partial-layers setting, a method is presented to attack networks by retraining missing layers using public data. The Bayes attack is applied on the retrained layers, showing similar performance to the MAT attack. This method outperforms a variant with shadow models. The VGG-16 BID13 and Resnet-101 architectures are experimented with, using specific training parameters and data augmentation techniques. The study evaluates the impact of data augmentation on network attacks, showing that stronger data augmentation reduces attack accuracy but still remains above 64%. Results of attacks in partial-layers setting demonstrate the ability to infer training set membership of an image, with performance influenced by the attack layer and data augmentation during training. The experiments show that neural networks can remember a large number of images and distinguish them from unseen ones, even with full data augmentation. However, determining if a single image was used during training is challenging with full data augmentation on a large dataset like Imagenet. The text discusses the effectiveness of data augmentation in preserving privacy and a method to detect training images without access to the last layers. It also references a previous study on authenticating humans based on image recognition capabilities. In this section, the text explains that the decision boundary induced by the K-S distance is equivalent to the MAT described earlier. The K-S attack differs from the MAT in that it considers confidence instead of loss value and computes the optimal threshold differently. The K-S distance attacks can be viewed as a generalization of membership inference. The text discusses the equivalence of the K-S rule to a threshold rule using cumulative distributions F and G. In this section, de-duplication processing is described for datasets used in memorization experiments to ensure reliable learning and evaluation. Images are compared using GIST, a hand-crafted descriptor, and the k-nearest neighbor graph is computed using Faiss. The histogram of distances for images in Imnet22k shows duplicates in the dataset, with exact duplicates being easily detected and removed beforehand. The de-duplication process for datasets involves setting a threshold of 0.001 to detect duplicate images, removing edges above this threshold in the k-nn graph, computing connected components, and keeping a single image per component. The largest nontrivial cluster in Imnet22k is an image of a flower appearing in 72 different synsets. In the de-duplication process, a threshold of 0.001 is set to detect duplicate images in datasets. The largest nontrivial cluster in Imnet22k is an image of a flower appearing in 72 different synsets. There is disagreement on the species of this flower and issues with annotations. Statistics in TAB2 show that Imnet22k has 10.4% duplicate images. Additionally, 930,757 images overlapping with Imnet1k were removed, indicating Imnet1k is not a subset of Imnet22k. Duplicates were found in Imnet1k and Tiny datasets, with 1% and 9.5% respectively, but only Tiny duplicates were removed, resulting in 71,726,550 unique images. Neural networks were trained to memorize a subset of images for classification purposes. The architecture functions like a discriminator in GANs, distinguishing between positive and negative images. ConvNets can overfit random labels but struggle with unseen images. TinyNet consists of 3 versions with varying parameters, designed for binary classification on 32x32 images. The models are tested on a subset of 15M images from Tiny dataset. Experimental setup involved using a subset of 15M images from Tiny dataset for binary classification. Positive and negative images were randomly sampled, with data augmentation techniques applied. The accuracy of the model was analyzed based on the number of positive images, showing a smooth drop in accuracy as the number of positives increased. Data augmentation was found to reduce the memorization capacity of the network. Data augmentation reduces network memorization capacity. The accuracy of a network trained on n images with flips is lower than on 2n images with no augmentation. Generalization capability of ConvNet helps capture common patterns in images and their symmetrics. Stronger augmentations like \"flip+crop\u00b11\" improve accuracy. Memorization experiments extended to VGG-16, ResNet-18, and ResNet-101 networks with Yfcc100M images. Larger networks have more parameters. Initial learning rate set at 10^-2. The experiments involved training VGG-16 and ResNet-101 with different data augmentations. VGG-16 has 11.7M parameters while ResNet-101 has 140M. The learning rate was adjusted based on training accuracy. Data augmentation increased the number of epochs needed to converge, with VGG-16 converging faster than ResNet-101. Memorization of a large number of images is possible but more challenging with data augmentation. The experiments involved training VGG-16 and ResNet-101 with different data augmentations, showing that memorization of a large number of images is possible but more challenging with data augmentation. The architectures of TinyNet1 to TinyNet3 include 3 to 4 convolutional layers, with the first layer being 5x5 and followed by Rectifier Linear Unit activation. The fully connected layer of TinyNet3 is larger than TinyNet2, and the filters of the first convolutional layer provide insight into how SGD optimizes the filters. The filters obtained after training a Resnet-18 on 10k images are noisy compared to Gabor filters. The network's large capacity leads to quick overfitting, resulting in uniform filters with more images. Shadow models were evaluated on a partial-layers setting by training 20 networks on a public dataset, each holding out a different subset of images. The study compared activations of different networks by aligning them using a regression model. Shadow models, trained on intermediate activations, underperformed compared to attack methods in predicting if an image was seen during training. The study compared activations of different networks using a regression model. The attacks in Section 5 were easier to train compared to shadow models using intermediate activations."
