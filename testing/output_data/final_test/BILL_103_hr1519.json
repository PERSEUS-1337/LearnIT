    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice in India Act\" and includes findings. The \"Justice in India Act\" finds that in Jammu and Kashmir and the Punjab, the Government of India detains thousands of persons each year under special or preventive detention laws without informing them of charges. Most detainees are political prisoners, held for months to over a year without contact with lawyers or family. They are detained under various acts including the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 allows for administrative detention without formal charge for up to 1 year for investigation of suspected terrorist or disruptive activities, violating Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This Act prevents detainees from being promptly brought before a judge or entitled to trial within a reasonable time. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 allows for secret court proceedings, witness identity protection, admission of confessions to police officers, and amends India's criminal code to increase the risk of torture. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987 shifts the burden of proof onto the accused, while the National Security Act of 1980 allows for detention without charge for up to 1 year to prevent actions against the state. Amendments to the National Security Act in 1980 permit 2 years of detention in Punjab, and India can detain individuals engaging in behavior prejudicial to its defense or foreign relations. The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978 allows India to detain individuals without trial for up to 1 year for various activities. The Armed Forces Special Powers Acts empower Indian security forces to conduct searches, arrests without warrant, and use lethal force with immunity from prosecution. Indian security forces are known to use torture, beatings, and threats to extract information from detainees. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act, National Security Act, Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, Armed Forces Special Powers Acts facilitate human rights abuses by allowing arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, and torture. These laws are incompatible with modern democracy principles. Reduction of development assistance for India unless certain laws repealed. The President must report to Congress within 60 days of this Act on whether India has repealed specified laws. If not, development assistance will be terminated except for certain projects, which can only resume if the laws are repealed. The Government of India has repealed special and preventive detention laws, including the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1987, the National Security Act of 1980, and others."
