Within 2 years, a study will be conducted on the operation of this rule and a report will be submitted to Congress on competition in the television marketplace. The Commission may prohibit ownership of multiple television stations in the same market to prevent concentration of control. Exceptions are made for UHF stations and UHF-VHF combinations.
