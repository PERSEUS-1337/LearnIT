    "content": "The Act titled \"Industrial Energy Efficiency Research and Development Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. The industrial sector accounted for 32% of energy use in 2006, more than residential, commercial, or transportation sectors. Key energy intensive industries include steel, chemicals, metal casting, and petroleum refining. Public-private partnerships have led to the development of energy-efficient technologies in these industries. Innovations in manufacturing processes lead to efficiency improvements in various economic sectors. Public-private partnerships have enhanced energy efficiency in manufacturing, but new technologies are needed for continual improvements. The US must innovate in energy efficiency and feedstock diversification to remain competitive globally. The Department of Energy should continue collaborative efforts. The Department of Energy should collaborate with the manufacturing sector to accelerate research on new processes for energy efficiency and diverse energy sources. These partnerships enhance research capabilities at universities and train future engineers in energy systems and industrial technologies. The Department of Energy collaborates with the manufacturing sector to accelerate research on energy efficiency and diverse energy sources. This partnership enhances research capabilities at universities and trains future engineers in energy systems and industrial technologies. SEC. 3. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program with energy-intensive industries, research collaborations, and higher education institutions to conduct energy and environmental research for improving energy efficiency and economic competitiveness in the industrial sector. The program aims to improve environmental performance through waste reduction, emissions reductions, and efficient water use. Research activities include developing technologies for feedstock recovery, utilizing alternative resources for manufacturing, and achieving energy efficiency in industries. The program focuses on research for energy efficiency in industries, including steam, power, control systems, and process heat technologies. Awards are given based on merit, and efforts are coordinated to avoid duplication. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on program activities annually. The program focuses on research for energy efficiency in industries, with a report to Congress annually. Activities include cooperation with energy-intensive industries, universities, and ongoing/new projects with anticipated energy savings. SEC. 4. UNIVERSITY-BASED INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT CENTERS. The Secretary will provide funding to university-based industrial research and assessment centers to optimize energy efficiency, promote emerging technologies in small and medium-sized manufacturers, develop alternative energy sources, coordinate with State research offices, and collaborate with technical training centers across the United States. Authorization of appropriations of $150,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013 to carry out the Act."
