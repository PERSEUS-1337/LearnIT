    "content": "The Orphan Works Act of 2006 may be cited as the ``Orphan Works Act of 2006''. Limitation on remedies in cases involving orphan works. The Orphan Works Act of 2006, also known as the \"Orphan Works Act of 2006,\" introduces a limitation on remedies in cases involving orphan works by amending Chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code. This new section imposes restrictions on remedies for copyright infringement if the infringer can prove a diligent search was conducted before using the work. The Orphan Works Act of 2006 limits remedies for copyright infringement if a diligent search was conducted to locate the owner of the infringed copyright. The infringing use must provide attribution to the author and owner of the copyright if known with a reasonable degree of certainty. The owner of an infringed copyright is defined as the legal or beneficial owner, or any party with authority to grant or license an exclusive right under section 106 applicable to the infringement. The Orphan Works Act of 2006 limits remedies for copyright infringement if a diligent search was conducted to locate the owner of the infringed copyright. A search is considered 'reasonably diligent' if it includes steps reasonable under the circumstances to locate the owner for permission to use the work. The lack of identifying information on the copyright does not make a search 'reasonably diligent'. The Register of Copyrights provides information to guide searches for copyrighted works, including industry guidelines and best practices, to assist users in conducting a reasonably diligent search. This may involve expert assistance and technology resources, even those with fees, to locate copyright owners for permission to use the work. The Register of Copyrights provides guidance on conducting a diligent search for copyright owners, including accessing relevant records, other sources of ownership information, methods for identification, technology tools, expert assistance, and best practices for documentation. The limitations on remedies for copyright infringement cases include restrictions on monetary relief, with exceptions for reasonable compensation for the use of the infringed work. The limitations on remedies for copyright infringement cases include restrictions on monetary relief, with exceptions for reasonable compensation for the use of the infringed work, such as ceasing infringement expeditiously after receiving notice of the claim. If the infringer fails to negotiate in good faith regarding compensation, the court may award full costs, including attorney's fees. The court may award injunctive relief to prevent infringing use, considering harm to the infringer if they have met certain requirements. Special rules apply for new works integrating the infringed work with original expression. The court may grant injunctive relief to prevent infringing use, but for new works incorporating the infringed work, the infringer can continue if they pay compensation and provide attribution to the copyright owner. The infringer can avoid being sued in Federal court for damages under section 501(b) if they comply with certain requirements, make a good faith compensation offer rejected by the copyright owner, and affirm in writing their willingness to pay reasonable compensation determined by the court. The infringer can avoid being sued in Federal court for damages under section 501(b) if they comply with certain requirements, make a good faith compensation offer rejected by the copyright owner, and affirm in writing their willingness to pay reasonable compensation determined by the court. In establishing reasonable compensation, the owner of the infringed copyright has the burden of proof. No action taken by an infringer shall waive any right or privilege protecting them from being sued in Federal court for damages. The infringer must establish the amount agreed upon by a reasonable buyer and seller before the infringement began. This section does not affect other rights or defenses to copyright infringement. The use of a work in accordance with this section does not limit the copyright protection for derivative works. The table of sections for chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item related to the infringed work. SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON AMENDMENTS. The Register of Copyrights will report to Congress on the effects of the amendments made by section 2 by December 12, 2014. SEC. 4. INQUIRY ON REMEDIES FOR SMALL COPYRIGHT CLAIMS. The Register of Copyrights will conduct an inquiry on remedies for small copyright claims, including alternatives to disputes in district courts. Interested persons can submit comments and participate in public roundtables. The Register will report to Congress on the effects of the amendments by December 12, 2014. The Register of Copyrights will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the enactment of this Act, including recommendations based on the inquiry conducted on remedies for small copyright claims."
