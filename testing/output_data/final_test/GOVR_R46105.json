    "content": "The report discusses twenty criminal law cases decided by the United States Supreme Court during its 2018 term. The cases covered sentencing issues, pretrial questions, congressional intent, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court relied on existing case law for capital punishment cases, including a decision in Flowers v. Mississippi regarding racially motivated misconduct during jury selection. The Supreme Court's 2018 term included cases on sentencing, pretrial issues, congressional intent, and ineffective assistance of counsel. Key decisions included barring execution of mentally deteriorating inmates (Madison v. Alabama), reaffirming standards for challenges to execution methods (Bucklew v. Precythe), and clarifying the exception to federal habeas relief for state inmates (Shoop v. Hill). The Court also addressed resubmission of intellectual-disability analysis by states (Moore v. Texas). In Bucklew v. Precythe, the Supreme Court found that the prosecutor in Flowers' sixth trial used peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. Flowers had been prosecuted six times for a crime involving the shooting deaths of a furniture store owner and three employees, with previous convictions overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct and discriminatory jury selection. The Supreme Court established a three-part test in Batson v. Kentucky to assess claims of racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by prosecutors. The Mississippi Supreme Court considered the prosecutor's challenges in Flowers' case to be race neutral based on valid reasons. The U.S. Supreme Court initially returned Flowers' case to the state courts for reconsideration in light of its decision in Foster v. Chatman. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in Flowers' case, citing multiple instances of racially discriminatory peremptory strikes by the prosecution. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in Flowers' case, citing racially discriminatory peremptory strikes against black prospective jurors. The State engaged in disparate questioning of black and white jurors and struck a black juror despite presenting race-neutral reasons. Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch had differing opinions on the case. The Eighth Amendment's implications on executing Madison with memory loss or dementia were also discussed. Madison's competency is questioned due to his dementia, not delusions. The Supreme Court's Ford and Panetti decisions are central to his case, which involves the issue of whether he can understand why the State wants to execute him. Madison murdered a police officer and was sentenced to death, but his deteriorating mental condition from strokes raises concerns about his execution. After Alabama scheduled Madison's execution, he petitioned for a stay citing his deteriorating mental health. The state court denied his request, leading him to seek federal habeas corpus relief. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that if Madison couldn't recall his crime, he couldn't grasp the reason for his execution. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that previous cases didn't establish incompetence based on memory loss. The Supreme Court emphasized that the critical question was whether Madison lacked the mental capacity to understand why the State wanted to execute him. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, dissented, arguing that the case should be resolved solely on specific grounds. In a case involving a death-row inmate's claim of intellectual disability, Gorsuch and Thomas objected to resolving the case solely on the basis for which certiorari was granted. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals erred in assessing and denying the inmate's claim. In previous cases, the Supreme Court ruled that executing an intellectually-disabled death row inmate is unconstitutional. In 2014, a Texas court found the inmate intellectually disabled and recommended he be declared ineligible for the death penalty. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals erred in assessing and denying the intellectually disabled death-row inmate's claim. Despite recommendations for declaring him ineligible for the death penalty, the court failed to apply the appropriate standards, leading to multiple reversals and remands by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decision on a death row inmate's eligibility for execution, citing instances of the lower court misapplying the standard for intellectual disability. The Supreme Court emphasized the criteria for determining intellectual disability and identified errors in the lower court's assessment, including overemphasizing the inmate's adaptive strengths and improved behavior in prison. The appeals court highlighted Moore's improved behavior in prison but cautioned against relying solely on adaptive strengths developed in that setting. They also noted Moore's history of academic failure and childhood abuse, which are considered risk factors for intellectual disability in the medical community. The court required Moore to show his adaptive deficits were not related to a personality disorder, but clinicians recognize that the presence of a personality disorder does not negate intellectual disability. The court directed state courts to consider specific factors when examining adaptive deficits. The Supreme Court criticized the use of factors from Ex parte Briseno in assessing intellectual disability, stating it could lead to the execution of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Chief Justice Roberts concurred in the decision, while Justice Alito argued for clearer instructions in the case. Federal courts cannot grant habeas relief based on Supreme Court precedent when the precedent is not clearly established. In 1986, an Ohio state court convicted Hill of kidnaping, raping, and murdering a 12-year old, sentencing him to death. Hill sought federal habeas relief, with the Sixth Circuit returning his case to state court in 2002 to address his claim of mental retardation preventing execution in light of Atkins. Despite state courts finding him competent for execution, Hill filed for federal habeas relief again, citing Moore I as \"clearly established\" Supreme Court precedent. The Sixth Circuit's reasoning in Moore I regarding Atkins as \"clearly established\" Supreme Court precedent was not convincing to the Supreme Court. The Court vacated the Sixth Circuit's decision, stating that a death-row inmate challenging the state's method of execution must demonstrate a risk of severe pain and a feasible alternative method to reduce that risk. The Court emphasized the need for a viable alternative method to the state's chosen execution method. Bucklew failed to provide evidence that an alternative method would reduce his risk of pain during execution. He sought to block his execution last minute, claiming a medical condition would make it cruel and unusual. The Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts' decisions. The Supreme Court established an Eighth Amendment standard for challenges to methods of execution, requiring a feasible alternative that significantly reduces the risk of severe pain. Justices Thomas and Scalia emphasized that a method must be deliberately designed to inflict pain to violate the Eighth Amendment. In Glossip v. Gross, the Court applied the same standard, requiring inmates to prove substantial and imminent risks and the availability of a known alternative method. In 2019, Justice Gorsuch rejected Bucklew's argument for a different standard in execution cases, stating that the Eighth Amendment always involves comparing levels of suffering. Bucklew failed to show a feasible alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce pain. The dissenters argued for exceptions to the standard set in Glossip. The Supreme Court's 2019 cases examined what constitutes a violent crime under three statutes: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (firearm-in-furtherance statute), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (general definition statute). These statutes have elements and residual clauses defining violent felonies and crimes of violence based on physical force or serious potential risk of injury. The Supreme Court's 2019 cases examined the definition of violent crimes under various statutes, including the ACCA, firearm-in-furtherance statute, and general definition statute. The ACCA mandates a 15-year prison sentence for individuals with three or more prior violent felony convictions. The Supreme Court examined the definition of violent crimes under the ACCA, which mandates a 15-year prison sentence for individuals with three or more prior violent felony convictions. The Court found that Taylor's state burglary conviction did not qualify as an ACCA predicate because it did not require proof of each element of the ACCA offense. The Supreme Court has ruled multiple clauses in different statutes as unconstitutionally vague, including the ACCA residual clause and Section 924(c)'s language. However, the Court has upheld penalties under the elements and specific offenses clauses of the ACCA in various cases. In Stokeling v. United States, United States v. Stitt, and Quarles v. United States, the Supreme Court found Section 924(c)'s residual clause to be constitutionally vague. In Davis, the Court addressed the vagueness issue by examining the facts underlying a conviction to determine the risk of injury. Davis was convicted under Section 924(c)'s residual clause for armed robberies, but the Fifth Circuit held it to be unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's decision on Section 924(c)'s residual clause, ruling it unconstitutionally vague. Justice Gorsuch explained that a case-specific approach was not feasible due to the clause's text, context, and history. The Supreme Court ruled Section 924(c)'s residual clause unconstitutionally vague, citing issues with a case-specific approach and the clause's history. Congress initially used the Section 16 definition for Section 924(c) before copying it into Section 924(c)(3). Justice Kavanaugh disagreed with the view that \u00c2\u00a7 16(b) required a categorical analysis, favoring a case-specific approach for Section 924(c). The Supreme Court clarified that under the ACCA's specific crimes clause, \"burglary\" includes unlawfully entering buildings or structures designed for overnight accommodations. This decision expanded on previous rulings regarding what constitutes burglary under the ACCA. Stitt, with multiple Tennessee aggravated burglary convictions, was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the Tennessee statute did not meet the ACCA generic burglary definition. Sims, whose case was linked with Stitt's, pleaded guilty to a felon-in-possession charge with two ACCA predicate drug convictions and two Arkansas residential burglary convictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that Sims's Arkansas residential burglary convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses. However, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned this decision, stating that the Arkansas statute did meet the ACCA generic burglary definition. In a recent appellate court decision, Justice Breyer highlighted that the ACCA generic burglary definition reflects Congress's understanding of state law at the time of enactment. The definition includes entry or remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime. Quarles was arrested in Grand Rapids, Michigan after assaulting his girlfriend and had prior convictions for third-degree home invasion. Quarles had prior convictions for third-degree home invasion and assault with a deadly weapon. He argued that his home invasion conviction should not count as an ACCA predicate offense because it did not align with the generic definition of burglary. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, stating that the generic definition includes \"remaining\" in a building with intent to commit a crime. In a unanimous decision, Justice Kavanaugh explained that the generic definition of burglary includes unlawfully remaining in a building continuously, not just at the moment of entry. The Court interpreted the term \"burglary\" in the Armed Career Criminal Act based on the ordinary understanding in 1986, state laws at that time, and Congress' recognition of the dangers of burglary. The Taylor Court interpreted generic burglary under \u00a7 924(e) to include remaining-in burglary, defining it as forming the intent to commit a crime while unlawfully present in a building. Stokeling's possession of a firearm during a burglary led to a challenge under the ACCA, where the Florida robbery statute was deemed a crime of violence. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eleventh Circuit's opinion that the broader Florida robbery statute qualifies as a crime of violence under the ACCA's element clause, which encompasses robbery offenses requiring the criminal to overcome the victim's resistance. The Supreme Court affirmed that the Florida robbery statute qualifies as an ACCA-predicate offense under the elements clause, as it requires the same degree of force as common-law robbery. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the Florida statute allows conviction based on minimal force, which the elements clause does not permit. The Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, binding the States. The Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause incorporates the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. Timbs used insurance policy proceeds to buy a Land Rover for his drug trafficking enterprise. The state trial court did not order confiscation of the vehicle, citing violation of the Excessive Fines Clause. The Indiana Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision on the Excessive Fines Clause, citing the need for authoritative decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, which was provided in Timbs v. Indiana. Justice Ginsburg traced the history of excessive fines protection and emphasized its importance in guarding against government abuse of punitive authority. The Excessive Fines Clause is considered fundamental to our system of ordered liberty and is incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch disagreed on the basis of incorporation, with the Supreme Court upholding the view that forfeitures with punitive intent constitute fines under the Eighth Amendment. The Court declined to revisit previous decisions on this matter. The Court in Haymond case found that a federal court violated the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee and the Fifth Amendment Due Process standard by imposing a mandatory term of imprisonment without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The case involved the federal supervised release statute and left it to the lower court to determine the appropriate remedy for the error. The court may revoke supervised release and re-imprison an individual for violating conditions, especially for sex offenders, for at least five years. In the case of Haymond, convicted of possessing child pornography, he was sentenced to 38 months in prison and 10 years of supervised release. Haymond's supervised release included conditions such as no further crimes, polygraph exams, and searches by his probation officer. Despite passing polygraph tests, child pornography was found on his cell phone. He argued it could have been placed there without his knowledge, but the court determined he knowingly possessed it, leading to a five-year prison sentence. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled the mandatory minimum sentencing violated constitutional amendments. The Supreme Court found that Subsection 3583(k) violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by allowing a judge, rather than a jury, to increase a defendant's prison term based on a preponderance of evidence. This decision was supported by Justices Gorsuch, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. The Supreme Court found that Subsection 3583(k) violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by allowing a judge to increase a defendant's prison term based on evidence, leading to a minimum of five years in prison for Mr. Haymond. Justice Breyer disagreed, stating that the punishment under \u00a73583(k) resembles a new crime rather than a continuation of punishment for the original offense. The Supreme Court found that Subsection 3583(k) violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 'not less than 5 years' for certain criminal offenses. The plurality agreed to remand the case to address whether revocation hearings should be conducted before a jury using the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Justice Alito dissented, arguing that a jury and \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" are not constitutionally required for supervisory release revocation proceedings. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether time served in state pretrial detention while on federal supervised release tolls the running of the term of federal supervised release. Mont began serving a five-year term of federal supervised release but was arrested on state charges and sentenced to six years in prison with credit for time served in state pretrial detention. Despite arguing that his supervised release had expired, the court revoked it. The court revoked Mont's supervised release and sentenced him to an additional 42 months in federal prison after his term had expired. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision based on precedent interpreting the law governing supervised release. The statute stated that supervised release does not run during imprisonment for a federal, state, or local crime unless the imprisonment is less than 30 consecutive days. The Supreme Court ruled that pretrial detention can toll the period of supervised release under Section 3624, with Justice Thomas explaining that imprisonment in connection with a conviction includes pretrial detention. He noted that supervised release is a form of conditional liberty but still constitutes punishment. The Supreme Court ruled that pretrial detention can toll the period of supervised release under Section 3624. Justice Thomas explained that imprisonment in connection with a conviction includes pretrial detention, stating it would be odd to satisfy both a new sentence of imprisonment and an old sentence of supervised release with the same pretrial detention period. Justice Sotomayor dissented, disagreeing with the notion that a person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction before any conviction has occurred. The Court examined federal statutes in two cases, clarifying requirements for convicting a foreign national possessing a firearm and validating Congress's authorization for the Attorney General. The Supreme Court ruled that conviction of an alien unlawfully present in the United States for unlawful firearms possession requires proof that the alien knew both that he was in possession of a firearm and that he was unlawfully present. Rehaif entered the US on a student visa but failed to maintain his immigration status. He purchased ammunition and practiced using firearms at a shooting range, leading to his conviction. Federal law prohibits individuals unlawfully present in the US from possessing firearms or ammunition that has crossed state lines. Rehaif was convicted for knowingly possessing a firearm without needing to prove he knew his immigration status. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed his conviction based on three elements: status, possession, and interstate commerce. The Supreme Court reversed Rehaif's conviction for possessing a firearm, stating that the government must prove both knowledge of possession and knowledge of belonging to a prohibited category. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of mens rea in criminal cases, highlighting congressional intent to require a culpable mental state for each statutory element. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of mens rea in criminal cases, stating that the presumption in favor of scienter does not apply to all elements of a crime, particularly jurisdictional elements. The Court typically does not apply the presumption in cases involving regulatory or public welfare programs with minor penalties. Public welfare offenses aim to protect the public from harmful products and devices, exposing individuals to criminal liability. The Court emphasized the importance of mens rea in criminal cases, stating that the presumption in favor of scienter does not apply to all elements of a crime. Regulatory statutes proscribe conduct that was innocent at common law and punish offenders relatively lightly. The firearms provisions in question do not fall under a regulatory or public welfare program and carry a potential penalty of 10 years in prison. On remand, the Eleventh Circuit will determine if the erroneous jury instruction was harmless error. Federal law prohibits firearm possession by convicted felons, fugitives, and drug addicts. The Supreme Court discussed disqualifying statuses for firearm possession, including convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and others. Justice Alito's dissent raised concerns about the scope of the opinion, emphasizing the importance of unlawful possession in combating gun violence. The Supreme Court decision will make it harder to convict certain individuals possessing firearms, including convicted felons, mentally ill persons, stalkers, harassers, domestic violence perpetrators, and illegal aliens. The decision also raises concerns about the registration requirements under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. The Supreme Court decision may lead to a reexamination of the issue in the future. Congress passed the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) in 2006 to create a registration system for qualifying offenses. Failure to comply with SORNA's requirements and traveling interstate can result in federal charges. An individual with a qualifying federal, tribal, or territorial sex offense conviction who fails to follow SORNA's registration requirements is guilty of a federal crime. Gundy, convicted of a state sex offense while on federal supervised release, did not register under SORNA during his time in state or federal custody. Gundy, convicted of a state sex offense while on federal supervised release, failed to register under SORNA during his time in state or federal custody. Federal authorities transferred him to a half-way house in New York and later charged him with interstate travel while failing to register as a sex offender. The district court initially dismissed the indictment, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decision. Gundy was eventually convicted on the failure to register charge after the Second Circuit rejected his arguments. The Court reviewed four questions regarding the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SORNA), focusing on the delegation of authority to the Attorney General. Justices did not agree on a rationale but a majority agreed on the result. The Supreme Court reviewed the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act, focusing on the delegation of authority to the Attorney General. Justices disagreed on the rationale, with Justice Kagan affirming the Second Circuit's decision while Justice Gorsuch dissented. Justice Kavanaugh did not participate in the case. The Justices interpreted the Court's earlier cases differently, with Justice Kagan pointing to the low bar set for delegation decisions. Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch disagreed on the delegation of authority in the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act. Kagan argued that the Act provided a more specific policy statement compared to previous delegations, while Gorsuch believed the Act left too much discretion to the Attorney General. Justice Gorsuch criticized the delegation of legislative-executive powers in the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act, stating that Congress cannot hand off the power to write criminal codes to the Attorney General. He emphasized the need for more demanding scrutiny in such cases. Additionally, the Supreme Court's recent term included decisions on double jeopardy and Fourth Amendment issues related to blood alcohol tests in drunk driving cases. The Supreme Court addressed double jeopardy in the case of Gamble, where a man was prosecuted by both state and federal authorities for the same firearm possession offense. The Court upheld the dual sovereignty doctrine, allowing for separate prosecutions by state and federal governments for the same crime. The Supreme Court upheld the dual sovereignty doctrine in the case of Gamble, allowing for separate state and federal prosecutions for the same offense. Justice Alito, in the majority opinion, emphasized that the Double Jeopardy Clause only prohibits prosecution by the same sovereign. Justices Ginsburg and Gorsuch dissented. In Mitchell, the Supreme Court ruled that a suspect's loss of consciousness after a drunk driving arrest qualifies for the exigent circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. This decision builds on previous cases like Schmerber v. California, where warrantless bodily intrusions were allowed in certain drunk driving cases. In 2013, the Court ruled that natural dissipation of alcohol in blood does not justify warrantless blood alcohol tests in drunk driving cases. Three years later, officers could conduct warrantless breath tests with probable cause but not warrantless blood tests. In Mitchell, officers arrested a suspect for drunk driving after he failed a breath test and became unconscious. They took him to a hospital for a blood test, leading to charges. The Supreme Court affirmed Mitchell's conviction for drunk driving based on the results of a blood test. Justice Alito highlighted the states' compelling interest in reliable testing methods to determine intoxication levels for highway safety. The Supreme Court affirmed Mitchell's conviction for drunk driving based on the results of a blood test, stating that when a breathalyzer test cannot be administered, a blood test is the only alternative. The court ruled that in cases where a driver is unconscious and needs to be taken to a hospital before a breath test can be conducted, a warrantless blood test is permissible to measure blood alcohol content without violating the Fourth Amendment. Justice Alito noted that the case should be sent back to Wisconsin courts for further evidence presentation. The Supreme Court affirmed Mitchell's conviction for drunk driving based on a blood test. Justice Thomas concurred, suggesting a per se rule for warrantless, probable cause tests. Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor argued for the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a warrant for blood draws in drunk driving cases. Justice Gorsuch dissented, citing the need for further development on the exigent circumstance exception. Section 1983 allows for legal action against those who violate rights under U.S. law. Section 1983 establishes a cause of action for deprivation of rights under color of law. The plaintiff must overcome hurdles including proving deprivation of a right, satisfying procedural requirements, and overcoming qualified immunity. Probable cause for arrest can preclude a Section 1983 claim for retaliatory arrest unless there is evidence of differential treatment based on protected speech. In a case involving an arrest at a sports festival in Alaska, the Court ruled on the issue. In a remote area of Alaska, Bartlett had a dispute with officers over his behavior, leading to his arrest. Charges were later dropped, and Bartlett sued the officers under Section 1983, alleging retaliatory arrest. The U.S. District Court initially dismissed the complaint, citing probable cause for the arrest. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision based on a previous ruling. The Ninth Circuit reversed the decision based on Ford v. City of Yakima, ruling that probable cause does not preclude a Section 1983 retaliatory arrest claim. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that Bartlett's retaliatory arrest claim fails as a matter of law due to probable cause for the arrest. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim may survive if similarly situated individuals were not arrested, triggering four individual opinions. Justice Thomas concurred in part, disagreeing with the majority's disparate-application exception, while Justice Gorsuch and Justice Ginsburg concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Gorsuch argued that the absence of probable cause is not an absolute requirement for such a claim. Justice Ginsburg questioned if the case was suitable for the majority's rule, while Justice Sotomayor argued that probable cause does not always defeat a Section 1983 First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim. The statute of limitations for a Section 1983 claim alleging falsification of evidence starts when criminal proceedings end in the plaintiff's favor. McDonough, a former commissioner, sued a special prosecutor under Section 1983 for denial of due process after being acquitted of forged absentee ballot charges. The U.S. District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim against the special prosecutor on the grounds of absolute prosecutorial immunity. The statute of limitations on McDonough's fabrication claim began when he became aware of the fabrication, not when he was acquitted. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to resolve the issue of when the statute of limitations starts for due process fabrication claims. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to resolve the issue of when the statute of limitations starts for due process fabrication claims. Justice Sotomayor explained that state law governs the length of the statute of limitations in Section 1983 cases, while federal law determines when it begins based on common-law principles. The Court ruled that common-law malicious prosecution is the most closely analogous tort to McDonough's fabrication claim. Justice Sotomayor highlighted the challenge to the integrity of criminal prosecutions involving groundless prosecution and fabricated evidence. The Second Circuit's approach to the statute of limitations could lead to parallel criminal and civil proceedings with inconsistent results. The Supreme Court criticized the Court of Appeals for defining the right to be free of excessive force at a high level of generality. Ametria Douglas shared an apartment with Maggie Emmons and her children. Police conducted a welfare check after a 911 call, but Emmons refused entry without a warrant. Officer Craig threw Emmons to the ground, leading to a lawsuit for unlawful search. The Supreme Court criticized the Court of Appeals for defining the right to be free of excessive force broadly. Marty Emmons sued Officer Craig and other officers for unlawful search, seizure, and excessive force. Officer Craig was granted summary judgment on the excessive force claim, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, stating that the right to be free of excessive force was clearly established. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision on the excessive force claim, emphasizing that the right to be free of excessive force must be closely analogous to the circumstances of the case at issue. The Court clarified that a clearly established right must have sufficiently definite contours for any reasonable official to recognize its violation. The Ninth Circuit should have determined if clearly established law prohibited the officers from stopping and taking down a man in this case. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Officer Craig was entitled to qualified immunity as no case precisely on point satisfied the Court's demand for specificity. Garza's failure to appeal, despite a client request, is presumptively prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel, even with an appeal waiver. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to effective assistance of counsel for the criminally accused. Appellate courts may overturn convictions if defense counsel's errors were serious enough to prejudice the defense. Prejudice is assumed when counsel's deficient performance deprives the defendant of an appeal. Garza's petition for relief was denied based on his waiver, but the Idaho Court of Appeals disagreed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case of Garza, focusing on the concepts of notice of appeal and waiver of appeal. Justice Sotomayor explained that filing a notice of appeal is a simple act that does not necessarily breach a plea agreement, as some appellate issues cannot be waived and matters within the waiver are only binding if the prosecution chooses to stand on its rights. Justice Sotomayor criticized Idaho's approach as inconsistent with precedent, emphasizing that a lawyer must follow a defendant's instructions to file an appeal. She argued that appeal waivers do not complicate the process and highlighted the importance of presuming prejudice when counsel's deficiency forfeits an appellate proceeding. Justice Sotomayor criticized Idaho's approach to appeal waivers, emphasizing the importance of following a defendant's instructions to file an appeal. She argued that counsel's deficiency in forfeiting an appellate proceeding should be presumed prejudicial. Garza was denied his right to appeal due to counsel's deficient performance."
