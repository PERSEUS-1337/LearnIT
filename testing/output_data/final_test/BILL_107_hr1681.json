    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voluntary Opportunities for Increasing Contributions to Education Act\" and introduces a credit for contributions benefiting elementary and secondary schools under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Voluntary Opportunities for Increasing Contributions to Education Act\" introduces a tax credit for qualified charitable contributions made by taxpayers, allowing a credit of 75% of the contributions, with a maximum credit of $500 for individuals ($1,000 for joint returns) and $100,000 for corporations. Qualified charitable contributions are defined as the amount deductible under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code for cash donations. The text discusses tax credits for cash contributions to school tuition organizations, school facility improvements, and computer technology for educational purposes. The term 'elementary and secondary school scholarship' refers to scholarships that allocate 90% of income to school scholarships for students eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch. The term 'school facility' excludes stadiums or athletic facilities. Special rules include no double benefit for deductions and limits on credits based on tax calculations. The text discusses the treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer for tax purposes and the option for a taxpayer to elect not to apply a certain section for a taxable year. The amendments made by this section provide a tax credit for contributions benefiting elementary and secondary schools, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
