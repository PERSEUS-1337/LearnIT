    "content": "The House rules favor decision making and the majority party, allowing for efficient procedures to reach a decision. Over the past 130 years, the House has reinforced its rules to support the majority and efficiency. Amendments have granted the chair discretion in voting procedures and increased transparency in proceedings. The House rules prioritize majority control and efficiency in decision-making processes. However, there have been concerns raised by members of both parties regarding the balance between efficiency and deliberation. Some practices, such as waivers of layover rules and closed special rules, have been criticized for potentially sacrificing too much deliberation for the sake of efficiency or electioneering. The report provides an analysis of House legislative rules and practices, committee organization, and procedures that could be changed in the 112th Congress. Ideas for changes originated from various sources, including bipartisan concerns and expert critiques. The first part discusses how rules changes can be made and their implications, the second part examines committee organization, and the third part looks at House floor procedures. The third part of the report analyzes House floor procedures and potential changes, focusing on considerations underlying these changes. The authors address various rules and practices that have been discussed in recent years, offering analysis and support to committees, Members, and staff on budget procedures, ethics, constitutional authorities, and other institutional issues. Changes to legislative procedures and committee organization in the House of Representatives can be achieved through different methods, including modifications in the opening-day rules resolution by the majority. The House adopts its rules on the day of convening of each Congress, often including changes in floor procedures, committee system, ethics rules, and budget process. The rules resolution is adopted with specific amendments from the preceding Congress and takes immediate effect. The House adopts rules on the day of each new Congress, with changes in procedures, committees, ethics, and budget. Rules changes are developed in the previous Congress, with input from Members and discussions in party caucuses. Simple resolutions may also be used to change rules, with standing orders detailing procedures. The House adopts rules at the start of each new Congress, including procedures, committees, ethics, and budget. Standing orders may also be adopted for non-rules matters, such as the daily time of the House's meeting. The Speaker announces policies on various matters, including privileges of the floor, bill introduction, and decorum in debate. The Speaker announces policies on various matters, including floor privileges, bill introduction, and decorum in debate, which may operationalize House rules or exercise discretion not covered by rules. These policies are not rules or standing orders and do not give rise to points of order. Rulings on points of order are made throughout a two-year Congress based on precedent and new rulings. The Speaker and other occupants of the chair respond to parliamentary inquiries concerning House rules, procedures, and precedents relevant to pending proceedings. Chairs' responses may inform precedent but cannot be appealed. Resolutions adopted by the House may deal with specific matters for the duration of the Congress in which they were adopted. Select committees have been created through such resolutions. The House can make temporary changes through resolutions, which may become permanent rules. Changes can also be made through statute or congressional rulemaking authority, often related to specific legislation or the committee system. Changes to the House, including the committee system, administration, and ethics, can be made through statute. The Rules Committee, House Administration Committee, and Appropriations Committee have special roles in the House, with the Rules Committee able to report resolutions changing House rules or establishing procedures for legislation. The House Administration Committee, known for its broad discretion in House administration, can make changes independently in areas like Members' spending and committee funding. The Appropriations Committee can also enact resolutions from the House Administration Committee into law through appropriations bills. Changes to the franking law are often made through appropriations bills and budget resolutions by the Budget Committee. The House adapted its rules in the 1970s to address nongermane subject matter in legislation from the Senate, allowing for effective agreement or disagreement on amendments. The House has changed its practice over time to waive points of order against conference reports, supplementing House rules with policies adopted by the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference. Party rules, developed before elections, include guidelines for the Speaker and committee service provisions. The House has changed its practice over time to waive points of order against conference reports, supplementing House rules with policies adopted by the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference. Party rules do not give rise to points of order in the House and are used to establish party positions on legislation. Different perspectives can be considered when analyzing House rules, such as the balance between deliberation and decision making, empowerment of leaders or groups, enforcement mechanisms, and the relationship between party rules and existing or new rules. The House and Senate process of passing a new law involves approval by both chambers and the President's signature or veto, which can be overridden by a two-thirds vote. Over the centuries, complexities have been added to the lawmaking process to ensure deliberation and decision-making balance. Congress remains politically responsive to citizen influence, with House rules prioritizing decision-making over deliberation. Members must be recognized by the chair before speaking in the House, subject to time limits. The House rules prioritize decision-making over deliberation, with members needing to be recognized by the chair before speaking subject to time limits. Changes to House rules can further restrict debate time, amendment procedures, and motions, allowing a majority to reach a decision on legislative outcomes within a limited time. For example, in the 104th Congress, the Republicans ensured the minority's right to make a motion to recommit with instructions, maintaining the rules' decision-making bias. The House rules prioritize decision-making over deliberation, with changes occasionally enhancing decision-making processes. For example, in the 104th Congress, a rules change allowed the majority leader to make a motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report after an appropriations bill had been read for amendment. This change did not increase the normal debate time on a motion to recommit with instructions beyond the 10 minutes in the earlier version of the rule. In 1979, the House adopted a rule to streamline the process of increasing the statutory limit on public debt by tying it to the approval of a budget resolution. This rule was later repealed in the 107th Congress. The House rules regarding the debt limit have been repealed and reinstated in different Congresses. In the 104th Congress, a rule was adopted to require a three-fifths vote for measures involving a federal income tax rate increase. Changes to House rules in the 1970s aimed to increase efficiency by reducing quorum calls and allowing for the postponing and clustering of roll-call votes. Members debated whether these changes would impact their time in the House chamber during debates. The House rules have evolved over time, with changes allowing for more efficient procedures like postponing and clustering roll-call votes. Quorum calls and roll-calls are now common interruptions during meetings. Rules changes also give the Speaker or House members control over decisions. The House rules have evolved over time to allow for more efficient procedures like postponing and clustering roll-call votes. Changes also give the Speaker or House members control over decisions, such as approving the Journal and resolving the House into the Committee of the Whole. Congress has used its rulemaking authority in drafting laws like the Unfunded Mandates Act, which requires unfunded mandates information in committee reports and limits consideration of measures with excessive costs. Special rules can waive these requirements, but the House may waive points of order by agreeing to a question of consideration. Rules changes may also promote the consideration of alternatives, such as the House rule on amendments. The House rule on amendments allows for an amendment, a substitute, and a perfecting amendment. Special rules in committee markups differ from the standing rule. Rule XIII requires committee reports to be available for three days before consideration. Rule XIII requires committee reports to include additional information such as roll-call votes in markups and committee members' views. While some rules are neutral, others tend to favor the majority or minority. This rule bestows privilege on special rules reported by the Rules Committee, favoring the majority due to the committee's organization. The Rules Committee, organized to favor the majority and majority leadership, has a two-to-one-plus-one ratio of majority to minority members appointed by the Speaker. Rule XII gives the Speaker discretion in making decisions related to the referral of measures without review. The Speaker has discretion in making decisions related to the referral of measures without review and may impose conditions deemed appropriate. Rules empower leaders other than the Speaker, such as the majority leader in Rule XXI. Questions of privilege in Rule IX favor the majority and minority leaders, allowing immediate consideration for their raised questions. The Speaker has discretion in making decisions related to the referral of measures without review and may impose conditions deemed appropriate. Rules empower leaders other than the Speaker, such as the majority leader in Rule XXI. Questions of privilege in Rule IX favor the majority and minority leaders, allowing immediate consideration for their raised questions. The Resident Commissioner may also raise a question of privileges, but it is privileged only at a time designated by the Speaker within two legislative days. The motion to recommit is the minority's motion, and some rules give a specific advantage to the minority. Amendments must be read, but this reading can be dispensed with by a provision in a special rule. In committee, reading can be dispensed with only by unanimous consent, allowing a determined minority to hold up a markup for hours. House rules outline processes for taking votes, considering measures, and raising questions of privilege. Rules may disallow, allow, or require actions to be taken, establishing conditions precedent. House rules establish conditions, consequences, and processes for actions such as referral of legislation, motion to discharge, call to order, authorization of majority leader, decision-making authority of the Speaker, and committee reporting requirements. House rules establish conditions, consequences, and processes for actions such as referral of legislation, motion to discharge, call to order, authorization of majority leader, decision-making authority of the Speaker, and committee reporting requirements. The rules allow for flexibility in processes, exceptions to certain requirements, motions with attached conditions, disallowance of certain motions, and delegation of responsibilities to specific entities or individuals. House rules establish conditions, consequences, and processes for actions such as referral of legislation, motion to discharge, call to order, authorization of majority leader, decision-making authority of the Speaker, and committee reporting requirements. The rules allow for flexibility in processes, exceptions to certain requirements, motions with attached conditions, disallowance of certain motions, and delegation of responsibilities to specific entities or individuals. The House may adopt special rules to provide for the consideration of specific bills and resolutions, which can circumvent or modify House rules. Through special rules, unanimous consent, or failure to make a point of order, the House can adapt, circumvent, or ignore House rules. Rules in the House of Representatives are difficult to enforce if Members wish to operate differently or if no objections are raised. Mechanisms in rules, like specific prohibitions or waiver processes, help ensure compliance. For example, Rule XIII prohibits the motion to recommit, important to the minority. The Unfunded Mandates Act requires certain information in committee reports and limits consideration of measures with excessive costs. The House of Representatives has rules in place to enforce compliance, including mechanisms like specific prohibitions and waiver processes. For example, Rule XIII requires a two-thirds vote to consider a special rule on the same day it is reported, bypassing the one-day layover rule. Members can make a point of order to allege a rule violation. Members of the House of Representatives can make a point of order to allege a rule violation, which can be appealed if necessary. The Speaker's determination on questions of privilege can also be appealed. Both the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference have additional policies that supplement House rules, such as guidelines for considering legislation under the suspension of the rules procedure. The Speaker's guidelines for considering legislation under the suspension of the rules procedure are not directives but are followed by the caucus and conference. Party decisions can influence House rules and may lead to changes in the rules package before it is proposed in the House. Both parties may choose to ignore certain House rules, such as the limit on serving on two committees. The House makes committee assignments by agreeing to committee assignment resolutions presented by the two parties. Members may be placed on three or more committees, with the House tacitly waiving its rule for those Members. Party rules also play a role in organizing committees and subcommittees, with Democratic Caucus rules enhancing subcommittees' responsibilities in the 1970s and 1980s. Discussions between party leaders and members may occur before major legislation is considered on the floor. The House rules and party rules govern the organization and procedures of House committees, including committee membership, jurisdiction, and leadership tenure. Party rules may supplement or circumvent House rules to accommodate the needs of the majority and minority parties. The House committees are organized and governed by House rules and party rules, with committee membership, jurisdiction, and leadership tenure being determined. The appointment of committee members is primarily a party function, with the majority party responsible for assigning members to committees. Members may seek appointment to committees that align with their constituency or seek more prestigious roles as they accrue seniority. Members gain expertise in issue areas handled by committees, with specialized knowledge seen as a hallmark of the House committee system. Waivers for additional assignments are granted on a case-by-case basis, leading to an increase in the average number of assignments for Members. Committee sizes have grown to accommodate requested assignments, and the majority party may adjust a committee's majority-minority ratio. The majority party has occasionally changed a committee's majority-minority ratio to alter its political makeup, leading to concerns about workload management, underrepresentation of minority-party Members, and an excess of committees. Some Members propose removing decisions on committee size and ratio from party caucuses and enforcing strict assignment limitations without waivers. Rotation of committee assignments has also been suggested. Some Members have proposed various changes to committee structures, including temporary assignments, rotating committee assignments or chairmanships, accommodating requests by Members for committee sizes, and abolishing select committees or standing committees with limited jurisdiction. Suggestions range from more reliance on subcommittees to fewer committees with broader jurisdiction. There are also proposals for House and Senate committees to align in jurisdiction. Some Members have proposed changes to committee structures, including temporary assignments, rotating chairmanships, accommodating requests for committee sizes, and abolishing select committees. Suggestions include aligning House and Senate committees in jurisdiction and clarifying committee jurisdictions in Rule X. Recommendations also involve codifying informal agreements and using specific statutory names in Rule X to reflect programmatic responsibilities. In drafting party rules for the next Congress, party members must consider achieving goals through party rules. In drafting party rules for the next Congress, members must consider achieving goals through party rules, including defining relationships, pathways to committee membership, and enforcement processes. Current caucus and conference rules address some of these questions but lack transparency. Unclear rules leave members ignorant of how they relate to leadership, the party, and the House. The House committee organization process is led by the majority party, which determines committee size and majority-minority ratio. The minority party has little influence in these decisions. Each party has a process for assigning members to committees and selecting leaders. Majority-party leaders establish committee size and majority-minority ratio for each new Congress. Minority-party leaders are consulted to some extent on these decisions. The House committee organization process is led by the majority party, determining committee size and majority-minority ratio. Some Members and experts criticize the large panels and excessive assignments, making it challenging to aggregate ideas into coherent legislative policy. There are debates on party ratios favoring the majority party, but some argue it allows each Member to lead panels and formulate policy in multiple areas. The House committee organization process, led by the majority party, determines committee size and majority-minority ratio. The size of committees was previously regulated by a House rule, but this was removed in 1974. Dr. George B. Galloway explained the evolution of committee sizes from the early 1900s to the late 1950s, highlighting the relationship between committee size, majority control, and Member assignments. The Legislative Reorganization Act led to the House having 11 major committees, with chairmen serving exclusively on one committee. The one-committee assignment rule allowed exceptions for certain committees, limiting members to serving on two committees. In the 83rd Congress, 18 Republicans were given second committee assignments to control all standing committees, breaking the one-committee assignment rule. By the 85th Congress, 118 Members had multiple committee assignments, including Education and Labor, Interior and Insular Affairs, Merchant Marine and Fisheries, Public Works, and Veterans' Affairs. In the 94th Congress, committee seats saw significant growth due to the addition of new standing committees and an increase in the size of existing ones. The Democratic Caucus aimed for committees to reflect their 2-to-1 House majority, resulting in changes to committee sizes and memberships to better align with the caucus's ideology. The Committee Reform Amendments of 1974 restructured committee memberships to align with caucus ideology. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 created the House and Senate Budget Committees. The House abolished the Internal Security Committee in 1975. By the 103rd Congress, committee seats had increased by over 16%, with the addition of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The increase in committee seats in the House was mainly due to larger standing committee sizes, with some committees being abolished and their jurisdiction transferred. The number of standing committee seats was reduced by over 12% in the 104th Congress. The creation of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Homeland Security contributed to the overall increase in committee seats. After controlling the House in the 110th and 111th Congresses, Democrats reduced committee sizes by nine seats compared to the Republican-controlled 109th Congress. Setting committee sizes in House rules and establishing uniform sizes could enhance deliberation opportunities during hearings and meetings. Reducing committee sizes and establishing fixed sizes could enhance deliberation opportunities during hearings and meetings, providing stability and predictability. However, this may also limit Members' participation in the legislative process and require adjustments in ratios between majority and minority parties. Flexibility in adjusting committee sizes is necessary to ensure majority-party control and accommodate changing policy issues. Adjustments in committee sizes and ratios are crucial to accommodate changing policy issues and members' requests for seats. This flexibility is necessary to prevent conflicts among party members and ensure majority-party control. Discussions on committee sizes and ratios typically occur after an election, with the goal of reflecting the majority party's dominance on committees. Individual committee ratios can be based on the proportion of majority and minority seats or other factors. The allocation of majority and minority committee seats in the House reflects proportions, with some committees having a larger majority. House rules may require committee membership to reflect the majority to minority ratio, ensuring a one-vote margin for the majority party. Alternatively, the House could increase the majority's seats on committees by establishing a 2-to-1-plus-1 ratio or awarding the majority an additional seat on exclusive committees. A tiered system could translate different majority sizes into related committee ratios. The allocation of majority and minority committee seats in the House reflects proportions, with some committees having a larger majority. House rules may require committee membership to reflect the majority to minority ratio, ensuring a one-vote margin for the majority party. A ratio on a specific committee might be arrived at to accommodate the assignment of Members perceived to benefit from a specific committee assignment. Party leaders may desire the flexibility to strategically place Members on certain committees, raising questions about unilateral assignments or consultation with party factions. The process of assigning committee seats in the House involves party committees recommending members for leadership roles. Transparency could be improved by allowing separate votes on individual assignments, rather than bundling them together in one resolution for approval by the full caucus. This system has traditionally been approved without much scrutiny. House approval of committee assignments has been pro forma, with limits on Members serving on two committees and four subcommittees. Some Members are assigned to just one committee, while others serve on more than two. Certain committees are considered exclusive, but exceptions exist, such as the Budget Committee. Some Members serve on a third or fourth committee, or a second standing committee despite being on an exclusive one. Additional assignments are made by parties. House Rules could be amended to reflect the reality of current committee assignments, such as allowing Members to serve on no more than two standing committees, with exceptions for certain committees like the Budget Committee or the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Parties may decide if a third or fourth assignment is allowed, potentially including service on term-limited panels in addition to two standing committees. Alternatively, both parties could enforce a one-Member, one-committee rule, with waivers for exceeding the two-committee limit being disallowed. House Rules could be amended to reflect the current committee assignments, allowing Members to serve on up to two standing committees with exceptions for certain committees. One approach discussed is enforcing a one-Member, one-committee rule with waivers disallowed for exceeding the two-committee limit. Other options include grouping committees into categories with assignment limits and exempting certain committees from the limit. The option discussed is to group committees into categories with assignment limits applicable to all Members. Alternatively, each Member could be limited to one committee and a fixed number of subcommittees. Term limits have been considered to address the assignment issue. One issue is the role of the party caucus and conference, and the party leader's role in nominating party colleagues for key committees. The House may consider implementing fixed tenure limits on committee service and leadership positions, with possible rotations of membership every 6 to 12 years for service and 4 to 8 years for leadership. This could involve one-third of a panel's members being rotated at a time, allowing for reassignment later on. Alternatively, Members could be allowed to nominate and choose their committee members without House approval, or the party caucus could determine all committee assignments without the party leader's involvement. Several options for rotating committee memberships have been suggested, including allowing Members to switch committees based on seniority, changing or swapping assignments voluntarily, taking temporary leaves of absence, or prohibiting such leaves. Rotating memberships could lead to oversight by Members not involved in program establishment, providing fresh perspectives, and allowing assignment panels more flexibility in aligning Members with anticipated policy goals. Rotating committee memberships could provide various benefits such as aligning Members with policy debates, reflecting House makeup, exposing committees to fresh perspectives, broadening knowledge base, and emphasizing expertise in choosing leaders. However, drawbacks include diminishing specialization, decreasing institutional memory, and making reorganization more challenging. Rotating committee memberships could lead to decreased institutional memory, increased reliance on staff, potential policy shifts, uncertainty for agencies and interest groups, and possible challenges in choosing committee leaders. This change may result in Members serving on less beneficial committees, impacting chances of reelection. Decreasing reliance on seniority for leadership selection could create issues if less experienced leaders are chosen. If term limits are not adopted by both chambers and parties, expertise may be at risk. Committee leadership selection is a topic of debate, with questions on whether party leaders or caucuses should have the final say. The process of choosing committee leaders and members is crucial, with considerations on seniority, caucus selection, and party leader involvement. The issue of equal treatment for all committees is also raised. The debate over committee leadership selection includes discussions on equal treatment for all committees, potential term limits for leaders, and the possibility of nomination panels selecting multiple individuals for leadership positions regardless of seniority or length of service. The debate over committee leadership selection includes discussions on potential term limits for leaders and the role and authority of subcommittees under House rules. The rules of House committees and subcommittees are subject to the direction of the parent committee. Questions have arisen regarding the interpretation of subcommittee authority when House rules do not explicitly apply. There have been intermittent attempts to clarify this relationship, with suggestions for another review to specify rules that apply specifically to subcommittees. The recommendation is to specify rules in House rules that apply specifically to subcommittees, including regular meeting days, public access to records, written reports on legislation, and inclusion of supplemental views. Additionally, committee rules could require all legislation to be referred to subcommittees and grant each subcommittee authority to mark up legislation. The House rules could be amended to allow specified panels to have six or seven subcommittees, reducing the need for a rules change each Congress. House rules could potentially be amended to allow specified panels to have six or seven subcommittees, reducing the need for a rules change each Congress. This change could mitigate the need for waivers of the rule each Congress and address the issue of members having too many committee assignments. Alternatively, House rules could reduce the permitted number of subcommittees instead of increasing them. The House rules may be amended to increase the number of subcommittees allowed per Member, currently limited to four. This change could address the issue of Members serving on more subcommittees than allowed, especially for those serving on multiple committees. An alternative approach could be to limit Members to a total of four subcommittees, regardless of the number of committees they serve on. The House rules may be amended to increase the number of subcommittees allowed per Member, currently limited to four. This change could address the issue of Members serving on more subcommittees than allowed, especially for those serving on multiple committees. Another option could be to prohibit a Member with a third committee assignment to serve on any subcommittee of the third committee in order to stay within the four-subcommittee limit. Committees have both legislative and oversight jurisdiction, with legislative jurisdiction generating the most conflict between committees. The jurisdictional structure of congressional committees is a critical issue, with concerns about duplication, overlap, and neglect of certain policy areas hindering policymaking. Task forces and non-legislative select committees exacerbate these problems, leading to turf battles and legislative gridlock. Suggestions for realigning committee jurisdictions include basing them on budget functions, federal agency organization, or federal programs to improve efficiency and balance committee importance. The congressional committee structure can be realigned by creating a system of numerous committees with narrow jurisdictions or a few committees with broad jurisdictions. The Senate's one-bill-one-committee referral system helps overcome jurisdictional issues, unlike the House. A larger number of committees could bring focus to individual committee work. Creating a system of numerous committees with narrow jurisdictions or a few committees with broad jurisdictions could help improve congressional committee work. Members serving on multiple committees with distinctive roles could enhance policymaking. Referral of measures to committees is primarily based on Rule X, with Rule XII addressing the process. Consideration could be given to eliminating or combining committees to streamline the system. The House rules on committee referrals changed in 1995 under the new Republican majority, requiring the Speaker to designate a primary committee for referral. Additional referrals could only be made sequentially. In the 108th Congress, the Speaker was allowed to refer a measure without a primary committee designation in extraordinary circumstances. The Speaker also had the authority to impose time limits on committee referrals. Several committees have jurisdictional agreements through memoranda of understanding (MOUs), which are considered binding. Committee jurisdiction has been changed multiple times in the past 15 years, with significant alterations in the 104th and 108th Congresses. Outside groups have recommended further jurisdictional reform, including the creation of new House committees and increased use of sequential referrals. Several committees in the 112th Congress will have new chairs and ranking members, with many subcommittee leaders also being new. House rules for the new Congress could potentially change to address perceived overlap or ambiguity among committees, affecting as few as two or as many as all committees. This could involve altering Rule X to better reflect the programs and agencies under committee jurisdiction. One possible change to House rules for the 112th Congress could involve altering Rule X to better reflect committee jurisdictions, potentially making referrals more consistent and transparent. This could help minimize conflicts among committees, even though past attempts at jurisdictional realignments have not been wholly successful. Another option could be to limit sequential referrals. One option to improve House rules for the 112th Congress is to limit sequential referrals by specifying sections or titles for additional committees to consider. Another option is to impose time limits on committees receiving referrals. One option to improve House rules for the 112th Congress is to limit sequential referrals by specifying sections or titles for additional committees to consider. Current procedures allow a time limit to be imposed by the Speaker, but do not require one. This could limit the power of a secondary committee to control the fate of legislation reported by a primary committee. House rules could be amended to clarify the intent of the current language or to specify committees or issues that might qualify for such a referral. Appointments to select and joint committees are at the discretion of the party leader, with little guidance in House or party rules. This unilateral authority allows leaders to reward supporters or like-minded individuals. Some committees have significant policy responsibilities and can continue for multiple Congresses. One suggestion is to involve the party assignment committee in confirming appointments, or allow individual Members to request committee assignments. The House rules could be changed to require approval from the entire party caucus or conference for select committee assignments. Resolutions creating select committees may need to be freestanding. Creating additional select committees allows Members to serve on panels addressing national issues. The House may consider creating select committees to allow Members to serve on panels without counting against assignment limitations and to promote interdisciplinary consideration of issues. Select committees with legislative authority have been effective in integrating policy split between multiple committees, with representation from committees of jurisdiction being key to their success. Changes to the House committee structure could be easily implemented. Some changes to the House committee structure could be made readily in preparing a rules package for the 112th Congress. Rule X, clause 5(a)(2)(A) currently limits service on the Budget Committee. The limitation was changed in the 96th Congress to relax the limitation. In the 101st Congress, a minority Member who had served for three terms was allowed to. In the 101st Congress, a minority Member who had served for three terms was allowed to serve an additional term as ranking minority member. In the 102nd Congress, the rule was amended to extend the waiver of the tenure restrictions for the ranking minority member. In the 103rd Congress, the provision related to the ranking minority member was stricken as obsolete. In the 104th Congress, the limitation was changed to four Congresses from three, in any period of six successive Congresses\u2014the current scheme. There was an exception for a Member who had served as chair or ranking minority member during a fourth Congress\u2014the Member could serve in either capacity during a fifth Congress, so long as that Member would not exceed two consecutive terms as chair or ranking minority member. The tenure limitation was suspended during the 106th Congress. In the 108th Congress, the tenure limitation for the chair and ranking minority member was replaced with a provision subjecting. The House Budget Committee's assignment limitation for Members has been relaxed to allow them to serve for up to eight years. There are suggestions to make the committee a permanent assignment, extend term limits, or limit the terms of Members serving on the committee. The House Budget Committee's assignment limitation for Members has been relaxed to allow them to serve for up to eight years. Suggestions include making the committee a permanent assignment, extending term limits, or limiting terms for Members serving on the committee. The Committee on House Administration serves a unique role in the House, with responsibilities related to internal operations and potential for expanded jurisdiction. Membership balance between majority and minority members is also considered. The committee's membership balance may be adjusted to have an equal number of majority and minority members. The jurisdiction of the committee includes issues like campaign finance. Concerns about overlapping jurisdictions with other committees persist, and revisiting recommendations from the 9/11 Commission is suggested. The House could consider adopting changes to Rule X to address these issues. The \"Legislative History to Accompany changes to Rule X\" inserted in the Congressional Record by then-Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier differentiated the Homeland Security Committee's jurisdiction from other standing committees. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also has limited jurisdiction, with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission related to the Intelligence Committee remaining unimplemented. Committees have unequal jurisdictions and workloads, with examples like the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means having extensive portfolios compared to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The jurisdictional portfolios of congressional committees vary, with some having broad responsibilities while others have more focused jurisdictions. Committees like Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means claim overlapping jurisdiction in areas such as health, while other committees like Veterans' Affairs have specific jurisdiction. The allocation of subject matter among committees raises questions about whether committees should have overlapping jurisdiction or more focused portfolios. The House could consider realigning committee jurisdictions to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Former Representative Robert H. Michel proposed changes to committee alignments based on factors like the economy, executive branch organization, and legislative goals. Jurisdictional questions do not have definitive answers but could lead to a different committee structure. Former Representative Robert H. Michel proposed realigning committee jurisdictions for efficiency. He suggested having committees chaired by the party opposite the President for oversight. Some experts want to abolish the Appropriations Committee and have authorizing committees propose appropriations. Others want unauthorized appropriations to stop. House Rules, particularly Rule XI, guide committees on conducting business and developing internal operating procedures. Questions arise about the need for more specificity in House and committee rules, especially regarding legislative responsibilities and inefficiencies in floor and committee procedures. Discussions include realigning committee jurisdictions for efficiency and proposals to have authorizing committees propose appropriations instead of the Appropriations Committee. Committee rules dictate the number of members required for various actions, such as two members for testimony, one-third for general business, and a majority for reporting a measure. There are debates about the fairness of the one-third rule. Some argue that the one-third rule for reporting a measure is unfair and should be changed to a majority quorum requirement. They believe that amending legislation is just as important and should have the same quorum status. Committee chairs often ignore the rule and conduct business with fewer members present. Defenders of the one-third rule say it helps with scheduling conflicts, while a majority quorum ensures integrity in the legislative process. There is also debate about the two-member quorum for hearings, which some believe discourages attendance. Some suggest changing the quorum requirement for committee business to ensure more attendance, possibly by requiring a majority of members present. Alternatively, the Senate's approach of allowing a single Senator to be present for testimony could be considered by the House. This change would need to be coordinated with limits on committee assignments and scheduling adjustments. The House committee chair is responsible for announcing hearings at least one week in advance. There are discussions on setting minimal standards for hearings before legislation markup. The minority party has limited input on the decision to hold hearings. The minority party's ability to request a hearing with witnesses of its choosing is limited. The chair has the authority to schedule such a hearing, considering factors like party control of the House, Senate, and White House. Questions arise about defining the minority in different control scenarios and whether the minority should have the power to schedule hearings. The House may consider using video conferencing for hearings to include more witnesses, reduce travel needs, and reach local audiences. Field hearings during district work periods could also be increased. Some argue that subcommittee markups are unnecessary and duplicative, causing delays and potential conflicts. Eliminating them could prevent disputes over conflicting recommendations and allow for easier compromise among committee members. Subcommittee markups may help committee members compromise or modify views before full committee markups. Subcommittee reports with minority views and analysis could aid full committee deliberations. Some argue subcommittee markups weed out unready measures, while others believe they enhance full committee deliberation by addressing major issues early on. The process of conducting markups for legislation in committees and subcommittees is governed by House rules and individual committee rules. The level of formality in a markup is typically determined by the controversy surrounding the measure being considered. The controversy surrounding the measure often overshadows discussions on its substance during markups in committees. Questions arise about the procedure, such as the need for advance amendments, inclusion of prefiling rules, and distribution of markup transcripts. House rules require committee reports to include markup vote information. Committees have inconsistent use of the Internet, with some providing a lot of information on their websites, webcasting proceedings, and archiving webcasts. It is challenging to access content from previous Congresses on committee websites. The House may need to establish rules for minimum website expectations or empower a committee to set these rules. New rules could address the content coverage on committee websites, such as posting committee rules and printed materials. New rules could require committee documents, calendars, activity reports, oversight plans, and proceedings to be available on committee websites. Archiving previous Congresses' committee websites could benefit committees, Members, and the public. The House could consider reinstating a rule to better schedule chamber sessions and committee meetings to minimize overlap. This rule could prohibit committee meetings during chamber sessions, after a designated time, or during proceedings under the five-minute rule. The House could divide the day so that committees meet in the mornings or early afternoons, and the House meets in the afternoons. The House could consider reinstating a rule to better schedule chamber sessions and committee meetings to minimize overlap. This rule could prohibit committee meetings during chamber sessions, after a designated time, or during proceedings under the five-minute rule. The House could divide the week for debates and votes on measures under the suspension of the rules procedure on Mondays, with committee meetings on Tuesdays and mornings of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and House meetings in the afternoons. Regular order in legislation development has been a concern in recent Congresses. Members from both parties have criticized deviations from regular order and leadership alternatives outside the committee process. The House rules place requirements on committees for oversight, hearings, meetings, and reporting legislation. The Speaker can set time limits on committee action. Committees have options for structuring the process of considering legislation. The House can bypass committees through a motion to suspend the rules, unanimous consent, or a special rule. In the 111th Congress, both Democratic and Republican Members emphasized the importance of \"regular order\" and \"transparency\" in the House's legislative process. This stemmed from critiques of Republican management during the 109th Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi introduced principles for regular order in legislation development, aiming for a more transparent and inclusive Congress. In the 111th Congress, there was a focus on regular order and transparency in the legislative process. Recommendations included bills being developed after full hearings and open markups, with members given time to review. Republican Leader John Boehner emphasized the need for chairmen to assume their bills will reach the floor and be subject to an open rule. Republican Whip Eric Cantor highlighted the importance of committee work in the legislative agenda. Eric Cantor emphasized the importance of committee work in the legislative agenda, suggesting that bills should be developed following full hearings to ensure transparency and effectiveness in the legislative process. Hearings are crucial for selecting legislative vehicles and allowing witnesses to comment on specific provisions, although they can sometimes be skipped or biased. Cantor's recommendation highlights the need for protected, regular time for committees to conduct their important business. Drafting legislative vehicles after hearings could lead to more widely supported legislation. This paradigm aims to enhance transparency, inform members and the public, understand different perspectives, separate facts from interpretation, encourage constructive participation, and garner public support for policy outcomes. The forum of hearings lays a foundation for decision-making and provides additional information for legislative proposals. Hearings are a mechanism for attaining legislative objectives responsibly and with public support, examining federal programs based on decision-making criteria such as cost-benefit, effectiveness, and national purpose. Phrases like \"the American people believe\" are often used in discussions, despite lack of unanimity in the electorate. Hearings are a mechanism developed by Congress to allow competing points of view to inform Members and the public on policy issues and legislative proposals. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of holding hearings on Capitol Hill are questioned, as few House rules require hearings. Rules could be changed to be specific and contain an enforcement mechanism, empowering subcommittees or committees to petition for hearings. Standing congressional committees have oversight and legislative authority limited by constitutional constraints and chamber rules. In overseeing committee activities, either chamber can direct committees to undertake specific tasks, with party conferences able to condition chairmanships on adherence to agendas. Coordination in large legislative purposes can be complex for leadership. Republican Leader Boehner emphasized transparency in committee proceedings, citing his experience at Education and Workforce where they provided at least three days notice on bills to allow for thorough examination. Democratic Leader Pelosi also highlighted the importance of regular order, allowing for sufficient time to review legislation. House rules require committees to establish regular meeting days and allow for additional or special meetings. Committees often hold meetings on short notice, with markups typically requiring 24 or 48 hours notice and hearings requiring at least a week's notice. Some committees have mechanisms to shorten notice for meetings or hearings, such as obtaining the ranking minority member's concurrence. House Rule XI, clause 2(g)(3) requires hearings to be held on less than a week's notice. House rules could be amended to specify notice periods for meetings and hearings, including new requirements for markups. Amendments in the nature of a substitute are common in markups, with changes to the underlying text varying in significance. An amendment in the nature of a substitute may contain major or minor changes and can be substantive or technical. It must be read when offered, and unanimous consent is needed to skip the reading. Moving the previous question ends the markup process and leads to a vote on the substitute amendment and the underlying measure. House rules could be amended to direct committees to have a notice requirement for an amendment in the nature of a substitute, which is commonly used in committee markups. Reforms in the Democratic Caucus in the 1970s led to a diffusion of power to subcommittees and a strengthened role for party leaders in the legislative process. The evolution of power dynamics in the House of Representatives led to a diffusion of power to subcommittees and a strengthened role for party leaders and the caucus. Questions arise about where authority should reside and how power should be balanced in committee policymaking. Legislative committees are authorized to study and make recommendations on spending and oversight matters. The House of Representatives grants oversight authority to standing committees, requires oversight plans, assigns special oversight functions to named committees, and mandates review of appropriations within jurisdiction. Additionally, committees must submit \"views and estimates\" to the Budget Committee. The House of Representatives grants oversight authority to standing committees, requires oversight plans, assigns special oversight functions to named committees, and mandates review of appropriations within jurisdiction. Additionally, committees must hold hearings on \"waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement,\" address disclaimers of agency financial statements, and review high-risk federal programs. Reports on legislation must include oversight findings, cost estimates, and unauthorized appropriations information. Special rules must specify preclusion of amendments to strike unfunded mandates from measures. The House of Representatives grants oversight authority to standing committees, mandates review of appropriations within jurisdiction, and requires oversight plans. Committees must hold hearings on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement, review high-risk federal programs, and include oversight findings in reports on legislation. Special rules preclude amendments to strike unfunded mandates from measures and impose restrictions on appropriations bills. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has broad authority over government operations and activities, conducting investigations without regard to other committees' jurisdiction. The President's need to fulfill duties allows Congress to focus on oversight of federal programs and activities. Congress must gather information to understand changing circumstances, influencing law implementation and creation. Standing committees have the authority to conduct oversight under House rules, with leadership playing a key role in achieving additional oversight goals. Republican Whip Cantor emphasizes the importance of reflecting legislative schedules accordingly. Republican Whip Cantor stresses the importance of legislative schedules aligning with the need for hearings and oversight to allow committees to work without interruption. He suggests that visibility and incentives for committee leaders could help Congress solve problems. Video conferencing and field hearings can expand witness lists, and the Speaker could enforce oversight plans for standing committees to hold chairs accountable for achieving their goals. House committees could form task forces with limited tenures to conduct oversight and have the same authority as subcommittees. They prepare various documents and reports related to legislation, with issues including product approval, access, and required contents. The House Administration Committee could enhance accountability through hearings on committee funding resolutions and mid-Congress updates. Committee prints encompass a variety of items for internal committee use, such as bill drafts and subcommittee recommendations. Approval through committee or subcommittee votes is often required, with voting records disclosed. Unapproved documents may be released with disclaimers. The House could improve transparency by timely publishing committee documents, including transcripts of hearings and markups. It may be beneficial to reassess the need for both calendars and activity reports to avoid redundancy. It may be worth reassessing the need for committee documents and establishing criteria for their content. House rules require specific items in committee reports, which were added at different times to address legislative concerns. Members should review the utility of these items, consider discarding some requirements, and adding new ones. For example, inflationary impact statements are often incomplete. Members should also evaluate if they have enough time to file additional views as allowed by the rules. The rule allows committee members two additional days to file views for inclusion in the written report. Republicans have proposed new requirements for reporting measures from committees, including stating the constitutional basis for congressional authority and identifying how programs will be funded. Representative Cantor suggested that committee reports on oversight should be debated and adopted by the House. House rules may need revision to allow for the inclusion of minority views in committee reports on special rules from the Rules Committee. Currently, minority views are not permitted to expedite the process, but allowing them could provide valuable insight into the development of special rules and highlight contentious debates. Granting the minority a regular outlet for their views could inform members and potentially impact decisions made by the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee plays a crucial role in House proceedings by creating special rules for legislation to be considered on the floor. Reports from the committee are typically filed in two parts, describing the parliamentary scenario and listing amendments made in order. Allowing minority views in committee reports could provide valuable insight and potentially impact decisions. The Rules Committee plays a key role in House proceedings by creating special rules for legislation. In recent years, fewer bills are being considered under open or modified open rules. Committee members are appointed by party leadership, and a 2-to-1-plus-1 ratio is common. Special rules take the form of a simple resolution and are privileged under the rules of the House. Special rules, in the form of a simple resolution (H.Res. _____), are privileged under House rules and allow for the consideration of specific measures. These rules, reported by the Committee on Rules, dictate procedures for floor consideration, including debate, amendments, waivers of points of order, and actions leading to final passage. If approved by the House, a special rule can waive certain procedures and govern the consideration of the named measure. It can only be changed by adopting another special rule or through unanimous consent. Committees are required to establish regular meeting days and can also adopt rules for calling meetings. The Rules Committee established a regular meeting day of each Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. with 48 hours' notice required. The chair can also call an emergency meeting at any time for urgent matters, consulting the ranking minority member. This allows for quick action when needed, separate from the majority leader's schedule announcements. The Rules Committee meets regularly on Tuesdays at 10:00 a.m. with 48 hours' notice required. They can also have emergency meetings for urgent matters. The committee moves rapidly when the majority leadership wants to, conducting hearings and markups on special rules. Majority-party members can always defeat proposals by minority-party members. House rules dictate that special rules cannot be considered on the same legislative day they are presented by the Rules Committee, unless by a two-thirds vote or for specific exceptions. To avoid the need for a two-thirds vote, the House may stay in session until the Rules Committee files a report or adopt a special rule in advance. Emergency Rules meetings can expedite bringing a measure to the House floor, sometimes without adequate review time for Members. Democratic Members have criticized the use of emergency meetings in managing House legislation. House rules dictate that special rules cannot be considered on the same legislative day they are presented by the Rules Committee, unless by a two-thirds vote or for specific exceptions. Emergency meetings have been criticized by Democratic Members for expediting legislation without adequate review time. Republicans have advocated for changes to ensure Members have sufficient time to review legislation before it is considered by the House. This includes proposals to require all amendments submitted to the Rules Committee to be posted online in full text in advance of a hearing and markup. House rules could be changed to address the issue of emergency meetings and layover requirements for special rules. This could include establishing criteria for emergency meetings, requiring advanced notice for meetings discussing structured or closed rules, and allowing waivers only by a supermajority vote. The duration of the layover could be specified in calendar days or hours, or tied to specific reporting deadlines. House rules could be changed to address emergency meetings and layover requirements for special rules, allowing waivers only by a supermajority vote. The duration of the layover could vary based on the type of amendment process. Party rules may also dictate the process, with the majority-party leadership having the ability to limit emergency Rules Committee meetings. Restraint is necessary for any new mechanism to be effective, with exceptions being rare and widely supported. The majority leadership's effective management of House business and floor time may conflict with changes that limit emergency Rules meetings and layover of special rules. Pressure to end a workweek or recess can lead to rushed decision-making. Leaders must consider if regular order benefits their party and the institution. Any rule changes would need to address limits or waivers. The House may waive the layover rule for special legislation by adopting a special rule in advance by majority vote. The House could choose to continue allowing this waiver or limit it to ensure the layover requirement is followed. Layover of legislative vehicles, amendments, and related issues are addressed in the following pages. In the 111th Congress, the House agreed to 89 special rules for initial consideration of measures and 25 special rules for Senate amendments. The House adopted 64 special rules governing procedures from the convening of the 111th Congress through April 30, 2010. This detailed examination aims to provide a factual understanding of floor actions and identify potential changes to House rules or practices. The House adopted 64 special rules governing procedures from the convening of the 111th Congress through April 30, 2010. These rules included modified open, structured, and closed rules for considering measures reported by House committees. On average, it took 10.5 days for a reported measure to be passed by the House, with a median of 7 days. Despite the three-day availability requirement for committee reports, the House passed 12 measures one or two days after being reported. House consideration of legislation reported from committee in the 111th Congress often occurred within a week after committee reporting. 44 out of 63 special rules governed measures reported with amendments, showing substantive differences from the original versions. On average, measures passed by the House 12.8 days after committee reporting, with a median of 9 days. In the 111th Congress, House consideration of legislation often occurred within a week after committee reporting. 44 special rules governed measures reported with amendments, with an average House passage time of 7.4 days and a median of 4 days. Members questioned if they had enough time to review legislation and prepare floor amendments. In the contemporary Congress, the time between committee reporting and floor consideration is questioned for being sufficient for reviewing legislation and preparing amendments. Committees and House leadership aim to capitalize on the momentum of committee reporting by scheduling floor consideration quickly. Some special rules also include self-executing changes to committee-reported measures. The House passed 10 special rules allowing for quick consideration of committee-reported measures, with one report requiring a two-day layover. House Rule XIII, clause 6(a) mandates a one-day layover for special rules. The House passed special rules for quick consideration of legislation, including H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act. The special rule for H.R. 2454 was adopted after amendments and had a one-day layover before consideration, which began on June 26 and concluded the same day with the bill passing by 7:17 p.m. The House passed H.R. 2454 by 7:17 p.m. on the same day after adopting special rules for quick consideration. From the start of the 111th Congress to April 30, 2010, the House adopted 25 special rules governing procedures for considering measures, with an average of 7.4 days for measures to pass after introduction. The House adopted special rules for quick consideration of H.R. 2454, passing it by 7:17 p.m. on the same day. During the 111th Congress, 25 special rules were adopted, with an average of 7.4 days for measures to pass after introduction. One special rule allowed for consideration of an amendment in the nature of a substitute, raising concerns about sufficient time for review and public input on legislation like H.R. 4872. H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, was passed by the House after a special rule was adopted, with consideration starting on March 21 and concluding by 6:29 p.m. Member concerns over transparency and regular order could be addressed through changes to House rules. Changes to House rules and practices related to special rules could impact the House's deliberative process and decision-making. These changes may make it harder for the majority leadership to avoid difficult votes by controlling the floor. The House typically uses a special rule to bring major measures up for consideration, which involves a simple resolution reported from the Rules Committee. A special rule is a privileged resolution that becomes a temporary order of the House, debated under the hour rule with time allocated for debate. The majority floor manager moves the previous question to proceed to a vote on the resolution, allowing the Speaker to call up a named measure or resolve the House into the Committee. The special rule in the House is a two-step process to authorize consideration of legislation. Opponents cannot offer amendments unless they defeat the previous question motion, which is rare. Defeat of the motion means some majority Members may vote to give control to the minority. The special rule in the House limits consideration and amending process of a measure once agreed to. The minority can use a motion to recommit if dissatisfied with amendments allowed. Both Democrats and Republicans in the minority may argue to defeat the previous question on a special rule to amend it. The special rule in the House limits consideration and amending process of a measure once agreed to. One way to address the issue of not being able to offer certain amendments is to allow the minority, a majority Member, or each to offer one amendment to a modified rule. The vote would be on whether to consider the amendments, not directly on the amendments themselves. One proposal to change the House's consideration of special rules is to make them divisible, allowing limited debate and votes on individual provisions. Another idea is to require a larger majority to approve special rules with waivers of House rules. Some Members have proposed requiring minority support for closed or structured rules, while others suggest a unanimous consent request for modifying special rules. Determining good faith in drafting rules and offering amendments could be challenging. The majority could draft rules allowing substantive amendments, while the minority may need to amend the rule to offer additional amendments. The minority could offer amendments to special rules to add, delete, or change provisions. They may seek to defeat the previous question or require at least one substantive minority amendment to be made in order. The Rules Committee may report special rules that include self-executing provisions, allowing for the passage of named measures with only a vote on the special rule. These special rules can apply to multiple pieces of legislation and contain unrelated provisions to establish procedures applicable to specific legislation. The Rules Committee may report special rules with self-executing provisions, allowing for the passage of named measures with only a vote on the special rule. Questions arise about governing the inclusion of unrelated provisions, limiting the use of self-executing provisions, and providing time for examination and debate on these provisions before floor consideration. The House can vote directly or indirectly on self-executing special rules provisions. State legislatures may have single-purpose restraints on legislation, but this is not the practice in Congress. Applying restraints to special rules could impact House deliberations. Both parties express a desire for \"regular order\" in the consideration of legislation. The role of committees and the structure of floor consideration of legislation has evolved over Congress's history. Republican Leader Boehner proposed changes to allow more floor debate and amendments, with a presumption of legislation under an open rule. Leader Boehner proposed changes to promote more floor debate and amendments, emphasizing the importance of committees in the legislative process. Pelosi also highlighted the need for a broader concept of regular order in 2006. Leader Pelosi defined regular order in 2006 as bills being developed through full hearings, open markups, and with at least 24 hours for Members to review before consideration. Bills should come to the floor with open and fair debate, allowing for full amendment process and Minority alternatives. Members should also have 24 hours to review bill and conference report text before floor consideration. Rules for floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to proceed. The House rules require floor consideration to be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the next day. Floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes, with a 2-minute extension for Members to reach the House Chamber. House-Senate conference committees must hold regular meetings and inform all conferees of activities in a timely manner. These principles reflect past House practices, especially after electronic voting was introduced. In the last 25 years, there has been a decrease in the number of hearings and annual authorizations considered in the legislative agenda. Markups have become shorter, with structured and closed rules becoming the norm, limiting opportunities for minority amendments. Leadership is more involved in crafting legislative vehicles, and layover requirements have been waived. In the 108th Congress, changes have been made to allow suspension of rules on Wednesdays, increasing partisan voting and decreasing conferences. Fewer substantive bills have become law, with changes aggregated in complex public laws. The principles of regular order aim to promote deliberation and participation in the legislative process. The evolution of rules and practices in the House in the past 25 years has favored decision making and efficiency, influenced by factors like shortened workweeks and external influences. Members question if there is too much focus on decision making over deliberation and if the minority is excluded from influencing legislative outcomes. Different ways to enforce regular order on the House floor include changing rules to create points of order, allowing a question of consideration to decide breaches of regular order, and having the Speaker make specific commitments to regular order. Proposed violations could also be discussed or decided by the majority-party caucus. The House can enforce regular order by changing rules to create points of order, using a question of consideration for breaches, and having the Speaker make commitments. Issues with regular order often stem from changes in standing rules through special rules. Members can look to House and party rules related to special rules for guidance on regular order. The Rules Committee determines the form of a bill or resolution for consideration on the House floor, which may differ from the version approved by House committees. This process ensures that all members are informed and able to debate and amend the measure effectively. The House Rules Committee can present a legislative vehicle that reflects the majority party's sentiment, integrates work from multiple committees, or contains provisions to attract votes. The decision to allow a different text than the committee-reported one for consideration on the House floor is a key question. The decision on presenting a different text on the House floor is a key question. Should the Rules Committee, majority-party leadership, or committees of jurisdiction decide on floor amendments? Should committee work products have a chance for debate and a vote? Should both majority and minority floor managers be able to offer a committee-reported measure as a substitute for the legislative vehicle made in order by a special rule? The decision-making process for presenting a different text on the House floor raises questions about allowing amendment authors to offer their amendments, the time for examining the text before floor consideration, the role of caucuses or conferences, the need for hearings on the other text, and requirements for disclosing information on decision-making. The decision-making process for presenting a different text on the House floor raises questions about allowing amendment authors to offer their amendments, the time for examining the text before floor consideration, the role of caucuses or conferences, the need for hearings on the other text, and requirements for disclosing information on decision-making. Leader Boehner supports making committee-reported text in order to address criticisms of transparency in the legislative process and ensure Members and the public are informed of changing legislative vehicles before chamber consideration begins. This direction would constrain the majority leadership's options. Sometimes, committees are bypassed in the legislative process due to various reasons such as time constraints, impasse, or when the legislation is not aligned with the majority party's views. Majority leadership may step in to resolve conflicts or exert more control over policy decisions. The duration for Members and the public to review legislative text before floor consideration is also a key consideration. The need for additional debate time on the floor to ensure Members are informed on a measure's provisions, potential requirements for disclosure of decision-making information by proponents of unreported measures, and the possibility of hearings before floor consideration on unreported text are key considerations in the legislative process. The decision to bring an unreported measure to the floor is often endorsed by an affirmative vote on a special rule. Committees may mark up an amendment in the nature of a substitute to a bill, which could be designated as the legislative vehicle by the Rules Committee after negotiation and compromise between committees. An amendment in the nature of a substitute may differ in minor or substantive ways from the original measure, and there are questions about the transparency and timing of its development for floor consideration. The text discusses the development and rules governing an amendment in the nature of a substitute, including considerations such as scope, debate time, voting procedures, and review by party caucuses. The text discusses the need for transparency and rules governing amendments in the nature of a substitute, including considerations for committee-reported amendments and decision-making processes. The House does not have a single-subject rule for its legislation, allowing bills to include multiple subjects. The germaneness rule applies to amendments, not the bill itself. Members tend to draft legislation referred to as few committees as possible for better chances of being reported. When drafting legislation, members aim to refer it to as few committees as possible to increase the chances of being reported or amended. Committees may combine bills into one, focusing on related subject matter within their jurisdiction to avoid jurisdictional conflicts with other committees. If multiple committees have jurisdiction over a measure, germane amendments from each committee could expand the bill's coverage. The germaneness rule and its precedents protect the House from considering new subject matter when amending a measure, ensuring amendments stay relevant. Careful drafting and committee practices also help address concerns about a measure's subject matter. The germaneness rule and committee practices aim to address concerns about a measure's subject matter by ensuring amendments stay relevant and avoiding the inclusion of nongermane subject matter through careful drafting and decision-making processes. The Rules Committee could potentially stipulate the automatic adoption of specific amendments to the legislative vehicle to streamline the process. The special rule allows for self-executing amendments to be automatically added to a legislative vehicle without separate consideration or voting. Questions arise about the regulation and limitations of self-executing amendments, including debate time and examination period for Members before floor consideration. The House rules currently provide a layover of three calendar days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless the House is in session. The issue of layover requirements has been raised by Members in relation to both reported and unreported measures. Should the House be allowed to vote directly or indirectly on self-executing special rules provisions, contingent on approval by the Democratic Caucus or Republican Conference? Deliberation in the House may be best served by debating and voting on a narrower set of choices. Members of both parties have raised concerns about the abridgement of layover requirements in the House rules. Proposals have been introduced to increase layover requirements to as long as 10 days or change the three-day layover requirements to 72 hours. Tolling and when it begins are also potential questions to consider. Proposals have been introduced to increase layover requirements in the House rules, potentially extending them to 10 days or changing the three-day layover to 72 hours. Questions also arise about when tolling should begin, whether it should apply to hours or days, and if a majority larger than a simple majority should be required to set aside a layover requirement. Proposals to increase layover requirements in the House rules have been introduced, potentially extending them to 10 days or changing the three-day layover to 72 hours. Questions also arise about when tolling should begin, whether it should apply to hours or days, and if a majority larger than a simple majority should be required to set aside a layover requirement. Layover waivers might be vetted in the Democratic Caucus or Republican Conference prior to Rules Committee consideration of a special rule. Exceptions to layover rules applicable to committee reports in Rule XIII, clause 4 may be eliminated, including special rules reported by the Rules Committee, House funding resolutions, questions of House privileges, declarations of war or national emergency, and certain disapproval resolutions of government agency action. The House rules may be changed to increase layover requirements, potentially extending them to 10 days or changing the three-day layover to 72 hours. Questions also arise about when tolling should begin, whether it should apply to hours or days, and if a majority larger than a simple majority should be required to set aside a layover requirement. Layover waivers might be vetted in the Democratic Caucus or Republican Conference prior to Rules Committee consideration of a special rule. Exceptions to layover rules applicable to committee reports in Rule XIII, clause 4 may be eliminated. House rules dictate the reading of bills and joint resolutions three times: by title in the House, in full in the Committee of the Whole, and by title before passage. Readings in the Committee of the Whole include a full reading before general debate and again for amendment. Special rules or unanimous consent can waive the full reading. Addressing concerns over measures brought to the floor within the layover period may involve these readings. The House rules require bills and joint resolutions to be read three times: by title in the House, in full in the Committee of the Whole, and by title before passage. Waiving readings in the Committee of the Whole can be done through special rules or unanimous consent. Measures brought to the floor within the layover period may involve these readings, and new House rules or forbearance by the Rules Committee could allow for additional time for examination. Members may find value in having a measure read for amendment to understand proposed changes better. Special rules can allow the existing House rule to operate during consideration in the Committee of the Whole. During debates on measures, the House allocates time for general debate, typically one hour equally divided between majority and minority floor managers. If a measure was referred to multiple committees, each committee may have floor managers. Time allocations can vary, with the primary committee usually given more time. Committees or members have raised concerns about time allocations, which can be addressed through practices rather than changes to House rules. The interest in time allocations for general debate in the House can be addressed through practices rather than changes to House rules. Questions arise about how to allocate general debate time when multiple committees have jurisdiction over a measure. Factors such as committee size, level of interest, and contentiousness of issues may influence the allocation of time. The allocation of general debate time in the House raises questions about committee size, contentious issues, and control over time. Should committees with jurisdiction over a measure have to formally decline debate time? Should the Rules Committee only allocate time to committees that request it? The process of seeking or limiting debate time could be reevaluated. The process of allocating general debate time in the House raises questions about committee size, contentious issues, and control over time. Should committees have to formally decline debate time, or should the Rules Committee allocate time only to committees that request it? The onus for limiting time could be placed on the Rules Committee, and considerations for chamber-wide interest in a measure should be factored in when determining speaking limits or general debate time. Amendments may be debated under the five-minute rule or controlled time in the Committee of the Whole. Amendments in the House can be debated under the five-minute rule or controlled time in the Committee of the Whole. Special rules classify amendment processes as open, structured, or closed, although terminology may vary among different parties. Special rules in the House can vary from open rules allowing germane amendments to closed rules prohibiting all amendments except those from the reporting committee. A structured rule, commonly used today, falls between open and closed rules in terms of amendment restrictions. Structured rules, commonly used today, restrict the amendment process by only allowing specified amendments, limiting debate time, and disallowing certain types of amendments. Despite some members advocating for open rules, it is unclear if they would prefer all bills to be considered under completely open rules. Leader Boehner has expressed support for open rules in recent speeches. In a recent speech, Leader Boehner expressed support for open rules, favoring an amendment process that allows for full debate and the minority to offer alternatives. A modified open rule or structured rule could accommodate these objectives, providing advantages in the amendment process by allowing germane amendments and binary choices as per House rules. The House rules allow for a series of binary choices through amendments. Members can offer second-degree amendments to the amendment or substitute. Debate continues under the five-minute rule until a motion to close or limit debate is adopted. The open rule fosters Member-to-Member debate but may be inefficient due to Members' schedules. In 2009, the House mostly abandoned open amendment processes in favor of structured rules for regular appropriations bills. Open rules may be disfavored for allowing frivolous or dilatory motions. The House rules allow for binary choices through amendments, with open rules fostering Member-to-Member debate but possibly being inefficient. Closed rules, in contrast, disadvantage all Members by limiting opportunities for amendments and forcing a yes or no vote on the leadership's decision. Clarifying the Speaker's authority to rule dilatory motions could help keep debate moving towards the conclusion of the amendment process. During Republican control, Democratic Members have been concerned with limited amendment opportunities under structured rules, which can affect Members with different perspectives. Minority parties may be limited to offering amendments as motions to recommit, potentially hindering minority perspectives from being considered. This can put majority Members in a difficult position when faced with substantive amendments. Amendments can put majority Members in a tough spot when district politics clash with leadership's stance. The minority party often resorts to motions to recommit with instructions, leading to legislation being pulled to avoid a vote. This raises questions about whether the House's deliberation is best served by a limited set of choices determined by the Rules Committee and majority-party leadership. Debate in the House is compressed in time, with limited amendments and structured rules. Noncontroversial legislation is considered under suspension of the rules procedure, indicating potential for more debate time during the week. Options for a more open amendment process in the House include allowing all amendments with majority-party sponsors, factions within the majority party to select key amendments, bipartisan sponsorship, specified number of sponsors, cut-and-bite amendments, amendments in the nature of a substitute, substantive minority amendments, and amendments within the committee's jurisdiction. The House could consider various options for a more open amendment process, such as allowing substantive minority amendments, full amendment trees under a structured rule, and disallowing frivolous or dilatory amendments. The House could consider different approaches to improve the amendment process, including setting time limits, allowing germane amendments, and using structured rules to complete consideration efficiently. Members would need to cooperate for these options to be effective. The House could consider different approaches to improve the amendment process, such as setting time limits and allowing germane amendments. The Democratic Caucus or Republican Conference could advise leadership on the amendment process. Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank requested a more open rule on H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. Leadership may also consider a more open amendment process or provide guidelines for it. Special rules in the House may waive points of order against a measure or its amendments, except for specific rules outlined in clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. Special rules in the House can obviate the operation of most House rules and statutory rules to allow for the consideration of specific measures. Rule XXI, clause 9 pertains to earmarks, and clause 10 is the House pay-go rule. These rules often waive points of order against committee amendments in the nature of a substitute, except for those arising under clause 10 of rule XXI. This provision aims to protect amendments and ensure a smoother legislative process. The House pay-go rule, under Rule XXI, clause 10, is protected by special rules, which waive points of order against amendments made in a structured rule. These waivers, known as \"blanket waivers,\" cover all points of order except those under clause 9 or 10 of Rule XXI. This provision aims to streamline the legislative process by allowing for the consideration of specific measures without being hindered by certain rules. Protection under special rules can extend to provisions of a measure or an amendment, but not to amendments to those protected provisions. The Rules Committee may waive points of order specified in a special rule, but it is not required to list them. Questions arise about justifying waiver decisions, allowing blanket waivers, requiring a supermajority for blanket waivers, and imposing longer layover requirements for special rules with blanket waivers. The Rules Committee may waive points of order specified in a special rule, but it is not required to list them. Questions arise about justifying waiver decisions, allowing blanket waivers, requiring a supermajority for blanket waivers, and imposing longer layover requirements for special rules with blanket waivers. Should all amendments made in order be treated the same as provisions of the measure to be amended? Should the Rules Committee be required to justify its decisions on differing waivers in its reports on special rules? The Rules Committee may waive points of order specified in a special rule, but it is not required to list them. Questions arise about justifying waiver decisions, allowing blanket waivers, requiring a supermajority for blanket waivers, and imposing longer layover requirements for special rules with blanket waivers. Should all amendments made in order be treated the same as provisions of the measure to be amended? Should the Rules Committee be required to justify its decisions on differing waivers in its reports on special rules? Committee and floor amendments should comply with House rules, and a vote to retain or amend a special rule's waiver provisions should be allowed before a vote on the previous question motion. After the previous question is ordered, a single motion to recommit to strike a specific or blanket waiver could be in order. Minority or any Member may make a procedural motion for a recorded vote, such as motion to adjourn or demand a recorded vote on a procedural step normally taken by voice vote. Through rules changes, the House has given the Speaker more flexibility in scheduling votes. The House has implemented rules changes to expedite consideration of motions and requests, such as limiting procedural motions and disallowing certain demands in the Committee of the Whole or the House. Special rules may restrict motions like rising from the Committee of the Whole or demanding a division of the question in the House. These provisions aim to streamline the voting process and scheduling of votes. Special rules provisions aim to expedite consideration of measures and prevent delays from the minority with multiple motions or votes. These provisions limit procedural opportunities for all Members, raising questions about curtailing Members' ability to use motions and the justification for disallowing certain motions. Should dilatory motions be left to the Speaker or chair to rule out of order? The House rules allow the Speaker or chair to rule certain motions out of order, such as the motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise and report. Special rules may designate who can make specific motions, like limiting the motion for the Committee of the Whole to rise to the majority floor manager. Amendments to House rules could reduce opportunities for procedural motions, such as moving to adjourn. The House rules may limit procedural motions, such as moving to adjourn, to reduce opportunities for minority actions. This could lead to increased partisanship and minority efforts to disrupt the majority's agenda. Changes to the motion to recommit rule have occurred in the past 15 years, with the Republican majority ensuring the minority's right to offer a motion with or without instructions. The motion to recommit in the House is a last attempt by the minority to amend a measure before a final vote. Instructions in the motion can include amendments or directions for further action by a committee. If the motion contains an amendment and is agreed to with the term \"forthwith,\" the amendment is immediately considered by the House. In the House, the motion to recommit allows the minority to amend a measure before a final vote. Instructions in the motion can include amendments or directions for further action by a committee. If the motion contains an amendment and is agreed to with the term \"forthwith,\" the amendment is immediately considered by the House. The rules for the motion to recommit changed in the 111th Congress to only allow motions with instructions using the term \"forthwith.\" The House motion to recommit allows the minority to amend a measure before a final vote. The minority often uses partisan messages in their motions, leading to the majority pulling legislation to avoid a vote. Majority members object to the element of surprise and lack of time to understand the motion. Changes to the House rule could address these concerns while preserving the minority's rights. The House motion to recommit allows the minority to amend a measure before a final vote, often leading to partisan messages causing the majority to pull legislation. Changes to the House rule, such as allowing additional debate time or pre-filing motions, could address concerns about surprise motions while preserving minority rights. Restricting the minority's role in legislation processing by postponing consideration of a motion to recommit with instructions, allowing time for majority-party Members to understand and weigh their vote. Variations could give decision power to majority floor manager, majority leader, or the House. House could amend Rule XIX, clause 2 to allow the majority floor manager to demand a delay for a specified time. The House could potentially amend its rules to enhance minority rights in the legislative process, allowing for a broader range of instructions in motions to recommit. This could include directing committees to hold hearings or conduct investigations, in addition to the current \"forthwith\" instructions. Enhancing minority rights in the legislative process could involve allowing more debate on motions to recommit with instructions. Currently, proponents and opponents each have five minutes, but the majority floor manager can extend this to one hour. Members can inquire about what it means to be \"opposed\" to a measure when making such motions. The Speaker relies on a Member's assertion of opposition and assumes a change in decision if a Member votes for the measure after a failed motion to recommit. The House considers a large number of bills and resolutions each week under a procedure called suspension of the rules. A single motion suspends all rules, limits debate to 40 minutes, prohibits floor amendments, and requires a two-thirds vote for passage. The motion is in order on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. The House considers bills and resolutions under the suspension of the rules procedure on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Both parties have guidelines for the Speaker's consideration, such as not allowing measures opposed by more than one-third of a committee and breaching cost ceilings. Democrats set the ceiling at $100 million, while Republicans set it at a 10% spending increase. During the 109th Congress, Democrats criticized Republicans for not restricting the Suspension Calendar to non-controversial legislation. Minority-authored legislation scheduled in relation to the party ratio in the House. Republican leaders propose reforming the use of suspension for commemorative legislation, suggesting handling appreciation and recognition through special-order speeches instead. The House banned commemorative legislation in 1995 but allows similar resolutions under suspension, recognizing accomplishments, events, and achievements. Further restrictions on this rule could be considered. Members in their representational capacity appreciate the opportunity to sponsor resolutions expressing recognition and speak on them in committee and on the floor. Suggestions have been made to review the operation of the rule allowing for such resolutions and consider further restrictions. One alternative proposed is to consider these measures by unanimous consent, allowing for a brief period of time for the proponent to address the House and for other Members to speak under a reservation. This could potentially reclaim floor time from measures considered under the suspension procedure. Members can make reservations for measures involving appreciation and recognition by unanimous consent at the Speaker's discretion on any day of the week. Alternatively, a different form of suspension of the rules can be provided for these measures, with 10 minutes of debate, no floor amendments, and passage by voice vote, only on Mondays. Measures must be considered within 30 days of introduction, with \"official objectors\" from each party reviewing and alerting leadership to any issues. Committees must adopt rules for expeditious consideration of these measures. Both Democratic and Republican leadership have scheduled controversial or important measures for consideration under the suspension of the rules procedure, forcing a decision with only a vote for or against the motion. Questions arise about who should decide if a measure is controversial or important, whether the Speaker should have sole responsibility for scheduling such measures, and if the committee chairs and ranking minority members should concur in the decision. The process of determining which measures can be considered under suspension of the rules is under scrutiny. The House is considering a new two-step procedure for controversial legislation under suspension of the rules, with a procedural vote first on whether to consider a measure and then the existing procedure for debate and voting on the motion. The House is considering a new two-step procedure for controversial legislation under suspension of the rules, with a procedural vote first on whether to consider a measure and then the existing procedure for debate and voting on the motion. House Rule XX, clause 2(a) mandates a minimum 15-minute time for a record vote or quorum call by electronic device, with heightened attention to vote duration since 1987 due to controversies over prolonged voting times. Controversies have arisen over the timing of vote announcements by the presiding officer, with allegations of early or late announcements. Speakers have addressed voting duration in their policies, urging promptness and ensuring Members are not disenfranchised. Despite guidance provided, disputes still occur where Members feel they were unable to vote. The most heated controversies arise when a presiding officer is accused of holding a vote open or closing it at a specific time to alter the expected outcome. In response to controversies over vote timing, Democrats proposed limiting vote duration to prevent manipulation of outcomes. This included a rule change in the 110th Congress to prevent holding electronic votes open solely to reverse results. In the 110th Congress, a rule change was made to prevent manipulation of outcomes by limiting vote duration. This led to the creation of a select committee to investigate voting irregularities, resulting in a recommendation to repeal the rule change due to difficulties in enforcement and causing anger. The House repealed the rule change in the 111th Congress. The select committee recommended better communication between majority and minority leaders to avoid controversy over vote duration. Votes could be extended with their concurrence or after consultation. Changes could be made through Speaker's policies or scripted floor colloquy between leaders. The select committee recommended preserving the Speaker's discretion and authority in conducting votes, formalizing the clerk's certification process, and ensuring accurate vote announcements to instill confidence in the process. Rule XX, clause 2 could be amended to implement these recommendations without referencing current practices. The Clerk conducts record votes or quorum calls by electronic device unless directed otherwise by the Speaker. Upon certification by the Clerk, the Speaker announces the vote results. The Speaker amended policies for the 111th Congress to wait for the Clerk's certification of vote tallies. The select committee recommended recording the total time electronic votes are held open and making this information available to Members. The select committee recommended eliminating voting by ballot card during electronic votes, having the chair confirm all Members have voted, and closing voting machines after a grace period. Speakers have urged Members to vote promptly within 15-17 minutes to conclude votes efficiently. The select committee recommended changes to voting procedures to improve timeliness and predictability in House voting practice. This includes eliminating voting by ballot card, having the chair confirm all Members have voted, and closing voting machines after a grace period. These changes aim to add predictability and procedural fairness to the conduct of votes, potentially influencing Members' behavior. The voting procedures in the House have evolved over time, with practices dating back to the 94th Congress. Speaker Carl Albert implemented rules to reduce vote changes, including using well cards and electronic voting within the first 10 minutes of a vote. New Members of the 111th Congress received separate briefings, but there is a suggestion for a unified briefing. The House previously allowed general, specific, and live pairs for voting, but now only allows live pairs in limited instances. Consideration is given to reinstituting pairing for voting. The House could consider reinstating pairing for absent Members to make their positions known during votes. In the 110th Congress, voting rights were restored to Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole. In the 110th Congress, voting rights were restored to Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole, despite challenges to its constitutionality. In the 110th Congress, voting rights were restored to Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole, despite challenges to its constitutionality. The House could revisit its grant of voting rights to Delegates and the Resident Commissioner. House Rule IX distinguishes between questions of privileges raised by the majority or minority leader and other Members. Such resolutions take precedence over all other business. The House Rule IX distinguishes between resolutions offered by the majority or minority leader and others, giving them precedence over all other business. Questions arise about whether this distinction should continue, or if the Speaker should have authority to schedule consideration of such resolutions regardless of who offers them. The House Rule IX distinguishes between resolutions offered by the majority or minority leader and others, giving them precedence over all other business. Questions arise about whether this distinction should continue, or if the Speaker should have authority to schedule consideration of such resolutions regardless of who offers them. Providing the Speaker with authority to schedule consideration of any resolution would be advantageous in managing the House's agenda and schedule. Both Representative Pelosi and Representative Boehner utilized the leaders' prerogative, but eliminating the distinction could lead to increased use of resolutions. One proposal is to allow the majority and minority leaders to appoint designees who could offer resolutions with immediate precedence, shifting consideration away from individual members. One proposal is to allow the majority and minority leaders to appoint designees who could offer resolutions with immediate precedence, shifting consideration away from individual members. This change could result in additional resolutions and provide a forum for the minority to air grievances officially. The proposal suggests allowing designees appointed by the majority and minority leaders to offer resolutions with immediate precedence, providing a forum for the minority to officially air grievances. This change would relax House rules, giving Members more opportunities to discuss matters on the floor, potentially leading to more resolutions. The convenience of commercial air travel has allowed Members to be present in their home districts almost every weekend, impacting the House's schedule. Members of the House of Representatives now prioritize staying in their district homes rather than in Washington, DC, due to the convenience of commercial air travel. They typically arrive in Washington on Monday or Tuesday and leave by Thursday or Friday. Campaign funding has also evolved, with Members now having different responsibilities in Washington and fewer lobbyists present. In the modern era, Members of the House of Representatives prioritize staying in their district homes rather than in Washington, DC. Campaign funding has evolved, with fewer lobbyists present, and changes in the political and policymaking environment have altered how Members spend their time in Washington. The use of floor time has also changed, with updates to the 1880 rule on suspensions in the 93rd Congress and suspension motions being made in order on specific days since the 108th Congress. Since the 108th Congress, suspension motions have been in order every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Open rules have accounted for a majority of special rules adopted by the House in the past, but there have been no open rules in the 111th Congress. Recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole were first allowed in 1971, and rules changes have allowed for clustered votes and reduced voting time. Practices have evolved to prefer amendments between houses over conference reports, and fewer, larger bills are making it through the legislative process. Since the 108th Congress, suspension motions have been in order every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Fewer, bigger bills seem to make it through the legislative process, and more representational legislation is considered under the suspension of the rules procedure. Leader Boehner and Leader Pelosi called for changes to House floor time for a more open amendment process. Republican leaders have emphasized committee work, especially oversight, and proposed reining in time spent on measures under the suspension of the rules procedure. Options to deal with the length of the workweek and workday are being considered. The majority leadership works within parameters to accommodate Members' schedules, including travel preferences and family time. They aim to balance committee meetings and House floor activities to avoid conflicts. Late daily sessions can disrupt Members' family life, whether in Washington or communicating with their children back home. A concentrated schedule on Tuesdays and Wednesdays helps manage committee and floor activities efficiently. A schedule that concentrates committee and floor activities on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays best responds to Members' desire to be in their home districts, even if they travel from a Western state. This schedule favors the representational component of a Member's service, but it also constrains both committee and floor time, spreading Members' time over possibly two or more meetings each day within a short workweek. On the other hand, a five-day workweek maximizes legislative work time, favoring the legislative component of a Member's service, particularly their committee work. However, it may leave Members with as little as 24 hours in their home. A four-day workweek schedule allows for more committee and floor time compared to a three-day schedule, giving Members at least two full days in their districts. However, the turnaround from Friday night travel to Monday morning disadvantages Members from Western states. Another proposal is a three-week work followed by a one-week home work period, based on the Senate's experience in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Members of Congress have considered various work schedule proposals, including a pattern of a five-day week, followed by a four-day week, and then a three-day week. This schedule allows for predictability, full legislative work weeks, and longer periods for home-district work. Other options include a repeating pattern or a home-district work period every fourth week. Additionally, there could be months with longer workweeks. The House is considering different work schedule proposals, including four-day weeks with longer weekends and restrictions on legislative activities to certain days. There are discussions on meeting times, evening sessions, and committee meetings during session hours. The House is discussing work schedule proposals, including meeting times and committee meeting restrictions. The Select Committee explored the roles of the chair and parliamentarian in conducting votes. The competence of a chair in presiding impartially was emphasized. The Speaker emphasized the importance of presiding officers being impartial and above the fray, not participating in debate. Private tutoring is available for Members who preside, but details were not discussed. The majority party can enhance its role in this process. The majority party can improve legislative management by providing training for potential presiding officers and allowing them to gain experience in presiding over different processes. The House and Senate must agree on the same legislative measure before it can be presented to the President. Measures that pass both chambers without changes are usually noncontroversial, while most legislation differs between the House and Senate. The House and Senate must agree on the same legislative measure before presenting it to the President. Legislation often differs between the chambers, but they usually reach agreement through amendments or conference procedures. House practice includes considering Senate amendments and conference reports under special rules. Members' concerns about regular order and transparency could be addressed through rule and practice changes. In considering Senate amendments, the House has 14 special rules, 9 for motion to concur and 5 for motion to concur with a House amendment. The rules order the previous question without intervening motion, allow debate time, waive points of order, and prohibit division of the question. The House typically concurs in Senate amendments within 9.5 days, with House amendments added within 3.8 days on average. The House typically concurs with Senate amendments within 9.5 days, with House amendments added within 3.8 days on average. Special rules expedite the consideration of Senate amendments, with the Rules Committee reporting each special rule the same day the House votes on it. Of the 11 special rules for conference reports, some waive points of order and order the previous question. The House typically agrees to conference reports within 2.1 days, with a median of 1 day. Special rules are adopted on the same day as the consideration and agreement of conference reports, except in one instance where a day elapsed between adoption of the special rule and agreement. House Rule XXII, clause 8(a)(1) requires conference reports to be printed in the Congressional Record on the day they are filed and be available for three calendar days, excluding certain days. This provision does not apply during the last six days of a session. The House often waives the requirement for conference reports to be available for two hours before consideration. Conference reports are typically considered within 2.1 days, with a median of 1 day. Conferences have become relatively infrequent due to various reasons, leading to questions about sufficient time for Members to review legislation. Conferences have become infrequent for reconciling differences in legislation passed by the House and Senate. Decision-making is delegated to a small number of Members, which may not be representative of the membership at large. Leader Pelosi recommended regular meetings for House-Senate conference committees. The recommendation for conference committees to hold regular meetings of all members to involve them in decision-making on legislation reconciliation. The current practice of delegating decision-making to a small number of members obscures the process from public view, raising questions about regulation. The selection of conferees should consider representing different perspectives within the majority caucus. In the 111th Congress, junior Members were appointed to conference committees to increase visibility in legislative roles. The question arises whether additional perspectives, factions, and groups within a party should also be represented on conferences. The role of limited conferees, the layover rule for conference reports, and the time elapsed between filing and adoption of conference reports are also points of discussion. The current system allows flexibility in bringing conference reports or Senate amendments to the floor for voting without a layover rule. The question is whether this flexibility harms deliberation and serves Member and public interests. Options for change include honoring layover requirements, applying new layover requirements, or implementing rules changes, party rules, or leadership commitments. Blanket waivers of points of order against conference reports could also be considered. Waivers of points of order against conference reports can protect provisions not in House or Senate-passed measures. Special rules waiving consideration of Senate amendments in Committee of the Whole may also be examined. Self-executing conference report adoption rules are another approach. The House may want to ensure prompt sending of engrossed measures or amendments to the Senate. In the 107th Congress, the House Administration Committee transferred oversight of engrossment and enrollment of measures to the clerk of the House. Two incidents raised concerns about congressional management of the enrollment process, including changes made to a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 during Senate enrollment. In the 110th Congress, there were two incidents involving discrepancies in enrolled bills. The first incident involved changes made to a provision in a law during Senate enrollment, leading to a dismissed constitutional challenge. The second incident occurred with H.R. 2419, where title III was omitted in the enrolled version sent to the President. This resulted in a veto by President George W. Bush, followed by Congress passing a new bill containing all the necessary titles and repealing the previous veto. The House could consider revising the engrossment and enrollment process oversight or maintain the current procedures. Barack Obama promised transparency in the legislative process by allowing the public to view bills online for five days before signing them as President. There has been discussion on whether this promise has been fulfilled and the impact it has on government transparency. The President has 10 days to act on a bill once it is presented to him. The President has 10 days to sign or veto a measure presented to him by Congress. Congress can control the timing of presenting a measure to the President, either on a rapid or slower schedule, based on public sentiment. From President Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009, through April 30, 2010, he was presented 162 bills and joint resolutions. The President acted, on average, after 13.3 days from the time Congress cleared legislation until his signature or veto. Excluding minor bills, the President was presented 102 bills and joint resolutions, and acted, on average, 9.0 days after clearance. The time elapsed from congressional clearance to presentation was 4.1 days, and the time from presentation to action was... Some major bills signed quickly included H.R. 3590, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; H.R. 3548, Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009; H.R. 627, Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009; and H.R. 2, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. Congress could establish a minimum period for public review of legislation by requiring online posting before presenting to the President. Consistency could be achieved if both chambers agreed on a minimum review period after clearance. The House could establish a minimum number of days for public review of House-numbered measures by amending its rules, adopting a standing order, or including a provision in the Speaker's policies."
