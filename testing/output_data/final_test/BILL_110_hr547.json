    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act\". The Congress finds that the Nation must diversify its fuel supply to include domestically produced biofuels like hydrogen to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum. Newer biofuels may pose challenges for current infrastructure, but chemical additives could help mitigate these issues. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel fuel was introduced in 2006 to mitigate air pollution and comply with Federal mandates. However, fuel labeled Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel may exceed the sulfur limit during transportation, leading to challenges for distributors and retailers in verifying sulfur content. Additionally, distributors and retailers may transition to dispensing hydrogen produced on-site or delivered by trucks, transforming their business. Transitioning to dispensing hydrogen on-site or by trucks presents new storage, handling, and equipment challenges. SEC. 3. BIOFUEL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADDITIVES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with other agencies, will conduct research to develop materials for biofuels that are compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure. This program will involve utilizing various educational institutions for research and will focus on preventing corrosion in pipes and other materials. Research will focus on developing materials for biofuels compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure, addressing issues such as clogging, contamination, poor flow properties, instability, microbial contamination, and electrical conductivity problems. Additionally, alternatives for tank refurbishment, emission reduction strategies, and certification issues will be explored. Issues related to certification of components for fuel dispensing devices, challenges in designing, storing, and dispensing hydrogen fuel, optimal fuel additive placement in the supply chain, and other identified problems will be addressed by the Assistant Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Assistant Administrator will conduct a program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop portable, low-cost methods for testing sulfur content in fuel, including Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and Low Sulfur Diesel. Demonstrations of these technologies must begin within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there will be a focus on developing standard reference materials and a data base. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will develop a physical properties data base and standard reference materials for biofuels within 6 months of the Act's enactment. $10,000,000 is authorized for the Environmental Protection Agency for this Act, derived from existing appropriations for energy and environmental research. A report to Congress is required. The Secretary of Energy will report to Congress within 1 year of the program's establishment, suggesting Federal incentives for its success. Congress emphasizes the need to reduce reliance on foreign petroleum by diversifying aircraft fuel supply with domestically produced alternative fuels. Research under this Act will address volatile and nitrogen oxide emissions. The Clerk, Karen L. Haas, attests to the document."
