FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that Environmental Land Technology, Ltd. acquired 2,440 acres of school trust lands in Utah for development purposes. They completed various studies and negotiations with the city, obtained water rights, and received permits under the Endangered Species Act.\" The Bureau of Land Management agreed in 1996 to acquire 12,600 acres of non-Federal land to create the Red Cliffs Reserve for desert tortoise protection. They have acquired most of the privately owned property within the Reserve, except for 1,516 acres of the ELT development land. Due to land exchanges for the Grand Staircase National Monument, there are no longer enough comparable lands in Utah for intrastate exchanges. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management are responsible for acquiring private lands within the Red Cliffs Reserve for desert tortoise protection. ELT is entitled to have its lands appraised at fair market value. The bifurcation of responsibility has left ELT in a bureaucratic \"no-man's-land\". The Secretary of the Interior and department officials prioritize acquiring ELT lands for the HCP and Agreement. No funds were requested in the 2001 budget to purchase remaining privately held lands within the area. The desert tortoise listing and lack of suitable land for exchange or funding have prevented the private land owner from developing or disposing of the property. The creation of the Red Cliffs Reserve has prevented ELT from developing its property, leading to financial hardship and the need to liquidate assets. It is in the public interest to acquire the land for desert tortoise habitat preservation and compensate the private land owner fairly. The text chunk states the acquisition of certain property in Washington County, Utah. The United States acquires 1,516 acres of real property owned by ELT in the Red Cliffs Reserve in Washington County, Utah, along with 34 adjacent landlocked acres. Owners will receive just compensation, with an initial payment of $15,000,000 within 30 days of taking possession. The United States pledges full faith and credit for payment of any judgment related to the taking of real property. Payment will be the agreed appraised value plus interest, costs, and expenses from February 1990 to final payment. Payment will come from a permanent judgment appropriation or another Federal Government fund. Interest shall accrue from the date of taking to the date of payment, compounded quarterly at the rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. In the absence of a negotiated settlement within 90 days, the Secretary of the Interior will seek a determination from the United States Federal District Court. The Secretary of the Interior will seek just compensation for the taking of property, prohibit unauthorized use of acquired lands, and credit a surplus property account if requested by the land owner. The land owner may receive compensation for real property taken, including interest, costs, and attorney fees. They can use the credit in a surplus property account to bid on surplus property and the account can be adjusted by the Administrator of General Services. The credit in the account can be transferred or sold to another party. The land owner can transfer all rights to another party, who must be notified within 60 days of the transfer."
