The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 incentivized businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations, leading to thousands of companies and millions of Americans having ownership interests across various industries.

SEC. 5 addresses assumption of estate tax liability for transfers of employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan sponsored by an S corporation. If employer securities are transferred to an employee stock ownership plan by gift or through the decedent's will, the executor can elect to apply a section relieving them of tax liability. This provision must be filed before the tax return due date. An employee stock ownership plan is required to pay a portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 if employer securities are transferred to the plan by gift, through the decedent's will, or by the executor of the estate. The executor of the estate shall pay a portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 with respect to the taxable estate of the decedent, which is determined by the value of employer securities in the gross estate or the tax imposed reduced by allowable credits. Installment payments can be elected by the executor. The executor may elect to have section 6166 apply to payment of estate tax on employer securities, allowing for installment payments before the tax return due date. Interest on installments for estate tax on employer securities is determined by aggregating the tax portions for the estate and employee stock ownership plan. Special rules apply for transfers of employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan, including no acceleration trigger and separate application of rules for estate and plan interests. Section 6166(g) applies separately to interests held by the estate and employee stock ownership plan after a transfer. Distributions or sales of securities by the plan are not considered dispositions for tax purposes, and such securities are not factored into subsequent dispositions. Dispositions of securities to meet diversification requirements are also addressed. Requirements for disposition of securities under section 401(a)(28) do not count as dispositions or withdrawals under section 6166(g). Employers with employees in an employee stock ownership plan must guarantee payments required by the plan. Agreements described in subsection (e) must be in effect for this guarantee. Agreements under subsection (e) require written consent from the plan administrator and employer for the application of subsections (b) and (d). An employee stock ownership plan assuming liability for tax under section 2001 is treated as a loan under section 4975(d)(3). Definitions for employer securities and employee stock ownership plan are provided in subsection (g). The terms 'employee stock ownership plan' and 'plan administrator' are defined in sections 4975(e)(7) and 414(g) respectively. The definition of 'tax imposed by section 2001' includes interest, penalties, and additional amounts related to the tax. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the Code.
