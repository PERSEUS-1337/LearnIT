    "content": "The estate and gift tax debate revolves around equity and economic efficiency. Opponents argue that taxing assets at death is unfair as they have already been taxed during accumulation. They also advocate for tax preferences for family assets passed down. On the other hand, supporters of the estate tax argue that it is necessary to tax accumulated capital gains that have not been subject to income taxes. The estate tax debate centers on equity and economic efficiency. Supporters argue for taxing accumulated capital gains, while opponents advocate for tax preferences for family assets. Repealing or modifying the estate tax could provide tax relief for farm and small-business estates, benefiting a wider range of estates with different asset types. IRS data on estate asset distribution can guide policymakers on the current impact of estate taxes on business assets and farms. The IRS publishes data on estate tax returns filed in 2009 and 2010. The 2009 data is more representative of the estate tax burden in 2012. The estate tax was repealed for those who died in 2010, so the 2010 data does not reflect the tax impact. Data from 2009 includes returns from decedents who died in 2008, with a difference in exemption amount from $2 million in 2008 to $3.5 million in 2009. The exemption amount for 2011 and 2012 is $5 million ($10 million for married decedents). The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 reinstated the estate tax for decedents starting in 2010 and ending in 2012. Executors of estates from 2010 can choose to file under previous laws. The new law sets the estate tax exemption at $5 million per decedent in 2010, with a top tax rate of 35%. Unused exemption can be transferred to a surviving spouse, resulting in a $10 million exemption for married decedents. The temporary estate tax changes are estimated to reduce revenue by $136.7 billion over 10 years. The number of affected decedents will increase in 2013 when the law reverts to pre-EGTRRA parameters. In 2013, the estate and gift tax minimum filing requirement is $5,120,000 for deaths occurring in 2012. Estates below this threshold do not need to file a return. Tax liability is calculated based on the gross estate value, with deductions like the marital deduction and charitable donations subtracted. The applicable credit provides an exemption equivalent to $5,120,000. The estate tax exemption amount is $5,120,000 for deaths in 2012. The marital deduction and charitable contributions can eliminate estate tax liability. The credit for state death taxes was gradually repealed by EGTRRA, replaced with a deduction for taxes paid. Some states still collect estate or inheritance taxes. Data used is from the IRS Statistics of Income Division. The IRS Statistics of Income Division reports assets held by estates by gross estate value classes. Farm returns are estates with farm assets, while business returns include assets like closely held stock and real estate partnerships. This methodology may overstate the number of business estates. In 2008, 0.6% of deaths had estate and gift tax liability, with only 0.08% including farm assets and 0.34% listing business assets in 2009. In 2008, only 0.34% of deaths involved business assets, with estates valued over $2 million required to file an estate tax return. Taxable estates over $10 million generated 61.0% of estate tax revenue in 2009, showing the progressive nature of the tax. The data provides significant detail on the distribution of the decedent's assets, with assets like publicly traded stock, cash assets, state and local bonds, other real estate, and closely held stock representing 66.2% of total taxable estate value in 2009. Farm assets make up approximately 3.25% of total taxable gross estate value, while business assets represent $14.1 billion (13.9%) of total taxable estate value, with closely held stock being the largest at $7.2 billion. The largest asset in the estate is closely held stock worth around $7.2 billion. Farm and business assets make up a small portion of total taxable estate value. Removing or lowering estate and gift tax rates will have a greater impact on non-farm and non-business assets. Farm estates are evenly distributed across different size categories, accounting for approximately 3.25% of total taxable estate value. Assets typically associated with non-farm businesses are concentrated in estates valued over $10 million, with over $11.0 billion held in these estates. Smaller-business taxable estates valued at less than $10 million contribute very little to the estate and gift tax base. Repealing the estate and gift tax would provide relief for estates composed of farm and small-business assets, which represent approximately 17.1% of total taxable estate value."
