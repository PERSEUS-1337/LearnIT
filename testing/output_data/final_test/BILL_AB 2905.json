    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the significant role of small businesses in California's economy, with a majority of businesses having fewer than 20 employees. Job growth is higher among businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The state aims to achieve a 25 percent small business participation goal for state procurement and contracting. Section 14838 of the Government Code is amended to facilitate small business participation in providing goods, services, and construction for state facilities. Directors of state agencies entering contracts must support small businesses in their respective areas of responsibility. (a) Establish goals for small business participation in providing goods, IT, services, and construction for the state. State agencies must include these goals in their reports to the Director of General Services. The Director will also include these goals in the department report as per the Public Contract Code. \n(b) Implement small business preference in awarding contracts for goods, IT, services, and construction, giving preference to bidders that involve small business and microbusiness subcontractors. In solicitations, a 5 percent preference is given to small business and microbusiness bidders meeting specifications. Nonsmall business bidders providing for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation can also receive a preference of up to 5 percent, as determined by the Department of General Services. In solicitations, a 5 percent preference is given to small business and microbusiness bidders meeting specifications. Nonsmall business bidders providing for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation can also receive a preference of up to 5 percent, as determined by the Department of General Services. The preferences shall not be awarded to a noncompliant bidder or used to meet minimum requirements. The preference for small businesses and microbusinesses in bids is capped at $50,000 and a total of $100,000 when combined with other preferences. Special considerations include reducing experience and inventory requirements, as well as providing assistance in preparing required information. Under Section 10163 of the Public Contract Code, awards should be made to small business and microbusiness bidders for projects within their prequalification rating. Major projects can be divided into subprojects to allow these contractors to bid. Small business and microbusiness bidders have precedence over nonsmall business bidders. In case of a tie between a small business or microbusiness bidder and a disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness bidder, the contract will be awarded to the disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness. This provision applies to ensure that small businesses and microbusinesses are not denied awards. The small business and microbusiness bidder preference allows for eligibility for an award. Section 10111 of the Public Contract Code is amended to require the department to provide a report on consulting services contracts entered into by the state, including contractor details, bidding information, contract price, justification for noncompetitive bids, contract purpose, and beneficiaries. The report on consulting services contracts must include details such as the purpose of the contract, dates of signing and completion, and potential beneficiaries. It should also list consultant contracts completed during the fiscal year, including any changes made to completion dates, contractor payments exceeding 3% of the original price, and significant changes in contract purpose or duties. The report on state contracting must include the level of participation of disabled veteran business enterprises and small businesses, detailing contract awards in various categories. It should also provide a statistical summary of each department's goal achievement and a statewide total of those goals. Additionally, an up-to-date list of eligible small business bidders by procurement and construction categories, including microbusinesses, should be included upon request. The report on state contracting should include statistics comparing small business and microbusiness contract participation dollars to total state contract participation dollars by procurement and construction categories. This information should also be provided by prime contractor and subcontractor separately, starting in 2018. (4) Recommendations for changes in statutes or state policies to improve opportunities for small businesses and microbusinesses.\n(5) Statistical summary of small businesses and microbusinesses certified for state contracting by number of employees in different categories.\n(6) Number of contracts awarded by the department in specified categories, starting in 2008.\n(7) Number of contracts and dollar amounts awarded annually to small businesses, microbusinesses, and disabled veteran business enterprises. The report shall include the level of participation of business enterprises in contracts by race, ethnicity, and gender of the owner, as well as whether the business is LGBTQ-owned, for various contract categories. Definitions for \"subcontractor\" and \"prime contractor\" are provided, and amendments to this section will apply from January 1, 2013."
