Paramilitary forces are distinct from regular armed forces but similar in organization and mission. The term \"paramilitary operations\" refers to CIA operations not involving US armed forces. Special operations differ from regular military operations in risk, techniques, and employment methods. USSOCOM and CIA conduct special operations with different objectives and methods. USSOCOM focuses on disrupting terrorist networks, while the CIA collects intelligence and performs covert operations to avoid implicating the US Government. The National Security Act was amended in 1991 to establish procedures for approving covert actions and notifying key Members of Congress. Covert actions involve influencing political, economic, or military conditions abroad without publicly acknowledging the role of the US Government. The CIA conducts a wide range of covert operations, including paramilitary activities that may overlap with DOD responsibilities. The National Security Council assigns responsibilities for paramilitary operations on a case-by-case basis. The CIA has supported US military operations with intelligence from the Korean War to present day and has also conducted clandestine military operations independently, such as the failed Bay of Pigs landing in Cuba in 1961 and the effort in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s. The CIA conducted paramilitary operations in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s to disrupt North Vietnamese supply efforts without direct US military intervention. They also played a significant role in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq, supporting military operations. Special Operations Forces (SOF) have been involved in covert operations since the Vietnam War, including responses to highjackings and conflicts in Panama, Mogadishu, and the Balkans. The 9/11 Commission report recommended shifting responsibility for paramilitary operations to the Defense Department due to the CIA's lack of investment in developing robust capabilities for such operations with U.S. personnel before 9/11. This would consolidate the capabilities already being developed in the Special Operations Command. The 9/11 Commission report recommended transferring responsibility for paramilitary operations from the CIA to the Defense Department, citing the CIA's reliance on improperly trained proxies before 9/11. The report highlighted the need for improved coordination and deconfliction between the DOD and CIA in carrying out secret military operations. The 9/11 Commission report recommended transferring responsibility for paramilitary operations from the CIA to the Defense Department, emphasizing the need for improved coordination between the two agencies. This includes developing joint procedures to prevent conflict and duplication of effort in operations involving elements of both the CIA and DOD. The CIA's capability to plan and undertake paramilitary operations is seen as crucial for obtaining intelligence from human sources and utilizing foreign contacts effectively. Some experts question if the Defense Department and Special Operations Forces (SOF) are capable of operating in a more agile and flexible manner compared to the CIA. Concerns are raised about SOF taking over responsibility for covert operations and the potential strain it may place on them. Some are concerned that if SOF takes over responsibility for clandestine and covert operations, they may become less agile and vulnerable to bureaucratic interference. Section 1208 of P.L. 108-375 allows SOF to directly pay and equip foreign forces supporting the U.S. in combating terrorism. This authority could be crucial for SOF in unconventional warfare and potential covert operations. Congress may review past paramilitary operations by the CIA and assess coordination between the CIA and DOD. The CIA and DOD coordination in paramilitary operations was required to be reported to defense and intelligence committees by June 2005. The CIA builds paramilitary capabilities when directed, using individuals with paramilitary experience managed by the Special Activities Division. The CIA does not maintain a large paramilitary force \"on the shelf.\" The CIA and DOD need to coordinate on paramilitary capabilities and future operations. The CIA should focus on operations that DOD might avoid, providing deniability and legal flexibility for covert activities. Some experts raise concerns about legal issues if Special Operations Forces are used for covert operations. The legality of ordering Special Operations Forces (SOF) to conduct covert activities that may require them to forfeit their Geneva Convention status is a concern. SOF may need to operate without military uniform and identification for deniability, which could violate international laws. Intelligence legislation often includes few provisions on paramilitary operations, with funding details in classified annexes. Congress can influence covert actions and has voted to deny funding in some cases. President Bush issued a letter in November 2004 requiring a review of Recommendation 32 by the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence. The 109th Congress did not address the issue legislatively, and in February 2005, the CIA and DOD disagreed with the 9/11 Commission's recommendation. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the CIA responded in June 2005. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the CIA disagreed with the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to shift paramilitary operations to DOD. The 110th Congress enacted P.L. 110-53, which did not address this issue. Opposition from the Pentagon, Intelligence Community, and Bush Administration influenced Congress' response. The CIA's reputation was positively impacted by post-9/11 performance evaluations. The CIA's post-9/11 performance was positively evaluated, especially during the Afghan campaign. Some Members have concerns about the blurring lines between DOD clandestine operations and CIA intelligence-gathering operations."
