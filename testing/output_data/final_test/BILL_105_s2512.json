    "content": "The \"Natural Resources Institute Act of 1998\" defines environmental sciences and the Intermountain West region, including Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and parts of Oregon and Washington. The Congress emphasizes the need for balanced economic growth with environmental protection through collaborative scientific inquiry, technology development, and public policy. There is a lack of adequate environmental science data to support long-term policy, leading to questions of credibility and utility. Individuals affected by natural resource decisions are not effectively involved in environmental research and development. Coordinated efforts between Federal and State agencies are necessary for effective policy and environmental sustainability. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is the only multiprogrammatic federally funded research and development laboratory in the Intermountain West region of the United States. The creation of a Natural Resources Institute will expedite sustainable environmental decision-making. The creation of a Natural Resources Institute will expedite sustainable environmental decision-making, leading to job creation, savings for taxpayers. The purpose of the Natural Resources Institute is to expedite sustainable environmental decision-making, leading to job creation and savings for taxpayers. The Natural Resources Institute aims to coordinate research, support public policy development, provide education and training, and facilitate the creation of commercial enterprises related to natural resource management. The Natural Resources Institute aims to coordinate research, support public policy development, provide education and training, and facilitate the creation of commercial enterprises related to natural resource management through teleconferencing and technology transfer. Establishment of Natural Resources Institute (referred to as the \"Institute\") to provide scientific solutions for economic and environmental improvement in the Intermountain West region of the United States. Located at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Duties include coordinating research, supporting policy development, education, training, and technology transfer for natural resource management. The Institute's duties include coordinating multidisciplinary research on natural resources, involving public participation, accessing scientific talent through private partners, and studying regional ecosystem dynamics. The Institute focuses on developing methodologies and tools for environmental stewardship in the Intermountain West region. It supports the formulation and implementation of natural resources public policy by considering socioeconomic concerns and involving the public in research activities. Additionally, it acts as an information resource center by managing environmental data and analytical tools for the region. The Institute in the Intermountain West region focuses on developing tools for environmental stewardship, including accessing regional environmental data sets, providing quick access to public databases, and maintaining trained personnel to assist the public and researchers. The Institute in the Intermountain West region focuses on providing education and training on natural resources, including seminars, training aids, internships, and research opportunities in collaboration with universities. The Institute in the Intermountain West region focuses on education and training on natural resources. A Board of Stakeholders, appointed by the Secretary of Energy, will incorporate vested interests and stakeholder prospectuses into the Institute's design and operation. The Board will consist of 11 members representing government, industry, the private sector, universities, and interest groups, serving 5-year terms. The Chairperson will be elected by the Board. The Director of the Institute, appointed by the Board of Stakeholders, has the authority to oversee the Institute's functions and integrate environmental sciences. The Director will hire staff as needed. Additionally, a Science Advisory Panel is established. The Science Advisory Panel is established to oversee the technical strategy and quality of science at the Institute. It consists of 15 members appointed by the Board of Stakeholders, representing various disciplines, serving for a 2-year term. The Science Advisory Panel oversees the technical strategy and science quality at the Institute. It has 15 members appointed by the Board of Stakeholders, serving for a 2-year term. The Chairperson is selected from among the panel members. The Institute can acquire unclassified data and nonproprietary information from Federal agencies to fulfill its duties. It will collaborate with various entities to ensure that its information and products are accessible and useful."
