    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act\". It includes findings and purposes for the development trust fund. Congress finds that the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program was approved to promote economic development, provide irrigation, protect from floods, and impounded waters have affected bottom lands along the Missouri River. The Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects, part of the Pick-Sloan program, have caused erosion on the Yankton Sioux Reservation and Santee Sioux Tribe lands along the Missouri River. The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe reservations remain undeveloped despite the Pick-Sloan program's hydropower generation and water impoundment. The tribes were not compensated for direct damages caused by the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects, which were acquired through condemnation proceedings by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Yankton Sioux Tribe and Santee Sioux Tribe did not receive fair compensation for the taking of their productive agricultural lands through condemnation. The settlement agreements did not consider the increase in property values over time. The Yankton Sioux Tribe should receive $34,323,743 for the loss value of 2,851.40 acres. The Santee Sioux Tribe is entitled to $8,132,838 for the loss value of 593.10 acres near the Santee village and 414.12 acres on Niobrara Island used for the Gavins Point Dam and Reservoir. SEC. 3.
