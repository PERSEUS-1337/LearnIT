    "content": "Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) provides benefits to workers affected by foreign trade, including training subsidies and income support. Workers over 50 who find reemployment at a lower wage may be eligible for wage insurance. To qualify for TAA benefits, workers must show that foreign trade contributed to their job loss. TAA is funded by federal appropriations and administered by state workforce and unemployment agencies. Title II of P.L. 112-40, known as TAAEA, established TAA eligibility and benefit provisions that expired on December 31, 2013, and reverted to more restrictive provisions on January 1, 2014. The program operates under both the 2011 provisions and the 2014 provisions simultaneously, with changes not being retroactive. TAA for workers was set to be phased out after December 31, 2014, under TAAEA. The TAA for Workers program was set to be phased out after December 31, 2014, but funds were appropriated in FY2015 to continue full operation. $710.6 million was allocated for the program, allowing for benefits to be provided to workers certified after December 31, 2014. The TAA for Workers program, subject to sequestration, will see a 7.3% reduction in funding to approximately $659 million for FY2015. Eligibility criteria under the current law 2014 provisions are described, comparing them to the now-expired 2011 provisions. Under current law, only production workers are eligible for TAA group certification if they have become separated from their employment due to foreign trade. This can be shown through increased competitive imports or a shift in production to an eligible country. The petitioning firm has shifted production to a foreign country with a free trade agreement, affecting secondary workers. The eligibility criteria for TAA certification have changed, with benefits not being retroactive. After the enactment of the 2014 provisions, workers can still receive benefits by completing a two-page petition and submitting it to DOL. The petition is also filed with the state governor. DOL investigates the petition to determine eligibility, with determinations published in the Federal Register. If certified, an impact date is determined for trade-related layoffs, covering workers laid off between the impact date and two years after certification. After certification of the petition, eligible workers laid off between the impact date and two years after certification can receive TAA benefits. Denied groups can request reconsideration within 30 days, and seek judicial review within 60 days. Certified workers apply for benefits at American Job Centers. Individual workers apply for benefits at American Job Centers after being deemed eligible. To qualify, they must have been separated from the firm within two years of DOL certification, worked at the affected firm for at least 26 weeks prior to the layoff, be entitled to state UI benefits, and not be disqualified for extended unemployment benefits. To receive the Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA), workers must be enrolled in an approved training program or have a waiver. Group-certified workers can appeal if denied individual benefits, with appeal rights and time limits explained in the determination notice. The ATAA program provides cash payments to TAA-certified workers aged 50 and over who find new employment at a lower wage. It is designed for older workers with limited time in the labor force and new wages below $50,000. Workers must request consideration for ATAA in addition to regular TAA benefits under the 2014 provisions. Under the ATAA program, workers aged 50 and over must secure reemployment within 26 weeks of separation from their TAA-certified job to be eligible for benefits. Unlike the RTAA program, there is no time limit for securing reemployment. ATAA benefits require full-time reemployment without TAA-funded training, while RTAA allows for part-time reemployment with wage insurance benefits and TAA-approved training. TAA benefits include training subsidies and income support for workers in training. Workers aged 50 and over may participate in a wage insurance program, and changes in TAA provisions are not retroactive. Workers certified under pre-2011 provisions may still be eligible for benefits authorized by previous TAA provisions, even if new provisions have taken effect. Table 2 compares benefits available to workers under different certification years. TAA-certified workers can receive various benefits to help them prepare for reemployment. Workers certified under pre-2011 provisions may still be eligible for benefits authorized by previous TAA provisions. The largest benefit is training assistance, along with employment services and reimbursements for job search and relocation expenses. Eligible workers request training assistance through American Job Centers, and funding can be paid directly to the service provider. There is no federal limit on the amount of training funding an individual can receive. In FY2013, approximately 90% of TAA training participants received occupational skills training, with an average program duration of 554 days. Data on the type of institutions providing training is limited. The 2012 DOL-commissioned report by Mathematica Policy Research found that occupational skills training for TAA participants was mainly provided by community or two-year colleges (55%) and vocational training centers (23%). The average cost of TAA-sponsored training was $8,500, with 41% costing less than $5,000 and 31% costing more than $10,000. 76% of workers who completed training earned an industry-recognized credential or equivalent. Training programs are not required to lead to a degree. The 2011 and 2014 provisions for training approval and funding differ. The 2014 provisions allocate specific funding for training subsidies, while the 2011 provisions funded training from a reemployment services fund. The 2014 provisions emphasize counseling and placement services without dedicated funding, while the 2011 provisions outline case management and employment services for TAA-certified workers. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program provides comprehensive assessment of worker's skills, assistance in developing employment objectives, and guidance on training and services. States must allocate 5% of reemployment services allotments for case management. Job search and relocation allowances are authorized under both 2011 and 2014 provisions. Certified workers can receive up to $1,250 for job search and relocation expenses. Job Search Allowance may subsidize transportation and subsistence costs for job search activities outside the local commuting area. The Relocation Allowance covers 90% of moving expenses for workers securing permanent employment outside their local area, with a maximum benefit of $1,250. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support to certified workers in approved training after exhausting UI benefits. TRA benefit levels are based on the worker's final UI benefit, which is determined by earnings during a base period of employment. States administer their own UI programs, leading to variation in benefit calculations. In January 2014, the highest maximum weekly UI benefit was $679 in Massachusetts and the lowest was $240 in Arizona. There are three stages of TRA: Basic TRA, which provides income support to workers in approved training after exhausting UI benefits. After exhausting UI benefits, workers may be eligible for basic TRA, which provides income support for up to 13 weeks. Upon completion of basic TRA, workers enrolled in a TAA-approved training program can receive an additional 65 weeks of income support, totaling 117 weeks of benefits. However, UI benefits offset both basic and additional TRA, and workers without a training waiver are eligible for additional TRA. Workers enrolled in a TAA-approved training program can receive up to 117 weeks of combined TRA and UI benefits. If the training program leads to a degree or credential, an additional 13 weeks of TRA can be collected, totaling 130 weeks. Enrollment in a qualified training program is necessary to continue receiving TRA benefits. The 2011 and 2014 TAA provisions offer the same level and duration of TRA benefits, but the timeline for enrolling in training is stricter under the 2014 provisions. Under the 2011 and 2014 TAA provisions, workers must enroll in training within 26 weeks of certification or layoff, whichever is later. The Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) program provides a wage supplement for workers aged 50 and over who pursue reemployment at a lower wage, with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over two years. The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) program, under the 2011 provisions, has differences compared to ATAA, including the requirement to secure full-time reemployment within 26 weeks of separation from a TAA-certified job. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides benefits to workers who are reemployed at least 20 hours per week, with no time limit on securing reemployment. The program is funded by the federal government and administered jointly with state agencies. Eligibility is determined by the Department of Labor (DOL) and individual benefits are administered by state agencies. Training and reemployment services are funded based on a formula that considers the number of certified workers and those participating in training. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides benefits to workers reemployed at least 20 hours per week, funded by the federal government and administered jointly with state agencies. Eligibility determined by DOL, benefits administered by state agencies. Training and reemployment services funded based on a formula considering certified workers and those in training. 65% of reemployment service funds distributed to states at the beginning of the fiscal year, remaining 35% held in reserve fund for emergencies or unforeseen training burdens. States can apply for reserve funds, any unallocated funds distributed throughout the year. Regulations ensure no state receives less than 25% of initial allocation. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides benefits to workers reemployed at least 20 hours per week, funded by the federal government and administered jointly with state agencies. Regulations specify that no state's initial allocation may be less than 25% of its allocation in the preceding fiscal year. TRA income support and ATAA wage insurance program are uncapped entitlements funded by the federal government. Any unobligated funds at the end of the fiscal year expire and are returned to the Treasury. Certification and participation data for TAA through FY2013 are presented, noting variations in eligibility and benefit provisions. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels under the TAA program are determined by the provisions in effect when the petition was filed. Workers may be covered by different provisions if petitions were filed at different times. Variations in policy should be considered when interpreting the data, making it difficult to align program provisions with recent program data. The TAA program provisions align with recent program data from FY2003 to FY2013. Petitions filed in one year may be determined in the subsequent year, creating a backlog. The number of certified petitions in FY2010 exceeded the number filed due to backlog reduction. In FY2013, approximately 104,000 workers were certified, an increase from FY2012 but still below the 287,000 workers certified previously. In FY2013, the TAA program operated under 2011 provisions, allowing both production and service workers to be certified for benefits. Out of 1,025 certified petitions, 58% were for production workers and 42% for service workers. Not all certified workers pursue benefits, some seek reemployment independently or retire. Data on workers enrolled in training or receiving TRA payments is presented in Table 5. The TAA program's benefits usage can be influenced by various factors, including policy changes and economic conditions. For instance, expanded eligibility and benefits in FY2009 led to a higher number of new training participants. Additionally, non-TAA policy provisions, such as unemployment insurance extensions, can impact the demand for TRA benefits. Economic conditions, like low unemployment rates, may also affect certified workers' decisions to pursue training benefits. Table 5 does not provide data on the number of TAA-certified workers who received non-training employment services such as case management and career counseling. Under different provisions, states may or may not have dedicated funding to provide these services. Table 6 presents post-TAA outcomes for program exiters using DOL's Common Measures, including entered employment rate (EER) and employment retention rate (ERR). The employment retention rate (ERR) and average earnings (AE) are key factors in measuring outcomes for TAA program participants. The data does not differentiate outcomes based on the specific provisions of TAA received, making it challenging to compare results. Consideration of broader labor market trends is important when interpreting the data. The impact of TAA benefits and services on program participants is difficult to assess solely through outcome data. While 71% of program exiters in FY2013 entered employment, it is unclear how many would have found employment without TAA. To estimate the impact, the Department of Labor commissioned studies to analyze the short and medium-term effects of the TAA for Workers program. The Department of Labor commissioned studies in 2012 to estimate the impact of the TAA for Workers program on participants who were laid off between November 2005 and October 2006. The studies compared TAA participants to a comparison group of UI claimants with similar characteristics over 16 quarters. Early findings showed TAA participants were more likely to participate in training, less likely to be employed, and had lower earnings than the comparison group. The study found that TAA participants had lower employment rates and earnings compared to the comparison group in the 16th quarter. The analysis highlighted limitations in evaluating the effectiveness of TAA-funded training, such as potential unobservable differences between groups and the impact of economic recessions on participants returning to the labor market. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was established in 1962 but saw limited use until the Trade Act of 1974 expanded benefits and eligibility. Despite lapses in authorization, the program remained funded through various legislative vehicles until the end of FY2001. The study noted that TAA participants returned to the labor market during an economic recession, while the comparison group returned before the recession, highlighting the impact of economic downturns on participants' employment rates and earnings. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was established in 1962 and saw limited use until the Trade Act of 1974 expanded benefits and eligibility. Despite lapses in authorization, the program remained funded through various legislative vehicles until the end of FY2001. Authorization for TAA was reauthorized and expanded through subsequent legislation, including the Trade Act of 2002, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, and Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009. The Omnibus Trade Act of 2010 extended the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program through February 12, 2011. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011 reauthorized TAA through December 31, 2014, and expanded eligibility and benefits. The expanded provisions expired after December 31, 2013. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was extended through December 31, 2014, with eligibility criteria and benefit levels reverting to 2002 levels after 2013. Funding was allocated for the program in FY2015 to continue full operation through that year."
