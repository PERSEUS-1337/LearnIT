The implications differ based on their legal status, whether they are legal permanent residents, nonimmigrants, or unauthorized aliens. The question arises whether Congress should consider relaxing immigration laws for foreign nationals affected by the hurricane. The total number of foreign nationals impacted by Hurricane Katrina remains unknown. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast region presents challenges for foreign nationals, with an estimated 270,000 foreign-born persons living in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi in 2004. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that over 130,000 naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, and nonimmigrants may be affected. Additionally, an estimated 20,000 to 35,000 unauthorized aliens are victims of the hurricane. This report focuses on immigration policy implications, including employment verification issues and noncitizen eligibility for federal benefits. Many victims of Hurricane Katrina lack personal identification documents due to evacuation, loss of personal items, and displacement. This poses challenges under immigration law, especially for employment. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires employers to verify employees' eligibility for federal benefits. Employers must verify employment eligibility and establish identity through specified documents for all employees, whether citizens or foreign nationals. It is illegal to hire anyone without first verifying their authorization to work in the United States. Employers must examine documents to ensure they are genuine and relate to the individual, without specifying which documents must be presented. There are three categories of documents: those establishing both identity and employment eligibility, those establishing identity only, and others. Employers must verify employment eligibility and establish identity through specified documents for all employees, whether citizens or foreign nationals. Failure to comply with the law may result in sanctions, including civil penalties and fines for hiring unauthorized individuals. The Department of Homeland Security stated that employers would not be sanctioned for hiring individuals evacuated or displaced due to certain circumstances. The Department of Homeland Security will not sanction employers for hiring individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina who are unable to provide identity and eligibility documents for the next 45 days. Employers still need to complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form, but documentation normally required is not available due to the hurricane. After 45 days, further recommendations will be made regarding this policy. The moratorium on sanctioning employers due to Hurricane Katrina has broad implications and critics, such as Representative Lamar Smith, argue that federal agencies should not disregard laws protecting American jobs. USCIS announced that records in its New Orleans office were undamaged and will verify identity before re-issuing immigration documents for hurricane victims. On September 21, 2005, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3827, the Immigration Relief for Hurricane Katrina Victims Act of 2005. The bill authorizes DHS to waive employer verification requirements for 90 days and provide temporary identity and employment authorization documents for those affected by Hurricane Katrina. Lack of documentation is a challenge for all victims, including noncitizens, seeking federal assistance. The eligibility of noncitizens for public assistance programs is determined by complex rules based on immigration status and arrival date in the US. Legislation is being considered to ease federal eligibility rules for Hurricane Katrina victims, including noncitizens. The key statute outlining eligibility rules for noncitizens seeking federal assistance is the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Noncitizens' eligibility for public assistance programs is determined by complex rules based on immigration status and arrival date in the US. Refugees, asylees, and certain qualified aliens are eligible for SSI benefits, Medicaid, TANF, and food stamps based on specific criteria such as work history or military connection. Medicaid coverage is required for all eligible individuals. LPRs receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, continue to be eligible for Medicaid coverage. Disabled LPRs who were legally resident as of that date are also eligible for SSI. LPRs receiving government disability payments are eligible for food stamps if they meet noncitizen eligibility tests. Elderly LPRs and LPR children are eligible for food stamps. LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, are barred from TANF and Medicaid for five years. Legislation introduced to provide emergency relief to Hurricane Katrina victims, including legal immigrants treated as refugees for food stamps. Unauthorized aliens are denied most federal benefits under the PRWOR of 1996. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 restricts unauthorized aliens from accessing federal benefits such as earned income tax credit, social services block grants, and migrant health centers, unless they fall within specific exceptions like emergency medical treatment under Medicaid and short-term disaster relief. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 limits unauthorized aliens' access to federal benefits, except for specific exceptions like emergency medical treatment and short-term disaster relief. Additionally, unauthorized aliens may receive certain benefits under specific conditions, such as Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. The P.L.104-193 restricts unauthorized aliens from most state and locally funded benefits, aligning with federal benefit restrictions. However, noncitizens can still receive short-term emergency disaster relief and necessary community-level assistance for life and safety. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act mandates nondiscrimination and equitable treatment in disaster assistance efforts by FEMA. This includes ensuring supplies distribution, application processing, and other relief activities are done without discrimination based on race, color, religion, nationality, sex, age, or economic status. FEMA assistance under the Stafford Act includes grants for temporary shelter and cash grants for uninsured individuals. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act mandates nondiscrimination in disaster assistance efforts by FEMA, including grants for temporary shelter, cash grants for uninsured individuals, temporary housing assistance, home repair grants, unemployment assistance, emergency food supplies, legal aid, and crisis counseling. Media reports suggest that fear of deportation, rather than restricted access to benefits, deters aliens from seeking emergency assistance after disasters like Hurricane Katrina. DHS assures that rescuers do not inquire about legal status during rescue operations. The FEMA response to Hurricane Katrina includes considerations for unauthorized aliens, with questions raised about sharing information with law enforcement. Immigration admissions are subject to various limits and preference categories, impacting eligibility for those affected by the hurricane. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina affects nonimmigrants with temporary visas, especially those with family relationships to U.S. citizens or LPRs. Many relatives are facing long backlogs for visa availability, with some waiting up to 12 years. Filipino family-sponsored immigrants have the longest waiting times. Consular officers are currently reviewing petitions from Filipino siblings of U.S. citizens filed 22 years ago. If the petitioner in the U.S. dies before the visa is issued, the prospective LPR is no longer eligible. Employers petition for prospective LPRs and must demonstrate qualifications for the job and INA preference category. Labor certification is issued if a labor shortage exists. If the petitioning employer can no longer employ the worker, the prospective LPR is no longer eligible for an immigrant visa. The \"Immigration Relief for Hurricane Katrina Victims Act of 2005\" (H.R. 3827) allows DHS to provide special immigration status to certain individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina, similar to provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act for 9/11 victims. This bill covers alien beneficiaries of immigration petitions, nonimmigrant fiance or fiancee K-visas, or labor certification applications filed before August 29, 2005, if the petitioner, applicant, or beneficiary died, was disabled, or lost employment due to the hurricane. H.R. 3827 extends immigration relief to individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina, including those who lost employment, were disabled, or died as a result of the hurricane. It also provides automatic extension of legal nonimmigrant visa status for certain visa holders impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, the bill covers spouses and children of refugees, asylees, or employment-based immigrants who died due to the hurricane. The bill extends immigration relief to individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina, including those who lost employment, were disabled, or died. It also covers spouses and children of refugees, asylees, or employment-based immigrants who died due to the hurricane. Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act granted immigration benefits to certain family members of those killed or disabled in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act provided immigration benefits to family members of those affected by the September 11 terrorist attacks, including orphans, spouses, and children of aliens who died or were disabled. It also extended legal nonimmigrant visa status to some nonimmigrant visa holders impacted by the attacks. The grounds of inadmissibility for foreign nationals seeking admission to the United States include barring those likely to become a public charge. All aliens applying for LPR visas must have binding affidavits of support from U.S. sponsors to prove financial stability. Sponsors must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, at least 18 years old, domiciled in the U.S., and able to support both their own family and the immigrating family members at 125% of the federal poverty guideline. The affidavit of support is a legally binding contract enforceable against the sponsor if the immigrant collects means-tested benefits. The issue is whether victims of Hurricane Katrina will be considered public charges for LPR visas if they cannot support their family at 125% of the federal poverty guideline. The INS defined \"public charge\" as someone primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The 1999 field guidance clarified that non-cash benefits are not considered in public charge determinations for immigrants, except for long-term care at government expense. Cash benefits for income maintenance are only considered if used by the immigrant directly. Family members' use of cash benefits is not attributed to the immigrant unless it is their sole means of support. Cash public assistance for income maintenance or long-term care may be considered in public charge determinations. The Attorney General has provided discretionary relief from deportation under certain conditions for aliens in the past. Blanket relief has been granted by suspending enforcement of immigration laws for specific groups. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) may be granted by the Secretary of DHS. The two common discretionary procedures for relief from deportation are deferred departure or deferred enforced departure (DED) and extended voluntary departure (EVD). Unlike TPS, aliens benefiting from EVD or DED do not need to register with USCIS but must apply for work authorization if they wish to work in the US. In the past, DED was granted to Chinese and Salvadorans by the George H.W. Bush Administration, and to Haitians by President Clinton. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, INS announced compassionate discretion for families of victims. Democratic Senators requested reassurance for immigrant victims of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Some foreign nationals affected by Hurricane Katrina are voluntarily leaving the US with the help of Mexican consular officials. Initially uncertain, there are now reports of unauthorized aliens who were victims of the hurricane being arrested, detained, and deported by ICE."
