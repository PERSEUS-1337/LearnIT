The Act includes provisions for income-based repayment plans, public service loan forgiveness programs, lowering interest rates for health professions, enhancing opportunities for minorities, and creating an Assistant Secretary for the evaluation and promotion of accessibility and affordability in higher education. According to information compiled by Campus Progress, Congress finds that total Federal student debt in the United States exceeded $617 billion in 2008. The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance estimated that between 1.7 to 3.2 million baccalaureate degrees will be lost this decade due to financial barriers. The average student graduates college with 25% more debt than a decade ago, entering a job market where salaries for college graduates have decreased. Additionally, the average college senior had $4,100 in credit card debt in 2008. According to a study by Sallie Mae, Inc., the average college senior had $4,100 in credit card debt in 2008 and $23,200 in student loans. Almost 7 in 10 college graduates are burdened with educational debt, with student debt outpacing starting salaries in certain fields, making it difficult for graduates to pursue careers in those areas. Nearly a quarter of graduates from public colleges and almost 4 in 10 graduates from private colleges have levels of student debt that would be unmanageable on the average starting teacher salary. The Nellie Mae Corporation's 2002 report revealed that college graduates delay major life decisions due to student debt, with percentages for delaying buying a house, marriage, and having children. The Education Trust's 2006 report highlighted that low-income high school graduates attend college at similar rates to wealthy families' lowest achieving students. The 2007-2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study showed that over 60% of minority students face a financial gap in funding their education. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to reduce the income-based repayment plan from 10% to 7% and the repayment period from 20 years to 15 years. Additionally, a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is established. Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to reduce the income-based repayment plan from 10% to 7% and the repayment period from 20 years to 15 years. A Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is also established. Additionally, loan cancellation provisions are updated to cancel a portion of the balance for borrowers who make monthly payments as required. The borrower's remaining balance on eligible Federal Direct Loans will be cancelled after making 120 monthly payments. TITLE III--LOWER INTEREST RATES FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS. Lowering of interest rates for health professions includes amending various sections of the Public Health Service Act to reduce interest rates on health professions student loans, physician assistants training programs, primary care loans, and nursing loan programs to 3.5 percent. Title IV focuses on enhancing opportunities for minorities. The Secretary of Education will award grants to eligible institutions to enhance opportunities for students. Eligible institutions must submit an application outlining their plan for the grant. The grant aims to increase educational program capacity, student graduation rates, and achieve grant purposes without raising costs for students. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. TITLE V--ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE EVALUATION AND PROMOTION OF ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. SEC. 501. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE EVALUATION AND PROMOTION OF ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. Section 202 of the Department of Education Organization Act is amended to include an Assistant Secretary for the Evaluation and Promotion of Accessibility and Affordability in Higher Education. This Assistant Secretary will evaluate actions to increase accessibility to higher education, opportunities for underserved minorities, capacity to educate medical personnel, and debt forgiveness for graduates. The Assistant Secretary for the Evaluation and Promotion of Accessibility and Affordability in Higher Education will assess the impact of the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, promote higher education accessibility and affordability, and submit quarterly reports to Congress on current trends. The Assistant Secretary will report to Congress on current trends in higher education accessibility and affordability, including recommendations on how to improve them."
