    "content": "The \"Health Insurance Stability Act of 2008\" allows for a refundable tax credit for individuals with COBRA continuation coverage due to termination of employment. This credit covers health insurance costs under a new section of the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Health Insurance Stability Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit for individuals with COBRA continuation coverage. The credit covers the amount paid for coverage of the taxpayer and qualifying family members. There are limitations on the credit amount based on monthly limitations and inflation adjustments. The \"Health Insurance Stability Act of 2008\" offers a tax credit for individuals with COBRA continuation coverage. The credit amount is adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. An eligible coverage month is defined as a month where the individual is covered by qualified health insurance. The \"Health Insurance Stability Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit for individuals with COBRA continuation coverage. To qualify, the individual must have qualified health insurance, no disqualifying coverage, and not be imprisoned. A month is considered eligible coverage if the individual was covered for 12 months in a 24-month period. A qualifying family member includes the taxpayer's spouse and dependents. Qualified COBRA continuation coverage is defined for tax credit purposes. For tax credit purposes, qualified COBRA continuation coverage refers to insurance that continues under specific circumstances. It excludes certain arrangements and insurance with mostly excepted benefits. Disqualifying coverage occurs if an individual has certain types of coverage at the start of a month. The individual must have employer-provided coverage, certain state-based or group coverage, or coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP to qualify for tax credits. The individual must have coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP, or certain other health benefits plans to qualify for tax credits. Special rules apply for coordination with advance payments of credit and recapture of excess advance payments. The recapture of excess advance payments under section 7529 reduces the tax credit allowed to the taxpayer for the taxable year. The tax imposed by section 1 is increased by any excess amount paid on behalf of the taxpayer under section 7529. The tax credit allowed to the taxpayer for the taxable year may be reduced by excess advance payments under section 7529. Amounts under subsection (a) cannot be used to determine deductions under sections 162(l), 213, or 224, or credits under section 35. Distributions from Archer MSAs or health savings accounts are not considered under subsection (a). No credit is allowed under this section to nonpermanent resident alien individuals. For individuals to qualify for the tax credit, they must not be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for the current taxable year, or be a dependent on another taxpayer's return. Married individuals must file a joint return to be eligible. Rules similar to those for insurance coverage of other individuals apply to qualified health insurance contracts under this section. The tax credit eligibility criteria include not being a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for the current taxable year, or being a dependent on another taxpayer's return. Married individuals must file a joint return to qualify. Payments made by the Secretary or the taxpayer for health insurance coverage are treated as being made on the first day of the month. The Secretary may prescribe regulations and guidance to implement this section, section 6050W, and section 7529. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
