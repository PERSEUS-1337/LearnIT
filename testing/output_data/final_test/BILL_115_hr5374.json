    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2018\". The Congress finds that public school students who are LGBT or perceived to be LGBT face discrimination, harassment, and violence, depriving them of equal educational opportunities. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is a severe problem, supported by social science studies. Discrimination, including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity leads to high rates of absenteeism, dropout, adverse health consequences, and academic underachievement among LGBT youth. This discrimination can also result in life-threatening violence and suicide. Public school students have constitutional rights that are violated when school officials are discriminatory or indifferent to such discrimination. The Act aims to protect students from discrimination, harassment, bullying, and violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Federal civil rights statutes do not explicitly include these protections, limiting legal recourse for affected students and parents. The Act aims to provide a Federal prohibition of discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, along with effective remedies and invoking congressional powers to enforce this prohibition. The Act aims to prohibit discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, allowing the Department of Education to enforce regulations effectively. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"program or activity,\" \"gender identity,\" and \"harassment\" in relation to public school education programs. The Act defines abusive behavior in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression. Public schools refer to elementary and secondary schools under educational agencies. Sexual orientation encompasses homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality. The term \"student\" refers to an individual enrolled in a public school or participating in its programs. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION; EXCEPTIONS. No student shall be excluded or discriminated against in any program receiving Federal financial assistance based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Harassment on these grounds is also considered discrimination. Retaliation or reprisal based on these factors is prohibited. The Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. It also prohibits retaliation for opposing unlawful conduct under the Act, including reporting, participating in investigations, or hearings related to such conduct. The Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. It also prohibits retaliation for opposing unlawful conduct under the Act, including reporting, participating in investigations, or hearings related to such conduct. Additionally, the Act prohibits providing false information to public schools or governmental entities in connection with violations of the Act. SEC. 5. FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT; REPORT TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. Federal departments and agencies providing financial assistance to education programs must comply with section 4 of the Act by issuing approved rules, regulations, or orders. Non-compliance may result in termination of assistance to recipients. The Act requires federal departments and agencies to terminate assistance to recipients found in non-compliance after a hearing. Termination is limited to the specific entity and program where noncompliance occurred, or by other authorized means if voluntary compliance is not possible. If a Federal department or agency fails to comply with a requirement, they must submit a written report to the relevant House and Senate committees before any action can take effect, with a 30-day waiting period. SEC. 6. CAUSE OF ACTION. An aggrieved individual can assert a violation of the Act in a judicial proceeding and may be awarded various forms of relief. This section does not prevent individuals from seeking other remedies under different laws or require them to exhaust administrative processes before seeking redress. The statute of limitations for actions under this section is determined by title 28 of the United States Code. In accordance with the law (42 U.S.C. 1983), actions can be taken in the forum State. State immunity under the 11th Amendment is not applicable for violations of the Act, and receiving Federal financial assistance waives sovereign immunity. Remedies for violations are available against States to the same extent as against other entities. Attorney's fees are addressed in Section 8. SEC. 8. ATTORNEY'S FEES. Section 722(b) of the Revised Statutes is amended to include the Student Nondiscrimination Act of 2018. SEC. 9. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. The Act does not override existing Federal and State nondiscrimination laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The obligations under this Act are additional to those imposed by existing laws. The Disabilities Act of 1990 does not affect free speech and expression laws or the rights of religious student groups under other Federal laws. This includes protections for freedom of speech and expression, as well as rights available to religious and other student groups under the 1st Amendment to the Constitution and the Equal Access Act. SEC. 10. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act takes effect 60 days after enactment and does not apply to conduct before that date."
