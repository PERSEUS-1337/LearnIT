    "title": "SB 507",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 6603 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to provide individuals subject to this article with the right to a trial by jury, assistance of counsel, access to relevant medical and psychological records, and the ability to retain experts. Indigent individuals will have counsel appointed by the court and may request assistance in obtaining an expert for their defense. The attorney petitioning for commitment also has the right to demand a jury trial. If the attorney petitioning for commitment under this article needs updated evaluations or replacement evaluations, they can request the State Department of State Hospitals to perform them. The evaluations will be forwarded to the petitioning attorney and the person subject to this article. Updated or replacement evaluations will only be done as necessary to update original evaluations or replace unavailable evaluators. The State Department of State Hospitals can provide updated or replacement evaluations for commitment proceedings if needed. These evaluations involve reviewing medical and psychological records, consulting with current clinicians, and interviewing the person being evaluated. If there is a split opinion, two additional evaluations will be conducted by the State Department of State Hospitals. The evaluator may no longer be available to testify for the petitioner in court proceedings if they fail to adhere to protocols, have their license suspended or revoked, are unavailable according to Evidence Code Section 240, or resign without entering a new contract. This is determined by the Director of State Hospitals. The court may notify the State Department of State Hospitals of the trial outcome within 72 hours. The defense can present relevant evidence, and a unanimous verdict is required in a jury trial. DNA testing rights are not limited, and the State Department of State Hospitals can conduct additional evaluations in case of split opinions. The evaluator performing an updated evaluation must include a statement listing all records reviewed, which can be subpoenaed by either party. These records can only be used in proceedings under this article and must not be disclosed for any other purpose. The party can object to the introduction of subpoenaed records at trial if they are more prejudicial than probative or not material to the case. If relief is granted, the records will retain confidentiality. This does not affect the right to seek other records related to the case. The party can object to the introduction of subpoenaed records at trial if they are more prejudicial than probative or not material to the case. If relief is granted, the records will retain confidentiality. This does not affect the right to seek other records related to the case. Except as provided, this subdivision does not affect any right of a committed person to assert that records are confidential. Nothing in this act is intended to affect the determination by the Supreme Court of California in a specific case regarding the entitlement of an expert to review confidential treatment information."
