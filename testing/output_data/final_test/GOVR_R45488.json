    "content": "The growing interest in LNG as a maritime fuel is driven by new regulations and increased supply. While LNG has been used as a secondary fuel, using it as a primary fuel is a recent development. This shift could help reduce emissions, create a new market for domestic natural gas, and boost the domestic shipbuilding industry. However, specialized infrastructure and regulatory oversight would be needed for LNG bunkering operations in U.S. ports. The report discusses impending International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards on sulfur content in shipping fuels, market conditions for LNG as a bunker fuel, and the current status of LNG bunkering globally and in the United States. Regulatory oversight and safety implications are key considerations for LNG bunkering operations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards on sulfur emissions from ships, established in 2008, have prompted vessel operators to seek alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Annex VI of the IMO's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) sets limits on nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions and sulfur content in vessel fuels. By 2020, the maximum sulfur content in vessel fuels must be reduced from 4.5% to 0.5%. Vessel operators must use low-sulfur fuels or install exhaust gas-cleaning systems to comply with the regulations. MARPOL is enforced in the United States through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. The United States ratified MARPOL Annex VI in 2008 through the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act, requiring joint enforcement by the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA. Annex VI sets global sulfur standards and establishes Emissions Control Areas (ECAs) with stricter emissions controls. The North American ECA limits sulfur content to 0.1% in bunker fuel, enforced by Coast Guard and EPA within 200 miles of U.S. waters. The IMO 2020 standards are enforced by the Coast Guard and EPA in waters up to 200 miles from shore. Most ships in the North American ECA meet emissions requirements by switching to low-sulfur fuels. The European Union and China are also considering similar sulfur limits. The requirement applies to vessels over 400 gross tons, estimated to cover about 110,000 vessels worldwide. Ship owners can meet the requirements by burning low-sulfur fuel or installing scrubbers. About 55,000 vessels currently burn high-sulfur fuel. The IMO 2020 standards require ship owners to comply by switching to low-sulfur fuel oils or distillate fuels, installing scrubbers, or using LNG-fueled engines. Analysts predict increased demand and higher prices for low-sulfur fuel due to widespread adoption of the regulations. This switch may also reduce demand for high-sulfur fuels, leading to a price spread between low- and high-sulfur bunkers fuels. Switching to lower-sulfur fuel could increase fuel cost across the industry by up to $60 billion in 2020 for full compliance with the IMO standards. Scrubbers are systems that remove sulfur from a vessel's engine exhaust emissions, allowing a ship to meet the IMO 2020 standard while using conventional high-sulfur fuel. Retrofitting a scrubber on an existing engine can cost several million dollars. Installing scrubbers on ships to capture sulfur emissions can be costly, with estimates of around $4.2 million for a typical tanker. The payback time for this investment is approximately 4.8 years. However, there may be additional costs for refitting or replacing scrubbers to comply with future IMO standards for greenhouse gas emissions. The financial impact of scrubber adoption depends on fuel costs, as they allow vessels to continue using cheaper high-sulfur fuel. The return on investment for scrubbers is influenced by the prices of high- and low-sulfur bunker fuels. The implementation of IMO standards in 2020 will impact fuel prices for low-sulfur and high-sulfur fuels based on vessel usage. Limited scrubber adoption may increase demand for low-sulfur fuel, raising prices. Alternatively, high-sulfur fuel costs could rise due to refinery cutbacks. Uncertainty surrounds the market distortions from scrubber installation, with around 660 ships retrofitted and over 600 ships in progress as of September 2018. In 2018, around 660 ships were retrofitted with scrubbers and over 600 ships were under construction for scrubber installation. Analysts predict that by 2020, up to 2,000 vessels could have scrubbers installed. However, the current capacity for scrubber installations is limited to 300 to 500 ships per year. Another option for compliance with IMO 2020 sulfur standards is switching to LNG engines, which emit minimal sulfur oxides and reduce particulate matter emissions. Switching to LNG engines can reduce particulate matter emissions and potentially emit less CO2 compared to conventional fuels. However, there may be increased methane emissions and higher costs associated with installing LNG-fueled engines on ships. Retrofitting existing ships with LNG engines is less desirable due to space constraints, and retraining crews may also add to the costs. Despite the initial investment, LNG engines may offer fuel cost advantages over petroleum-based engines. Switching to LNG engines for ships can result in fuel cost advantages over petroleum-based engines. The 1920 Merchant Marine Act requires U.S. domestic transport vessels to be built domestically, with many new ships receiving federal loan guarantees. The Maritime Administration now considers LNG-fueled engines as an \"alternative energy technology,\" making ships with LNG-capable engines more likely to receive loan approvals. Since the establishment of the North American ECA in 2015, Jones Act coastal ship operators have been transitioning their fleets to use cleaner fuels like LNG. Three Jones Act operators shipping goods to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have received or ordered LNG-fueled vessels from U.S. shipyards. Harvey Gulf International has deployed five LNG-powered offshore supply vessels for oil rig services. Some Jones Act tanker operators are opting for LNG-ready engines or scrubbers for their fleets, with no requirement for these components to be manufactured in the U.S. Seagoing barges, including articulated tug barges, are a significant part of the domestic coastal fleet for moving liquid cargoes. Bunkering vessels in U.S. waters must be Jones Act compliant, with LNG bunkering vessels becoming more prevalent. LNG may be a cheaper fuel option in the long run. Recent energy sector trends suggest that LNG may be cheaper in the long-run than petroleum-based, low-sulfur fuels. LNG prices are correlated to oil prices, with long-term contracts linking them. Shale gas production in the US since 2008 has significantly lowered natural gas prices. Liquefying natural gas into LNG adds around $2/MMBtu to production costs. The cost of LNG at a U.S. port is around $6/MMBtu, with an additional $1 to $2/MMBtu for shipping to Asia or Europe. LNG delivered overseas would cost $7 to $8/MMbtu under long-term contracts. The U.S. market offers the lowest-priced LNG, while Northern Asia has the highest prices due to limited pipeline gas supplies and distance from suppliers. Prices for Japan LNG have generally been cheaper than low-sulfur fuel and more expensive than high-sulfur fuel on an energy-equivalent basis over the last five years. Spot prices for LNG deliveries to Japan fell below $6/MMBtu in 2016 from a high above $16/MMBtu in 2013. Low-sulfur gas oil prices have doubled, and high-sulfur fuel oil prices have tripled since 2016. The volatility of bunker fuel markets and the global LNG market lead to unpredictability in relative prices among fuels. LNG may become more price-competitive versus low-sulfur fuel as the 2020 IMO sulfur standards take effect. Many analysts predict prices for low-sulfur gas oil to increase significantly after 2020 due to rising demand driven by standards. LNG may lose its price advantage over residual fuel oils if high-sulfur fuel prices collapse post-2020 IMO regulations. Variability in LNG prices by region poses challenges for global shipping lines seeking low-priced fuel worldwide. The regional variability in natural gas markets affects the economics of LNG bunkering. Additional costs for marketing, storing, and transporting LNG in bunkering operations could lead to ports charging rates above spot market prices. Despite potential savings from using LNG, it may take years to recoup the capital costs of switching fuels. As of May 2018, there were 122 LNG-powered vessels in operation and 135 ordered or under construction. The Norwegian government has subsidized LNG-fueled vessels with a \"NO x Fund,\" providing an exemption from the country's tax on NO x emissions. Some vessel owners opt for \"LNG-ready\" engines for future conversion to LNG. Growth in LNG-powered vessels by 2030 is uncertain due to slow growth in the shipping industry, potentially resulting in fewer orders. The shipping industry has seen slower growth in vessel orders, leading to fewer orders for LNG-powered vessels. Despite this, the demand for LNG from the shipping industry could still be high, especially for cruise ships, vehicle ferries, and container ships. One quarter of cruise ships on order and a major container ship line have already adopted LNG as bunker fuel. CMA CGM announced ordering nine LNG-powered container ships with fuel tanks displacing minimal cargo space. LNG adoption may be less likely for oil tankers due to spot market operations. Dry bulk cargo vessels also operate in the tramp market. LNG-powered vessels have lower emissions than those using petroleum-derived fuels. LNG adoption for vessels may have lower exhaust emissions compared to petroleum-derived fuels, but the lifecycle GHG emissions from natural gas production complicate the comparison. Studies suggest varying benefits of LNG in reducing GHG emissions, with further research needed. Despite uncertainty about environmental benefits, pairing LNG engines with newer vessel designs could reduce onboard GHG emissions in the short term. However, meeting future GHG emission standards could be a challenge for ship owners, with concerns that LNG-fueled ships might become less viable if limits are established well before 2050. This could lead to a decrease in orders of LNG-powered ships over time, considering the typical lifespan of commercial vessels is over 20 years. Compliance with potential regulations is a key factor for firms ordering new ships. In the future, renewable fuels like biodiesel could compete with LNG-powered ships. The key requirement for ocean carriers to use LNG as fuel is the availability of LNG bunkering facilities, which require specialized infrastructure for supply and storage. LNG bunkering could involve transporting LNG to a port from an offsite facility or delivering it directly to vessels in port via truck or supply vessel. LNG bunkering can be done via truck-to-vessel method, which allows fueling capabilities without large upfront investments. LNG can also be brought to a storage tank at the port by tanker trucks and then bunkered to ships via pipeline. Truck-to-ship bunkering is suitable for smaller and mid-sized vessels. LNG bunkering via truck-to-ship method is ideal for smaller and mid-sized vessels like ferries or offshore supply vessels. On-site liquefaction facilities offer the highest capacity for large vessels, but require significant planning and investment, around $70 million for a mid-sized port. Each LNG bunkering option in Figure 3 can be a starting point for LNG bunkering service in a port, but practical constraints may arise as bunkering scales up. Additional infrastructure or supply vessels may be needed for moving LNG to other port locations. The development of LNG bunkering operations is growing, with potential constraints on port capacity and timing. European ports are leading in early adoption, with a mandate for LNG bunkering infrastructure by 2025 for marine ports and by 2030 for inland ports, supported by European Commission funds. Additional investments may be required as LNG bunkering scales up. The European Commission funds LNG bunkering infrastructure development in European coastal ports, with over 40 ports currently operational. LNG bunkering is also growing in Asia, led by Singapore, which plans to subsidize the construction of two LNG bunkering vessels. Singapore has signed a memorandum of understanding with 10 partners to promote LNG bunkering at ports globally. Japan is implementing vessel-to-vessel LNG bunkering at the Port of Keihin by 2020. Asian countries, Australia, and the UAE have around 10 coastal ports offering LNG bunkering, with 15 projects in development. Some operations in Europe and Asia are linked to existing LNG terminals, while smaller projects often use trucking. LNG bunkering operations are expanding globally, with various countries and regions developing infrastructure to support LNG bunkering at ports. In the United States, LNG bunkering currently takes place in Jacksonville, FL, Port Fourchon, LA, and soon in Tacoma, WA. South America also has potential for significant LNG bunkering operations in the near future. Additionally, plans for LNG-fueled cruise ships bunkering in Port Canaveral, FL are underway. Jacksonville is currently the largest LNG bunkering operation in a U.S. port. Jacksonville is the largest LNG bunkering operation in a U.S. port, with facilities operated by JAX LNG and Eagle LNG. JAX LNG initially started truck-to-ship refueling in 2016, but now uses ship-to-ship bunkering with the Clean Jacksonville bunker barge. Eagle LNG provides LNG bunkering sourced from a plant in West Jacksonville and is constructing an on-site liquefaction and vessel bunkering facility at the port. These facilities are expected to establish Jacksonville as a key player in LNG bunkering. Harvey Gulf International Marine has established LNG bunkering operations in the Gulf of Mexico, with a $25 million facility at Port Fourchon for LNG storage and bunkering services. Puget Sound Energy is proposing an LNG liquefaction and bunkering facility at the Port of Tacoma, WA. TOTE Maritime is retrofitting engines of container ships for LNG use at the Port of Tacoma, WA. A proposed LNG facility there aims to produce 500,000 gallons per day, serving LNG-powered vessels and local gas utility systems. The $310 million project faces regulatory review amid community and environmental concerns. Puget Sound Energy's LNG facility opening delayed until 2020 or later due to permitting issues. Q-LNG Transport, partially owned by Harvey, orders two LNG bunkering barges for ship-to-ship fueling. First barge to fuel LNG-fueled cruise ships in Port Canaveral, sourced from Elba Island LNG terminal. Plans for on-site LNG storage facility in the future. U.S. LNG bunkering activities have been limited to domestic vessels, with plans for expansion to foreign-flag ships. Domestic ports near LNG terminals may anchor bunkering operations. LNG can be sourced from terminals and transported by various means. The distance between Port Canaveral and Elba Island is 230 nautical miles, indicating the feasible sourcing range for LNG. Based on the proximity of U.S. ports to existing LNG terminals, it is feasible for LNG bunkering to be accessible for every U.S. port along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of Mexico. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach on the West Coast are close to the Costa Azul LNG terminal in Ensenada, MX. Seattle and Tacoma could be served by the proposed Tacoma LNG bunkering project. The potential for LNG bunkering in Seattle and Tacoma could be sourced from an existing LNG port facility in Vancouver, BC, which is expanding to provide LNG bunkering services. Alaska's inactive LNG export terminal could also supply LNG bunker fuel in the Pacific Northwest. Additional investment in infrastructure would be needed for regional bunkering operations. Cheniere Energy sees vessel bunkering as a source of future LNG demand growth worldwide. LNG bunkering is seen as a source of future demand growth worldwide. The IMO adopted safety standards for ships using natural gas as a bunker fuel in 2015, which apply to all new ships and conversions. The standards cover engine design, LNG storage tanks, distribution systems, and training requirements for crews. The Coast Guard and other U.S. federal agencies have jurisdiction over domestic LNG storage infrastructure and bunkering operations. The Coast Guard issued guidelines for safe LNG bunkering operations in 2015 and 2017, advising on risk assessment for facilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has jurisdiction over LNG terminal siting and operations under the Natural Gas Act of 1938. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority over the construction and operation of LNG terminals, including modifications and extensions. FERC may require permits for LNG bunkering facilities to be amended if added to existing terminals. Other federal agencies, such as the Coast Guard and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, also have jurisdiction over specific aspects of LNG bunkering operations in U.S. ports. Compliance with safety regulations from agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration may be necessary for LNG facilities. The administration regulates Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Other federal agencies may also regulate aspects of LNG bunkering projects. Global LNG production is increasing rapidly, driven by growth in the natural gas sector in new regions. Projections show a significant increase in LNG supply from new liquefaction projects, potentially exceeding demand. LNG supply from new liquefaction projects may surpass demand, leading to lower prices. This could also expand options for LNG bunkering in more ports. Estimating LNG demand in the maritime sector is complex, with projections suggesting a growth in LNG-powered vessel construction to meet a potential demand of 20 to 30 MMt per year by 2030. The LNG bunkering market in the maritime sector could potentially create a significant new market for LNG suppliers, with projections estimating a market worth $2.9 billion to $5.8 billion by 2030. However, predicting key variables such as natural gas and crude oil prices, new vessel orders, and emissions technology costs is challenging. The IMO sulfur standards and development of new LNG supply and bunkering infrastructure globally will impact the growth of the market. The United States, as a leading global natural gas producer since 2009, has a strong interest in new sources of natural gas demand. With the growth of domestic LNG supply and bunkering infrastructure, considerations such as domestic shipbuilding opportunities and LNG safety and security also play a role in influencing the LNG bunkering market in the U.S. North America, primarily the United States, is expected to lead in adding new LNG production capacity through 2030. The United States is expected to lead in adding new LNG production capacity through 2030. Currently, there are projects operating, under construction, and likely to be developed. The increase in liquefaction capacity will drive LNG producers to secure new buyers, with prices in North America being lower compared to other regions. The United States is a leading LNG producer with competitive prices for overseas transport. The country could become a key source of LNG for bunkering at major ports worldwide. Safety risks associated with LNG in vessel operations include leakage due to its extremely low storage temperatures. LNG bunkering poses hazards due to its extremely low storage temperatures. Care must be taken to prevent LNG spills on ship hulls or decking, as it can cause brittle fracture. Spilled LNG can vaporize into natural gas, leading to a pool fire that is intense and cannot be extinguished until all the LNG is consumed. The thermal radiation from an LNG pool fire can cause injuries and damage vessels or property at a considerable distance. Many experts consider large pool fires, especially on water, as the most serious LNG hazard. Leaks of boil-off gas can release natural gas into port areas, causing fires or explosions. Major LNG releases from carriers are most dangerous within 500 meters of the spill and pose risks up to 1,600 meters away. Bunkering operations with LNG can still be a significant concern, especially in ports conducting simultaneous operations during the process. Accidents during bunkering operations with LNG can lead to spills that threaten workers. LNG tankers, bunkering vessels, and facilities are vulnerable to terrorism, with potential attacks causing catastrophic fires in ports and nearby areas. Public and policymakers have long been concerned about terrorist attacks on LNG terminals or tankers in the United States. The ship-based supply chain for energy commodities, including LNG, is vulnerable to security threats. Concerns about terrorism risks to LNG bunkering infrastructure exist, with potential for widespread impact if operations expand. The Coast Guard has authority over hazardous material security in maritime shipping under the MTSA and has developed port security plans to prevent terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard assesses marine vessel vulnerability to terrorist attacks and implements port security measures under the MTSA. The IMO's MARPOL Annex VI sets emissions standards for vessels, including sulfur limits, which apply to all member nations. Commitment to these standards predates the U.S. shale gas boom and is independent of specific energy policies. The U.S. shale gas boom was not anticipated by the IMO framework. Changes in the international shipping fleet are driven by market forces, not a preference for one fuel over another. The question is whether international adoption of LNG as a bunker fuel could create an economic opportunity for the United States. The LNG bunker fuel market could grow to several billion dollars by 2030, potentially benefiting U.S. natural gas producers, shipbuilders, and infrastructure developers. The potential growth of the LNG bunker fuel market to several billion dollars by 2030 could benefit U.S. natural gas producers, shipbuilders, and infrastructure developers. Opportunities for domestically-constructed LNG bunkering barges and new port infrastructure development could lead to economic growth and job creation in engineering, construction, and operation sectors. LNG bunkering presents economic opportunities for the United States but may also pose challenges. Rising demand in the maritime sector could impact natural gas prices for domestic consumers. The U.S. is a major producer of natural gas and crude oil, as well as a key bunkering hub. Vessel conversion to LNG could affect demand for U.S. natural gas and crude oil. The environmental impact of LNG on emissions from vessels needs to be balanced with potential increases in emissions from natural gas production and transportation. The environmental impact of LNG bunkering and transportation is uncertain, with ongoing studies and debates in the natural gas industry. The construction of LNG bunkering infrastructure, like the Tacoma LNG project, can create jobs but raises concerns about safety, security, and environmental impact. The adaptation of the global shipping fleet to IMO sulfur standards adds further uncertainty to decisions regarding private investment and public policy. LNG-fueled ships currently make up a small fraction of the U.S. and global fleets, and it may take decades to see significant benefits. Alternative ship fuels such as biofuels, electric engines, and hybrid engines could become more economically viable in the future. The future of LNG as a ship fuel is uncertain, making it hard to predict potential benefits or costs. Congress could support LNG bunkering growth through tax incentives, addressing regulatory barriers, and providing technical support. Alternatively, Congress could incentivize competing bunker fuel options like biofuels. Policies affecting LNG bunkering growth could also be influenced by Congress. Congress could impact LNG bunkering growth through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry. Changes in federal regulation or the Jones Act could also affect LNG bunkering economics. Evaluating implications on LNG bunkering of broader energy, environmental, or economic objectives may be a consideration for congressional oversight. Congress may also examine safety and security measures for LNG vessels and facilities if LNG bunkering expands in U.S. ports."
