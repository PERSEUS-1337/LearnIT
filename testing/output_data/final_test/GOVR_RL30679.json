    "content": "The South Caucasus region, comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, has historical, cultural, and economic ties with neighboring countries. Russian and Soviet influence lasted until 1991, impacting development and nationality relations. After gaining independence, the states faced economic challenges and conflicts that threatened their existence. The South Caucasus states have faced economic challenges and conflicts since gaining independence from Russian and Soviet influence in 1991. Despite appearing more stable in recent years, they remain weak compared to neighboring powers. The region's internal and external security concerns, including threats from neighboring powers like Russia, are discussed in this report. The states' internal weaknesses, such as political and economic instability, ethnic conflicts, and crime, make them less able to address external threats. U.S. security ties with the South Caucasus states have increased in response to these challenges. In the late 1990s, U.S. policy towards Armenia aimed to strengthen security and prosperity by resolving conflicts with Azerbaijan and normalizing relations with Turkey. The U.S. also supported efforts to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and enhance regional security partnerships. Assistant Secretary of Defense Alexander Vershbow emphasized U.S. support for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty, rejecting spheres of influence in the region. The U.S. will continue to deepen its assistance to Georgia, considering the needs of the Georgian people, regional security, and democratic and economic reforms. The United States provided security assistance to the region before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The United States provided security assistance to Georgia and other states in the region before and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This aid facilitated anti-terrorism cooperation and support for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, including overflight rights and information sharing. The U.S. also supported efforts to prevent the use of territories as conduits for terrorist activities. Additionally, there was a strategic focus on energy supplies from the Caspian region, with initiatives to build pipelines not controlled by Iran or Russia. The Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to strengthen U.S. energy security by expanding oil and gas suppliers in the Caspian region. Support for a \"Southern Corridor\" route through Central Asia, South Caucasus, and Turkey to Europe was endorsed to avoid reliance on routes through Iran or Russia. Congress has backed U.S. assistance for independence, security, and reforms in the South Caucasus, but questions remain about the effectiveness of U.S. involvement in the region. Congress has provided aid for Armenia, Georgia, and Nagorno Karabakh, with attention to U.S. policy towards the South Caucasus. In the early 1990s, aid to Azerbaijan was prohibited until certain conditions were met. After 9/11, a waiver was granted for Azerbaijan's assistance in the war on terrorism. The United States Congress has allocated funding for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in North Korea and the South Caucasus region. Aid was provided for border security programs in Georgia to fortify borders with Russia and Chechnya. The Security Assistance Act of 2000 authorized aid for the South Caucasus states to strengthen national control of borders and promote independence. Millions of dollars were committed to facilitate the closure of Russian military bases in Georgia. The United States Congress allocated millions of dollars to help Georgia recover from the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict and support its NATO aspirations. Congress also condemned Russia's invasion and provided increased aid for Georgia's rebuilding. Congressional concerns about Russian military and economic coercion against Georgia were reflected in legislation criticizing Russian actions. Outside players involved in the South Caucasus region include Russia, Turkey, Iran, the United States, and the European Union. These players have both complementary and competing interests towards the regional states. Russia sees the region as a traditional sphere of influence, Iran views Azerbaijan and Armenia as part of a \"new Middle East,\" Turkey emphasizes common ethnic ties with Azerbaijan and Central Asia, the EU focuses on the region as part of the wider \"European Neighborhood,\" and the US prioritizes antiterrorism and energy diversity. Neighboring states are drawn into the region due to perceived threats to their interests. Since the early 1990s, Iran has been concerned about Azerbaijanis calling for secession in Iran's ethnic Azerbaijani areas. Iran has increased efforts to suppress ethnic Azerbaijanis advocating for human rights, autonomy, or secession. Instability in Chechnya and other areas along Russia's North Caucasus borders has threatened Russia's security, leading to Russian intervention in the South Caucasus. Russia has tried to boost influence in the region to counter U.S. anti-terrorism assistance, but faced setbacks for most of the decade. In the early 1990s, Iran became concerned about secession calls from Azerbaijanis in its ethnic Azerbaijani areas. Russia intervened in the South Caucasus due to security threats from instability in Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions. Despite setbacks, Russia increased its influence in the region to counter U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. In 2003, Georgia's \"rose revolution\" strengthened ties with the U.S., challenging Russian interests. Russia withdrew its military base in Georgia in 2007 but invaded Georgia in 2008, recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence. Western oil and gas firms have heavily invested in Azerbaijan, supplementing aid from international institutions. The region also benefits from remittances sent by its citizens. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia rely on remittances from their citizens working abroad, particularly in Russia. However, Russia's restrictions on non-citizen labor and economic downturn threaten these remittances. External powers like Iran, Turkey, and Russia compete for influence in the South Caucasus but may agree not to foster instability that could spill across borders. Iran and Russia cooperate to retain regional influence. All seek control over regional energy resources, aiming for a balance of power. Turkey and Russia are increasing cooperation on energy, potentially challenging EU and U.S. plans for alternative oil and gas export routes. Regional states prioritize their own strategic interests in dealing with outside powers, despite concerns over foreign invasion. Regional security cooperation is slow to develop, leading to conflicts and searches for external support. The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over NK has influenced foreign lobbying efforts by the states and separatist areas. Armenia seeks security and economic ties with Russia and Iran to counter Azerbaijan's ties with Turkey. President Serzh Sargisyan prioritizes friendly relations with Russia, while relations with Turkey remain strained. Armenia's relations with Turkey have been strained due to historical issues, including Turkey's denial of the Armenian genocide. Despite obstacles, there were efforts to normalize ties, leading to the signing of protocols for establishing diplomatic relations in 2009. Armenia and Turkey signed protocols in 2009 to establish diplomatic relations and open their common border within two months after ratification by their legislatures. They also agreed to conduct regular political consultations and dialogue on historical issues to restore mutual confidence. The Armenia-Turkey protocols signed in 2009 aimed to establish diplomatic relations and open the common border. Both countries agreed to address historical issues, set up a bilateral commission, and make use of existing infrastructure for cooperation. The Armenian government emphasized the importance of international recognition of the Armenian genocide, while the Turkish government assured that the protocols would not harm Azerbaijan's interests. The Turkish government criticized a ruling on the Armenia-Turkey protocols in 2010, stating it did not conform with the text. Armenia delayed ratification, waiting for Turkey to move towards it, while Turkey waited for progress on the NK conflict. Azerbaijan's interest in Iran's Azerbaijani population and oilfield delineation with Russia and Kazakhstan were noted. Georgia focused on reversing Russia's control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgia prioritizes reversing Russia's control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia and strengthening ties with Turkey and the United States, rather than improving relations with Iran. Its Black Sea ports connect it to NATO members and countries around the Mediterranean, aligning it strategically with the West. The United States aims for impartial mediation in regional conflicts, but conflicting interests hinder progress. The South Caucasus region, marked by instability, faces deadlock due to the involvement of various powers and nationalist elements. The South Caucasus region is unstable with ethnic and civil conflicts, crime, corruption, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking. Ethnic tensions exist between Armenia and Azerbaijan, leading to displacement of populations. Secessionism by ethnic minorities is a primary security concern. Ethnic relations between Azerbaijanis and Georgians are less contentious. Borders do not align with ethnic populations, and regional cooperation to resolve security issues is limited. Secessionism by territorially-based ethnic minorities in Georgia and Azerbaijan, including Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, has been a major security concern. NK receives economic support from Armenia, while Abkhazia and South Ossetia are backed by Russia. Both Azerbaijan and Georgia experienced political turmoil in the early 1990s but later consolidated power under new constitutions in 1995. However, they faced political instability again in the 2000s, with Georgia undergoing the \"rose revolution\" in 2003 resulting in President Shevardnadze's ouster. In Georgia, President Shevardnadze was ousted in 2003 after a tainted election, while in Azerbaijan, a violent repression of oppositionists occurred after power was handed over to Heydar Aliyev's son in 2003. Armenia faced instability in 1998 when President Levon Ter-Petrossian was forced to resign, and later experienced political assassinations in 1999. In Armenia, Robert Kocharyan was re-elected president in a contentious race in 2003. Opposition protests against his re-election escalated in 2004, leading to arrests. The opposition criticized the lack of input in constitutional changes approved in 2005. After a disputed presidential election in 2008, opposition demonstrators alleging fraud were forcefully suppressed. The South Caucasus states faced a decline in living standards in the early 1990s, impacting their security and hindering economic recovery. Armenia resettled most refugees from Azerbaijan, while Azerbaijan lagged in improving housing for refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh. The South Caucasus states, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, face economic challenges and widespread poverty. Despite oil revenues in Azerbaijan, living standards for the poor remain low. The region has struggled with economic growth since the 2008 global downturn. Ethnic conflicts have hindered peace, stability, and development since gaining independence in 1991. Since gaining independence in 1991, the South Caucasus countries face budgetary burdens from arms races, caring for refugees, and ethnic conflicts. Azerbaijan has faced dissension from various ethnic groups, with some calling for secession or autonomy. The separatist Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has resulted in about 15,000 casualties since 1988. Since 1988, the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in Armenia and Azerbaijan has caused 15,000 casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugees. Georgia has faced autonomy calls in Ajaria and Javakheti regions. Conflict in South Ossetia in 1990 led to 1,500 deaths and displacement of ethnic Georgians. The separatist conflict in Georgia's Abkhaz region resulted in thousands of deaths and displaced persons, mostly ethnic Georgians. The 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict led to more displaced persons, with some unable to return home due to damage or coercion by militias. The Georgian government and international donors provided housing for many displaced persons. UNHCR reported nearly 340,000 internally displaced persons in Georgia by the end of 2009. The separatist conflict in Nagorno Karabakh has resulted in casualties and refugees in Armenia and Azerbaijan. The OSCE's \"Minsk Group\" began talks in 1992, leading to a cease-fire in 1994. The United States, France, and Russia co-chair meetings, but a peace settlement has been elusive. In late 1997, a new peace proposal was recognized by Azerbaijan and Armenia presidents, leading to protests and the resignation of Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in early 1998. Heydar Aliyev rejected a 1998 Minsk Group proposal in early 2001. The assassination of Armenian political leaders in late 1999 hindered the peace process. Talks in Key West, Florida in April 2001 with President Bush showed early Administration interest in a settlement. Negotiations on a fourth \"hybrid\" peace plan have been ongoing since 2005. The Minsk Group co-chairs proposed a settlement plan for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, including the phased redeployment of Armenian troops, demilitarization of territories, and a referendum for determining the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite some agreements on basic principles, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan lacked the political will to reach a settlement during peace talks in Bucharest in 2006. The presidents lacked the \"political will\" to make decisions about a settlement and suspended their \"shuttle diplomacy\" until they showed political will. Negotiations on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were described as \"intensive\" with little progress reported. Azerbaijani President Aliyev stated that the return of occupied areas and displaced persons must happen before determining Nagorno-Karabakh's status. Talks between the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia in June 2007 did not result in a breakthrough for settling the conflict. On November 29, 2007, former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner presented a draft text to the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, urging them to accept the Basic Principles for the Peaceful Settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict. Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister claimed the principles upheld territorial integrity while Armenia's stance was not disclosed. The Basic Principles for the Peaceful Settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict call for the phased return of territories to Azerbaijan, an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh with security guarantees, a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, and the right of displaced persons to return. Meetings between Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, along with the Minsk Group co-chairs, have taken place to discuss these principles. Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents met in 2008 to discuss NK conflict settlement. Azerbaijan's military parade raised concerns about potential conflict escalation. U.S. diplomats warned Aliyev against provocative statements. In 2008, Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents met to discuss the NK conflict settlement. Concerns were raised about Azerbaijan's military parade and the potential for conflict escalation. The United States warned that Azerbaijan does not have military superiority and that renewed conflict would jeopardize energy exports. Russian President Medvedev hosted talks in Moscow between the two presidents, resulting in a joint declaration upholding a mediating role for the Minsk Group. In 2009, Presidents Aliyev and Sargisyan met to discuss NK peace settlement issues, with Russia aiming to play a major role in mediating the conflict. Despite reported progress by the Minsk Group co-chairs, there were accusations of misinformation. Civil society representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan later met in NK, followed by President Medvedev hosting talks facilitated by the Minsk Group. In July 2009, President Medvedev hosted talks between Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents facilitated by the Minsk Group. In October 2009, Presidents Sargisyan and Aliyev discussed a possible settlement in Moldova. The Minsk Group co-chairs participated in the talks. In December 2009, foreign ministers urged completion of the Basic Principles for a comprehensive settlement. In December 2009, the Russian co-chair announced the preparation of \"renovated\" Madrid principles to be presented to Armenia and Azerbaijan. Presidents Aliyev and Sargisyan met in Sochi with President Medvedev in January 2010. They agreed on a preamble to the Madrid Principles and pledged to resolve remaining contentious aspects. In 1992, Abkhazia declared independence, leading to a UN observer mission and conflict with Georgian forces in 1993. In 1993, Abkhaz separatist forces routed Georgian forces. A political settlement framework was agreed upon in 1994, with Russian troops deployed as \"peacekeepers.\" The U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and other countries worked to facilitate a settlement, with sticking points including the return of displaced persons and Abkhazia's demand for independence. In July 2006, a warlord in northern Abkhazia renounced allegiance. In northern Abkhazia, a warlord renounced allegiance to the Georgian government, leading to a conflict with Georgian forces. Abkhazia accused Georgia of violating a cease-fire agreement by deploying military troops in the area. Peace talks were suspended, and tensions escalated when Russia increased its \"peacekeepers\" in Abkhazia in response to alleged Georgian military buildup in the Kodori Gorge. In the Kodori Gorge, forces and police were accused of preparing to attack the de facto Abkhaz government. 400 Russian paratroopers were deployed to Abkhazia to repulse possible Georgian attacks. In 2008, railway construction troops were sent for \"humanitarian\" work but left after repairing tracks and bridges. The region lobbied for joining North Ossetia in Russia or independence in 1989, leading to conflict triggered by former Georgian President Gamsakhurdia in 1990. In June 1992, Russia brokered a cease-fire in South Ossetia, where Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian \"peacekeeping\" units were stationed. The units consisted of around 1,100 troops, including Russians, North Ossetians, and Georgians. President Saakashvili increased pressure on South Ossetia in 2004 by tightening border controls and cracking down on smuggling operations involving Russian organized crime and corrupt Georgian officials. In 2008, tensions escalated in South Ossetia when Georgia accused of launching an artillery barrage against its capital, Tskhinvali, while South Ossetia bombed Georgian villages. This conflict followed inconclusive clashes and a referendum in South Ossetia reaffirming its \"independence\" from Georgia. Peace talks ceased after October 2007. Georgia reported intense bombing of Georgian villages in the conflict zone by South Ossetian forces. Despite a ceasefire appeal, South Ossetian forces escalated their shelling, prompting Georgia to send in troops that quickly took control of Tskhinvali and other areas. Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev condemned Georgia's actions, stating that Russian citizens were being harmed. In response, Russia launched air attacks across Georgia and sent troops to engage Georgian forces in Tskhinvali. President Bush emphasized the importance of respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. Russian troops had retaken Tskhinvali, occupied South Ossetia, and bombed various Georgian locations. Medvedev declared the operation successful and endorsed elements of an EU peace plan. The Georgian government accepted a French-brokered 6-point cease-fire plan presented by visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The plan included commitments to halt hostilities, withdraw forces to pre-conflict positions, and open international discussions on security in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia began a pullback of military forces on August 22, but substantial forces remained near South Ossetia's and Abkhazia's borders with Georgia and the port of Poti. The international community condemned Russia for violating the ceasefire accord by recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A follow-on ceasefire accord was signed by French President Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev, outlining the withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia's port of Poti and adjacent areas by September 15, and from areas near Abkhazia and South Ossetia by October 11. Georgian forces were to return to their barracks by October 1. The ceasefire accord signed by French President Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev outlined the withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia's port of Poti and adjacent areas by September 15, and from areas near Abkhazia and South Ossetia by October 11. International observers, including at least 200 from the EU, would be increased by October 1. Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent was deemed \"irrevocable\" by President Medvedev. The Russian defense minister called for retaining around 3,800 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, exceeding the troop ceilings permitted under ceasefire agreements. Russian military bases were being established in violation of the CFE Treaty, with EU monitors deployed and Russian troops announced to have withdrawn from buffer zones, although Georgia claimed troops remained in Akhalgori. Russia objected to the presence of OSCE observers in Georgia and vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for UNOMIG, leading to their withdrawal from Abkhazia. The EUMM is now the main monitoring group in the region, with 320 staff members in 2010, mainly from France and Germany, stationed in four field offices near the disputed borders. Assistant Secretary of Defense Alexander Vershbow and Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon praised the EUMM for its effectiveness in debunking misinformation. The EUMM has effectively debunked allegations by Russia and separatist regions of ceasefire violations by Georgia. The US and EU call for unrestricted access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia for monitoring. Vershbow and Gordon praised Georgia's cooperation with the EUMM, contrasting it with Russia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia's refusal to permit patrols in the regions. Assistant Secretary Gordon warned of Moscow's increasing control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. An international conference in Geneva discussed security, repatriation, and status issues related to the conflict in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia signed an agreement with separatists to guard administrative boundaries for five years. Economic dependency on Russia for the regions continues to grow. In February 2009, an \"incident prevention and response mechanism\" was set up along the South Ossetian border to defuse tensions. Russia insists on a non-use of force agreement and an arms embargo on Georgia. The first meeting of the incident team was held in Ergneti to address tensions along the South Ossetian border. The May 2009 Geneva conference faced challenges, including a Russian demand to exclude the UNOMIG acronym from a report. The U.N. Secretary General highlighted the continued erosion of the ceasefire regime due to the presence of Russian military equipment and personnel in the area. At the July 2009 Geneva conference meeting, discussions were held about establishing an incident prevention office along Abkhazia's border with Georgia. A special EU fact-finding mission led by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini released a report on the origins and outcome of the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, concluding that the Georgian artillery attack on Tskhinvali was not justifiable under international law. The report on the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict concluded that the Georgian artillery attack on Tskhinvali was not justifiable under international law. The mission also criticized Russian military actions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia as violations of international law, including illegal use of force and human rights violations. The U.S. State Department acknowledged that all sides made mistakes. The U.S. State Department acknowledged mistakes made by all sides in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. South Caucasus states and breakaway regions have alleged the presence of terrorist groups with political, ethnic, and religious goals. Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of sponsoring terrorism, while Georgian militias were reportedly involved in regaining control over South Ossetia in 2004. Russian defense officers allegedly assisted irregulars from Abkhazia, Transnistria, and Russia in carrying out attacks against ethnic Georgians during and after the conflict in August 2008. The August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict saw attacks against ethnic Georgians. South Caucasus governments have accused opposition parties of terrorism, but some violence is hard to attribute. Islamic extremism is a growing concern in Azerbaijan, with the government taking action against various terrorist groups. In mid-2006, Azerbaijani officials raised concerns about Islamic extremists targeting the country after threats from al Qaeda. Azerbaijan had been a conduit for international mujahidin supporting Chechnya's separatist leadership until Russia's incursion in 1999. Border controls were reinforced to deter foreign mujahidin, with increased interdiction efforts after September 11, 2001, leading to some success in suppressing these activities. Dozens of individuals have been convicted in Azerbaijan for involvement in terrorism. Several individuals in Azerbaijan have been convicted for supporting Chechen separatism, with some members of Jayshullah arrested in 1999. The leaders of Revival of Islamic Heritage were sentenced in 2003 for recruiting Azerbaijanis for paramilitary training in Chechnya. In 2005, a group called \"Al Qaeda Kavkaz\" received sentences for planning terrorist attacks in Baku. In Azerbaijan, individuals have been convicted for supporting Chechen separatism, with some arrested in 1999. In 2005, a group called \"Al Qaeda Kavkaz\" received sentences for planning terrorist attacks in Baku. In 2006, members of Jamaat al-Muwahidun and al Qaeda Caucasus International were sentenced for planning attacks on Western interests and engaging in terrorism. Azerbaijani authorities warned of ongoing activities by al Qaeda-linked Chechen rebels and an Iranian Shiite extremist group operating in the country. Islamic extremists, including the group \"72 Martyrs,\" were reported to be active in southern Azerbaijan, with an increase in recruitment and establishment of cells. The growth of Wahhabism was noted in northern areas bordering Chechnya and Dagestan. Azerbaijani authorities arrested fifteen members of the Northern Mahdi Army in January 2007 for plotting a coup to establish Shariah rule, with some receiving terrorist training in Iran. In November 2007, 18 alleged members of the Salafi Forest Brothers, including Saudi Arabian citizen Nail Abdul Kerim Al-Bedevi, were arrested for setting up terrorist jamaats in Sumgait and northern Azerbaijan. Thirteen more members were arrested in connection with the bombing of Baku's Abu Bekr Mosque in August 2008. Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security alleged that Ilgar Mollachiyev and Samir Mehtiyev had revived the Forest Brothers group and led the mosque bombing. Troops later raided the jamaat in northern Azerbaijan, killing three terrorists. In November 2007, members of the Salafi Forest Brothers were arrested for setting up terrorist jamaats in Azerbaijan. Troops raided a jamaat in northern Azerbaijan, killing three terrorists. In September 2008, Mollachiyev was killed in Dagestan. Azerbaijani security forces were still fighting terrorists in late 2008. In November 2008, Nail Abdul Kerim Al-Bedevi and others received prison terms. Georgian Zviadists attempted an assassination against President Shevardnadze in 1998. Georgian officials suspected a supporter of ousted Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze in a failed hand-grenade attack during President Bush's 2005 visit. Georgia dealt with \"third-country terrorists with links to al Qaeda,\" using the country for support. The US and Russia aided Georgia in combating mujahidin activities post-9/11. US concerns over international terrorists in Pankisi Gorge heightened after a call from a bin Laden operative on 9/11. President Bush explained the US decision in February 2002. In late 2002, Georgian forces launched operations in the Gorge to combat international terrorists. In March 2003, extra military and police forces were sent to prevent Chechen rebels from re-entering. Russia claimed terrorists remained in the gorge in 2004 but refused to renew the mandate of OSCE personnel monitoring the border. In response to border incursions, Russia claimed they were ineffective. The OSCE trained Georgian border guards, and Georgian police discovered hidden weapon caches in the Pankisi Gorge. Despite improved security measures, Georgia was still used as a transit state for weapons and money due to corruption at border checkpoints. Col. Andrey Sergeyev confirmed in 2007 that the Gorge was no longer a terrorist transit route. The Russian Border Directorate for the Chechen Republic reported potential border crossings from the Pankisi Gorge of Georgia. Lt. Gen. Anatoliy Zabrodin warned of Chechen terrorists in the Gorge, but Georgian Border Police denied their presence, stating that only Islamic fundamentalists were influential in local business. In early 2009, the Russian Federal Security Service claimed that terrorists had received training in the Pankisi Gorge and infiltrated Chechnya. Georgian officials denied the claim, but allegations persisted that Georgia was allowing terrorists to transit through the Gorge. Accusations of Al Qaeda presence in the Gorge were made by Russian officials, reaching a new level in October 2009. In late October 2009, a delegation visited the Pankisi Gorge to investigate Russian claims of Al Qaeda members receiving support from Georgia's security services. Georgia denied the accusations, with no signs of terrorists found in the Gorge according to delegation members and Georgian officials. Crime and corruption pose serious threats to democratization and economic growth in the region. The influx of foreign currency from investments and drug trafficking, along with low government salaries and weak laws, contribute to corruption. Saakashvili has taken steps to combat corruption by firing corrupt officials and implementing merit-based exams. Armenia saw a decrease in corruption during the 1990s, but progress has slowed since the early 2000s. In 2008, Azerbaijan ranked poorly in combating corruption, with little progress since 1996. Georgia, on the other hand, has made significant strides in fighting corruption. The South Caucasian states, including Azerbaijan, are becoming key drug trafficking routes from Afghanistan to Europe. The State Department warns that drug trafficking could increase significantly in Armenia once borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey open. Drug smuggling is a concern in Georgia, especially in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Previously, Chechen and al Qaeda terrorists in Georgia financed their activities through drug trafficking, but recent counter-terrorism actions have reduced this activity. Georgia's border control police and customs officials require more scanning equipment. Border control police and customs officials in Azerbaijan are in need of more scanning equipment and drug detection canines. Drug seizures have decreased in 2009, possibly due to a focus on responding to separatism in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Azerbaijan serves as a transit route for Afghan opiates entering from Iran and Central Asia, then smuggled to markets in Russia, Turkey, and Europe. Most illicit drugs enter from Iran, with increased government seizures at the Azerbaijan-Iranian border in 2009. Drug consumption is also on the rise in Azerbaijan. The South Caucasus states are implementing export control regimes to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There are nuclear research facilities and a nuclear power reactor in Armenia with inadequate security systems. Some radioactive materials from the Soviet era have been discovered. Border and customs officials are receiving training to prevent smuggling of WMD materials. The South Caucasus states seek assistance from Western donors and join international organizations to bolster their economic and defense capabilities. Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan have sought private investment, joined international organizations, and cooperated to a limited extent. Georgia was the first in the region to join the World Trade Organization, followed by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Georgia's role as a key conduit for oil and gas pipelines, along with its economic and democratic reforms, has positioned it as crucial for regional stability and security. Instability in Georgia could have ripple effects on the entire region. Georgia maintains working relations with other states in the region and Turkey, and is a member of GUAM with Azerbaijan. Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan have common interests in limited cooperation, facing separatism, wary of Russian influence, seeking oil and gas revenues, and being pro-Western. Armenia maintains good relations with Georgia for transport links to Russia. President Sargisyan navigated relations with Russia and Georgia post-2008 conflict. Georgia must balance relations with regional states to avoid favoritism accusations in the NK conflict. Armenia has growing ties with Iran, allowing for energy trade. Russia increased gas prices for all three states in 2006. In early 2006, Russia raised gas prices for Armenia, leading to the country giving up energy assets to Russian firms. Critics claim Russia now controls Armenia's energy supply. Russia also demanded price hikes for 2007 from all three states. Georgia faced a gas supply cut-off unless it agreed to a price hike or sold its gas pipeline to Gazprom. Georgia then negotiated for Azerbaijani gas via the South Caucasus Pipeline and continued purchasing gas from Gazprom. Azerbaijan also faced Russia's demands for higher prices. In 2007, Azerbaijan decided to stop buying Russian gas due to price and supply reductions. However, they agreed to purchase Russian electricity at a higher price. Despite poor relations, Gazprom continued to supply gas to Georgia in 2008-2009. Russia has an interest in maintaining supply to Georgia as some gas transits to Armenia. In 2009-2010, Gazprom supplied gas to both Georgia and Armenia, with a brief pipeline closure in December 2009 due to a bomb scare. In December 2009, a bomb scare led to a one-day closure of the gas pipeline in Russia's Ingushetia region. Gazprom announced a 17% gas price increase for Armenia in April 2010. A new gas pipeline from Russia to South Ossetia replaced the previous route through Georgian territory. Concerns were raised about Russia's United Energy Systems activities in Armenia and Georgia, including control over power systems and nuclear plants. In late 2003, UES acquired controlling interests in the Tbilisi electrical grid and power generation facilities in Georgia. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia have all faced challenges in building military forces to address regional conflicts and threats. Armenia has made progress in suppressing paramilitary forces and developing its armed forces with Russian assistance. Azerbaijan initially rejected ties with the Russian military, hindering its military development. Both Azerbaijan and Georgia relied on paramilitary forces for combating separatism, leading to civil disorder. The South Caucasus states have joined NATO's Partnership for Peace to modernize their armed forces and increase ties with Europe. Georgia sees PFP as a path to NATO membership for security against Russian threats. All three states agreed to participate in military and civil-military reforms with NATO in 2004-2005. NATO pledged enhanced attention to PFP members in the region. A Special Representative was appointed to promote democratic civil-military relations and transparency in defense planning and budgeting. NATO aims to promote democratic civil-military relations, transparency in defense planning, and interoperability with South Caucasus states. Russia is reassured of its regional role through participation in Partnership for Peace and the NATO-Russia Council. Georgia's application for \"Intensified Dialogue\" with NATO is approved, signaling progress in military reform but emphasizing the need for further reforms before NATO membership consideration. The Riga Summit in November 2006 reaffirmed support for an intensified dialogue to assist Georgia in implementing reforms. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 urged NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia. In February 2008, Georgia formally requested NATO to invite them to participate in a MAP. Despite not receiving a MAP at the April 2008 NATO Summit, Georgia was assured of future consideration. At the 2008 NATO Summit, Georgia was not offered a Membership Action Plan (MAP) but was assured of eventual NATO membership. A NATO-Georgia Commission was established after the Russia-Georgia conflict to guide NATO reform. The United States and Britain agreed to focus on Annual Action Programs for Ukraine and Georgia to help them meet NATO membership requirements. Georgian and Azerbaijani troops supported Partnership for Peace (PFP) by serving as NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo. Azerbaijani troops supported PFP by serving as NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Azerbaijan's cooperation with NATO may have cooled recently, as it denied overflights for AWACS aircraft and declined to send more troops to Afghanistan. Armenia aimed to increase activities with PFP in order to ensure its security by developing international ties, especially with NATO. Armenia's ties with NATO through PFP included sending peacekeepers to Kosovo and adopting an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2005. Armenia, along with Russia and Central Asian states, signed a Collective Security Treaty in 1992. In 2002, Armenia joined the CSTO with other CIS countries for mutual defense against security threats. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) includes a permanent secretariat for military planning and budget coordination, allowing for a quicker response to security threats. The organization pledges not to intervene in political conflicts but to resolve military, local, and border conflicts, prevent terror acts, stop drug trafficking, and protect pipelines. Russia views CSTO as the main instrument to counter military-political and military-strategic threats from outside member-states. The CSTO is seen as a Russian initiative to increase security influence over member-states and counter outside influence. Some former Soviet states not in the CSTO have concerns about its role in their regions. Turkmenistan stays neutral by not joining the CSTO, while Ukraine previously sought closer ties with NATO. In the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, the CSTO's collective defense provision was mentioned as pertaining to aggression. In 2006, it was suggested that the CSTO's collective defense provision did not apply to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict due to Azerbaijan being a member of the CIS. However, in 2008, Armenia sought clarification on this issue. Armenian Defense Minister stated that the CSTO would support Armenia if attacked by Azerbaijan. The ambiguity of the CSTO's area of responsibility remains a concern. Armenia hosted a large-scale CSTO military exercise in 2008 focused on coordination between Armenian and Russian forces in repelling an invasion. In 2008, Armenia hosted a CSTO military exercise focusing on coordination with Russian forces to repel an invasion. The exercise took place in Armenia and Moscow, with concerns raised by Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Georgia. President Medvedev announced the creation of an air-assault CORF to address rising tensions along CSTO borders, with Russia and Kazakhstan as main participants. Uzbekistan hesitated to contribute troops due to concerns about the force's vague nature. The CSTO has bilateral ties with NATO through the Partnership for Peace program and has called for cooperation on various issues. Observers believe that the CSTO's aim is to gain recognition from NATO of a Russian sphere of influence in former Soviet states. Despite attempts to establish formal ties, Russia's actions have hindered progress, including urging Armenia and Kazakhstan to boycott NATO exercises in Georgia in 2009. Foreign Minister Lavrov urged Secretary Clinton to cooperate in October 2009. The CSTO has urged greater cooperation with NATO and the U.N. in areas such as regional security, peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and combating illicit trafficking. President Medvedev expressed support for this in 2009. President Medvedev stated in early 2009 that the CSTO would combat terrorism and offer support for ISAF operations in Afghanistan, including transit agreements for supplies. The CSTO has emphasized that it will not deploy troops to Afghanistan. Former President Kocharyan proposed a South Caucasus security system involving regional states and external powers for stability, prompted by Azerbaijan and Georgia's withdrawal from the CIS Collective Security Pact. Iran supported the creation of a regional stability pact involving the three Caucasus states, with Putin trying to lead the formation of the pact. However, the region's leaders disagreed with Russia's stance on shaping the region's fate alone. Meetings of the \"Caucasus Four\" were held until 2003, with plans for future meetings disrupted by political events in Georgia. Russia and Armenia called for the resumption of meetings, but Georgia's government hesitated. Armenia, Turkey, and Russia proposed a \"Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform\" for regional peace and development in 2008. The proposal was endorsed by leaders from Azerbaijan, Russia, and Armenia, with discussions held between Turkish and Armenian presidents. Turkey's efforts to normalize relations with Armenia and facilitate regional engagement as part of the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform were highlighted by President Gul in speeches in 2008 and 2009. GUAM states, including Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine, cooperate to resist Russian domination and secure energy transport outside Russian control. In 1997, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine formed GUAM to resist Russian domination and secure energy transport outside Russian control. Russia opposed GUAM but also called for membership. GUAM members agreed to hold regular summits and signed agreements on cooperation in fighting terrorism and organized crime. Democratic revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine in the early 2000s gave GUAM a democratic orientation. In 2004, political reforms in Moldova led GUAM towards a democratic orientation. In April 2005, members and guests proclaimed goals of consolidating democracy in the Black Sea region, ending \"frozen conflicts,\" and discussed energy cooperation. Ukrainian President suggested integration with NATO and the EU, all with concerns about Russian behavior. GUAM opened Virtual Centers for Fighting Against Terrorism and Organized Crime in Azerbaijan and Ukraine. In May 2006, the heads of state signed a charter renaming the organization \"GUAM: The Organization for Democracy.\" In September 2006, GUAM delegations to the U.N. General Assembly proposed a discussion on \"protracted conflicts\" in GUAM states. In October 2006, GUAM foreign ministers called on Russia to refrain from unilateral actions against Georgia and supported talks on international forces in separatist areas. In December 2006, plans were announced to form a GUAM peacekeeping force for U.N. operations. At the July 2007 Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, GUAM countries aimed for economic and security integration with the West. At the July 2007 Summit of the Heads of State of GUAM in Baku, Azerbaijan, the presidents agreed to form a permanent secretariat and committees handling economic, trade, security, and cultural issues. Energy security was a primary topic at the July 2008 Summit in Batumi, Georgia, with discussions on transport links and oil delivery. The member-states endorsed territorial integrity and peaceful resolution of conflicts. In February 2009, the GUAM secretariat facility in Kiev was inaugurated during a meeting of foreign affairs ministers. Moldova opposed creating a GUAM peacekeeping force and focused on economic cooperation. Ukraine held the GUAM presidency in 2010, with discussions on combating trafficking, money laundering, and modernizing law enforcement systems. In mid-February 2010, the GUAM secretariat in Kiev hosted a workshop with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime on improving legal cooperation for combating terrorism. The inauguration of Viktor Yanukovych as Ukraine's president in late February 2010 led some observers to question the future of GUAM. The United States has provided significant encouragement to GUAM, including funding for projects to facilitate regional trade, transport, border and customs services, and the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking. The United States funded pilot programs for customs and border training in GUAM member-states. They also supported discussions on \"protracted conflicts\" at the U.N. General Assembly. Budget requests in various years called for using funds to bolster Moldova's and Ukraine's participation in GUAM and to combat trans-border criminal activities. Support was also provided for training law enforcement personnel in GUAM member-states. The discovery of major oil and gas resources in the Caspian Sea has made the South Caucasus region strategically important as an energy producer and transport corridor. Azerbaijan has significant reserves, with Russia and Kazakhstan also having substantial energy reserves in the area. However, Azerbaijan faces obstacles in fully exploiting its resources, including project financing, political instability, and pipeline security concerns. U.S. companies are involved in many international production-sharing consortiums in the region. Several international production-sharing consortiums were formed in the 1990s for oil and gas exploration, but many were dissolved due to lack of significant resources. The Azerbaijan International Oil Corporation (AIOC) was the first consortium formed to exploit the Azeri-Chirag-deepwater Gunashli (ACG) fields. Early oil was transported through Soviet-era pipelines in Georgia and Russia, with a main oil pipeline to Turkey's Mediterranean port opening in 2006. The Clinton Administration launched a campaign in 1997 emphasizing the strategic importance of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) route for oil transportation. Political endorsement was given by multiple countries and the pipeline was constructed at a cost of $4 billion. The $4 billion Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline was endorsed by multiple countries, with Kazakhstan agreeing to transport oil across the Caspian Sea to address under-utilization. A gas pipeline to Erzurum, Turkey (SCP) was built parallel to the oil pipeline and opened in March 2007. The BTC pipeline and SCP helped reduce reliance on Russian gas in Azerbaijan and Georgia. The opening of the BTC pipeline and SCP, along with the region's improved transport infrastructure, could boost economies through energy transit fees and trade. Concerns exist about Azerbaijan using oil revenues for military buildup against NK, but completion of pipelines may deter conflict. Gen. Craddock highlighted the strategic importance of the Caucasus region for the US and its allies. The Caucasus region is crucial for the United States and its Allies due to its support for Iraqi Freedom and ISAF, providing alternative hydrocarbon sources and routes. To maintain regional stability, sustained interagency efforts are needed to counter corruption, ethnic conflicts, and Russian interference. U.S. security assistance has helped Central Asian and Caucasus countries improve their capabilities to address transnational threats, integrated with programs promoting human rights and reforms. The Obama Administration's foreign policy in the Caucasus region focused on human rights, political and economic reforms, and conflict resolution. The U.S. viewed South Caucasian countries as part of the Caspian Sea-Black Sea region, with a focus on oil and gas transit routes. The State Department also implemented initiatives in 2005 to address regional issues. The U.S. State Department reassigned responsibility for Central Asian states to the Bureau for South Asian Affairs in 2005, while leaving the South Caucasus to the Bureau for European and Eurasian Affairs. U.S. military operational planning also separated these regions, with Central Asian states falling under USCENTCOM's area of responsibility and the South Caucasus states under USEUCOM's area of responsibility. U.S. national interests in Armenia include cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and combating illicit trafficking. A durable resolution of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict is crucial for U.S. interests in the South Caucasus, including regional stability, economic cooperation, and improved relations. Armenia's shift towards peace would benefit its economic development and living standards. In Azerbaijan, U.S. interests lie in counterterrorism cooperation, energy security, and democratic reforms for internal stability, reducing conflicts with Iran and Armenia. Azerbaijan's transparent market economy is vital for its role in the trans-Caspian energy corridor. Georgia plays a significant role in diversifying American and global energy supplies. The country is a key partner in the global war on terrorism, providing troops for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Georgia serves as a conduit for Caspian Basin energy resources to flow to the West, supporting energy source diversification for the United States and Europe. The U.S. Government will continue to support democratization, NATO integration, law enforcement, economic growth, and conflict resolution in Georgia. The U.S. supports Georgia's territorial integrity and conflict resolution with separatist regions. After 9/11, U.S. policy focused on global anti-terror efforts, with Georgia offering support for U.S. and coalition efforts in Afghanistan. President Shevardnadze condemned the attacks and offered Georgian assistance. During his U.S. visit in October 2001, the Georgian President offered full cooperation and solidarity with the U.S. in Afghanistan. The U.S. Embassy in Georgia declared readiness to help combat terrorists in the Caucasus. President Bush announced support for Georgia to combat al Qaeda influences. The U.S. announced the \"Georgia Train and Equip Program\" to help Georgia combat al Qaeda influences. Russia initially criticized the program but later supported it. Georgia also sent troops for peacekeeping in Afghanistan in 2004-2005. In early 2007, President Saakashvili announced Georgia's plan to send 200-400 troops to support NATO in Afghanistan. Before the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, the US advised Georgia to continue military support in Iraq. In November 2009, Georgian troops began training in Germany for deployment to Afghanistan. Azerbaijan also pledged support to the US in anti-terrorism operations, offering overflight rights and intelligence support. Heydar Aliyev endorsed air operations in Afghanistan after 9/11. After the commencement of air operations in Afghanistan in October 2001, Heydar Aliyev supported coalition actions in phone conversations with Secretary Powell and President Bush. Azerbaijan deployed 30 troops to assist the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan in November 2002. However, Azerbaijan's cooperation with NATO may have cooled recently, as they have declined to increase the number of troops serving in Afghanistan and denied overflights for AWACS aircraft. In contrast, Armenia offered condolences and rescue aid after September 11, 2001. Armenia offered support for U.S.-led counter-terrorism efforts, including military overflight rights and intelligence sharing. They also expressed backing for military actions in Afghanistan to combat international terrorism, in line with their foreign policy of complementarity. Armenia supports U.S.-led counter-terrorism efforts, including military overflight rights and intelligence sharing. They also sent troops for training in Germany before deployment to Afghanistan under German-led command for airbase security. U.S. Congress altered attitudes toward aid sanctions on Azerbaijan post-9/11 for regional cooperation on anti-terrorism, conflict resolution, and energy development. Presidential waiver authority was added for Foreign Operations Appropriations in FY2002. The President may use waiver authority for aid to Azerbaijan if it supports U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, armed forces readiness, and Azerbaijan's border security. The waiver can be renewed annually, with a report to Congress required. President Bush exercised the waiver in 2002 after the law was signed. The waiver authority for aid to Azerbaijan was exercised by President Bush in 2002 and again in 2008 to support U.S. counter-terrorism efforts and armed forces readiness. Azerbaijan and Georgia pledged support for the U.S.-led Operation Iraqi Freedom, offering airfields and assistance in rebuilding Iraq. Azerbaijan expressed a preference for a peaceful solution but supported U.S. action in Iraq. Both countries also dispatched troops to Iraq in 2003. In August 2003, Azerbaijan and Georgia sent troops to Iraq at the request of U.S. officials. Georgia increased its deployment to 850 troops in 2005, matching contributions from Australia and Ukraine. Azerbaijan's troops assisted U.S. Marines at the Haditha dam, while Georgia's troops protected various facilities and patrolled areas in Iraq. President Saakashvili announced plans to increase Georgia's troop deployment to 2,000 in 2007, making them the second-largest non-U.S. contributor. However, most troops were withdrawn in 2008 due to the Russia-Georgia conflict. Armenia initially did not support military intervention in Iraq due to concerns about the safety of ethnic Armenians in the region, Turkish expansionism into Kurdish areas, and affinities with France, Germany, and Russia. However, Armenian troops later served with the Polish contingent in Iraq for humanitarian work. Azerbaijan and Georgia also sent troops to Iraq, with some economic losses reported. Armenia's troops pulled out of Iraq in late 2008. The BTC pipeline construction was delayed due to material delivery problems, and Azerbaijan faced backlash for supporting the United States. Vice President Cheney visited Georgia and Azerbaijan in 2008, pledging continued US support for Georgia and assistance in overcoming the Russia-Georgia conflict. In Azerbaijan, the United States is committed to achieving a negotiated solution to the NK conflict, emphasizing territorial integrity and international principles. The US praises Azerbaijan's cooperation in the energy sector and its contribution to the global fight against terrorism. Additionally, the US supports Azerbaijan's efforts to strengthen democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. On January 9, 2009, Secretary of State Rice and Georgian Foreign Minister Vashadze signed a U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, aiming to strengthen their relationship across various fields. The Charter emphasizes the importance of a strong, independent, sovereign, and democratic Georgia contributing to security and prosperity in Europe. Both countries aim for the full integration of Georgia into European and transatlantic institutions. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership aims to enhance cooperation in political, economic, security, and defense institutions to promote peace and stability. The agreement includes plans to expand defense and security programs, increase Georgian capabilities for NATO membership, pursue an Enhanced Bilateral Investment Treaty, and enhance energy security through increased production and transit security. The accord strengthens ties through the NATO-Georgia Commission and aims to diversify natural gas supplies through a new Southern Corridor. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership aims to enhance cooperation in political, economic, security, and defense institutions. The agreement includes plans to expand defense and security programs, increase Georgian capabilities for NATO membership, pursue an Enhanced Bilateral Investment Treaty, and enhance energy security through the Southern Corridor. Georgia and the U.S. pledge to cooperate on democratization efforts, including bolstering independent media and the rule of law. The charter does not provide security guarantees to Georgia, but aims to strengthen defense cooperation programs. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership aims to enhance cooperation in political, economic, security, and defense institutions. The Charter supports Georgia's territorial integrity to convince Russia to rescind recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The United States has provided significant security assistance to the region, with cumulative funding of $1.13 billion for peace and security programs in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The U.S. has provided significant security assistance to the South Caucasus region, with budgeted funding for all programs and about 10% of security assistance to all twelve Soviet successor states. The relative lack of aid to the South Caucasus reflects historical U.S. emphasis on Global Threat Reduction in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Sec. 907 had prohibited much U.S. security aid to Azerbaijan until waived, allowing an increase in aid to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. A U.S.-financed center for de-mining opened in Armenia in March 2002. In March 2002, a U.S.-financed de-mining center opened in Armenia. In July 2002, 25 U.S. Special Operations troops were assisting in training troops in Azerbaijan for de-mining. President Bush made Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan eligible for U.S. arms exports in April 2002. A U.S.-Azerbaijan Security Dialogue working group has been meeting yearly since 1996 to discuss security concerns. Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov discussed various security issues in a March 2006 meeting. Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman visited Azerbaijan in February 2007. In February 2007, Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman visited Azerbaijan to discuss energy security, NATO cooperation, and anti-terrorism assistance with President Aliyev and other officials. This visit was part of an \"expanded dialogue\" following Aliyev's 2006 U.S. visit. In March 2007, a memorandum of understanding was signed by then-Secretary of State Rice and Foreign Minister Elmar Mamedyarov to hold annual meetings on energy security. The U.S.-Azerbaijan Security Dialogue working group met in July 2007 to discuss security and energy cooperation, democracy promotion, counterterrorism, maritime security, nonproliferation, missile defense, and energy infrastructure protection. In November 2009, Assistant Secretary of State Andrew J. Shapiro met with Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov for the 11th U.S.-Azerbaijan Security Dialogue. They discussed bilateral defense cooperation, Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations, Azerbaijan-NATO cooperation, Afghan stabilization efforts, Caspian Sea security, and the future of Russia's Gabala radar site in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan proposed cooperative initiatives, and working groups would convene to discuss them. Georgia became eligible for security-related International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) programs in FY1997. In 1999, the United States provided grant aid of ten UH-1H unarmed combat helicopters to Georgia, with six operational and the rest for spare parts. The Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) was initiated in response to a request from former Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze to resist Russian influence and combat terrorists in the Pankisi Gorge area. The program was initially linked to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) to enhance military capabilities. The $64 million Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) began in April-May 2002 to enhance Georgia's military capabilities. Training included light infantry, airmobile, mechanized, and mountain tactics, as well as medical and logistical methods. Over 2,000 troops and various security personnel were trained, with equipment provided for base refurbishment. The program ended in April 2004. The Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) ended in April 2004 after training over 2,000 troops in various military tactics. The program was praised for its contribution to Georgia's deployment of troops to Iraq and other countries. A follow-on program called the Georgian Sustainment and Stability Operations Program (SSOP) was developed in 2004 to help sustain troop deployments to Iraq and train four battalions of 2,000 troops. Training took place near Tbilisi at the Krtsanisi Training Area. In March 2006, the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd battalions completed training and were deployed to Iraq. The SSOP program received $30 million in funding, including $6.5 million for equipment and operations in Iraq. The 2006 National Security Concept of Georgia highlighted the increased defense capabilities due to U.S. assistance programs. Troops trained under GTEP and SSOP were recognized as the core of the Georgian Army. The GTEP and SSOP programs trained a significant portion of Georgia's armed forces, with observers noting the promotion of democratic values. SSOP received $71 million in funding in FY2008, including $11.5 million for special forces training. U.S. military training for Georgia's troops included preparation for deployment to Iraq in 2008 and Afghanistan in 2009, with the first group deployed in December 2009. Over 700 Georgian troops deployed with U.S. Marines to Afghanistan's Helmand province, facing possible problems with GTEP and SSOP. Russia's concerns about U.S. military training in its sphere of influence strained relations with the United States. Despite this, then-President Putin acknowledged the role of U.S.-trained Georgian troops in counter-terrorism efforts in the Pankisi Gorge. In mid-2004, Russia protested to the United States about alleged U.S.-trained troops in Georgia's actions in South Ossetia. Some issues arose in finalizing applicants for SSOP training in 2005, causing delays. Georgian reports mentioned a lack of discipline in U.S.-trained units and dissatisfaction with SSOP training at the Krtsanisi Training Center. Concerns were raised about troops not re-enlisting after GTEP training, leading to a loss of expertise among active duty personnel. Some military officials were accused of resisting SSOP. Some Georgian observers have raised concerns about the large-scale involvement in SSOP and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan diverting Georgia from other national security priorities. However, most Georgian officials see these efforts as enhancing the professionalism of the armed forces and advancing Georgia's NATO membership aspirations. U.S. analyst Paul Saunders advised against supporting the deployment of Georgian troops to Afghanistan, emphasizing that the U.S. has no military commitment to Georgia. Additionally, USEUCOM initiatives in the region include the South Caucasus Clearinghouse and the Caspian Regional Maritime Security Cooperation program. The Clearinghouse and Caspian Regional Maritime Security Cooperation program aim to facilitate security cooperation by sharing data and coordinating U.S. government activities in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. U.S. Naval Forces Europe promote Maritime Safety and Security in the Caspian Sea through engagement with Azerbaijan, with efforts to enhance Azerbaijan's ability to respond to events in their maritime domain. In FY2008, $1.7 million in Section 1206 funds were allocated for naval counter-terrorism training for Azerbaijan. In late 2005, the United States provided maritime surveillance radars to Azerbaijan for detecting illicit weapons in the Caspian Sea. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, Gen. Craddock surveyed Georgia's military damage. EUCOM conducted assessments of Georgia's Armed Forces, revealing deficiencies. Defense consultations were held with Georgia in October 2008. In March 2009, Gen. James Cartwright visited Georgia to assess its defense needs and pledged training and equipment transfers to support their reform efforts and independence. Assistant Secretary Vershbow also testified in August 2009 about the focus on assisting Georgia with their defense capabilities. Assistant Secretary Vershbow testified in August 2009 about the focus on building defense institutions, assisting defense sector reform, and developing modern, NATO-interoperable armed forces in Georgia. Despite claims of rearming, the United States has not provided lethal military assistance since the 2008 conflict, and no part of the $1 billion assistance package went to the Ministry of Defense. This lack of lethal security assistance has been criticized by some in Congress and elsewhere. The United States has been the largest aid donor for efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the South Caucasus states. Various agencies like DOD, DOE, and DOS provide training and equipment to prevent nuclear smuggling and other proliferation threats. DOS funds the Export Control and Related Border Security Program (EXBS) to improve export control capabilities in the region. DOE's Second Line of Defense Program places radiation detection systems at ports of entry, while other agencies help implement EXBS. The DOD's Proliferation Prevention Program (PPP) aims to upgrade the abilities of non-Russian Soviet successor states to deter and interdict smuggling of WMD and related materials. It coordinates with other DOD programs like the International Counter-proliferation Program (ICP) that works with the FBI and Customs and Border Protection Service. In FY1999, DOS provided $1.9 million for Armenia and Azerbaijan to expand the Tracker Automated Licensing System for tracking exports of proliferation concern. Through FY2005, agencies have provided over $55 million to enhance efforts in the region. In FY1999, an ICP in Azerbaijan provided training courses on crime scene investigation, criminal investigation, radiation detection, and response. In January 2004, the US and Azerbaijan signed an agreement for a five-year PPP to enhance WMD detection on vessels in the Caspian Sea. $68 million was used to improve maritime radar surveillance equipment, upgrade boats, provide WMD detection equipment for boarding crews, and upgrade command and control facilities. In November 2006, DOD completed construction of a boat basin for the Border Service-Coast Guard in Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea border. A follow-on FY2009-FY2013 PPP costing $33 million aims to develop WMD surveillance capability. Plans include upgraded maritime surveillance radar on Chilov Island, repairs for naval vessels, transfer of WMD detection equipment, and training for State Border Service-Coast Guard personnel. United States and Georgia signed a CTR umbrella agreement in 1997 for defense reform and regional stability. In 1998, the United States assisted Georgia in removing highly enriched uranium and spent fuel from a research reactor near Tbilisi. The US provided security assistance after criminal attacks on the reactor facility. Additionally, CTR funding was used to enhance export controls, remove dual-use equipment at an animal vaccine production plant, and convert the plant into a feed mill by 2007. The US provided $469 million in aid from FY1992-FY2008. The United States provided $469 million in aid from FY1992-FY2008 to help Georgia prevent the proliferation of WMD. There is rising U.S. concern about drugs transiting the South Caucasus and terrorist groups using drug trafficking to finance their operations. Regional governments urge the U.S. to combat rising drug trafficking from Afghanistan. The United States is taking the lead in combating drug trafficking from Afghanistan, providing training and aid to countries in the region. Waiver of Sec.907 of the Freedom Support Act allows for government-to-government aid for counter-narcotics programs in Azerbaijan since 2002. Significant assistance was reported for FY2006, including trucks for Customs Contraband Teams and security assessments along the Iranian border. The United States provided aid to combat drug trafficking in Azerbaijan, including rebuilding watchtowers along the Iranian border, upgrading radar near Astara, delivering patrol boats, and training Customs personnel. INL-funded law enforcement programs were canceled in 2009 due to lack of cooperation from the Azerbaijani government. Other training programs by the State Department and U.S. Coast Guard continued to enhance border controls. U.S. firms are the largest investors in Azerbaijan. U.S. firms are the largest investors in Azerbaijan, with investments totaling $7.1 billion through 2008. Corruption has driven some Western firms to leave Azerbaijan, particularly in the non-energy sector. Despite efforts to improve the investment climate, bribery is still an issue, making Azerbaijan a challenging market to do business in. Foreign direct investment in Georgia has increased. Foreign direct investment in Georgia has increased since the \"rose revolution,\" with BP investing in oil and gas infrastructure. However, many investors remain wary due to official corruption and criminalized sectors like gasoline and cigarette distribution. FDI in Georgia dropped after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. U.S. embassies were on high alert post-9/11, with temporary closures for security reasons. In March 2003, U.S. embassies issued warnings about terrorist attacks, but no significant violence occurred. The State Department advised against travel to Abkhazia and South Ossetia due to gunfire and crime, with limited diplomatic access. Americans were also warned against travel near these regions' borders, as well as to the Pankisi Gorge and border areas near Russia's Chechnya and Dagestan regions. Despite Georgia's anti-corruption efforts, crime remains a concern. Despite efforts to combat corruption and improve law enforcement, crime remains a significant issue in Tbilisi, with high rates of poverty contributing to crimes against Americans and other foreigners. Most crimes involve residential break-ins, car-jackings, car theft, petty theft, and armed robbery. The level of crime in Tbilisi is higher than in many European and U.S. cities, with a recent incident involving a hand grenade thrown towards Presidents Bush and Saakashvili during a visit. Abashidze was sentenced for a crime. A more secure U.S. Embassy building opened in Tbilisi in December 2005. During the August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, U.S. Embassy dependents and Peace Corps volunteers were evacuated to Armenia. U.S. investors in Armenia have reported financial scams and property disputes. The State Department reports rare crime against foreigners in Armenia, mainly involving break-ins and theft. There are instances of violent assaults and robberies, but the level of violent crime is lower in Yerevan than in most U.S. cities. Armenia has a large organized crime network. In Armenia, there is a large organized crime network, but violence is not typically directed towards foreigners. U.S. citizens are unlikely targets of political violence. Young men with dual citizenship visiting Armenia have been conscripted into the armed forces. The U.S. Embassy in Yerevan opened a more secure building in 2005. In Azerbaijan, there have been no political violence acts against U.S. businesses or foreign-owned entities, but there is a reported increase in Islamic extremism and terrorist plots targeting Western interests. In Azerbaijan, there is an increase in Islamic extremism and terrorist plots against Western interests. Members of the indigenous terrorist group Jayshullah were convicted in 2001 for planning an attack against the US Embassy. In July 2005, a group was arrested for planning terrorist training to attack the U.S., Israeli, and Russian embassies. In late October 2007, the Azerbaijani National Security Ministry warned of a terrorist group planning attacks, leading to limited operations at the U.S. Embassy. U.S. citizens traveling to Azerbaijan are advised of dangers in occupied areas around NK and warned to be on guard against violent acts and possible terrorist attacks. In July 2006, Americans were warned to be cautious due to potential terrorist attacks during Israeli military actions in Lebanon. The State Department cautioned in early 2009 about a shift towards violent attacks on foreigners in the South Caucasus states, with injuries reported. Additionally, Americans of Armenian descent traveling to Azerbaijan were advised of safety concerns due to the government's inability to guarantee their well-being. There is a consensus among U.S. policymakers on promoting democratization, free markets, and responsible security policies in the region. Some view the United States as the \"indispensable power\" in promoting peace, stability, and development in the South Caucasus region. Critics argue that the region has historically been of little interest to the U.S., with EU expansion making it more of a priority for Europe. Advocates suggest limited U.S. involvement to achieve goals of reducing strife, promoting democratization, and improving human rights. Increased U.S. assistance could also positively impact stability in North Caucasian areas of Russia. Increased U.S. involvement in the South Caucasus region could bring stability and have a positive effect on North Caucasian areas of Russia, Turkey, and European security. Advocates urge greater U.S. aid and conflict resolution efforts to contain warfare, crime, smuggling, terrorism, and Islamic extremism. Improved U.S. ties with Azerbaijan could benefit relations with other Islamic countries. Encouragement of Caspian region oil and natural gas development could expand world supplies and make the West less vulnerable to supply cutoffs in the Middle East or Russia. The Administration has also pursued close ties with Armenia and Georgia for their democratic principles. Some argue for continued U.S. aid in the South Caucasus region due to democratic principles, while others suggest curtailing aid due to shortcomings in democratization and peace efforts. Caution is advised in heavily involving the U.S. in a region with ethnic and civil conflicts. Some question if U.S. interests are threatened by international terrorists. Some question whether U.S. interests are threatened by alleged Al Qaeda or other international terrorists in the region and if the U.S. should lead in advocating diverse routes for oil and gas export from the Caspian region. Concerns exist about providing substantial U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan until peace is achieved with Armenia and NK. The U.S. promotes respecting sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity in the South Caucasian states and resolving disputes peacefully. Engagement with Russia and the South Caucasus states has been impacted by Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia, with some urging stronger Western sanctions against Russia. EU and Obama Administration policymakers emphasize continued cooperation with Russia. EU and Obama Administration policymakers stress cooperation with Russia on various security interests but demand Russia reverse its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence. Some suggest Turkey play a role in countering Iran and Russia's influence. Caspian regional oil and gas exports from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan make up a small percentage of global exports, projected to increase in the future. Oil and gas exports from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan are expected to rise, increasing their significance as global suppliers. The US has shown cooperation with Russia in developing Caspian oil resources, but also supported pipelines as a precaution against potential Russian opposition. US administrations believe that developing energy resources in the region could lead to economic benefits, rule of law improvements, and regional stability. The Administration's Eurasian energy strategy aims to develop oil and gas resources in the Caspian region, support energy security in Europe, and assist Caspian countries in expanding export routes. The US plays a supporting role in implementing these goals through various initiatives like the U.S.-EU Energy Council and the Nabucco gas pipeline. The US supports the expansion of oil and gas resources in the Caspian region and advocates for European energy integration. They encourage agreements between Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iraq for gas transit to Europe. The US also promotes diversified energy sources for Europe, including gas from North Africa and LNG from Qatar and Nigeria. Critics raise concerns about regional stability and ownership of Caspian Sea fields. Some observers question the importance of oil and gas reserves in new states for U.S. security and economic development. They advocate for conflict resolution and broader economic reforms in the region instead of focusing solely on energy development. Others argue for increased U.S. security assistance to prevent vulnerability to terrorist groups and coercion from neighboring countries in the South Caucasus states. The importance of U.S. customs and border training, nonproliferation aid, and military assistance in preventing WMD technologies from reaching terrorist groups in the region is emphasized. Greater U.S. support for military institution-building, soldier life support, and education programs is urged to strengthen security and democratic civil-military relations. Increased U.S. backing for PFP training could encourage regional military cooperation. Observers suggest that as Iran enhances its military capabilities, the South Caucasus states may seek closer ties with the United States for security. Georgia's integration into Western institutions bolsters security in the region, but critics question the need for increased U.S. security commitments. They argue for promoting conflict resolution and regional cooperation instead of escalating arms races. In the wake of the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, debates over U.S. military assistance to Georgia centered on the need for increased security support. Advocates argued that enhanced U.S. assistance could have deterred Russia's actions, while critics emphasized the importance of conflict resolution and regional cooperation over escalating arms races. The U.S. and NATO assistance to Georgia's military was seen as a factor in the 2008 conflict with Russia in South Ossetia. Russian President Medvedev's opposition to Georgia's NATO membership was viewed as destabilizing. The U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership aimed to enhance security cooperation and support Georgia's NATO candidacy. The United States and Georgia are expanding defense and security cooperation to address global threats and promote peace. The partnership benefits both nations and the region, with the U.S. supporting Georgia's security needs. Some suggest that security challenges in the South Caucasus stem from weak democratization, risking civil unrest and foreign interference. Recommendations include increased U.S. and Western focus on social programs for stability. Observers recommend greater U.S. and Western attention to bolster social programs to prevent public demands from destabilizing fragile democratic institutions. Political instability increased in Georgia after the \"rose revolution\" and a free presidential election in 2004, leading to President Saakashvili's resignation in 2007. Despite efforts to restore stability through a more open political system, democratization progress has been slow, with political instability remaining a significant issue in 2010. U.S. aid for democratization has been primarily directed towards Armenia, with less assistance provided to Georgia and Azerbaijan. Armenia's legislative elections in May 2007 showed improvement and were largely in line with international standards, although concerns were raised about pro-government party dominance and campaign finance disclosures. The presidential election in February 2008 mostly met OSCE commitments but faced challenges post-election, displaying insufficient regard for democratic election standards. The 2005 legislative election in Azerbaijan had large-scale irregularities in vote-counting, but the U.S. Administration saw it as a sign of democratization commitment. The 2008 presidential election showed progress but fell short of meeting all democratic election principles, with observers noting a lack of robust competition and vibrant political discourse facilitated by media. Critics of U.S. democratization aid have raised concerns. Critics of U.S. democratization aid argue that the Administration's emphasis on gradual political change in the South Caucasus may inadvertently support current ruling elites, hindering democratic transitions and potentially fueling extremist groups. They advocate for a policy where aid is tied to reform progress. Observers highlight Russia as a significant threat to the region's security and independence, prioritizing influence in the South Caucasus. Russia places a strategic importance on maintaining influence in the South Caucasus region, pressuring countries to join the CIS and sign security treaties. Putin's presidency marked a more active stance, with a focus on protecting economic interests and countering threats to Russian position in the region. During Medvedev's presidency, a new national security strategy and military doctrine highlighted threats from NATO advancing military infrastructure to Russia's borders. The doctrine also emphasized protecting Russian citizens abroad. Observers point to Russia's actions in Chechnya and Georgia as examples of its pursuit of regional influence in the South Caucasus. Putin's regional initiatives in the South Caucasus included holding \"Caucasus Four\" summits and creating the North-South International Transport Corridor (NSTC) with Russia, Iran, and India to protect Russian interests in the Caspian region. The NSTC was established between Russia, Iran, and India with termini at Bombay and St. Petersburg. Shipments began in July 2004, and discussions were held in late 2004 to expedite shipping. The opening of the BTC pipeline and SCP has impacted Russia's plans for the NSTC. Accords were signed to build a railway from Azerbaijan to Iran, linking Europe to the Persian Gulf. A memorandum of understanding was signed in March 2010 by the Iran-Russia Joint Transportation Working Group to form a joint company to fund the building of a railway for land-based transport of cargo from Europe to the Persian Gulf. Iran is also planning to build a railway to Armenia. The presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed a declaration of intent in May 2005 to build a railway linking Kars in Turkey to Baku in Azerbaijan, with construction starting in late 2007. Armenia objected to the project as it bypasses their territory. Russia's role in the South Caucasus has waned in recent years due to increasing authoritarianism. Congressional concerns over Russia's actions in Eurasian states have led to restrictions on aid, with a focus on military influence and border security. Russia aims to prevent terrorism, control contraband, and manipulate separatist ideologies in the region. Russia's declining influence in the South Caucasus is evident through various responses to Putin's policies. Armenia seeks close security ties with Russia, viewing it as a protector against neighboring Islamic states. Azerbaijan is wary of Russia's ties with Armenia, while Georgia has unsuccessfully pushed for the closure of Russian military bases. NATO's increased involvement in the region has also contributed to Russia's diminishing influence. Russia's declining influence in the South Caucasus is highlighted by NATO's increased ties with the region, completion of key pipelines, and Russia's agreement to close military bases in Georgia. Despite this, Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have marked a reassertion of Russian influence in the area. In recent years, Russia's military presence in the South Caucasus has declined. Russia signed the CIS Collective Security Treaty with Armenia in 1992, leading Georgia and Azerbaijan to join as well. However, they withdrew from the treaty in 1999. Russia has military bases in Armenia and Georgia, helping guard the Armenian-Turkish border. Azerbaijan pressured Russia to withdraw troops in 1993, except at the Gabala radar site. Georgia took control of guarding its borders in 1999, except for some liaison officers. At the November 1999 OSCE Summit, the South Caucasus states agreed to adapt the CFE Treaty, leading to a reduced Russian military presence in Georgia and the North Caucasus. Russia agreed to reduce weaponry at its bases in Georgia, closing some bases by July 2001. Georgia reported the turnover of the Vaziani base and airfield on July 1, 2001. On July 1, 2001, Georgia reported that Russia had turned over the Vaziani base and airfield. In June 2002, Russia closed its Gudauta base but left 320 troops to guard facilities. The OSCE praised the Gudauta closure in December 2002, despite Georgia's objections. The United States hoped Russia would fulfill its CFE commitments. Russia claimed it needed $300 million to $1 billion and three to ten years to close the remaining bases, with about 2,500 troops stationed there as of June 2005. In March 2005, Georgia pressured Russia to close its bases by January 2006 or face restrictions. An agreement was reached in May 2005, with a deadline set for 2008. President Putin acknowledged Georgia's right to request base closures. By June 2007, Russia handed over the Akhalkalaki base, and by November 2007, the Batumi base was closed. Russia closed its Batumi base in Georgia, fulfilling its obligations, but Georgia protested that the Gudauta base still had Russian forces. Georgia called for the removal of Russian \"peacekeepers\" from Abkhazia and South Ossetia or their inclusion in an international peacekeeping force. Russia's military withdrawal from Georgia increased its influence in Armenia, where it has about 3,500 troops. Armenia argues that Russian bases ensure regional stability, but Azerbaijan sees Russian weapons supply as destabilizing. Russia has a significant military presence in the South Caucasus region, with about 90,000 troops in the North Caucasus area and forces along the borders including the Black Sea Fleet and Caspian Flotilla. After the 2008 conflict with Georgia, Russia established military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, each with around 3,500 troops. Russia aims to develop closer security ties with Azerbaijan to counter U.S. influence. In February 2003, a framework agreement on Azerbaijan-Russia military cooperation was signed, allowing for Russian military training and arms sales to Azerbaijani forces. Cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan in security matters has included anti-terrorism efforts and extradition of suspected criminals. President Putin called for enhanced economic and security cooperation during a visit in March 2006. After President Putin's visit in 2006, Azerbaijani-Russian relations soured over disagreements on naval security alliances and gas price hikes. However, relations improved in 2009-2010 with gas sales to Russia amid disputes with Turkey and questions about the Nabucco gas pipeline. Russia also accused Georgia's Pankisi Gorge of harboring Chechen terrorists linked to bin Laden after September 11, 2001. The United States and Russia had tensions over military training in Georgia to combat terrorism in the Pankisi Gorge, where Chechen terrorists were hiding. Georgia launched policing efforts and coordinated border patrols with Russia to reduce tensions. In 2004, Saakashvili pledged to combat Islamic extremists in Georgia, satisfying Russian officials that terrorism in the Gorge was under control. Since the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, Russian authorities have raised concerns about alleged terrorist bases in the Gorge threatening the North Caucasus, which Georgia denies. Russian energy firms have increased their presence in the Caspian Sea region, with Russia agreeing on seabed delineation with Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in the 1990s and early 2000s. Putin criticized Western private investment in the region before 9/11 and appointed a special energy emissary to promote energy ties with Russia. After the 2001 September 11 attacks, Putin appeared to ease his criticism of the U.S. presence. In May 2002, a joint statement at the U.S.-Russia summit endorsed multiple pipeline routes, suggesting Russia's non-opposition to the BTC oil pipeline. However, in March 2004, a Russian official stated Putin's desire for Caspian energy to flow through Russian pipelines. The 2008 U.S.-Russia Strategic Framework Declaration aimed to enhance energy supply diversity. Russian energy firms have aggressively pursued influence in the South Caucasus region, including lobbying in Armenia. In Armenia, Russia lobbied to limit the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline capacity. Gazprom became the operator. Azerbaijan allowed Gazprom to import gas. Russia's military presence in Georgia could affect transit routes for oil and gas pipelines. Russia has concerns about the safety of ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus states, where they make up less than 4% of the population. A new Russian citizenship law facilitated granting citizenship to Abkhazians and South Ossetians, allowing Russia to justify military actions as protecting its citizens. Critics argue that Russia's actions are driven by military and economic interests rather than human rights concerns. Turkey is seen as a front for Russia's military and economic interests, using pro-Russian agents to boost influence and oppose U.S. interests. Some view Turkey as able to promote pro-Western policies and deter Iranian interference in the South Caucasus. Critics warn against over-reliance on Turkey due to its support for Azerbaijan and lack of full support for U.S.-led actions in Iraq. Turkey seeks good relations with Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Turkey seeks good relations with Azerbaijan and Georgia, while trying to limit Russian and Iranian influence in the region. However, its own economic problems, poor relations with Armenia, and countervailing Russian influence have constrained Turkey's influence. Roadblocks to better Armenian-Turkish relations include Turkey's rejection of Armenian genocide claims and its support for Azerbaijan in the NK conflict. Turkey's proposal of a \"Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform\" aims for regional problem discussion and cooperation development. Turkey's increased influence in Azerbaijan has included the adoption of a Latin alphabet and the construction of oil and gas pipelines. Relations were strained in 2009-2010 over gas prices, but the dispute was reportedly resolved in 2010. Azerbaijan objected to Turkey's offer to open its border with Armenia, linking it to the settlement of the NK conflict. Georgia has an interest in ties with Georgians in Turkey and Iran. Georgia has one million residents in Turkey and 50,000 in Iran, with friendship treaties signed with both countries. Turkey and Russia are Georgia's main trade partners, with Russia having military bases in Armenia and Georgia. Turkey sees these bases as security threats but has improved ties with Russia recently. Iran initially saw the breakup of the Soviet Union as creating a \"new Middle East\" but has moderate interests in the South Caucasus. Iran's interests in the South Caucasus are focused on building economic ties, discouraging Western powers like Turkey and the United States from gaining influence, and preventing regional instability that could threaten its territorial integrity. Iran has cooperated with Russia in the past to block Western energy development in the Caspian region. Iran has intensified its involvement in South Caucasus economic and security issues to deter states from strengthening ties with the United States. High-level Iranians have visited regional states and met with leaders to make their case. Iran's large Azerbaijani and Armenian populations are factors in its regional strategy. Iran's largest ethnic minority in Iran is the Azerbaijani population, constituting almost one-third of the country's population. Iran has limited trans-Azerbaijani contacts to discourage ethnic consciousness among its \"Southern Azerbaijanis\" and has criticized politicians in Azerbaijan advocating separatism in Iran. Some Azerbaijanis are inspired by Kurdish ethnic rights assertion in post-Saddam Iraq in 2003, pushing for greater rights for \"Southern Azerbaijanis.\" Azerbaijani elites fear Iranian-supported Islamic fundamentalism and question Iran's support for an independent Azerbaijan. Iran has growing trade ties with Armenia and Georgia, but trade with Azerbaijan has declined. Iran suggests Azerbaijan would benefit financially by cooperating in building energy pipelines to Iran. Islamic Shiite fundamentalists in Iran urge the government to reconsider its official policies. Shiite fundamentalists in Iran are pushing for solidarity with Shiites in Azerbaijan, urging the government to abandon neutrality in the NK conflict. Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran improved in 2004-2005 with high-level visits, but disagreements remained on issues like border delineation and Azerbaijani security ties with the United States. Some speculate that Iran's strained relations with the US may have influenced its efforts to strengthen ties with Azerbaijan. Since 2006, Azerbaijan has been concerned about Iran's arrests of ethnic Azerbaijani civil rights advocates. Azerbaijani-Iranian relations were strained in 2007 due to convictions in Azerbaijan for collaborating with Iran. U.S. policy aims to contain Iran's threats in the region. Some critics argue that South Caucasus states face pressure to accommodate Russian interests if discouraged from dealing with Iran, especially in building pipelines. The United States and European states are influential in the region, aiming to integrate it into the West, prevent anti-Western orientation, open it to trade, obtain energy resources, and promote peace, stability, and democracy. U.S. and EU policies sometimes differ, with the EU more willing to cooperate with Russia. The EU and US have differing policies on cooperation with Russia and Iran in the South Caucasus region. In 2009, the EU initiated the \"Eastern Partnership\" program with South Caucasus states, Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine to enhance ties and aid. The region has also developed economic and political connections with other Black Sea and Caspian Sea littoral states. Central Asian states like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan share interests with Azerbaijan, including linguistic and religious ties and concerns about bordering powers. They face terrorist threats and drug trafficking from Afghanistan. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are exploring trans-Caspian transport for oil and gas to Western markets. As trade links between Central Asia and the South Caucasus grow, stability in the region becomes more crucial."
