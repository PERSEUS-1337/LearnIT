    "content": "The \"Marine Energy Act\" is defined as the Act for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy research and development. It amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to focus on marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. The Secretary, in consultation with other relevant departments, will implement a program to accelerate marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy production in the US. This includes prioritizing technology development, testing infrastructure, and commercialization efforts. The program aims to accelerate the technological readiness and commercialization of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy devices, support demonstration projects to increase efficiency and lower costs, investigate integration with the utility grid, identify sustainable supply chain needs, and enhance reliability and survivability. The program aims to increase the reliability and survivability of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies, verify performance and cost of new designs, coordinate activities across programs and agencies, and identify opportunities for joint research. The program aims to identify opportunities for joint research and development programs between marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies and other energy programs, offshore activities, and Department of Defense. It also supports technology development with international partners through cooperative funding and participation. The United States aims to participate in international projects related to marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies. It also focuses on identifying potential environmental and navigational impacts of these technologies, along with measures to prevent adverse effects. SEC. 4. NATIONAL MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION CENTERS. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to advance research, development, and commercial application of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies through Centers in coordination with the Department and National Laboratories. This includes supporting in-water testing and demonstration of various technology levels and scales at multiple test berths. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to establish Centers that will support in-water testing and demonstration of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies at multiple test berths. These Centers will also serve as information clearinghouses for the industry by collecting and disseminating best practices. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to increase funding for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 from $50,000,000 to $60,000,000 for Centers supporting marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies."
