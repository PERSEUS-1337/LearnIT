    "content": "The President submitted his budget for FY2000 on February 1, 1999, including $22.0 billion for energy and water development programs, $800 million more than the previous year. The Senate Subcommittee marked up the bill on May 25, with the full Appropriations Committee reporting a total appropriation of $21.7 billion on May 27. The House passed a $20.4 billion bill on July 27, and a House-Senate Conference agreement was reached for $21.3 billion on September 24. The bill was signed into law on September 29, 1999. The Administration requested $22 billion for civil projects funding for various agencies in FY2000, with the House increasing the allowance by $800 million. The Senate bill aimed to reduce funding for the Corps of Engineers. The Senate bill aimed to reduce funding for the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation in FY2000. The House recommended increasing the Corps appropriation to $4.19 billion and the Bureau of Reclamation to $785 million. The House and Senate Conference settled on $4.14 billion for the Corps of Engineers and $769.3 million for the Bureau of Reclamation. DOE programs funded by the Senate bill would have risen about 4% to $17.1 billion. The House and Senate Conference agreed to fund DOE programs at $16.6 billion for FY2000, with most cuts in cleanup and weapons programs. The remaining $1.2 billion of DOE's net appropriations request is included in the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The Clinton Administration sought a slight increase for civil projects of the Army Corps of Engineers in FY2000, with a $3.9 billion request for 19 new construction starts. The Senate approved $3.7 billion, the House supported $4.2 billion, and the conference agreement funded the Corps of Engineers at $4.14 billion. Major initiatives included a $951 million Harbor Services Fund for port improvements and $25 million for the \"Challenge 21\" river restoration program. The FUSRAP program, transferred from DOE in FY1998, cleans up contamination at old industrial sites processing nuclear materials for defense. Funding for Corps of Engineers civil programs is often contentious, with Congress typically adding more projects than requested. For example, in FY1998, Congress added $270 million to the $3.63 billion requested by the Administration. In FY1999, $3.86 billion was allocated for the Corps, $638 million more than requested. The Administration's FY2000 request of $3.9 billion included $80 million for 19 new construction starts. The Senate bill reduced Corps funding by over $200 million below the Administration's request, with cuts mainly in the construction budget. The proposed Harbor Services Fund aimed to replace the existing Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund with a new fund from a proposed Harbor Services User Fee. The Senate Appropriations Committee report aimed to maintain continuity in previously funded construction projects with some flexibility in schedules. The House bill increased Corps funding by over $280 million but did not support the Challenge 21 proposal or modify harbor maintenance through appropriations. Policy issues regarding wetlands regulatory programs were addressed in the final bill, including a provision for unsuccessful appellants to challenge Corps decisions in court. The conference report deleted House language allowing certain administrative decisions to be appealed to federal courts before a final permit decision. It included Senate language allocating $5 million for an administrative process for appeals of jurisdictional determinations by the Corps related to wetlands. The House bill also required the Corps to submit a study on the workload impact and compliance costs of replacement permits for \"nationwide permit 26\" (NWP 26). The Corps proposed changes to restrict the use of NWP 26, a program allowing certain activities to fill small wetlands. Landowner and developer groups supported the changes, but the Administration opposed them, citing concerns about delays in issuing replacement permits. The conference report on H.R. 2605 directed the Corps to study the workload impacts and compliance costs of the proposed replacement permits. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The Administration's FY2000 request for the Bureau of Reclamation increased by more than 10% from the previous year. The bill included no new funding for the Animas-La Plata water supply project in Colorado, instead allocating $3 million for preconstruction activities from previous appropriations. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations include funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The Bureau of Reclamation has been involved in building large dams and water diversion structures in the West. The appropriations also include funds for Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission activities and a contribution authorized by the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The Bureau of Reclamation manages over 600 dams in 17 western states, providing water for agriculture and millions of people. In the last 15 years, it has shifted to focus on water resource management, aiming to operate facilities efficiently, sustain ecosystems, and assist with water-related issues in a sustainable manner. The Bureau of Reclamation faces challenges in addressing new water demands due to existing laws and contracts governing water delivery. The Administration requested $856.6 million for FY2000, with the Senate bill proposing $761.2 million. Water project appropriations were recommended to be $40.4 million less than requested. The House bill included $784.7 million for water projects, $71.9 million less than requested but $2.7 million more than enacted for FY1999. The final bill appropriated $769.3 million for FY2000, approximately $85 million less than requested. One major difference between the House and Senate bills was funding for the California Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration program (CALFED), with the FY2000 request being $95.0 million. The Senate bill figure is $50 million for FY2000. The Senate bill for FY2000 is $50 million, $45 million less than requested and $25 million less than enacted for FY1999. It includes $37.3 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, $4.2 million more than enacted for FY1999. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $75.0 million for CALFED, matching FY1999 funding. P.L. 106-60 appropriates $60 million for CALFED, $15 million less than requested. The Energy and Water Development bill includes all but $1.2 billion of DOE's $17.8 billion FY2000 net appropriations request. The Energy and Water Development bill includes most of DOE's $17.8 billion FY2000 appropriations request, with major activities in research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The bill boosts DOE programs by 4% to $17.1 billion, with the remainder of the budget request for fossil fuels programs, energy efficiency, and energy statistics included in a separate appropriations bill. For FY2000, DOE requested $3.48 billion for civilian R&D and $3.40 billion for national security R&D. The DOE requested $3.40 billion for R&D in FY2000, a 4.7% increase from FY1999. The solar and renewable energy program received a boost to $398.9 million, with increases in funding for photovoltaics, biomass, wind, and solar program support. Additionally, $47.1 million was requested for renewable energy-related research programs under the Office of Science. The Senate rejected most of the DOE's requested increase of $47.1 million for renewable energy programs, recommending $353.9 million instead. A floor amendment to increase funding by $70 million failed. The approved figure covers $306.8 million for EERE programs and $47.1 million for OS programs, which is less than the requested amount. The House Appropriations Committee also rejected the proposed increase, recommending $326.5 million for FY2000. The Committee recommendation for renewable energy programs is $119.6 million, which is 27% less than the request. This includes reductions in funding for photovoltaics, biomass, wind, and solar program support. The total approved funding for EERE is $362.2 million, with $315.1 million for EERE programs and $47.1 million for DOE's OS Programs. The Office of Management and Budget expressed opposition to the bill due to cuts in renewable energy funding. The Conference figure for EERE is $84.3 million, 21% less than the request. It includes reductions in funding for Photovoltaics, Biomass, Wind, and Solar Program Support. A new $1 million Electricity Restructuring Program is included in the bill to provide technical assessments of policy concepts and programs such as renewable portfolio standards, public benefits funds, and green power marketing programs. The DOE was appropriated $288.7 million for nuclear energy programs in FY2000, including research, development, space power systems, and uranium programs. Funding was increased for innovative nuclear energy research projects, such as the \"nuclear energy research initiative\" (NERI). Additionally, funding was provided for a separate research program to improve the economic competitiveness of existing nuclear power plants. The NEPO funding focuses on extending the operating lives of existing nuclear reactors to increase efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that DOE's nuclear energy research programs provide wasteful subsidies to a failing industry. Controversy surrounds the electrometallurgical treatment of DOE spent fuel. The DOE received $40 million in FY1999 for a demonstration program on rendering certain types of spent fuel safe for storage. A decision on a full-scale electrometallurgical treatment program will be made in FY2000. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $40 million for the program in FY2000, with $20 million for demonstration activities. Opponents argue that the treatment is unnecessary for separating plutonium. The DOE received $40 million in FY1999 for a demonstration program on rendering certain types of spent fuel safe for storage. A decision on a full-scale electrometallurgical treatment program will be made in FY2000. Opponents argue that such treatment is unnecessary and could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons. The final bill also includes $9 million for research into the use of particle accelerators to transmute long-lived elements in radioactive waste into shorter-lived elements for safer disposal. The Senate appropriated $2.73 billion for Science for FY2000, 3.7% below the request, but 0.4% above the FY1999 level. The Senate approved $169.0 million for SNS construction, but did not provide any funding for the SSI project. Most other programs would receive small reductions in funding. The House recommended $2.72 billion for Science for FY2000, with small reductions in other programs. They did not fund the SSI project, citing budget constraints and the existence of the ASCI program. $50 million was allocated for SNS construction, contingent on resolving project management issues. The final appropriations bill provides $2.80 billion for Science programs for FY2000, including $117.9 million for SNS construction and $250 million for the Fusion Energy Science program. Congress expressed strong support for DOE supercomputer programs and urged a comprehensive plan for a civilian supercomputing program. The DOE's national security R&D request focuses on the stockpile stewardship program, which aims to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile without testing. The program includes developing computational capabilities for simulating weapons explosions. The Senate appropriated $2.352 billion for Stockpile Stewardship in FY2000, expressing concern over insufficient funding for the program. The Senate approved additional funding for the Stockpile Stewardship program, including $35 million for strategic actions and $10 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion program to avoid delays in the National Ignition Facility project. The Senate also commended the Department of Energy's achievements and recommended speeding up the project to reach the 100 teraflop goal. The House approved $2 billion for Stockpile Stewardship for FY2000, with reductions in core activities but an increase for the ASCI effort. The Inertial Confinement Fusion program received an additional $10 million, and the NIF project would be fully funded for FY2000. The House recommended $10 million for high-average-power laser development and $14 million for technology transfer and education activities, citing budget constraints. It also noted security issues at DOE weapons labs and proposed restructuring national security programs. An independent agency was deemed necessary for effective action. The House recommended delaying $1 billion in DOE obligations until after June 30, 2000 to allow time for bipartisan legislation. The FY2000 Defense Authorization Act reorganized the weapons program within DOE. $2.252 billion was provided for Stockpile Stewardship, with a $64.8 million reduction in weapons activities funding. The actual amount for the program may be less than $2.252 billion. $316 million was allocated for the ASCI program. The conferees allocated $316 million for the ASCI program, $25 million below the request. The House's additional $10 million for high-average-power laser development remains in the final bill. The NIF cost estimate increase was met with strong disappointment, with DOE ordered to submit a certified cost estimate by June 1, 2000. The bill appropriated $745 million for nonproliferation and national security programs. The bill appropriated funds for security programs aimed at helping Russia and other former Soviet states with nuclear weapons activities. This included initiatives like the Nuclear Cities Initiative and the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention. The budget for these programs was adjusted, with $150 million allocated for the Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program. The bill appropriated $150 million for DOE's Environmental Management Program, which is responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at DOE nuclear sites. The FY2000 appropriation includes funds for privatization projects and uranium enrichment decontamination. The total appropriation is slightly below the Administration's request but above the FY1999 funding level, with a focus on accelerated cleanup to maximize completed sites by FY2006. Savings can be achieved by completing work at sites like Rocky Flats and Fernald, with $1 billion allocated for Defense Facilities Closure Projects in FY2000. Privatization projects include Hanford Tank Waste Remediation System, Idaho National Engineering facility, and Oak Ridge waste treatment facilities, aiming to reduce costs. The EM privatization effort aims to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting project risks to contractors. Contractors would need to raise funding for facilities and equipment, recover investments by charging fees for services provided under the contract. Profit would be based on meeting project schedules and controlling costs. The House recommended eliminating $3.7 million in funding for the DOE National Low-Level Waste Program, stating that federal funding is no longer necessary due to mature state expertise. $595,000 is allocated for maintaining federal low-level waste databases in FY2000, with an additional $10 million for cleanup activities. The House recommended eliminating $3.7 million in funding for the DOE National Low-Level Waste Program, citing mature state expertise. $595,000 is allocated for maintaining federal low-level waste databases, with an additional $10 million for cleanup activities at DOE's uranium enrichment plants in Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio. Recent controversy surrounds environmental hazards at the plants, particularly contamination from past uranium enrichment activities. Additionally, DOE requested $409 million for the civilian nuclear waste program in FY2000, with $39 million coming from unspent funds appropriated in FY1996 for an interim waste storage program. The FY2000 Energy and Water Development bill provides $352.5 million for the program. The Energy and Water Development bill allocates $352.5 million for the Civilian Nuclear Waste Program, focusing on a proposed underground repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The program's major efforts for FY2000 include completing the Environmental Impact Statement, preparing a site recommendation report for the President in FY2001, and submitting a license application to the NRC in 2002. Missing critical milestones could delay the repository's opening in 2010. Despite not receiving full funding, DOE emphasizes the importance of meeting these milestones to stay on schedule. The House Appropriations Committee cut DOE's waste program funding to $281 million due to budget constraints. The final appropriation includes $240.5 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $112 million from the defense nuclear waste disposal account. The 2010 target for a permanent repository is 12 years later than the statutory deadline of January 31, 1998. Utilities and regulators have won court decisions holding DOE accountable for the missed deadline. The Department of Energy is obligated to meet deadlines and compensate utilities for damages. Congress provided funding for research on treating radioactive waste in FY1999. DOE requested funding for the Yucca Mountain Project in FY2000. Congress rejected most of the funding request for Nevada in FY1999. The DOE requested $250,000 out of nearly $5 million for Nevada, with concerns about the state's use of funds. The Senate approved $10.1 million for Nevada and local governments in FY2000, while the House recommended no funding. The conference agreement allocated $500,000 for DOE reimbursement of state oversight costs and $5.4 million for affected local governments. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established from dam construction projects in the 1930s for water resource management, with many facilities also generating electricity. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established from dam construction projects in the 1930s for water resource management. The PMAs sell excess power at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies at low rates. They do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The PMAs cover expenses, repay debt, and manage federal investments in generating facilities. The 104th Congress debated selling the PMAs, authorizing the divestiture of the Alaska Power Administration in 1995. Sale of the remaining PMAs has not been an issue since then. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established in the 1930s from dam construction projects for water resource management. They sell excess power at wholesale to electric utilities and federal agencies at low rates. The PMAs do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated selling the PMAs, but the sale of the remaining PMAs has not been an issue since then. The Administration's request for the PMAs for FY2000 was $200 million, a reduction of 15.8% from the FY1999 appropriation. The savings stemmed from the proposal that customers of SEPA, WAPA, and SWPA would be responsible for making their own power purchases and transmission arrangements from suppliers other than the PMAs. The proposed elimination of the Purchase Power and Wheeling Program (PPW) was based on the idea that deregulation should make it less expensive and less complicated for PMA customers to make these arrangements. The Senate passed the bill with the PPW program maintained and more than $80 million restored, despite bipartisan controversy. The House supported the Administration's proposal, but the Senate position prevailed in the enacted bill. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federal corporation established in 1933 to provide electricity and development to a region spanning multiple states. TVA's electric power operations are self-supporting and do not receive appropriations. They also handle non-power functions like flood control, recreation, navigation, and environmental research. TVA operates dams, reservoirs, and a recreational area in Kentucky and Tennessee. Critics argue TVA should fund non-power programs internally due to declining congressional appropriations. FY1998 saw a recommended $70 million appropriation, with TVA expected to cover costs through savings. Administration requested $77 million for these programs. The Administration requested $77 million for TVA non-power programs for FY1999, with the House holding to the prior year's conference report. The Senate proposed $70 million, but the House position prevailed in the enacted Energy and Water Appropriations. Conferees later restored $50 million to TVA for non-power programs in an omnibus spending bill. Additionally, TVA was authorized to refinance $3.2 billion of its debt to the Federal Financing Bank, expecting to save $100 million annually. This refinancing was intended to support non-power programs without further appropriations. The Administration requested $7 million for the operation of LBL for FY2000. The House Appropriations recommended no funding for TVA, while the Senate concurred. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requested $471 million for FY2000, an increase of $1.6 million over FY 1999 for safety regulation of commercial nuclear reactors. The NRC requested $471 million for FY2000 for safety regulation of commercial nuclear reactors, licensing of nuclear waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The funding request included $6 million for the NRC inspector general's office, with a $1 million cut in the conference report. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticized NRC for failing to update its regulatory system, citing inconsistencies in regional offices, inappropriate interference with nuclear plant management, and outdated review processes. NRC's FY2000 budget justification claimed sufficient funding to address these concerns. The Senate and House approved NRC's full budget request for FY2000, with a $10 million cut by the House later reversed in conference. The budget will be mostly covered by fees from nuclear power plants, with an extension of fee-collection authority included in the Energy and Water bill. The DOE reimburses NRC for oversight of its nuclear waste disposal program and funds various NRC programs. Key issues include foreign nuclear safety efforts, renewable energy, fusion energy, DOE restructuring, National Ignition Facility, and civilian nuclear spent fuel storage options."
