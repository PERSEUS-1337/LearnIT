    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2003\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Congress finds that the Holocaust was one of the most tragic crimes in history, with 6 million European Jews murdered and families destroyed. Holocaust survivors faced challenges in reclaiming insurance policies due to lack of documents, and have been fighting for decades to settle unpaid claims. The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) was established in 1998 to address unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims. The United States and Germany signed an Executive Agreement in 2000 supporting the ICHEIC to resolve Holocaust-era insurance policies from German companies. Additionally, the United States and Austria signed an Executive Agreement in 2001 designating the ICHEIC to address unpaid insurance claims. As of February 2003, over 80 percent of the 88,000 claims filed with ICHEIC remained unresolved due to claimants not being able to identify the insurance companies holding the policies. Insurance companies in the US have a responsibility to disclose Holocaust-era insurance policies to facilitate their quick resolution. The Act aims to provide information on Holocaust-era insurance policies to victims and their heirs for prompt claims filing, preventing further victimization. The Holocaust Insurance Registry is established by amending Chapter 21 of title 44, United States Code. The Archivist will collect and maintain records provided under the Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2003, making the information publicly accessible and searchable. The Holocaust Insurance Registry requires insurers to disclose information about Holocaust-era policies, including policyholder details and issuing entities. Insurers must file this information electronically within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, insurers must provide information to the Archivist for public access. The Secretary of Commerce must promptly provide filed information to the Archivist of the United States. A civil penalty of at least $5,000 per day will be imposed on insurers for non-compliance with section 4. Amounts received as civil penalties may be used by the Archivist to maintain the Holocaust Insurance Registry. SEC. 8. NOTIFICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce will notify each State's insurance commissioner of insurers failing to comply with section 4 or pay civil penalties under section 6. Upon request, the Secretary will inform state commissioners about non-compliant insurers.\n\nSEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES. SEC. 9. STATE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS REPORTING STATUTES. This Act does not preempt State laws requiring insurers to disclose information on insurance policies taken from victims of Nazi persecution. If litigation is dismissed because the State's insurance commissioner relies on this Act, each party should bear its legal fees. The Act defines key terms such as \"commissioner of insurance,\" \"covered policy,\" and \"insurer\" related to insurance policies issued to individuals affected by Nazi Germany during a specific time period. The term \"related company\" refers to an affiliate as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act."
