    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" and includes a section on mandatory congressional review of certain rules in the United States Code. The \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" includes sections outlining rules subject to mandatory congressional review, agency submission requirements, and the introduction and referral process for approval bills. Sec. 817 of the \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" outlines the process for introducing and referring approval bills in Congress after an agency submits a report. The Majority Leader of each House must introduce a bill approving the agency rule within 3 legislative days, or any Member can do so within 7 days if the Majority Leader does not act. The bill introduced under Sec. 817 of the \"Taxpayer's Defense Act\" must be referred to the relevant Committees in Congress. The House of Representatives committee must report the bill without amendment within 30 days of its introduction, or a motion to discharge the committee can be made by a Member favoring the bill. The motion to discharge the committee can be made by a Member favoring the bill, with limited debate time and the previous question ordered on the motion without a reconsideration option. During consideration of a bill, if a committee has been discharged, the House can move to the Committee of the Whole for further discussion. Points of order against the bill are waived if the report has been available for a day. The motion is privileged, and reconsideration is not allowed. General debate in the Committee of the Whole is limited to one hour. During consideration of a bill, the House can move to the Committee of the Whole for further discussion, with general debate limited to one hour. Appeals from decisions on House rules regarding a bill's procedure are decided without debate. In the Senate, any introduced bill is referred to the appropriate committee. When a bill is introduced in the Senate, it is referred to the appropriate committee. The committee must report the bill without amendment within 30 days of its introduction. If the committee fails to do so, it is automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill, which is then placed on the Calendar. Bills received from the House of Representatives are not referred to committee and are placed directly on the Calendar. Motion to proceed to consider a bill under this rule is nondebatable. After 10 hours of consideration, the Senate must proceed to vote on a bill without further debate, except for a motion to reconsider or table. After 10 hours of consideration, a motion to extend the time for debate by up to 5 hours is allowed without debate. The debate time on the bill will be divided between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. A motion to recommit a bill is not permitted. If the Senate has passed a bill for the third time, it can be considered at any time. The Senate can move to consider a bill from the House of Representatives without debate, substitute the text with the Senate bill, agree to amendments, and vote on final disposition. Consideration of motions or appeals on a House message is limited to 4 hours. Debate on motions, amendments, appeals, or points of order related to House messages is limited to 30 minutes. Time for debate is divided equally between the proponent and majority manager, unless the majority manager is also the proponent, in which case the minority manager controls opposition time. Technical amendments are made to Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, including the addition of \"SUBCHAPTER I--DISCRETIONARY CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW\" and \"subchapter ii--mandatory review of certain rules\" sections. This involves rules subject to mandatory Congressional review, agency submission, and approval bill."
