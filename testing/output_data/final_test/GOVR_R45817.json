    "content": "Mozambique, in southeastern Africa, faces political, economic, and security challenges due to the dominance of the FRELIMO political party since independence in 1975. Tensions between FRELIMO and RENAMO have led to violence, disrupting the country's transition to peace after the civil war. The discovery of large offshore natural gas reserves in the north has potential for economic growth. The discovery of large offshore natural gas reserves in Mozambique in 2010 is expected to boost gas exports in the early to mid-2020s, along with rising coal exports, leading to rapid economic growth. Despite previous economic expansion post-civil war supported by foreign direct investment and aid, poverty rates remain high, with disparities in development needs and access to growth benefits. The post-2015 economic decline in Mozambique was triggered by the government's failure to report over $2 billion in state-guaranteed debt to the IMF, leading to a major scandal known as the \"hidden debt affair.\" This scandal involved corrupt loans provided by foreign banks to state-owned firms controlled by state intelligence officials, resulting in ongoing political and legal repercussions. The hidden debt affair in Mozambique led to a major political scandal, prosecutions, and aid suspensions. Observers question the government's ability to manage earnings from the energy sector. The scandal reduced Mozambique's sovereign debt ratings, leading to debt distress and limited access to credit for development projects. Public debt totaled $15.9 billion, 110.5% of GDP, with $1.2 billion in arrears. Security challenges also pose a threat to the country. Mozambique faced a $1.2 billion arrears and security challenges, including a political dispute with RENAMO and armed conflict, which led to a temporary cease-fire. In 2018, political and military agreements were signed to end the dispute, followed by a permanent cease-fire in August 2019. The country also dealt with an insurgency by armed Islamist extremists in the north, posing additional security threats. Recent developments and policy challenges in Mozambique have the potential to draw increased congressional attention, including U.S. private-sector stakes in the energy sector, state corruption implications, government integrity, U.S. counterterrorism concerns, and recovery from cyclones in 2019 prompting ongoing U.S. assistance. Mozambique gained independence in 1975 after a long armed struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. A civil war broke out in 1977 between FRELIMO and RENAMO, causing widespread devastation and economic challenges. After gaining independence in 1975, Mozambique experienced a civil war between FRELIMO and RENAMO. Economic liberalization began in the late 1980s, leading to a new constitution in 1990. Peace accords in 1992 ended the war, paving the way for multiparty elections in 1994. Postwar politics focused on competition between FRELIMO and RENAMO, with FRELIMO holding electoral majority since 1994. Initially, informal bargaining among political elites gave RENAMO influence, but FRELIMO later marginalized them using their electoral majority and control over the system. The country's constitution concentrates executive power in the office of the directly elected president, augmenting FRELIMO's influence over the economy and FDI flows. Former President Armando Guebuza centralized power in the presidency, appointed loyalists to state posts, and fostered an influential network of relatives and associates. RENAMO has engaged in a politics of obstruction and protest, boycotting elections or parliament and threatening due to grievances over electoral allocations and a narrow 1999 presidential election loss. RENAMO, under the leadership of Afonso Dhlakama until his death in 2018, often resorted to threats of violence or withdrawal from the political process to address electoral grievances. Dhlakama's approach yielded some concessions but was hindered by internal divisions, poor organization, and erratic leadership. The formation of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in 2009 by RENAMO dissidents, led by Daviz Simango, further divided the party. In 2009, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) became the third-largest party in parliament and nearly doubled its gains in the 2014 election. RENAMO, led by Afonso Dhlakama until his death in 2018, had the potential to resort to violence to achieve its aims, with ex-fighters loyal to the party and access to arms caches. Dhlakama began to marshal a military force in late 2012, reminiscent of its civil war tactics. In early 2013, RENAMO launched armed attacks on police, military personnel, state facilities, and civilians, leading to fatalities. Conflict paused briefly after a 2014 cease-fire accord but resumed due to dissatisfaction with election results. The renewed conflict involved enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and political killings by government forces, as well as attacks and looting by RENAMO forces. Peace talks and provisional agreements were frequent but a binding accord was elusive. Numerous peace talks and agreements were hindered by violence and intransigence from both sides, with RENAMO's shifting demands including electoral reforms, economic benefits, military integration, and political decentralization. A 2016 cease-fire reduced hostilities, and in 2018, President Nyusi and Dhlakama negotiated further. In early 2018, President Nyusi and Dhlakama negotiated a framework accord on political decentralization. After Dhlakama's death, parliament enacted constitutional amendments for elected provincial, district, and municipal assemblies. RENAMO's disarmament remains a point of contention for FRELIMO, but a memorandum of understanding on military integration and demobilization was signed in July 2018. In July 2019, a group of 50 RENAMO fighters began the demilitarization process at Satunjira, their wartime headquarters in Mozambique. The DDR process involved government and RENAMO military representatives, foreign military observers, and a U.S. officer overseeing the handover of weapons. The outcome raised questions about RENAMO's commitment to the demobilization process. The demilitarization process involving RENAMO fighters at Satunjira raised questions about their commitment. DDR began alongside a law granting immunity for crimes related to past hostilities. President Nyusi and RENAMO leader signed a permanent cease-fire and final peace accord, endorsed by Pope Francis. The peace accords were adopted as law by a parliamentary majority. The law incorporating peace agreements with RENAMO includes provisions for disarmament, DDR, and integration of RENAMO elements into police and military. It does not address RENAMO's demand for a role in the State Information and Security Service. International funding is expected to support implementation, but details on contributions and amounts are not specified. The peace agreements with RENAMO include provisions for disarmament, DDR, and integration into police and military. Funding details are unclear, but reports suggest monetary compensation for RENAMO leaders. Implementation challenges include legislation passage, electoral process, and demobilization of fighters. Internal RENAMO splits and perceived threats could hinder demobilization efforts. RENAMO members facing threats if they disarm, citing assaults by police and ruling party members. Internal divisions within RENAMO could also hinder disarmament and electoral prospects. The RENAMO \"Junta Militar\" accuses Momade of nepotism, cooperating with intelligence services, and ordering executions. They demand his resignation, threaten violence, and reject peace accords. They elected Mariano Nhongo as their leader and criticize Momade for excluding RENAMO forces from integration processes. They call for election postponement to allow Nhongo to compete. The Junta Militar's ability to influence elections or remove Momade as leader is uncertain. The RENAMO \"Junta Militar\" threatens violence and demands the resignation of leader Momade, accusing him of nepotism and cooperating with intelligence services. They have elected Mariano Nhongo as their leader and call for election postponement to allow Nhongo to compete. Observers and the opposition MDM party are concerned about the Junta's potential to disrupt the peace and electoral process. Jacinto Nyusi, a FRELIMO member, won the presidency with 57% of the vote, a drop from the previous election. RENAMO rejected the results, boycotted parliament, and demanded a joint caretaker government with FRELIMO. Despite some irregularities, the results were deemed credible. Local elections in 2018 were mostly peaceful, with some instances of violence. Prior to the 2019 national elections in Mozambique, there were allegations of electoral violence and procedural irregularities, with RENAMO threatening to deploy armed men to prevent rigging. After the vote, opposition parties filed legal appeals, but most were rejected on technical grounds. RENAMO and the MDM protested the outcomes in various cities, citing fraud and irregularities. Despite threats to halt the peace process, it continued, although incomplete. Reports surfaced of FRELIMO using state resources and pressuring public workers to support the party during campaigning. Prior to the 2019 national elections in Mozambique, there were allegations of electoral violence and procedural irregularities. The pre-election voter registration process was controversial, with indications of possible manipulation by the election administration secretariat. Registration in key pro-FRELIMO provinces exceeded the number of voting-age adults, leading to additional seats being awarded to FRELIMO. RENAMO's appeal against the registration in Gaza was rejected on a technicality. The controversy surrounding the Gaza registration in Mozambique led to the resignation of the head of the National Statistics Institute. Questions over the integrity of the voter registration process were raised, with allegations of favoritism towards FRELIMO. The impact of cyclones in 2019 also affected voter registration, displacing potential voters and causing loss of identification papers. RENAMO accused STAE's chief of bias, while the government may benefit from the cyclones impacting areas where RENAMO had positive electoral prospects. Mozambique faces a security threat from an Islamist extremist group in Cabo Delgado Province, separate from the RENAMO-state conflict. The group, known as Al Shabaab or Ansar al Sunnah, has targeted state facilities, civilians, and contractors, causing destruction with crude weapons like machetes. The group known as Al Shabaab or Ansar al Sunnah in Mozambique has caused destruction to village buildings and crops using crude weapons like machetes, guns, and explosives. They have reportedly killed over 300 people, often by beheading, leading to population displacements. The group targets those cooperating with the state and has killed state security forces and civilians in recent attacks. Limited information on the group is available due to restricted access by journalists and researchers, attributed to insecurity and state obstruction. The group may have ties to the Allied Democratic Forces in Central Africa. The ASWJ group in Central Africa has alleged links to IS and has claimed responsibility for attacks. Formed in 2014, it espouses jihad and the creation of a Sharia-based state, with roots in a group called Ansar al Sunna. The group targets those cooperating with the state and has ties to the Allied Democratic Forces. The ASWJ group in Central Africa, formed in 2014, advocates for a Sharia-based state and rejects state institutions and services. Influenced by foreign Islamist ideologies and ties to the Swahili Coast, the group has been influenced by Sheikh Aboud Rogo Mohammed. ASWJ members initially proselytized locally and later used payments and coercion to recruit, attracting both opposition and support. They have provided business loans and employment to locals. ASWJ in Central Africa provides business loans and employment to locals in exchange for loyalty. They target poor young males with limited education and may sponsor Islamic education abroad. Analysts suggest that the group, like other African Islamist armed groups, consists of disaffected youth driven by local grievances such as economic disparities and high unemployment. Other sources of local tension include loss of livelihoods, land seizures, and corruption in compensation processes related to natural resource industries. Some analysts believe ASWJ is involved in illicit activities in the region, including trafficking of various items like heroin, ivory, and gemstones. State officials benefit from this illicit trade, and state security forces have heavy-handed responses to ASWJ. State security forces' heavy-handed responses to ASWJ violence have alienated local populations, with reports of delayed arrival at attack sites, arbitrary arrests, inhumane treatment of detainees, and mass trials of alleged perpetrators. Despite rapid post-civil war growth, Mozambique's GDP growth has significantly declined in recent years. Mozambique's GDP growth has declined significantly in recent years, attributed to weak global commodity prices, poor weather conditions, undisclosed loans issue, and the RENAMO-government conflict. The effects of cyclones in 2019 may further reduce growth. Despite past growth reducing extreme poverty, poverty rates remain high, with 62.4% living on less than $1.90 a day in 2014. Average GDP per capita was $476 in 2018, making Mozambique one of the world's poorest countries. Mozambique's GDP per capita was $476 in 2018, the seventh-lowest globally, down from a peak of $620 in 2014. Despite improvements in social indicators since the war, the country still ranks low on the U.N. Human Development Index and struggles to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Limited development gains are attributed to FDI inflows focusing on large industrial projects, leading to high GDP growth rates but little overall progress. Large industrial projects in Mozambique have led to high GDP growth rates but limited overall progress in development. These projects often benefit politically connected elites and investors, rather than the general population. Some projects have resulted in loss of farmland and population displacements, while others are starting to benefit society through multiuse infrastructure investments. The disjuncture between the local economy and megaproject activity in Mozambique is significant. Most Mozambicans work in the informal sector, with limited access to credit and technical expertise, leading to constrained productivity. Youth unemployment is a major challenge, with many young people gravitating towards cities where job growth lags behind education and training rates. Despite substantial official development assistance, Mozambique's socioeconomic development gains have been moderate. Mozambique received an average of $1.96 billion in official development assistance annually from 2008 to 2017, with the United States being the largest bilateral donor. The country faces challenges such as high transaction costs, taxes, regulations, poor infrastructure, and corruption. Despite some improvements in the ease of doing business, Mozambique ranks poorly globally in indicators like starting a business, access to credit, investor protections, and tax payment complexity. Foreign direct investment has focused on the coal sector and natural gas development, peaking at $6.2 billion in 2013. Mozambique's FDI peaked at $6.2 billion in 2013, declining to $2.3 billion in 2017. It remains a top FDI destination in Africa, with a total FDI stock of $37.5 billion in 2017. The agriculture sector, employing 72% of the labor force, plays a crucial role in the economy by providing incomes and affordable food for urban consumers. The agriculture sector in Mozambique employs 72% of the labor force and contributes 21% of GDP. It is dominated by smallholders but has attracted over 400 large commercial investment projects in the past two decades, focusing on various products. Despite its importance, the sector has faced challenges such as low productivity, limited state funding, and contested land rights. Large FDI agro-projects have had mixed impacts on the sector. Large FDI agro-projects in Mozambique have varied impacts, with some receiving preferential access to land and displacing smallholders, while others create jobs through contract farming. The country also has significant coal reserves, becoming Africa's second-largest producer, with coal exports contributing significantly to the economy. Additionally, mining of other resources like graphite and titanium is on the rise. Exports of graphite, titanium, niobium, and tantalum are increasing in Mozambique, contributing 4% of export value in 2017. The power sector is a key focus for FDI and state investment, with 27% of Mozambicans having access to electricity in 2017. Hydropower accounts for 81% of installed capacity, but there are coal, natural gas, and solar electricity generation projects underway to address grid weaknesses and access disparities. The World Bank provided $150 million in 2017 to upgrade the sector. Mozambique has significant natural gas reserves, with estimates of at least 100 trillion cubic feet. Energy firms are investing in gas extraction infrastructure in the Rovuma Basin, with total investments projected to exceed $100 billion. Anadarko Petroleum leads one consortium in developing these reserves. Anadarko Petroleum leads one international consortium developing the Rovuma reserves, with production starting in 2024. ExxonMobil is also involved in a separate area with ENI and other firms. Gas exports are expected to boost public revenues and GDP growth significantly. Gas has been exported to South Africa since 2004 and is used domestically in various industries. The government of Mozambique guaranteed corrupt off-budget bank loans to state-owned enterprises totaling over $2 billion, which was not reported to the IMF until 2016. This led to a scandal causing some donors to suspend aid. The loans went to three SOEs owned by the State Information and Security Service, Defense Ministry, and other state agencies, with activities kept confidential under national security grounds. The government of Mozambique guaranteed corrupt off-budget bank loans to state-owned enterprises totaling over $2 billion, leading to a scandal. Three SOEs were involved in coastal surveillance, shipyards, and tuna fishing, but their business plans were flawed. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted officials and foreign investors for fraud in relation to the loans, alleging diversion of funds for bribes. The government of Mozambique guaranteed corrupt off-budget bank loans to state-owned enterprises totaling over $2 billion, leading to a scandal. Indictees include high-ranking officials collaborating with foreign investors in a fraud case involving loans from Russian state-owned VTB Bank and Credit Suisse. The indicted bankers proposed an exchange of Mozambican-issued Eurobonds for Credit Suisse securities to hide the fraud-related near bankruptcy of the SOEs. After defaulting on their loans, the government was forced to disclose further information about the scandal. The government of Mozambique guaranteed corrupt off-budget bank loans to state-owned enterprises totaling over $2 billion, leading to a scandal. The IMF and World Bank demanded an audit, revealing $713 million in deal price inflation and $500 million in unaccounted-for financing. Investigations and criminal prosecutions are ongoing, with arrests made including high-profile figures. Chang was arrested in South Africa on a U.S. extradition warrant. In late 2018, Chang was arrested in South Africa on a U.S. extradition warrant, but South African officials accepted an extradition request from Mozambique. In late May 2019, the government and creditors agreed to restructure the Ematum Eurobond bonds and $535 million in VTB MAM debts. The case has led to lawsuits and two indicted bankers pleading guilty. Legal and financial repercussions may continue if those responsible are not held accountable. Civil society groups advocate nonpayment of the debt, calling it \"odious.\" The Mozambique debt scandal involves allegations of corruption and illegal debt, with calls for repudiation due to its \"odious\" nature. Corruption is widespread in the country, particularly in key institutions like the police and judiciary. Mozambique ranks poorly on corruption perception indexes, with declining governance indicators. Despite having anti-corruption laws, weak institutional capacity and judicial accountability hinder effective implementation. The IMF reports state involvement in multiple economic sectors creates opportunities for corruption, notably in the extractive sector. Public corruption is linked to organized crime and black markets. Illicit financial outflows may have contributed as much as 48% of the country's trade with advanced economies in 2015. Financial fraud, tax evasion, drug trafficking, and other crimes are prevalent in Mozambique. The misappropriation of state funds, kidnappings, human trafficking, and wildlife trafficking in Mozambique generate a large share of money laundering. The country's unpatrolled coastline and porous borders make it a major corridor for illicit goods, with drug trafficking being a significant challenge. Mozambique serves as a transit point for heroin and cocaine trafficking, with the heroin trade being especially well developed, contributing significantly to the local economy. The weak fiscal and anticorruption institutions have raised concerns among observers. The government of Mozambique has taken steps to address weaknesses in fiscal and anticorruption institutions, including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in 2009. Plans are in place to increase transparency in beneficial ownership and business interests, establish a sovereign wealth fund for gas income, and allocate a portion of revenue for infrastructure development and poverty reduction. Bilateral relations are positive, although concerns have been raised by the United States regarding hidden debts. The United States has expressed concern over the hidden debts affair in Mozambique, highlighted by the late 2018 U.S. DOJ indictment of high-ranking officials. U.S. policy goals in Mozambique include promoting democratic governance, economic growth, trade, poverty reduction, and countering transnational crime. The U.S. is also leading efforts in humanitarian aid and rebuilding after cyclones in 2019. The United States supports cyclone recovery efforts in Mozambique, projecting billions of dollars needed for reconstruction. It is involved in mediating between RENAMO and the government, part of an international contact group. Bilateral ties were strengthened through a $506.9 million Millennium Challenge Corporation compact focused on infrastructure and agriculture improvements. The United States provides significant aid to Mozambique, focusing on various development projects such as sanitation, transportation upgrades, land tenure improvements, and increased farmer income. A Peace Corps program with 196 volunteers supports education and health care initiatives. U.S. bilateral aid aims to address instability drivers in northern Mozambique, including governance issues and lack of jobs, especially for youth. Assistance targets basic needs, education services, and private sector investment to enhance workforce skills. Nonemergency bilateral development aid totaled nearly $472 million in FY2018. Development aid for Mozambique in FY2018 totaled $472 million, with $428 million allocated to health programs. The Trump Administration requested $251.7 million for FY2019, mainly for health programs. The FY2020 request is for $403.5 million, with 98.5% for health aid. HIV/AIDS programming has been a major focus due to Mozambique's high adult HIV prevalence rate. Development aid for Mozambique in FY2018 totaled $472 million, with $428 million allocated to health programs. The Trump Administration requested $251.7 million for FY2019, mainly for health programs. The FY2020 request is for $403.5 million, with 98.5% for health aid. Most aid has been funded under the Global Health Program-State Department account and administered under the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Additional funds support programs to combat malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child health, family planning, reproductive health, and nutrition. Agricultural development, education, and connecting farmers to markets have also been priorities for U.S. aid in Mozambique. In FY2018, development aid for Mozambique totaled $472 million, with a focus on health programs. Funding for basic education decreased from $13.7 million to $3 million in FY2020. Aid also supported good governance programs and wildlife conservation efforts, including combating wildlife poaching and trafficking. USAID has also assisted coastal urban city governments in adapting to rising sea levels and regional conservation efforts. Mozambique is a key wildlife trafficking transit country, particularly for elephant ivory and rhino horn destined for Asia. The government lacks capacity to address violent extremism, so the State Department is helping develop a comprehensive counterextremism approach. Other donor governments are also working to build the capabilities of Mozambican security forces. The State Department, along with other donor governments, is working to increase U.S. counterextremism program assistance in Mozambique. Interagency teams have consulted with various actors to understand the drivers of violent extremism and have compiled a list of recommended interventions. However, there are still gaps in understanding the extent of extremism in northern Mozambique, including the groups' motivations, objectives, and funding sources. The U.S. plans to adjust its strategy as knowledge increases. According to State Department Southern African Affairs Director Stefanie Amadeo, recommended activities are underway in Mozambique to promote constructive dialogue, strategic communications, logistics support, and capacity building for law enforcement to address terrorism. USAID is funding a $2 million program to mitigate drivers of instability and violent extremism in Cabo Delgado province. In mid-2018, Mozambique joined the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT) initiative, which aims to support counterextremism programs and disrupt terrorist networks. This includes funding for various sectors such as law enforcement, military, and civil society programs. International narcotics smuggling is a concern for the U.S., with the DEA opening an office in Mozambique in 2017. The DEA opened an office in Maputo in 2017 to address concerns about international narcotics smuggling. Efforts are being made to enhance information sharing on money laundering, establish joint investigative units, enforce anti-money-laundering laws, and engage in military cooperation with the U.S. Africa Command. In early 2019, Mozambique participated in Cutlass Express 2019, a naval exercise focusing on combatting illegal trafficking and piracy. The country is eligible for trade benefits under AGOA but its exports to the US are limited. USAID supported the development of a Mozambique AGOA utilization strategy in May 2018. In June 2019, Mozambique hosted the US-Africa Business Summit. Mozambique hosted the US-Africa Business Summit in June 2019, attended by a U.S. high-level delegation. The U.S. Commercial Service expanded its presence in Mozambique due to rising U.S. investment in the energy sector. Expected gas and coal exports may lead to economic growth, but governance challenges like corruption and political decentralization could hinder development. The peace process with RENAMO and extremist violence in the north pose stability risks. The United States is providing assistance to address these issues. The United States is providing assistance to help Mozambique address challenges, including violence in the north and significant aid for the health sector. Cooperation is expected to continue in the coming years."
