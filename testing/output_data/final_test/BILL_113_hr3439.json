    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"New Markets Tax Credit Military Installation Act of 2013\" or the \"NMTC Military Installation Act\". Since 1988, over 300 military installations in 48 states and 3 territories have had their missions eliminated or realigned through 5 rounds of the Base Realignment and Closure process. 120 of these closures resulted in the loss of 300 or more jobs each, with no current federal programs to support redevelopment. Nearly 100 closed installations are in economically distressed communities with high unemployment rates. Since 1988, over 300 military installations in 48 states and 3 territories have had their missions eliminated or realigned through 5 rounds of the Base Realignment and Closure process. More than 20 of these former installations are located in severely distressed communities suffering from high unemployment and poverty rates. For example, the City of Vallejo, California filed for bankruptcy in 2008 due to the closure of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, resulting in the loss of almost 10,000 jobs. When a military base is closed, the Department of Defense completes necessary environmental cleanup and transitions the property to a Local Redevelopment Authority. The Local Redevelopment Authority and Adjustment create a plan for former military bases to facilitate timely and beneficial reuse, aiming to generate revenue. However, cleanup of these sites has often been delayed and costly, leading to economic distress in communities. The New Markets Tax Credit program, established in 2000, incentivizes private sector investment in low-income areas with tax credits through Community Development Entities. The NMTC program leverages private investment in distressed communities. Brunswick, Maine used NMTC to redevelop the former Naval Air Station, including building a manufacturing facility for Molnlycke Health Care and renovating facilities for Kestrel Aeroworks. Additional NMTC funds could have made the latter project three times larger. The NMTC program helped redevelop the former Naval Air Station in Brunswick, Maine, creating high-tech jobs and economic benefits. Surrounding communities still struggle with economic redevelopment after the military exodus. Focusing NMTC on these distressed communities can facilitate the economic redevelopment they need. PERMANENT APPLICATION OF NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT LIMITATION WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY MILITARY INSTALLATION REALIGNMENT OR CLOSURE. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allocate $100,000,000 in new markets tax credit limitation for qualified low-income community investments within former military installation boundaries impacted by realignment or closure. The amendments made by this section allocate new markets tax credit limitation for qualified community development entities focused on redeveloping former military installations, effective for allocations after December 31, 2013."
