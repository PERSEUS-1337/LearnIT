The Secretary may award grants to States for providing comprehensive eye examinations and treatment for children identified with vision problems, with a focus on those under 9 years old. Educational materials will also be developed and distributed to parents, teachers, and healthcare practitioners. The Secretary will develop criteria for a grant program focusing on vision assessment and follow-up services for children. Coordination with other health programs will also be ensured. The Secretary will establish a grant program under title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act for children's vision programs. States must submit an application detailing existing programs and how grant funds will be used to enhance efforts. The grant program under title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act for children's vision programs requires states to submit an application detailing how funds will be used to provide items or services for eligible children, without reducing existing vision care benefits.

To be eligible for the grant program, a child must not have vision coverage under any health insurance policy, must not qualify for coverage under various state or federal programs, and must be classified as a low-income child by the state. Additionally, states must commit to conducting evaluations within one year of receiving grant funds.
