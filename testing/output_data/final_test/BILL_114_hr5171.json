The \"Legacy IRA Act\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes. Amendment to section 408(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exempts qualified charitable distributions from gross income, with a limit of $400,000 per year. The \"Legacy IRA Act\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes. A qualified charitable distribution is defined as a direct distribution from an individual retirement account to a specified charitable organization or split-interest entity, with limits of $100,000 or $400,000 per distribution. The \"Legacy IRA Act\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes. A qualified charitable distribution is a direct distribution to a charitable organization or split-interest entity, subject to age requirements of 70\u00bd or 65. A qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement account to a split-interest entity is limited to individuals or their spouses, with no other income interests allowed. A qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement account to a split-interest entity is nonassignable and must be deductible for the entire value of the remainder interest in the distribution for the benefit of a specified charitable organization. A qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement account to a split-interest entity is nonassignable and deductible for the entire value of the remainder interest for the benefit of a specified charitable organization. The term 'specified charitable organization' refers to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A), excluding certain organizations. A 'split-interest entity' is defined as a charitable trust funded by a qualified charitable distribution. The curr_chunk discusses special rules for charitable remainder trusts funded by qualified charitable distributions, including unitrusts and charitable gift annuities. These distributions are treated differently from regular trusts under section 664(b). Qualified charitable distributions for charitable gift annuities are not considered as an investment in the contract for tax purposes. The entire distribution is treated as includible income for the beneficiary receiving the annuity or payment. The distribution is treated as includible income without regard to subparagraph (A) if it does not exceed the aggregate amount that would have been includible if all amounts in individual retirement plans were distributed during the taxable year. Adjustments will be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in the taxable year and subsequent years. The amendment excludes qualified charitable distributions from the deduction under section 170 and requires the entire amount to be considered for section 401(a)(9) purposes. Subparagraph (A) does not apply to distributions to split-interest entities after December 31, 2020. The amendment applies to distributions in taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
