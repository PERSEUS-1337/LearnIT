    "content": "The \"Unlocking Technology Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title for the Act. Infringement of a copyright is required for anticircumvention prohibition. Amendments to Section 1201(a) of title 17, United States Code, allow circumvention of technological measures for non-infringing purposes. Amendments to Section 1201(a) of title 17, United States Code, now allow circumvention of technological measures for non-infringing purposes, facilitating the infringement of copyright by circumventing measures for use in facilitating copyright infringement. It is not a violation to use, manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or traffic in any such measures. The new amendments allow circumvention of technological measures for non-infringing purposes, but it is still a violation to facilitate copyright infringement by trafficking in devices designed for that purpose. The Department of Commerce must submit a report on this within nine months of the Act's enactment. The report requested in paragraph (2) assesses the impact of section 1201 of title 17, United States Code, on consumer choice, competition, and free flow of information. It also considers whether section 1201 should be reformed or repealed, and identifies barriers to such reform or repeal, including international trade agreements and treaties. The committees involved are specified for the House of Representatives and the Senate. SEC. 3. NETWORK SWITCHING NOT INFRINGEMENT. Amends Section 117 of title 17, United States Code to allow copying or adapting software of a mobile device for connecting to a wireless network with owner consent. SEC. 4. HARMONIZATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS. The President must modify trade agreements to align with the changes in this Act. The amendments will apply after 9 months from the enactment date, with certain sections taking effect immediately."
