    "content": "The Andean Counterdrug Initiative aims to assist seven countries in the Andean region, including major drug producing countries like Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The program's objectives are to eliminate drug cultivation, build law enforcement infrastructure, and arrest traffickers. Additionally, the region includes oil-producing countries like Venezuela and Ecuador, which supply oil to the United States. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) supports Andean countries in economic integration and drug control efforts. U.S. funding for ACI, managed by the State Department, totaled nearly $4.3 billion from FY2000 to FY2005. Funds are used for eradication, interdiction, alternative crop development, and democratic institution building. Some funds are transferred to USAID for development programs. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) supports Andean countries in economic integration and drug control efforts through various programs. This includes training national police and military forces, providing communications and intelligence systems, supporting aerial eradication aircraft, and improving infrastructure for counternarcotics activities. Additionally, funds are allocated for development programs in coca growing areas, assisting internally displaced persons, promoting the rule of law, and expanding judicial capabilities. The ACI also funds the Air Bridge Denial Program operational in Colombia and temporarily suspended in Peru after an accidental shooting incident in 2001. The Air Bridge Denial Program, operational in Colombia, was suspended after an incident in which two Americans died. The program resumed in Colombia in August 2003, supporting aircraft fleet, pilot training, and logistical and intelligence support for tracking and inspecting aircraft suspected of drug trafficking. The program in Peru is still pending safety enhancements. The Administration requested $734.5 million for FY2006 for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, including $21 million for the Air Bridge Denial Program in Colombia and $40 million for a new component. In FY2006, Congress approved $734.5 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with $14 million allocated for the Air Bridge Denial program and $30 million for the Critical Flight Safety Program. Different funding levels were recommended for Colombia and Peru. The conference report allocated $131.2 million for alternative development and $27.4 million for Rule of Law programs in the Andean region. Additional funding is provided through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program and the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. The Defense Department has a counternarcotics account for worldwide programs managed by the U.S. Army Southern Command. FMF provides grants to foreign nations to purchase U.S. defense equipment and training to improve defense capabilities and strengthen military relationships. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program provides support to Colombia and the Andean region to strengthen national authority in areas used by guerrilla organizations, paramilitaries, and traffickers. Funding in FY2002 and FY2003 went towards protecting oil pipelines. In FY2005, $103 million was allocated for the region, with $99 million for Colombia. The FY2006 request was for $94 million, with $90 million for Colombia to support the military with specialized equipment and operational support. Other countries in the region also received funding to enhance their capabilities. In FY2006, funds were earmarked for countries in Latin America to strengthen capabilities for drug interdiction. The IMET program provides training to improve defense capabilities and develop relationships between U.S. and foreign militaries. The Administration had $242 million to fund unearmarked countries, with a request for $318 million. Amounts for Andean recipients may be trimmed due to decreased funds. In FY2006, IMET funding for the Andean region was estimated at $3.7 million out of a total of $14 million for all of Latin America. The request for FY2006 for the Andean countries was $3.5 million out of a hemisphere-wide total of $13.7 million, with Colombia receiving $1.7 million focusing on civil-military issues for military officers. The Department of Defense has authority for counternarcotics programs worldwide, with an estimated amount for Colombia in FY2004 at $122 million. The estimated amount for Colombia in FY2004 ranges from $122 million to $160 million. For FY2005, DOD counternarcotics funding for Latin America is $366.9 million, with up to $200 million planned for Colombia. In FY2006, DOD requested a total of $896 million globally for counternarcotics programs, with $368 million allocated for Latin America, including $122 million for Colombia. Colombia receives the largest portion of ACI funds, with the Administration requesting $463 million for FY2006. For FY2006, the Administration requested $463 million for Colombia, with $311 million for interdiction and eradication efforts, $125 million for alternative development, and $27 million for rule of law programs. Interdiction funds would support the Colombian military's aviation program and drug units, while alternative development programs aim to introduce new licit crops and develop local and international markets. Rule of law assistance would promote democracy through judicial reform and support for vulnerable groups. In FY2006, Congress allocated $469.5 million for Colombia, with funds for interdiction, alternative development, and rule of law programs. Assistance includes support for democracy, judicial reform, vulnerable groups, and training for advisors in rule of law areas. Additionally, funds are used to provide training and support to bomb squads to combat terrorist bombings in Colombia. Colombia's isolated terrain facilitates drug cultivation and processing, making it difficult for the government to exert control. The country has a history of democracy but also faces ongoing violence from guerrilla insurgencies, drug trafficking, and paramilitary groups. The main groups involved in these activities are FARC, ELN, and AUC, all designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the United States. The AUC and Colombian military have been accused of collaborating in fighting the FARC and ELN. U.S. Counternarcotics Assistance to Colombia totaled $97 million for FY2006, with funds split between interdiction and alternative development. Peru is the second largest recipient of ACI funding. Peru receives $108 million in FY2006 for improving airlift operations, coca cultivation assessment, demand reduction, and money laundering programs. Funds also support alternative development projects like road rehabilitation, land reform, and agri-business. Congress did not require notification for restarting the Air Bridge Denial program in Peru. Peru is a major cocaine producer, exporting to various markets. Joint U.S.-Peru interdiction efforts have been successful in counternarcotics operations. Counternarcotics efforts in Peru have led to a decrease in coca production, with joint U.S.-Peru operations and eradication programs playing a significant role. Despite facing resistance from indigenous communities, the Peruvian government resumed eradication efforts to qualify for trade benefits. Coca cultivation decreased by 15% in 2003, but there were conflicting reports in 2004, with the ONDCP noting a slight decrease and the United Nations reporting a 14% increase. The Peruvian government has resisted de-criminalizing coca growing due to President Toledo's low popularity and growing discontent in coca growing regions. U.S. Counternarcotics Assistance to Peru decreased from $90 million in FY2005 to $80 million in FY2006, with funds allocated for interdiction and alternative development. For FY2006, Congress approved $43 million for interdiction and $37 million for alternative development in Bolivia. Interdiction funds would support eradication programs, training for police, and aviation programs. Alternative development would focus on supporting licit crops and establishing integrated justice centers in conflictive regions. Bolivia, once a major coca producer, has made progress in reducing coca cultivation but faces challenges with social discontent over forcible eradication. The eradication of coca in Bolivia has led to social discontent and tensions over class and ethnicity, potentially causing political instability. Despite efforts to reduce coca cultivation, it increased in 2002 and 2003. The US has been involved in controlling coca production in Bolivia, providing assistance for counternarcotics efforts. Public opposition to Bolivia's counternarcotics policy has fueled popular discontent and contributed to political instability. The US counternarcotics policy in Bolivia has led to popular discontent and political instability. Coca growers have formed a political party, MAS, with Evo Morales winning the presidency in 2005. Morales' criticism of US counternarcotics policy has raised uncertainty about future US-Bolivian relations. Ecuador received $20 million in ACI funds for FY2006, with a focus on interdiction and alternative development. The assistance aims to prevent drug trafficking and guerrilla activities from spilling over from Colombia. Ecuador is a major transit country for drugs from Colombia and Peru, cooperating with the US in counternarcotics efforts. Ecuador faces challenges in countering drug trafficking due to weak institutions, corruption, and uneven implementation of laws. The government has implemented a new national drug strategy focusing on strengthening institutions and providing more resources for the National Drug Council. The US signed a 10-year agreement for a forward operating location in Manta for aerial counterdrug operations. Colombian guerrillas have been reported to enter Ecuador for rest and medical treatment, with FARC camps detected in Sucumbios province. Ecuadoran officials have uncovered and destroyed small cocaine processing labs in the border region, where barracks, ammunition, explosives, and radio equipment were found. Colombian refugees and paramilitary fighters have been causing issues in the area. The armed conflict and drug trafficking in Colombia are negatively impacting Ecuadoran peasants, with concerns about aerial fumigation harming the environment and health of Ecuadorans. US Counternarcotics Assistance to Ecuador from FY2000-FY2006 is detailed in Table 5. Brazil received $6 million in FY2006 ACI funds for interdiction and law enforcement activities to prevent drug spillover from Colombia. The country serves as a transit point for cocaine to Europe and the US, with increasing issues of crack cocaine and heroin abuse. Brazil has implemented counternarcotics laws and strategies, including a shoot-down law for the Air Force to use lethal force against drug traffickers. Brazil has implemented a 1998 shoot-down law allowing the Air Force to use lethal force against civilian aircraft suspected of drug trafficking. To control the Amazon region, Brazil has invested in the $1.4 billion Amazon Vigilance System (SIVAM) and established a military base at Tabatinga with 25,000 personnel. Programs like COBRA focus on border security with Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and Bolivia. The programs in Brazil focus on controlling land and air entry into the country, headquartered at Tabatinga. U.S. Counternarcotics Assistance to Brazil and Venezuela is highlighted, with Venezuela being a major transit route for drugs destined for the United States. According to the 2005 INCSR, Venezuela seized significant amounts of cocaine in 2002-2004 with cooperation from the U.S. Despite some tensions, both countries worked together on law enforcement leading to successful drug seizures. The report highlighted the need for Venezuela to improve in areas such as passing an Organized Crime Law, combating corruption, cracking down on document fraud, enforcing wiretaps, and eradicating opium poppy and coca. President Bush designated Venezuela as one of two countries failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements, despite an increase in drug seizures. Economic sanctions were waived, but concerns remain about Venezuela's lack of focus on counternarcotics initiatives and reduced cooperation with the United States. Venezuela's focus on counternarcotics initiatives and cooperation with the United States has decreased. The US provided $4.5 million for counternarcotics programs in Panama due to its strategic location for drug trafficking and money laundering. Panama is a major drug transit country and a concern for money laundering. Drug traffickers use various means to transport cocaine, heroin, and Ecstasy through the country. Security in the Darien region has improved, but smuggling of weapons and drugs from Colombia continues. Panama cooperates well with the US on counternarcotics efforts despite fiscal challenges. The US provides critical assistance to Panama for effective law enforcement despite fiscal challenges. Congress has imposed conditions on assistance for counternarcotics programs, with the most recent funding legislation being the FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2005 and FY2006 National Defense Authorization Acts included provisions related to Colombia, authorizing funding for drug interdiction activities. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act maintains language supporting a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and activities by designated terrorist organizations in Colombia. The focus of U.S. policy in Colombia remains on counternarcotics, alternative development, and judicial reform. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act increased the cap on U.S. military and civilian contractors in Colombia to support Plan Colombia. As of September 30, 2005, there were 359 U.S. military and 365 U.S. contractors in Colombia. Personnel levels fluctuated in the previous three months. The caps do not apply to foreign national contract employees or personnel at the U.S. embassy. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires the Secretary of State to provide a report on the proposed uses of ACI funds within 45 days of enactment. If any helicopter procured with ACI funds is used to aid illegal groups, it must be returned to the United States. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act mandates a report from the Secretary of State on relationships between foreign governments and designated terrorist organizations in Colombia. 75% of assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces can be provided without human rights certification, with the remaining 25% released in two installments. The first installment requires certification that members credibly alleged of human rights violations are suspended. The Colombian government is vigorously investigating and prosecuting members of the military alleged to have committed human rights violations or aided paramilitary organizations. The Armed Forces have made progress in cooperating with civilian prosecutors and severing links to paramilitary groups. The government is dismantling paramilitary networks and ensuring indigenous land rights are protected. The last installment of progress can be reported after July 31, 2006. The law requires the Secretary of State to certify Colombian Armed Forces' compliance with human rights conditions and vigorous operations against paramilitary and guerrilla groups. Visas are denied to those supporting these groups or involved in gross human rights violations in Colombia, with a provision for waivers on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary of State certifies visa issuance for peace process support in Colombia or urgent humanitarian needs. The Leahy amendment denies funds to security forces with human rights violations unless effective measures are taken. $228.8 million of ACI funds allocated for USAID, with $131.2 million for Colombia programs. The ACI funds allocated for USAID in Colombia include $6 million for judicial reform, $8 million for human rights programs, and $2 million for biodiversity and indigenous reserves protection. Additionally, $500,000 is designated for treating Colombian Armed Forces soldiers injured by land mines in the United States, with further assistance recommended for disabled civilians through the Leahy War Victims Fund. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires that a portion of funds for aerial coca and poppy fumigation in Colombia be withheld unless certain certifications are met regarding herbicide safety and compensation for harm. These funds are to be used for programs implemented by USAID, the Colombian government, or other organizations to assist civilians disabled by land mines. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits U.S. military personnel from participating in combat operations in Colombia. Certification is required for the Bolivian military to respect human rights before receiving ACI funds. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires certification for the Bolivian military to receive ACI funds, ensuring respect for human rights. $20 million is allocated for assisting in the demobilization and disarmament of former members of foreign terrorist organizations, with conditions such as renouncing affiliations with FTOs and Colombian government cooperation in extraditing indicted FTO leaders. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act report language urges funding for a maritime refueling support vessel for drug interdiction. H.R. 3057 fully funded the ACI at $734.5 million with conditions on assistance. The House provisions differed from the Senate regarding ACI funds availability, earmarks, and conditions on funding for aerial spraying in Colombia. The House provisions regarding the use of ACI funds by USAID for Colombia assistance programs, including a follow-up to Plan Colombia, are outlined. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other key officials, is directed to report on the future strategy for US assistance to Colombia, emphasizing the need for the Colombian government to take on more responsibility for maintaining assets. The House directed the Colombian government to assume operational and maintenance functions of Plan Colombia, report on actions to transfer responsibilities to Colombian nationals, address concerns about increased fuel costs, and allocated $5 million for programs benefiting internally displaced persons in Colombia. The House report supported alternative development programs in Colombia and emphasized the importance of law enforcement and security for long-term peace. USAID was directed to provide detailed steps on Colombia's rural development strategy. In Peru, the House expressed concern over proposed cuts to ACI programs and directed no less than $114 million in funding, with allocations for eradication, interdiction, and institution building. Funding would be reallocated from other programs. The Senate approved the Administration's request for Peru and supported a pilot project for counternarcotics objectives. They limited funds for Colombian Armed Forces and National Police and included conditions for assistance to Bolivia based on human rights compliance. The Committee urged USAID to collaborate with The Field Museum of Chicago on a project for community development and conservation education in Cordillera Azul National Park. The Bolivian military is cooperating with human rights investigations. The House did not provide funding for the demobilization of armed groups in Colombia, requiring consultation before any funds are used. The Senate included provisions for funds to be subject to consultation and notification, with restrictions on demobilization activities under U.S. anti-terrorism laws. The Secretary of State must certify Colombian law's consistency with the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty and extradition practices. The certification must find that Colombian law provides for effective investigation, prosecution, and punishment of members of foreign terrorist organizations charged with violations of humanitarian law and drug trafficking. Sentence reductions for these members are contingent on a full confession of criminal activity and turnover of illegal assets. Demobilized fighters will lose sentence reductions if found to have withheld assets, lied to authorities, rejoined an FTO, or engaged in new illegal activities. The bill requires an inter-agency working group to consult with Colombian authorities and issue a report on whether the FTO is violating cease-fires, its criminal structure is being dismantled, and the Colombian government is effectively prosecuting FTO commanders. The Colombian government is aggressively locating and confiscating illegal assets of FTOs, enforcing cease fires by barring accused individuals from benefits, and extraditing FTO commanders to the US. The Senate conditions 20% of funds for aerial fumigation on a certification of herbicide safety. The Secretary of State must report on water proximity to drug fields and herbicide toxicity within 180 days. The Senate maintained provisions for certification of human rights conditions before funding the Colombian military and added consultation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. $21 million was approved for the Air Bridge Denial program, with a recommendation for consolidation under a single aviation operation account. No funding was allocated for the proposed Critical Flight Safety program. The Senate approved $21 million for the Air Bridge Denial program, but no funding was provided for the proposed Critical Flight Safety program. The Committee recommended $90 million for Colombia in FMF funding and expressed concerns about the aerial eradication program falling short of predictions. Additionally, $5 million in ACI funds was recommended for technology to monitor web-based communications in Colombia for combating various criminal activities. Assistance was also recommended for Afro-Colombians, especially those internally displaced in the Choco region, through the Afro-Latino Development Alliance. The House and Senate passed the Foreign Operations Conference Report to combat various criminal activities in Colombia. The agreement fully funds the ACI at $734.5 million and provides $20 million for demobilization. The report removed the Senate provision requiring the Secretary of State. The conference report on U.S. assistance to Colombia removed the Senate provision for consultation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Instead, it expects the Secretary of State to consider their opinion and increased funding for development programs. The House bill makes assistance contingent on Colombia's framework for demobilization and cooperation with the U.S. on extradition requests. The House approved a Burton amendment authorizing the transfer of marine patrol aircraft to Colombia for interdiction purposes. The Senate is considering a foreign relations authorization bill that includes funding for ACI and conditions on assistance. The bill authorizes a unified campaign against narcotic trafficking and terrorist activities, maintains caps on personnel in Colombia, prohibits U.S. personnel from combat operations, and includes reporting requirements on human rights and U.S. operations. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) authorized $901.7 million for DOD-wide global drug interdiction activities, excluding provisions for Colombia or the Andean Counterdrug Initiative."
