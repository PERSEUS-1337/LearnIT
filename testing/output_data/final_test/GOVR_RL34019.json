    "content": "Restrictions on planting fruits, vegetables, and wild rice are part of a policy that allows planting flexibility for program crop farmers. This flexibility enables farmers to respond to market signals and not be tied to growing a specific crop to receive subsidies. The targeted restriction aims to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables from competition on subsidized land. Despite some problems with the policy, planting flexibility is seen positively from an economic theory and world trade agreement perspective as it separates production decisions from government subsidies. This helps minimize distortion in commodity markets. The planting flexibility policy, viewed positively by fresh fruit and vegetable growers, allows farmers to grow certain crops on designated \"flex acres.\" However, it is mostly negatively perceived by growers of processing fruits and vegetables and in the context of world trade rules. Officials are concerned about the impact on U.S. position at the WTO and the classification of direct payments as \"green box\" expenditures. The 1990 farm bill initiated planting flexibility and restricted planting of fruits and vegetables on program crop base acreage. The 1996 and 2002 farm bills allowed planting flexibility on base acres for program crops, with penalties for planting fruits and vegetables. Farmers violating the restriction lose payments and face financial penalties. Exceptions exist for farmers with a history of planting fruits and vegetables. Some midwestern producers have reduced vegetable plantings since soybeans became a program crop in 2002. Landowners now restrict fruits and vegetables on base acres to maximize soybean planting history or receive direct payments. Processors face shortages and struggle to contract new growers. Some producers face shortages and struggle to contract new growers for canning and freezing. Bills in Congress aim to allow producers to use base acres for fruits and vegetables without penalties. A WTO case against the US found restrictions on planting specialty crops affect subsidy payments. The Administration proposes eliminating fruit and vegetable planting restrictions in the 2007 farm bill to meet WTO obligations. H.R. 1371 / S. 1188 may not fully satisfy WTO rules as it only relaxes restrictions for processing, not fresh produce. Growers may seek compensation through direct payments or support for research and trade promotion. Policy options include retaining current restrictions or lifting them to address concerns in the WTO. The current option is to retain the planting restrictions, which may not satisfy concerns in the WTO cotton case and could subject the direct payments program to expenditure limits. Allowing fruits and vegetables for processing on base acres without penalties could appease midwestern growers, but may not fully comply with WTO rules. Legislation like H.R. 1371 / S. 1188 could address concerns for processing, but not for fresh produce growers. Eliminate planting restrictions on fruits and vegetables to address WTO cotton case violations and exceed proposals by midwestern growers. Farmers can grow fruits and vegetables on base acres without losing government payments. Transition out of direct payments to make planting restrictions irrelevant. Some call for ending direct payments in the 2007 farm bill for budget savings or due to inconsistency in making payments when farm income is high. Some suggest reconsidering direct payments due to planting restrictions on fruits and vegetables. Options include providing direct compensation to existing growers without base acres. Increase federal funding for research on fruits and vegetables to lower production costs, increase quality, and boost demand. Efforts to increase demand include market promotion, foreign trade assistance, and government purchases for nutrition programs. Five academic and industry studies compare the effects of removing restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables on base acres under the 2002 farm bill. The studies include research from USDA Economic Research Service, Michigan State University, and Arizona State University. Several studies conducted by academic and industry experts analyze the potential impacts of lifting planting restrictions on base acres under the 2002 farm bill. The studies, including those from Arizona State University, Texas A&M University, and Informa Economics, take different approaches to measuring these effects. Key differences between the studies are outlined in Table 1. Table 1 compares key differences between five studies analyzing the impacts of lifting planting restrictions on base acres under the 2002 farm bill. Three studies are national in scope (USDA, Arizona State, Informa), while two focus on regional impacts (Michigan State, Texas A&M). Different methodologies are used, with economic modeling in Texas A&M and Arizona State studies, and a descriptive approach in USDA, Michigan State, and Informa studies. USDA and Michigan State studies focus on county-level data to identify affected producing counties and crops, while Informa uses limited state-level data. The studies on lifting planting restrictions on base acres under the 2002 farm bill vary in methodology and data sources. Texas A&M and Arizona State used economic modeling to analyze expected costs and returns, while USDA and Michigan State focused on county-level data. Arizona State's model was not detailed, making evaluation difficult. Texas A&M and Arizona State also considered market interactions across crops, unlike USDA and Michigan State. The state studies indirectly considered expected costs and net returns, while the Informa study did not. Differences in research approach and scope complicate direct comparisons across studies, making it difficult to generalize the economic effects of lifting planting restrictions. Some studies do not account for production and market factors in the fruit and vegetable sectors, particularly barriers to entry. The studies examined the mobility of production between crops, focusing on fruits and vegetables. Most studies did not quantify potential price, revenue, and market impacts, making comparisons challenging. Informa and Arizona State studies estimated revenue losses for existing fruit and vegetable growers, ranging from $1.7 billion to $4.0 billion in the first year of lifting restrictions. Arizona State study also considered effects on all growers, including new entrants, and multi-year adjustments. The Informa study's high-end estimated effects are questionable due to not considering barriers to entry for fruit and vegetable production. Planting base acres to long-maturing tree crops and plantings by producers without a history of growing fruits and vegetables are also doubtful. The USDA and Michigan State studies suggest that removing the current restriction would have limited industry impacts, mainly affecting individual producers, commodities, and regions, with low overall industry effects. Industry impacts would likely focus on specific crops with a higher chance of conversion from program crops to fruits and vegetables. The Texas A&M study suggests that lifting the planting restriction could have adverse effects on certain crops, particularly potatoes and processed vegetables. Other studies show impacts on dry beans, squash, and processed tomatoes in specific regions. Additionally, there may be new entrants in the fruit and vegetable sectors. The potential adverse effects on specialty crop producers in Michigan and Texas due to acreage shifts in fruit and vegetable plantings are highlighted in various studies. Barriers to entry, such as capital investment, are emphasized as factors influencing production mobility between crops. The Informa study did not consider entry barriers to fruit and vegetable production or the possibility of switching program crops to permanent crops. It reported significant economic effects for specialty crop producers if current planting restrictions are lifted, but there are questions about the study's approach and assumptions. The study raises questions about the reliability of its estimated effects on fruit and vegetable production compared to commodity crops. Differences in machinery, technology, costs, labor, and marketing channels exist between the two sectors. Market trends and variations within the fruit and vegetable industry also impact the likelihood of conversion. The likelihood of conversion from program crops to specialty crops is influenced by market trends and production factors. Studies assume a greater likelihood of conversion to easily rotated specialty crops like vegetables and beans. Permanent crops are excluded from these studies, as they require lengthy cultivation before yielding results. The studies assume that farmers growing both program and specialty crops will potentially convert program crops to specialty crops like vegetables and beans. However, the Informa study may overstate market effects by not considering all factors influencing planting decisions for specialty crops. The studies on the potential market effects of eliminating planting restrictions on specialty crops vary in their projections. One study found that effects diminish greatly after the first year, while none of the studies addressed current market demand or differentiated between fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Relaxing planting restrictions proposed under H.R. 1371 / S. 1188 would only apply to producers growing for canning and freezing, not fresh market fruits and vegetables. USDA's Economic Research Service identified potentially affected counties for 8 product groupings including citrus, strawberries, grapes, vegetables, apples, potatoes, and beans. The approach involves mapping the intersection of crop production and base acreage to determine counties that may be impacted by lifting planting restrictions. The USDA's report analyzes county-level maps to show competition for land between program and specialty crops, focusing on fruits and vegetables that could be limited by base acreage restrictions. A case study on dry beans highlights potential impacts. The report considers various barriers to expanded specialty crop production and concludes that eliminating planting restrictions may have limited market effects, mainly in specific regions and commodities. Planting restrictions may have limited impacts on specific regions and commodities. Affected counties include eastern ND, southern MN, central WI, northern IL, western MI, western NY, eastern coastal plains (SC, GA), southern ID, central WA, CA, and FL. Dry edible beans, vegetables for processing, and potatoes could be most affected by lifting planting restrictions. Program crop producers are likely to benefit from the changes. Program crop producers may benefit from lifting planting restrictions, with vegetables having a share of >40%. Farmers could switch to less capital-intensive crops like dry beans or processing vegetables. Strengths include detailed county data analysis, while shortcomings include not quantifying price impacts or production interactions among crops. Michigan State University focuses on select regional crops. Michigan State University conducted field interviews to assess the likelihood of conversion from program crops to specialty crops in Michigan. Barriers to entry include capital investment, rotational requirements, market access, and labor needs. Financial inducements were measured by comparing DCP crop benefits to net returns for specialty crops at the county level. Michigan State University conducted field interviews to assess the likelihood of conversion from program crops to specialty crops in Michigan. Barriers to entry include capital investment, rotational requirements, market access, and labor needs. Financial inducements were measured by comparing DCP crop benefits to net returns for specialty crops at the county level, considering returns per acre for select specialty crops based on county-level production and acreage data. Input data included information on business activity, size, investment in machinery and equipment, production practices, contracts, farm management, labor, and markets from various sources. Financial analysis compared DCP crop payments and market revenue per acre minus variable costs per acre for traditional crops versus specialty crop revenue minus contract violation penalty and variable acre costs for select specialty crops. Commodities with high expected barriers to entry were excluded from the analysis. Counties with high vegetable production and potential for specialty crop growth are likely to be affected by barriers to entry for converting from program crops. Dry beans have the highest likelihood of conversion, with some potential for squash and processed tomatoes. However, barriers may limit new entrants and crop conversion. Michigan's 12 largest vegetable producing counties are identified as key areas for consideration. The curr_chunk discusses the 12 largest vegetable producing counties and their potential for specialty crop growth. Strengths include addressing barriers to entry and conducting thorough selection of affected commodities. Shortcomings include regional scope, lack of price/revenue impact quantification, and not addressing production interaction effects or market demand for specialty crops. The scope is national for select crops like broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, onions, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, and watermelon. The curr_chunk discusses a market simulation model developed by NFAPP to analyze the impact of converting program crop acreage to fresh produce production in 205 counties across various states. The study projected market impacts over an eight-year period using county-level production and value data from 2002. The analysis excluded sweet corn and sweet potatoes and did not provide information on the underlying model, making evaluation difficult. The market simulation model developed by NFAPP analyzed the impact of converting program crop acreage to fresh produce production in 205 counties. The analysis excluded permanent crops like nut and tree fruit crops, grapes, and perennial vegetables. New specialty crop acreage was allocated based on current cropping patterns, resulting in total industry revenue losses of $1.3 billion in Scenario A. Specialty crop producers faced greater losses at $1.7 billion, with adjustments expected over time. Specialty crop producers are adjusting to lower prices, with projected industry revenue losses of $120 million by 2015. Short-term value losses are expected to be highest for potatoes and onions, while long-term losses are projected to be greatest for broccoli. In Scenario B (5% acre conversion), new acres for 5 commodities could result in industry revenue losses of $1.7 billion in 2008. Losses to incumbent specialty crop producers are estimated at $2.4 billion. Industry revenue losses are projected at $204 million in 2015 as producers adapt to lower prices. The analysis identifies crops that could be affected by lifting planting restrictions and uses a simulation model to examine interaction effects over an eight-year period. The study focuses on potential revenue loss and shortcomings in examining a subset of affected crops in Texas. It uses a stochastic simulation model to estimate income distributions for alternative crops and assesses the impact of planting restrictions on corn, cotton, and sorghum acreage. The analysis is regional, covering crops like green cabbage, cantaloupe, corn, upland cotton, and watermelon in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The study analyzes the impact of planting restrictions on corn, cotton, and sorghum acreage in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas. Data includes annual prices, yields, and harvested acreage for various crops, as well as crop program data from 1970-2004. Predictions suggest acreage increases for watermelon and cabbage if planting restrictions are lifted, based on risk-adjusted net returns. The study examines planting decisions based on risk-adjusted net returns for various crops. Watermelon is preferred over cotton for risk-preferring producers, while cabbage is preferred over corn. Among risk-neutral producers, watermelon is favored over cotton, and cabbage over grain sorghum. Risk-averse producers prefer watermelon over all crops. Government payment program commodities are preferred over risks associated with planting onions, cantaloupe, or honeydew. Strengths include addressing risk and uncertainty in planting decisions using detailed price and cost input data. Shortcomings include regional scope and limited examination of select annual crops, without addressing potential downward price impacts or market demand trends. The study analyzes planting decisions for various crops based on risk-adjusted net returns. It focuses on specialty crops converted from program crops, assessing cross-subsidization effects among producers receiving DCP benefits. The analysis covers 25 commodities in 15 states, excluding Florida, and considers market demand and trends that may impact marketability. The study analyzes the impact of Direct and Counter-cyclical Program (DCP) benefits on crop producers, considering a \"wealth effect\" and reduced planting risk. It calculates average fixed direct payments and three-year average counter-cyclical payments, adjusting for state \"weights\". Market impact effects are assessed, including potential revenue reduction for specialty crop producers due to increased acreage and production. Increased specialty crop acreage is estimated on two farm categories: farms producing program crops only, with no history of specialty crops (new entrants), and farms that produce both specialty and program crops. Acreage increases are estimated using state \"weights\" and assuming a flat 5% increase for category (2) acreage. Increases are allocated to 25 specialty crop groupings by state, with price and revenue reductions determined based on the calculated acreage increase and an assumed price response of -1.11. Direct payment per acre for 8 commodity groupings and counter-cyclical payments averaged over a three-year period for 7 commodity groupings. Fruit, nut, and vegetable acres in the U.S. and top-producing states. Market impact effects on planted acres for farms with specialty crops only, program crops only, and both. Production and production value data for the U.S. and states. Price response estimate based on demand elasticities for 10 crops from USDA and Georgia College studies. Estimated combined financial effects to existing specialty crop producers is $4 billion/year, with $806 million/year for cross-subsidization effects and $3.1 billion/year for market impact effects. The U.S. is expected to see a 10% increase in specialty crop acres, with the largest acreage increases in farms producing program crops only. California will have the greatest acre increase, mainly from rice and cotton, while Idaho and Colorado will see the greatest percent acre increase, with potatoes being the main crop. The analysis estimates price and quantity changes, revenue loss, and potential strengths and shortcomings of the effects on specialty crop producers. However, the analysis may overstate effects due to assumptions about DCP benefits and does not consider other market-based factors influencing planting decisions. The analysis overstates the number of new entrants in specialty crops by not considering market-based factors like barriers to entry, likelihood for conversion, and differences in machinery and technology needs. The curr_chunk discusses factors influencing the development of crops for commercial viability, including differences between fresh market and processing crops, market trends, and potential impacts on potato and dry bean production."
