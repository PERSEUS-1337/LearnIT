    "content": "The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999 may be cited as the \"Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999\" and includes amendments. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999, also known as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, has been amended to include definitions related to employee religious accommodations and the term \"undue hardship.\" The term \"employee\" now includes prospective employees, and \"undue hardship\" is defined as an accommodation requiring significant difficulty or expense. The term \"undue hardship\" under the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999 refers to accommodations that may result in an employee being unable to perform essential job functions. Factors considered include the identifiable cost of accommodation, the number of individuals needing the accommodation, and the geographic separateness of employer facilities. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999 defines \"undue hardship\" as accommodations that may make it difficult or expensive due to geographic separateness or administrative relationships. Additionally, the Act amends Section 703 to include prospective employees and defines \"leave of general usage\" as flexible leave policies. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999 defines \"undue hardship\" as accommodations that may make it difficult or expensive. An employer commits an unlawful employment practice by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for religious observance if the accommodation does not remove the conflict between work requirements and religious practices. Employers must allow the use of general leave to accommodate religious practices. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999 requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for religious observance, even if it conflicts with seniority systems. This includes adjusting work hours, shifts, or job assignments to accommodate religious practices. An employer is not obligated to pay extra wages or benefits for work done during hours that would typically receive premium compensation, if it is only done to accommodate an employee's religious requirements. Premium benefits include seniority, insurance, leave, and pensions, while premium wages cover overtime pay. The term 'premium wages' includes overtime pay, compensatory time off, premium pay for night, weekend, or holiday work, and premium pay for standby or irregular duty. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS. This Act and its amendments take effect upon enactment, with exceptions for conduct before enactment."
