The Congress finds that fishing and hunting are important traditional recreational activities with millions of Americans participating. Survey data shows strong approval for these activities, and anglers and hunters support wildlife management and conservation practices. Fishing and hunting activities support wildlife management by generating funds for research and conservation. Each State has agencies dedicated to managing fish and wildlife, ensuring sound programs are in place. Federal agencies managing natural resources on Federal public land must support hunting and fishing opportunities in accordance with State and Federal laws. Federal agencies managing natural resources on Federal public land must support hunting and fishing opportunities in accordance with State and Federal laws, including regulations on the taking of fish and wildlife. Federal public land and water are generally open for fishing and hunting, with limitations set by the State or Federal agency for reasons of national security, public safety, or as authorized by statutes. Closures can only be in effect as long as specific circumstances exist. Federal agencies can close land or water for hunting or fishing, but not to manage fish or wildlife. National parks and monuments under the National Park Service are not required to open for hunting or fishing. Federal agencies are not obligated to prioritize hunting or fishing over other land uses. State authority in regulating fishing and hunting on federal land is not affected by this Act. The authority of Federal agencies for taking fish and wildlife on Federal public land is limited to that of a private landowner, unless specified by Congress.

The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and the Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act are being amended to change the responsible department from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior.
