    "content": "The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill funds the planning, design, construction, and improvement of DOD facilities worldwide, military family housing, NATO Security Investment Program, veterans benefit and health care programs, U.S. cemeteries and monuments, U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Armed Forces Retirement Homes, Arlington National Cemetery, and construction for contingency military operations and veterans' medical services. The Trump Administration's budget proposal to the 115th Congress included $646.9 billion for Department of Defense Military spending, with $10.4 billion allocated for military construction and family housing. This marked a significant increase over FY2017 enacted totals, with the additional funds intended for new missions, support to Geographic Combatant Commands, and medical facility recapitalization. The Administration's FY2018 defense appropriations request included additional funding of $920 million, with changes made to the MILCON topline. This included justification materials for Air Force projects related to KC-46A Main Operating Base construction at Travis Air Force Base, CA and Joint Base McGuire Dix Lakehurst, NJ. The original request had a single line item for all 15 projects, but later documents itemized each project separately. The Administration requested amendments to various accounts to align with policies and add omitted appropriations language. Additional funds were requested for missile defense against North Korea and hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Congress approved $200 million for missile defense and $721 million for hurricane recovery in FY2018. Congress fully funded the supplemental request for hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in H.R. 1892 (P.L. 115-123). The funds would be used for military construction activities, including the reconstruction of Army National Guard facilities and Navy construction at NAS Key West, FL and NAS Corpus Christi, TX. The FY2018 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to assess hurricane damage to DOD assets. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2018 saw minimal changes to the Administration's MILCON request. Congressional defense committees had differing opinions on reshaping military construction funding. The SASC and other defense committees disagreed on military construction funding reshaping, with the SASC recommending $56 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed H.R. 2810 authorizing $10.2 billion for military construction, $199 million less than requested. The Senate passed its version of the FY2018 NDAA, authorizing $10.5 billion for military construction, with $331 million designated for Overseas Contingency Operations. The FY2018 NDAA conference negotiations concluded with the passage of H.R. 2810, which authorized $10.7 billion for military construction, family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure activities. This was $309 million more than the President's Budget Request. The bill was signed into law as P.L. 115-91 on December 12, 2017, after adjustments were made to the President's Budget Request in response to a supplemental request for missile support. The Administration submitted a supplemental request for missile defense enhancements to counter North Korea's threat. After the passage of H.R. 2810, an additional request for hurricane disaster relief funds was made. The hurricane supplemental included $721 million for military construction activities not considered in the final FY2018 NDAA. H.R. 3354, an appropriations omnibus, combined several bills including a defense minibus with four appropriations bills. The defense minibus, H.R. 3219, included four bills: H.R. 2998, H.R. 3266, H.R. 3219, and H.R. 3162. H.R. 3219, known as the \"Make America Secure Appropriations Act\", 2018, passed the House on July 27, 2017. Division C of the omnibus contained the FY2018 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, with $10.2 billion allocated for military construction and family housing. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $9.5 billion for military construction, family housing, and base realignment activities, which is $247 million less than the Administration requested. The House passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 with $10.1 billion for military construction and $750 million for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate and President signed the bill on March 23, 2018. This report summarizes major elements of the Military Construction discretionary request, including funding for projects, BRAC, and family housing. The Military Construction appropriations include funding for projects, BRAC, and family housing. MILCON funds are mostly discretionary and cover facility capital expenses. Additional funds are allocated for maintenance, repair, environmental cleanup, disposal of real property assets, and Base Operations Support within separate appropriations. Military construction and DOD research facility maintenance are also funded through other accounts like Research Development, Test and Evaluation. The Secretary of Defense can use an expedited process for minor military construction projects costing $6 million or less, funded by minor military construction appropriations. Section 2805 allows funds to be drawn from O&M appropriations for projects costing less than $2 million. The Secretary can initiate the authorization process independently of the President's budget submission by notifying defense committees, followed by a 14-day waiting period before drawing appropriations from a designated account in the MILCON. The Administration requested approximately $180 million for minor construction in the FY2018 MILCON request, representing less than 2% of the total amount. Congress' adjustments to UMMC notification time requirements and cost thresholds increase the Department's flexibility for larger projects while adjusting oversight for smaller ones to the Secretary. H.R. 2810 adjusts thresholds for U.S.C. 2805, providing more flexibility for minor military construction projects. During NDAA conference negotiations, the Senate agreed to House-adjusted thresholds but did not accept a change to the \"life threatening\" qualifier in Section 2802. They also negotiated for a $2 million increase in congressional notification threshold. Military construction funding for projects in Europe and the Pacific focused on key projects in Germany and the United Kingdom. Majority of MILCON funding was allocated to projects in Northern and Western Europe. In the Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request, military construction projects in Eastern Europe were funded by appropriations from the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) Overseas Contingency Operations account. $104 million were directed to airfield improvements in Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve, part of the ERI aimed at bolstering NATO partners against potential Russian aggression. The ERI fund, announced by President Obama in 2014, has raised questions about its planning and management. Several official investigations are now underway to assess the effectiveness of improvements to European partners' infrastructure. Congress has directed DOD to submit a comprehensive military construction plan for future projects associated with ERI. 44% of all spending for military construction projects in PACOM's area of operations have been for Hawaii. In the President's FY2018 request, Hawaii represents roughly 25% of all military construction projects in PACOM. Military construction spending in PACOM is highest in Guam, Japan, and South Korea. US Forces in Korea are being concentrated in Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys. A relocation plan for American troops in Okinawa will move operations to a less-congested area. The Administration requested $763 billion for military construction projects. The Administration requested $763 billion for military construction projects within PACOM's area of operations. The largest share of spending would support Marine relocations on Okinawa and Guam, with smaller amounts allocated for family housing in South Korea and fuel storage facilities in Australia. DOD officials note a decrease in MILCON spending since the Budget Control Act of 2011, leading to increased infrastructure risk. Budget data shows a decline in MILCON budgets from FY2013-FY2018, following the end of a surge in 2005 BRAC spending. In a June 2017 hearing, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Potochney testified about DOD's infrastructure investments reduction leading to a $140 billion backlog of maintenance and repair work. The Administration's FY2018 MILCON request of $10.4 billion represents a 28% increase over FY2017. The Administration's FY2018 Defense-Wide request for military construction projects totaled $3.1 billion, with the largest increase of $1.3 billion allocated to the Defense-Wide account. Missouri, Maryland, California, and Texas received the majority of funds for projects such as medical centers and national intelligence infrastructure. The Administration's FY2018 Defense-Wide request for military construction projects totaled $3.1 billion, with Missouri, Maryland, California, and Texas receiving the majority of funds. Key projects included the replacement of a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency complex in St. Louis, MO, and construction of a National Security Agency operations facility at Fort George G. Meade, MD. Medical facilities also received significant funding, including hospital replacement projects at various locations. The Administration requested $0.9 billion for Defense Health Agency funding for medical centers, hospitals, and clinics. The President proposed $150 million for the DOD's Energy Resilience Conservation and Investment Program. Congressional committees recommended reductions of $300-500 million to the $3.1 billion Defense-Wide Military Construction request, focusing on projects in Missouri and Texas. Concerns were raised about the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage such projects. The Senate Armed Services committee expressed concerns about U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' management of construction projects, leading to reduced funding and stricter reporting requirements to address cost overruns. The committee highlighted issues with delays and cost increases, citing the example of a $250 million increase in costs for the Hospital at Fort Bliss due to \"omissions\" and \"design errors.\" This lack of accountability for project management was seen as a problem, especially with upcoming projects like the National Geospatial Agency facility and a hospital replacement at Fort Leonard Wood. The committee recommends increased oversight of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Navy Facilities Command for construction projects. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 authorized $2.8 billion for defense-wide construction projects, a decrease from the Administration's request. The House Armed Service Committee recommended reductions in proposed project funding, with significant cuts to projects in Missouri. They also planned to shift $22 million from the base defense-wide account to OCO for a construction project in Italy. The Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 proposed cuts to Defense-Wide Military Construction projects, with funds being shifted to other military departments, mainly the Navy. The cuts included reducing funding for projects in Missouri, such as the \"Next NGA West Complex\" and Fort Leonard Wood hospital replacement. Additionally, the committee recommended increasing funding for the President's Energy Resilience Conservation Investment Program. The Senate authorizers recommended funding the eighth increment of a hospital replacement facility and blood processing center at Fort Bliss, Texas, but expressed concerns about design errors, cost overruns, and management omissions. The committee inserted new reporting requirements for additional oversight, including provisions for notification of cost overruns and schedule delays, limited private sector supervision in case of extensive overruns or delays, annual reports on cost overruns and schedule delays, and a report on design errors related to the Fort Bliss project. The NDAA conference agreement authorized $2.96 billion for military construction activities, $151 million less than the Administration's request. The NDAA conference agreement authorized $2.96 billion for military construction activities, with reductions made to two Missouri projects. The final agreement included a provision requiring a report on design errors and omissions that led to a cost increase for a Fort Bliss hospital replacement project. The President's requested amount for FY2018 was fully funded. In response to North Korean nuclear tests, the Administration requested $200 million for a ground-based missile defense system at Fort Greely, AK. House and Senate authorizers agreed to fully fund the project, adjusting the President's Budget Request. The House-passed defense omnibus H.R. 3219 allocated $2.8 billion for Defense Wide Military Construction projects. The House Committee on Appropriations reduced funding for Defense Wide Military Construction projects by $0.3 billion, focusing on two Missouri projects. Concerns were raised about the Defense Health Agency's ability to fully utilize funds for the Fort Leonard Wood Hospital and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency West Campus Headquarters project. The Senate version of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY2018 would have provided $2.6 billion for Defense-Wide military construction, $0.5 billion less than the Administration's request. The reduced amount was taken from hospital replacement and blood processing centers projects in Fort Leonard Wood, MO and Fort Bliss, TX, as well as a major NGA replacement complex in Saint Louis, MO. Senate appropriators cited examples of Army Corps of Engineers mismanagement. The Senate appropriators recommended significant reductions in funds for major projects in DHA's fiscal year 2018 budget request, including the Fort Bliss Hospital and Fort Wood Hospital replacement projects. They also preferred incremental funding for the \"Next NGA West\" project, providing $175 million of the requested $381 million. The Senate appropriators recommended significant reductions in funds for major projects in DHA's fiscal year 2018 budget request, including the Fort Bliss Hospital and Fort Wood Hospital replacement projects. They also preferred incremental funding for the \"Next NGA West\" project, providing $175 million of the requested $381 million. The Committee believes this is a textbook example of a project that should be incrementally funded, providing $175,000,000 for the first increment. The FY2018 Military Construction appropriations bill provided $2.8 billion for Defense-wide base and OCO military construction projects, $281 million less than the Administration's initial request. Among the largest changes made was a reduction from the President's request for several large Missouri projects, including the \"Next National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) West Complex\" in Saint Louis. The Senate appropriators recommended reductions in funds for major projects in DHA's fiscal year 2018 budget request, including the Fort Bliss Hospital and Fort Wood Hospital replacement projects. They also preferred incremental funding for the \"Next NGA West\" project, providing $175 million of the requested $381 million. Appropriating committees expressed concern about cost overruns and poor execution of Army Corps of Engineers projects within the Defense Health Agency. The Acting Director of the Facilities Division within DHA is directed to provide quarterly reports to congressional defense committees on hospital construction projects progress and settlements for errors or deficiencies. Appropriators made minimal changes to funding requests for over 80 military construction projects in FY2018. The table below summarizes these changes. The Administration requested $1.7 billion for Navy and Marine Corps military construction projects for FY2018, including funding for active and reserve forces. Vice Admiral Dixon Smith highlighted the Navy's need to prioritize warfighter readiness despite omitting high priority projects in the FY2018 request. The Marine Corps is facing infrastructure challenges due to accepting risk in facilities maintenance, resulting in increased lifecycle costs. They are implementing an Infrastructure Reset Strategy to address excess facilities and prioritize higher mission requirements. The FY2018 budget request for Navy and Marine Corps military construction projects includes funding for operational readiness and unaccompanied housing projects. The Navy and Marine Corps' FY2018 request focused on funding projects in Guam for the permanent relocation of USMC forces from Okinawa. In the United States, California received a significant portion of the funding, with major projects at Naval Air Station Lemoore, Camp Pendleton, and Twentynine Palms. Other investments included a water treatment plant and enlisted quarters at Camp Lejeune, NC, and land purchases at Naval Support Activity Washington, DC. Congressional defense committees recommended few changes to the $1.7 billion request for military construction activities. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) proposed adding new projects to the Navy and Marine Corps' military construction budget for FY2018, increasing it by $0.4 billion. However, all committees agreed to reduce funding for a Navy Support Activity (NSA) Washington, DC land acquisition project by $60 million. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 would have authorized $1.8 billion for Navy projects. The Senate Armed Services Committee proposed adding $0.4 billion to the Navy and Marine Corps military construction budget for FY2018, with the largest increase among all defense committees. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 authorized $1.8 billion for Navy projects, including cuts to projects in Djibouti and the Washington Navy Yard. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended adding $0.4 billion to the Navy and Marine Corps military construction budget for FY2018. The committee proposed omitting funding for a land acquisition project at the Washington, DC, Navy Yard and shifting funds for ERI planning and design. Additional funds were recommended for projects in California, Florida, and North Carolina, including support for Littoral Combat Ship facilities and a modernized pier in San Diego. The NDAA conference agreement authorized $1.8 billion for military construction activities. The NDAA conference agreement authorized $1.8 billion for military construction activities for the Navy and Marine Corps, including additional funding for six projects not in the Administration's request. Funding was shifted for aircraft parking apron expansion at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti, and eliminated for force protection measures at the Washington Navy Yard. The final legislation closely resembled House changes, with only one HASC-altered item not included. The Senate altered six projects not in the final agreement, mostly for Littoral Combat Ship support and training facilities at Mayport, FL. The House appropriators approved funding for Littoral Combat Ship support and training facilities in Mayport, FL ($110 million) and a replacement pier in San Diego, CA ($108 million). The Navy's topline request was decreased by $45 million in H.R. 2998, affecting a land acquisition proposal at Naval Support Activity Washington. This project aimed to protect critical assets from attacks and encroachment, with potential use for the National Museum of the U.S. Navy. The National Museum of the U.S. Navy is being considered for a new location, with House appropriators recommending reducing the Navy's requested amount. S. 1557 proposed $1.6 billion for Navy and Marine Corps construction projects in FY2018, $51 million less than the Trump Administration's request. The Senate bill mostly kept the Administration's request unchanged, except for omitting funding for a land acquisition project in Washington, DC and adding $9 million for planning and design efforts at unspecified locations. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $1.7 billion for military construction Navy and Marine Corps projects, reducing the Administration's request by $18 million. Cuts were primarily from the Navy active forces, with the Navy Reserve receiving an additional $30 million. The largest change was a $60 million reduction for a land acquisition project at the Naval Support Activity Washington Navy Yard in Washington D.C. This cut reflected skepticism from both House and Senate appropriators. Senate appropriators provided $14 million for a $60 million military construction project, while House appropriators cut funding entirely. The legislation also shifted $13 million in funds for an airfield expansion in Djibouti from base to OCO. The table summarizes Navy and Marine Corps construction project funds by location. The section provides an overview of the Administration's FY2018 Army request for construction projects and summarizes final enacted totals. The Administration requested $1.3 billion in FY2018 for Army military construction projects, focusing on replacing poor facilities and addressing infrastructure deficits. The Army's MILCON request in FY2018 was the smallest among all services for the third consecutive year, with 22% of Army facilities in poor or failing condition. The Army's FY2018 MILCON investments focused on active component facilities, with reduced investments for National Guard and Reserve facilities. Projects included austere barracks for JTF GTMO, a new Pacific Command and Control Facility, and a military incarceration facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Authorizers and appropriators generally supported Army construction funding exceeding the Administration's request. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018, H.R. 2810, would have authorized $1.5 billion for Army military construction, with additional funds directed towards unfunded Army National Guard and Reserve projects. Notable increases included $32 million for an Army National Guard aircraft maintenance hangar in Springfield, MO. The Senate version of the FY2018 NDAA recommended additional funds for Army military construction projects, including $30 million for an Army Reserve center in WA, $26 million for a training building in Puerto Rico, and $33 million for a vehicle maintenance shop in Texas. The committee also proposed shifting $6 million for facilities in Turkey to support the AN/TPY-2 radar system. The Senate bill included additional funds for Army military construction projects, with changes made by the committee including the elimination of $66 million for a medium security confinement facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA. Other alterations provided funds for projects like a vehicle maintenance shop in Fort Hood, TX ($33 million) and a barracks at Pohakuloa Training Area, HI ($25 million). The NDAA conference agreement authorized $1.6 billion for military construction appropriations for the Army components, representing $208 million more than the Administration's request. The final authorized amount for all Army construction exceeded funds authorized by both the House and Senate prior to conference. The final conference agreement most closely followed changes made by the House, omitting only one project ($10 million for minor military construction) that had been included in that chamber's version of the bill. By contrast, the agreement omitted four projects ($37 million) whose totals had been changed from the Administration's request in the Senate version. The House and Senate proposed additional amounts for unfunded Army Reserve and National Guard construction. The House bill would have provided $1.4 billion, $44 million above the Administration's request, with $33 million for a vehicle maintenance shop at Fort Hood, TX. The Senate bill provided $1.3 billion, $20 million less than the Administration's request, eliminating funding for a Ground Transport Equipment building at Fort Huachuca, AZ. The House and Senate proposed additional funding for Army Reserve and National Guard construction projects. Congress appropriated $1.4 billion for Army military construction projects in the FY2018 Military Construction appropriations bill, including $30 million for minor military construction funding for the active Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. Appropriators also shifted $6.4 million in funding for a forward operating site in Turkey to the OCO account. The final legislation made few changes to the Administration's request, reflecting a 2% difference in the topline amount and four altered projects. The FY2018 NDAA made significant changes to military construction projects for the Navy and Marine Corps, with Congressional authorizers adding over $200 million to projects at multiple locations. However, very few of these additional funds were included in the final appropriated legislation. The section also provides an overview of the Administration's FY2018 Air Force request for military construction projects and summarizes the final enacted totals. The Air Force's FY2018 MILCON request focused on infrastructure investments for new aircraft bed downs like the F-35A, Presidential Airlift Recapitalization, and KC-46. Projects exceeding $100 million at locations like Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, made up almost half of the Service's entire MILCON budget request. The FY2018 MILCON request for the Air Force includes investments in infrastructure for new aircraft bed downs such as the F-35A, Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization Complex, and KC-46. Projects exceeding $100 million are planned for locations like Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, Azraq in Jordan, and Royal Air Force Lakenheath in the United Kingdom. These projects involve upgrades, expansions, and facilities to support various operations and missions. The Air Force requested funding for various military construction projects, including bed down facilities for F-35As at Lakenheath, UK, and additional projects supporting the nuclear enterprise. Congressional defense committees recommended reducing the Administration's $2.4 billion request by $85 million to $241 million, except for the SASC which recommended an increase of $92 million. The defense committees adjusted their budget materials for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization project, but most did not make significant changes to the topline request for the KC46A infrastructure. They split on funding for the Air Force ERI. The House and Senate committees disagreed on funding for Air Force ERI, with the House proposing significant reductions for projects in Hungary, Slovakia, and Norway. The Senate, on the other hand, fully funded the Administration's request. The SASC suggested moving all ERI funds from the OCO account to the base. The House version of the FY2018 NDAA authorized $2.4 billion for Air Force MILCON projects, $85 million below the Administration's request, but added 19 new projects and made significant changes to the total number of projects. The House and Senate committees disagreed on funding for Air Force ERI, with the House proposing significant reductions for projects in Hungary, Slovakia, and Norway. The Senate fully funded the Administration's request. H.R. 2810 made significant changes to the President's request, including a $130 million reduction to the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization project at Joint Base Andrews, MD. The HASC endorsed the total request but indicated that DOD had exceeded its ability to fully expend the funding in fiscal year 2018. Other changes by H.R. 2810 included replacing a single budget line item with 15 projects of an equivalent amount for the bed down of KC-46As at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and Travis Air Force Base. H.R. 2810 proposed changes to the OCO account, including transfers and cuts totaling $68 million and $112 million respectively. It also added $156 million for new projects, with a focus on Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard projects. One notable project would have been the construction of a 288-room dormitory at Eglin Air Force Base, FL. The committee supported the Administration's FY2018 request for ERI projects but removed seven projects totaling $112 million in installations in Norway, Slovakia, and Hungary. The committee expressed concerns about the Department's ability to begin construction in fiscal year 2018. S. 1557 proposed $2.5 billion for Air Force military construction projects for FY2018, $92 million more than the Administration requested. The Senate authorizers supported the Administration's FY2018 request for ERI projects but made changes to Air Force OCO construction funding, including shifting ERI projects to the base account. They did not include projects related to KC-46A operating bases at specific locations, reducing the overall requested amount by $16 million. The Senate reduced funding for the Presidential Aircraft Complex at Joint Base Andrews, MD by nearly 80% from the Administration's original request. S. 1557 added new unfunded projects to the Air Force construction accounts, altering almost a third of the Administration's line item requests. The NDAA conference agreement authorized $2.5 billion for Air Force military construction activities. The agreement allocated additional funding for Air Force military construction activities, including $68 million for non-U.S. projects in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar. The largest change was a $154 million reduction for a hangar to support new Presidential aircraft. Conferees affirmed the project but did not authorize the full amount for FY2018, citing the Department of Defense's inability to fully expend the funding. The FY2018 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act allocated $2.2 billion for Air Force construction, $242 million less than requested. House appropriators did not provide additional funds for Air Force Reserve and Guard projects, reducing the Administration's request by $124 million for an Air Force One hangar replacement complex. The current aircraft will be replaced by a larger Boeing 747-8 by 2020. Additional reductions of roughly $112 million were made to the OCO ERI account by eliminating airfield upgrades and infrastructure projects. The House appropriators shifted $269 million from Air Force worldwide unspecified accounts to support the bed down of KC-46A Tanker Aircraft at locations in New Jersey and California. The delivery of the tanker aircraft is projected to begin in the second quarter of FY2020, but concerns were raised about the Air Force's inadequate infrastructure strategy to support new mission requirements. The House appropriators shifted funds to support the bed down of KC-46A Tanker Aircraft, expressing concerns about inadequate infrastructure strategy. Senate appropriators made minimal changes to Air Force military construction projects, with a reduction in funding for the Presidential Aircraft Recap Project. The House and Senate appropriators made changes to military construction projects, including shifting funds for the bed down of KC-46A Tanker Aircraft. The FY2018 Military Construction appropriations bill provided $2.3 billion for Air Force base and OCO military construction projects. The enacted legislation reduced funding for Air Force base and OCO military construction projects by $107 million compared to the Administration's request. The active Air Force saw all reductions, while the Reserve and Guard received an additional $10 million each. A significant change was a 50% cut in funds for a Presidential aircraft complex at Joint Base Andrews, MD, supporting two new Boeing 747-8 aircraft. The Air Force modified its submission for KC-46A tanker aircraft basing projects in June 2017, not initially considered in congressional deliberations. The final appropriations bill includes a reduction of $269 million, with $8 million cut for KC-46A projects at Travis Air Force Base. Additionally, $68 million was shifted to the OCO account, including funds for projects in Italy. The final appropriations bill includes a reduction of $269 million, with $8 million cut for KC-46A projects at Travis Air Force Base. $68 million was shifted to the OCO account for projects in Italy, Qatar, and Turkey. The Administration requested $1.4 billion for military family housing appropriations in FY2018, with most of the funds allocated for Operation and Maintenance expenses. Construction of family housing units at specified locations represents a quarter of the total amount. The FY2018 NDAA provided the full amount of the Administration's request for family housing construction projects, with the largest projects in Germany, Guam, and South Korea. The Senate recommended altering the request by reducing funds for specific projects, including Army construction in Kwajalein Atoll and replacement housing at NSA Anderson in Guam. The final NDAA agreement addressed concerns over the high costs of maintaining family accompanied tours at remote locations, such as proposed housing units on Kwajalein costing over $1.3 million each and a replacement hospital at Guantanamo Bay costing $50.0 million per bed. The FY2018 Military Construction appropriation included $1.4 billion for Family Housing. The FY2018 Military Construction appropriation included $1.4 billion for Family Housing, with reductions recommended by the SAC and concerns over project details, including a provision for certification by the Secretary of the Army before funds can be expended on family housing improvements on Kwajalein Atoll. The Administration's FY2018 request for military construction projects certifies to congressional defense committees that new housing units offer the best value to taxpayers. DOD relies on nearby communities for military family housing, but provides government accommodations when necessary. The request represented 14% of all MILCON appropriations, consistent with past spending trends. The FY2018 OCO request for military construction projects, following congressional action, totaled $638 million. Nearly half funded European Reassurance Initiative projects, with notable components including planning and design projects, an airfield infrastructure warehouse in Luxembourg, upgrades at Kecskemet Airbase in Hungary, and construction in Slovakia. The non-ERI request included $331 million for various projects. The Administration's non-ERI request for FY2018 included projects such as a new airfield in Jordan, an enlisted barracks at Guantanamo Bay, and security upgrades at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. Congress generally funded OCO projects in amounts exceeding the Administration's request, with proposals to rebalance projects between base and OCO accounts. The SASC recommended moving all ERI related construction projects into the base account. Congressional defense committee recommendations matched or exceeded the Administration's topline request for FY2018. The Administration's FY2018 request for construction projects related to ERI was fully funded by Congress. Congressional concerns were raised regarding the DOD's process for reviewing OCO MILCON requests, leading to a directive for the Secretary of Defense to submit a future year defense program for OCO projects, which was narrowed down to only include ERI projects in the final legislation. In FY2018, Congress fully funded the Administration's request for construction projects related to ERI. The President requested $256 million for BRAC-related activities, but Congress appropriated $310 million, exceeding the request by $54 million (20%). Senate committees recommended fully funding the request, while House committees suggested providing additional funds. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing an additional $35 million for accelerating environmental remediation efforts at closed BRAC installations. The goal is to reach 95% \"response complete\" status by the end of FY2021 for over 34,000 sites, with a directive to achieve 100% \"status complete.\" This funding is to accelerate cleanup at BRAC locations. The Department is directed to submit a spend plan for additional BRAC funds within 30 days. Legislative language prohibits new BRAC rounds. The NDAA conference agreement states no authorization for additional BRAC rounds. Defense Appropriations also reflect this provision. The FY2018 Defense Appropriations prohibit new BRAC rounds, despite the Administration's objections. Congressional advocates made unsuccessful attempts to initiate a new round, with bills like H.R. 753 and proposals by Senator John McCain. In 2017, Senator John McCain proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 that would have omitted the appointment of a BRAC Commission, removing key aspects of the BRAC process like third-party appraisal and public comment opportunities. The historical and regional data used in the report was derived from DOD Comptroller budget documents. The Comptroller has posted data in Excel format for public use, with varying styles and errors prior to FY2008. CRS corrected data anomalies using numerical codes and keywords. For example, to identify Classified Construction, CRS searched for the word \"classified\" in specific columns. To identify minor construction, variations of \"Minor Const\" were used in certain fields. In FY2018, the Administration's $10.1 billion request for military construction appropriations was amended to include approximately $920 million for additional projects in response to natural disasters and actions by North Korea.
