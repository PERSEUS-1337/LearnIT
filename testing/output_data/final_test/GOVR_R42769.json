    "content": "Congressional authorization of federal assistance to state and local governments dates back to the Continental Congress granting nationally owned land to states for public education. Over time, Congress granted millions of acres for various infrastructure projects and cash grant programs, leading to the growth of federal grant programs. These programs transfer funds or resources to achieve goals authorized by Congress. The federal domestic assistance programs authorized by Congress include loans and grants. There are 2,179 programs, with 1,714 being federal grant programs administered by 26 federal agencies. Eight agencies administer 67% of these programs. Congressional interest in the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs has increased as their number and cost have grown over time. Federal outlays for grants to state and local governments have significantly increased from $13.2 billion in 1940 to $514.6 billion in 2011. The complexity and fragmentation of these programs pose challenges for federal agencies in standardizing financial and administrative aspects of grant program management. This variation in grant administration makes it difficult for Congress to compare program performance and exercise oversight. Agencies struggle to provide timely and accurate information on federal grant awards due to the distribution of grant funds from federal to local levels. The distribution of federal grant funds from federal to local levels poses challenges due to limitations in tracking and validating data. This complexity hinders Congress' oversight of grant programs, as highlighted by scholars and government agencies. The increasing number, fragmentation, and complexity of federal grants has led to a lack of clear definitions for different types of federal grant programs. There are three main types: categorical, block, and general revenue sharing grants. Categorical grants have specific purposes defined by Congress, block grants have broader purposes with more discretion in fund use, and general revenue sharing grants are for general purposes. Federal grants provide recipients with substantial discretion in fund use. General revenue sharing, authorized under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, expired in 1986. Grants can be categorized based on the level of discretion exercised by the federal agency. Conditional grants have high agency monitoring, while unconditional grants have lower monitoring. Formula grants are allocated based on established factors. Formula grants are allocated based on formula factors established in statutory and regulatory provisions, with some administrative discretion. Discretionary grants, also known as competitive grants, are awarded based on a competitive process. Some federal grant programs may use both formula and competitive allocation methodologies. The distribution methodology is established in the authorizing legislation of a federal grant program. The distribution of federal grants can be through formula or competitive processes, but lack of transparency hinders effectiveness. Agencies do not have to disclose scores or factors used in selection, making it hard for Congress to assess fairness in grant allocation. The structure of federal grants management varies widely across and within federal agencies, with functions divided into financial management, program administration, and grant oversight. Limited communication between these components can impede effective grant management. Financial grant management activities involve tracking expenditures and disbursing grant funds, while grant program administration includes monitoring recipient activities for compliance and performance evaluation. The Office of Inspector General conducts audits and investigations to assess program efficiency and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal grant programs. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) plays a critical role in federal grant management by providing insight into issues that arise during the life cycle of a federal grant. The ad hoc nature of federal grant program authorization complicates federal agency grant management, limiting the ability to establish a uniform structure. For example, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consolidated several grant programs previously administered by other federal agencies. Each new grant program requires the establishment of processes, policies, and systems, making it difficult to change the financial and program management structure once established. The consolidation of federal grant programs under a single agency poses challenges in establishing uniformity in administration, particularly in cash management systems. Federal agencies have discretion in administering grant programs, including procedures for application, review, and awarding grants. The Office of Inspector General provides insight into grant issues, but the ad hoc nature of program authorization limits uniformity in grant management structures. The administering agency has the authority to place conditions on federal grant awards, including compliance with reporting and audit requirements. Noncompliance can result in consequences such as additional monitoring or debarment. Most federal grants are awarded to state governments, which then pass funds to local entities through a process known as federal grant pass-through. The federal grant pass-through structure allows states to award contracts to private sector entities, giving them more resources for oversight. States have discretion in choosing projects to fund, increasing their autonomy within federal guidelines. The federal grant pass-through structure allows states to award contracts to private sector entities, giving them more resources for oversight. States have discretion in choosing projects to fund, increasing their autonomy within federal guidelines. The states, as primary grant recipients, can impose state priorities on federal grant funds and determine the allocation methodology. Federal funds are awarded to states under a formula or through a competitive in-state application process. The life cycle of a federal grant includes pre-award, grant award, grant program administration, and post-award/audit stages. During the pre-award stage, federal agencies calculate formula amounts for formula grant programs and establish criteria for scoring competitive grant program applications. Competitive grant programs give federal agencies discretion in selecting applications for funding. Grants.gov is a public website that provides information about federal grant funding opportunities and allows grant seekers to register for funding availability notifications. However, it does not include state-level grant program information. Federal administering agencies review and select grant recipient projects based on statutory and regulatory provisions. Federal grant funds can be passed through the state to the local level, but local constituents cannot access information on Grants.gov for these funds. Federal administering agencies may require technical expertise to evaluate grant applications and may use expert panels to review and recommend projects for funding. The agencies have the discretion to deviate from the panel's recommendations when awarding grants. Grant amounts are typically based on statutory formulas, agency discretion, or a combination of both. Congress may establish formulas for fund distribution with minimum allocations to specific recipients. Congress establishes grant applicant eligibility in the program's authorizing legislation, with primary eligible recipients being state, local, and tribal governments, as well as specified not-for-profit organizations. The primary grant recipient may then distribute funds through subgrants to local governments, nonprofit organizations, and individuals, with grant award periods varying across programs. Grant recipients must comply with administrative requirements outlined in the grant agreement, which is a legally binding contract between the federal agency and the primary recipient. These requirements include environmental assessments and financial record-keeping. Federal agencies must adhere to government-wide circulars issued by the Office of Management and Budget for grant management activities. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 required federal agencies to submit grant award information to USAspending.gov. Once a grant agreement is signed, the federal agency administers the grant by reviewing activities, approving changes, and ensuring compliance with reporting requirements. Each grant program has eligible activities. Congress may limit grant project eligibility by narrowing the range of activities to address specific categories, known as categorical grants, or provide greater flexibility through block grants. Grant programs have broad or specific eligible activities depending on statutory language. Administering federal agencies exercise discretion in selecting grant projects for funding in competitive processes. The grant administration process includes accountability provisions such as reporting requirements to agencies like OMB and GAO, as well as submitting financial documentation during the post-award stage. Grant closeout involves compiling financial documentation and closing out the federal grant. Grant closeout is the process of reconciling expenditures and disbursements, closing cash and program management accounts, and conducting audits to measure efficiency and prevent misuse of federal grant funds. Primary recipients must undergo annual audits and comply with the Single Audit Act if they expend over $500,000 in federal awards. Under the Single Audit Act, primary grant recipients must conduct an annual audit if they spend $500,000 or more in federal grant funds. Audits are submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse for public viewing. Comparing data in the FAC to other grant databases can be challenging due to different fiscal years. Federal agencies administering grant programs face challenges in providing timely, accurate, and detailed information on federal grant awards. The validity and reliability of federal grant distribution data is critical for oversight. Limited ability to track grant funds distribution is attributed to database limitations. USAspending.gov is the primary data source, but questions have been raised about its quality. The elimination of detailed reports emphasizes the importance of data quality in USAspending.gov. The FY2010 reports on Federal Aid to States (FAS) and Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR) were the last issued due to funding termination. These reports summarized the distribution of federal grant funds to states and counties and were used to track federal funding. FAS and CFFR contained state summary data and aggregate figures by federal department and agency, with a delay of 12 to 18 months after the fiscal year end. The delay in issuing the FY2010 reports on Federal Aid to States (FAS) and Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR) raised concerns about the timeliness of information. Without standardized data on federal grant distribution, Congress may struggle with oversight. Questions arise about differences in grant administration among federal agencies and the need for transparency and best practices to improve grant management. Developing a strategy to improve federal grant administration is crucial for Congress to compare program performance and exercise oversight over federal agencies. Variations in grant administration hinder effective oversight and comparison of agency performance."
