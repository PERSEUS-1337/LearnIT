    "content": "Presidential elections in America have evolved over time, from brief campaigns with a small group of supporters to modern-day campaigns lasting months or years with thousands of employees and volunteers. This report focuses on three key aspects of contemporary presidential elections: nominating procedures, campaign finance, and the electoral college, with a special emphasis on developments leading up to the 2008 election. The report highlights significant developments in the nomination process, campaign finance, and electoral college, particularly in relation to the 2008 and 2012 elections. These topics have political implications for the presidency and reflect the democratic process in the United States. Key issues include nominee selection, financial competitiveness in elections, and the role of electors versus voters in electing the chief executive. Congress may find these concerns relevant as they participate in presidential campaigns, national conventions, and oversee federal elections. The presidential primary season is influenced by events from the previous election cycle, with the 2012 cycle seeing negotiations between national Democratic and Republican parties to organize the schedule of primaries and caucuses. Changes were made to reduce front-loading and prevent other states from pushing Iowa and New Hampshire contests earlier. Democratic Party rules helped maintain the traditional order of events. Significant changes in campaign finance law are expected to shape campaign finance in the 2012 election cycle, including developments resulting from the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. The Republican rules for awarding delegates were also changed to a proportional system for contests before April 1, extending the nominating contest compared to past seasons. The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission invalidated prohibitions on corporations and unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures in elections. This has led to increased pressure on presidential candidates to raise funds to compete against opponents and super PACs. The future of the presidential public financing program is uncertain as candidates opt for private funds. The electoral college method of presidential elections is also under scrutiny. The electoral college system of presidential elections has been a topic of debate, with critics calling it outdated and undemocratic. Efforts to reform or replace the system have been considered by Congress between 1948 and 1979, but no proposal gained the necessary support. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in reform at the state level, with the National Popular Vote campaign proposing an interstate compact to achieve direct election without a constitutional amendment. The National Popular Vote campaign proposes an interstate compact to award electoral votes to the nationwide popular vote winner, bypassing state results. By late 2011, eight states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact, totaling 132 electoral votes. Both Democrats and Republicans have made changes to their nomination processes to reduce front-loading and bring order to the process. The two parties agreed on a window for primaries from March to June, exempting Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Penalties were imposed on states holding January and February events. Corporations and unions can now make unlimited expenditures on candidate defeat. Presidential candidates must adapt to the decline of public financing. In 2008, Barack Obama declined public funds for his presidential campaign, marking a shift in the use of public financing. The 2012 election cycle may see both major-party nominees rejecting public funds. Debate over the electoral college's relevance has resurfaced, with some states considering a move to direct election of the President. The primary and caucus calendar for 2012 did not have the usual crowded events in early February or March, indicating a potential shift in presidential selection processes. In early February or March, the primary and caucus calendar for 2012 did not have crowded events due to a coordinated effort between Democrats and Republicans to enforce a sanctioned \"window\" for delegate selection events. Democrats first adopted this in 1980, while Republicans only did so in 2010 after failed attempts in 2004 and 2008. The 2008 national convention approved a committee to review delegate selection procedures and make recommendations to the Republican National Committee (RNC). The Temporary Delegate Selection Committee recommended important amendments to party rules for the 2012 primary cycle, including a new timing rule that no delegate selection event could be held before the first Tuesday in March, with exceptions for certain states. This was a significant change as Republicans had never before imposed a calendar window for primary and caucus events. The 2012 primary cycle saw significant changes in delegate selection rules, including a new timing rule that no event could be held before the first Tuesday in March. States had to use proportional allocation of delegates before April 1, leading to a less front-loaded calendar. This slowed down the race and prevented any candidate from closing it out early. In 2008, Republican events were held in 36 states by the end of February, leading to an early race announcement on March 4. The winner-take-all system for delegates helped the front-runner end the race quickly. In 2012, only 10 events had occurred by the same date, and proportional allocation of delegates before April 1 prolonged the contest, resulting in more spending and party infighting. The Democratic party penalized states for holding primaries before March 6, reducing their national convention delegations by 50%. Caucus states like Iowa were not penalized as their results were not binding. Speculation arose that no candidate would accumulate a majority of delegates, potentially leading to a brokered convention. The 2012 convention saw the adoption of rules changes that could impact the 2016 contest, including binding delegates to primary outcomes and allowing rule changes between elections. Front-loading was influenced by the prominence of the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses. Democrats' rules changes after the 1968 convention encouraged state parties to adopt primaries. After Democrats' rules changes post-1968, more primaries were adopted, but the increase did not lead to a front-loaded calendar. Efforts to schedule early events in other states only solidified Iowa and New Hampshire's \"first-in-the-nation\" status. These states benefit economically from hosting presidential campaigns before voting begins. In 1988, Iowa and New Hampshire maintained their early voting status, leading to the acceleration of the \"front-loading\" phenomenon with the organization of the southern Super Tuesday regional primary on March 8. This event aimed to increase the impact of southern voters in the nominating process. The Super Tuesday regional primary was designed to increase the impact of southern voters in the nominating process. Following this, many states scheduled primaries or caucuses at the beginning of the window, accelerating the nominating season. This front-loading phenomenon led to clusters of state contests dominating the early part of the calendar. The effort to reduce front-loading for the 2012 election was largely successful, with the nominating season not being shortened. The calendar for the early part of the election year was similar to 2008, but with fewer February contests due to new timing rules. Some states consolidated their presidential primaries with regular state primaries, while others canceled the presidential primary altogether. The 2012 election saw some states consolidating their primaries with regular state primaries, while others like California, Utah, and Washington canceled the presidential primary altogether. The nominating season was not shortened, but the calendar was more evenly distributed from March to June. The New Hampshire primary has been significant since 1952, boosting the candidacies of Eisenhower and Kefauver. The New Hampshire primary, significant since 1952, boosted the candidacies of Eisenhower and Kefauver. The state has protected its \"first-in-the-nation\" primary status by legislation, ensuring it is held on the second Tuesday in March. The national Democratic Party has also protected New Hampshire's frontrunner status since 1980. New Hampshire's primary status has been protected by legislation, ensuring it is held on the second Tuesday in March. The state receives disproportionate media attention, with criticism of its influence being ongoing. Between 1988 and 1996, New Hampshire received 17-23% of all television coverage during the nomination phase. The New Hampshire primary, held in March, has been criticized for its influence on the presidential election due to its small number of participants and lack of demographic representation. The Iowa caucuses gained prominence in 1972 with new nominating rules following the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In 1972, the Iowa caucuses marked the beginning of the nominating season under new rules. Senator Edmund Muskie, the presumed frontrunner, was unexpectedly challenged by Senator George McGovern, who finished third. Despite winning in Iowa, Muskie's campaign fell short of media expectations, while McGovern's early organization in the state paid off. The New Hampshire primary further slowed Muskie's campaign, leading to McGovern eventually winning the nomination. In 1972, Senator George McGovern won the Democratic nomination but lost to President Richard Nixon in a landslide. The 1976 Iowa caucuses highlighted the state's importance as the first contest of the nominating season. Governor James E. Carter's surprise victory in Iowa led to a windfall of press coverage and boosted his momentum for the nomination. On the Republican side, President Gerald R. Ford narrowly defeated Governor Ronald Reagan in a straw poll. The Iowa caucuses in 1976 were successful in making the state a key starting point for the presidential nominating season. In 2008, South Carolina and Nevada were added to the Democratic timing rules due to their demographic representation. The Democrats revised the nomination process in 1970 for \"democratization,\" leading to changes enacted by state legislatures. Both Democratic and Republican parties have rules for delegate selection, with Democrats having more detailed rules and superdelegates. Both parties allocate delegates based on congressional districts and statewide votes, with additional bonus delegates based on party strength in previous elections. They use a combination of primaries and caucuses to select delegates and hold national conventions in August or September to finalize their selections. Both Democratic and Republican parties hold national conventions in August or September to select presidential and vice presidential nominees. In 2012, Republicans met in Tampa, FL, and Democrats met in Charlotte, NC. The Republican convention was briefly interrupted by Hurricane Isaac. Democrats aim to promote participation and representation of historically marginalized groups in delegate selection. The national Democratic party imposes affirmative action goals to achieve diversity in delegate selection, prioritizing African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, women, LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, and youth. State delegations must have equal numbers of men and women delegates and alternates. In contrast, the Republican Party does not have affirmative action goals for state parties. The Republican Party does not have affirmative action goals for state parties but emphasizes broad participation in delegate selection without discrimination based on sex, race, religion, color, age, or national origin. Each state is encouraged to have equal representation of men and women in its delegation to the convention. Voter participation in primaries and caucuses is governed by national party rules, state laws, and state party rules. The Republican Party restricts participation in primaries to registered party voters or those aligned with its principles, following state laws and national party rules. State voter registration procedures vary, complicating the process. Republicans limit participation to those deemed Republicans by state law or party rules, with additional qualifications allowed. No state law can permit a person to participate in both a primary and delegate selection. The Democratic Party rules allow all voters who wish to participate as Democrats to join the delegate selection process. They also encourage nonaffiliated and new voters to register with the party. No person can participate in the nominating process for a Democratic presidential candidate if they also participate in other party's nominating processes. The Democratic Party rules for delegate selection allow all voters to participate, but individuals cannot participate in the nominating process for a Democratic presidential candidate if they are involved in other party's nominating processes. The parties have different methods for allocating delegate slots and conducting primaries and caucuses. The Democratic Party has a simpler rule on binding delegates compared to the Republicans, who defer to state parties on the matter, resulting in varied delegate selection procedures at the convention. Delegate selection procedures for Democrats and Republicans are based on specific documents. Democrats follow the Call for the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Rules and Bylaws of the National Democratic Party, and Delegate Selection Rules. Republicans adhere to the Rules of the Republican Party and the Call of the 2012 Convention. State Democratic parties must submit delegate selection plans for approval by the Rules and Bylaws Committee. The 2012 Democratic National Convention had 5,077 delegates and 371 alternates, while the Republican National Convention had 2,286 delegates and 2,119 alternates. The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee must approve delegate selection procedures by May 2, 2011. Democrats have pledged and unpledged delegates allocated at district and statewide levels. A third type of pledged delegate, called an \"Add-on\" delegate, allows for representation by party leaders and elected officials. The DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee must approve delegate selection procedures by May 2, 2011. Democrats have pledged and unpledged delegates allocated at district and statewide levels. An \"Add-on\" delegate allows for representation by party leaders and elected officials within the state, calculated based on the allocation factor formula. South Dakota's allocation factor is .004012, resulting in 15 delegates. Delegates are assigned as district level delegates (11) and at-large delegates (4). The state also has 2 add-on delegate slots for party leaders and elected officials. In total, South Dakota has 24 delegates, including superdelegates. South Dakota has a total delegation of 26 delegates, with 2 alternates. Democrats allocate delegates to entities like American Samoa and Guam, while Republicans assign 10 at-large delegates to each state and 3 delegates per congressional district. Bonus delegates are given to states that supported the Republican nominee in the previous election. Republicans assign at-large delegates to states based on various criteria, including the governor's office, congressional seats, state legislature composition, and U.S. Senate representation. They also allocate delegates to territories like the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The District of Columbia can receive bonus delegates if it supported the Republican nominee in the previous election. The Republican Party designates automatic delegates based on various criteria, including the governor's office, congressional seats, state legislature composition, and U.S. Senate representation. In contrast, the Democratic Party has superdelegates who are unpledged and include Members of Congress, governors, DNC members, former Presidents and Vice Presidents, and other distinguished party members. Superdelegates were added after the 1980 election. The Democratic National Committee introduced superdelegates after the 1980 election to counterbalance rank and file party voters in evaluating presidential candidates. Superdelegates represent an effort to reverse the influence of \"party elders\" and have increased in number every four years since 1984. In 2008, superdelegates attracted attention as they could potentially decide the contest between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. In 2008, Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama courted superdelegates to win the nomination. Obama ultimately claimed victory with 2,201 delegates compared to Clinton's 1,896. The delegate selection process for the 2012 election was influenced by the events of the 2008 cycle, leading to a controlled calendar for delegate selection events starting on March 6, 2012. The delegate selection process for the 2012 election began on March 6, 2012, with a controlled calendar for events. A new Republican party rule required proportional allocation of delegates before April 1, aiming to reduce front-loading. This rule introduced uncertainty and prolonged the nominating battle. The 2012 delegate selection process was controlled with a new rule for proportional allocation of delegates before April 1, aiming to reduce front-loading. The race extended until the national convention, with Governor Romney securing the nomination on May 29. The 2012 calendar was finalized on November 2, with the New Hampshire primary set for January 10. The race began on January 3 with the Iowa caucuses, less front-loaded than in previous years. The 2012 primary calendar was less front-loaded than in previous years, with Iowa caucuses starting on January 3. The schedule in February differed from 2008, with only a few states holding events. The trend saw states moving their primaries later in the year, such as California. In 2012, the primary calendar was less front-loaded than in previous years, with states like California moving their primaries to later dates. The Democratic contest in 2008 extended into June, while in 2012, more delegates were at stake. The Republicans faced unintended consequences with an open nominating contest and rule changes, prompting them to consider changes to the delegate selection process. The 2012 convention approved a rules change allowing interim revisions to delegate selection rules. Fundraising and spending trends in 2008 suggest a different terrain for the 2012 election. Campaigning for the presidency now requires more money than ever before, with funds used for various campaign facets, especially political advertising. Political advertising is a significant expense in national campaigns, especially in major media markets. Costs include airtime, production, polling, and operational expenses. Federal election laws regulate fundraising and spending for presidential campaigns and political committees. Public financing was prominent until the early 2000s, but recent cycles rely more on private funding. In recent election cycles, private money has played a significant role as no major candidate accepted public funds in the 2012 cycle. Individuals could contribute up to $5,000 to a presidential campaign, with $2,500 allowed during the primary election and $2,500 during the general election. PACs and parties can also contribute to campaigns, and publicly financed candidates are restricted from accepting private contributions in the general election. Private contributions in presidential elections are subject to limits and do not apply to independent expenditures. Campaign finance is governed by complex requirements specified in various laws and regulations. Recent changes in the legal and regulatory environment, such as the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, have impacted campaign finance. The 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission led to major legal changes in campaign finance. In the 2012 election cycle, corporations and unions could independently spend treasury funds to advocate for or against a presidential candidate. Presidential campaigns were limited to raising $5,000 from individual contributors. Record amounts were raised by presidential campaigns in 2012, along with significant financial activity from parties, PACs, and outside groups. The decline of public financing in presidential campaigns is a significant change in campaign finance over the past 20 years. Candidates have increasingly relied on private funds, with Barack Obama being the first to be elected solely with private funds in 2008. Fundraising and spending in federal elections are regulated by federal election law and FEC regulations. Congress established modern campaign finance law in the 1970s, emphasizing contribution limits. In the 1970s, Congress established finance law through the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), focusing on contribution limits, reporting requirements, and creating the FEC. Parts of FECA were invalidated in the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976. The law remained largely unchanged until the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002, also known as \"McCain-Feingold,\" which banned soft money in federal elections, increased contribution limits, and placed restrictions on pre-election issue advocacy. Notably, BCRA prohibited corporations and unions from using treasury funds for broadcast ads mentioning federal candidates close to elections. The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in January 2010 invalidated FECA's prohibitions on corporate and union treasury funding of independent expenditures and electioneering communications. This allows corporations and unions to use their treasury funds for political advertisements calling for election or defeat of candidates, which was previously financed through PACs. Super PACs, formed after Citizens United and SpeechNow v. FEC, can raise unlimited funds from corporations or unions for independent expenditures. Nonconnected PACs, allowed to accept unlimited contributions for IEs after Carey v. FEC, behave like super PACs but are not the same. Fewer than 25 nonconnected PACs plan to spend funds under the Carey agreement. Between 1976 and 2000, presidential campaigns were primarily funded with public funds, which provided significant support through matching funds and grants. Both Democratic and Republican candidates participated in the public financing program, despite Republican candidates typically opposing campaign finance regulation and taxpayer funding. Every major-party nominee accepted public funds in primary and general election campaigns from 1976 to 1996. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the public financing program showed strain as presidential candidates turned to private funds for additional funding and lack of spending limits. Barack Obama's refusal to participate in public financing in 2008 and the Supreme Court's ruling in 2010 allowing unlimited independent expenditures by corporations and unions further shifted focus to private funds. In 2012, no major candidate accepted public funds, with only three minor candidates participating. The presidential public financing program, created in the 1970s, has faced challenges and a shift towards private funding. In 2012, only three minor candidates accepted public funds, highlighting the need for significant reform to attract modern candidates. The presidential public financing program diverts funds from the Treasury's general fund for qualified candidates and party conventions. The program provides grants for nominating conventions, matching funds for primary candidates, and grants for general-election nominees. Congress does not appropriate funds to the program, and convention funding receives priority over general election grants and primary matching funds. The presidential public financing program provides grants for nominating conventions and general-election nominees. Primary matching funds are distributed if sufficient amounts remain after convention grants. Shortfalls are a concern, but surpluses have been seen since 2008. Grants vary by candidate type and campaign phase, with major parties qualifying for $4 million for conventions and nominees eligible for $20 million for the general election. The presidential public financing program provides grants for nominating conventions and general-election nominees. Republican nominees can receive $20 million grants, adjusted for inflation. Third parties may qualify for lesser amounts. In 2008, primary candidates could spend up to $42 million, with additional costs exempt from the limit. The FEC estimated a $91.2 million general election grant for 2012 if any candidate participated. Candidates' funds depend on securing government matching payments based on private fundraising. In 2012, the spending limit for publicly funded primary candidates was $45.6 million. Contributions of up to $250 may be matched at a rate of 100% each. The primary matching fund program matches contributions up to $250 at a rate of 100%. Contributions over $250 are only matched for the first $250. The program applies only to individual contributions, not PAC or party contributions. Publicly funded campaigns must adhere to spending limits, record-keeping requirements, FEC audits, and limit personal funds to $50,000. The aggregate limit was around $42 million in 2008. The public financing program for presidential campaigns sets limits on funds, with state-specific limits ranging from $841,000 to $18.3 million in 2008. Candidates in the general election must agree not to raise private funds in exchange for taxpayer-funded grants, with spending limited to approximately $91.2 million in 2012. The public financing program has seen a decline in recent presidential campaigns. Checkoff participation in the public financing program peaked in 1980 at 28.7% but has steadily declined since then, with less than 15% of taxpayers participating since 1993. Taxpayer participation hit a low of 7.3% in 2009 and has remained around that level. Despite low taxpayer participation, most major presidential candidates participated in the program until 2008, with only a few wealthy, self-financed candidates opting out. Starting in 2000, some major candidates began to opt out of primary matching funds. In the 2000 election cycle, major candidates started opting out of primary matching funds to bypass spending limits. George W. Bush participated in public financing for the general election but not the primary, becoming the first President elected without both. In 2004, Bush and John Kerry declined public financing for the primary but accepted it for the general election. In 2008, eight candidates received primary matching funds, and both parties received funding for their nominating conventions. In the 2008 general election, Republican nominee John McCain accepted $84.1 million in public financing, relieving his campaign of private fundraising obligations. Democratic nominee Barack Obama opted out of public financing, allowing his campaign to raise and spend unlimited amounts, totaling $747.8 million. The Obama campaign raised a record-breaking amount through online fundraising, surpassing both the McCain and Clinton campaigns. This success, along with low taxpayer participation in public financing, has raised doubts about the program's future viability. Proposed reforms aim to make public financing more appealing to candidates, with legislation introduced in recent Congresses. As of August 2012, Democratic and Republican presidential candidates had raised approximately $855.8 million for the 2012 election cycle. Democratic fundraising accounted for about 50.5% of that amount. Noncandidate organizations also play a significant role in presidential campaigns, providing outside money that can influence the election. Noncandidate activity in political campaigns includes fundraising and spending by political committees like party committees, PACs, and non-political committees such as political organizations regulated under the Internal Revenue Code. These non-political committees include social welfare organizations, labor unions, trade associations, and Section 527 organizations that can influence elections but are not considered political committees. Coordination with a political campaign is limited for these entities. Outside organizations are limited in how they can support candidate campaigns. Political parties and PACs can contribute directly to presidential campaigns, with party committees allowed to make coordinated expenditures supporting their candidates within specified limits. In 2008, parties were limited to $19.2 million in coordinated expenditures, increasing to approximately $21.7 million in 2012. After Citizens United, corporations and unions are also able to support campaigns, including 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations. After Citizens United, corporations, unions, parties, and PACs can make independent expenditures (IEs) supporting or opposing federal candidates. Super PACs also allow for IEs in presidential campaigns. Non-political committees can make electioneering communications (ECs) that refer to federal candidates without explicitly calling for their election or defeat, originally established to target \"sham\" issue ads. The future prominence of ECs post-Citizens United remains uncertain. Since Citizens United, corporations and unions can engage in independent expenditures (IEs) and electioneering communications (ECs) supporting or opposing candidates. IEs and ECs, which cannot be constitutionally limited, have been prominent in presidential elections, with $445.9 million spent between 1996 and 2008, mostly in 2004 and 2008. These types of spending typically oppose candidates, reflecting a trend since 2004. In 2012, outside spending increased significantly compared to the 2008 election cycle. Major presidential candidates raised substantial amounts, with President Obama's campaign committee alone raising $86.2 million by September 2011. By August 2012, total fundraising had reached approximately $855 million. In 2012, major-party nominees did not accept public funds due to heavy outside spending and the influence of super PACs. These groups, although prohibited from coordinating with candidate campaigns, raised millions of dollars to influence the elections. Some super PACs had close ties with presidential candidates, allowing for unlimited spending on independent expenditures. Super PACs with close ties to presidential candidates are raising significant funds, potentially rivaling or surpassing the candidates' own financial activity. For example, in January 2012, pro-Mitt Romney super PAC Restore Our Future and the Romney campaign both raised $6.6 million, while a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich spent $4 million more than his campaign. On the Democratic side, the Obama reelection campaign has outpaced super PACs in financial activity. The Obama reelection campaign has raised $21.3 million in February 2012, outpacing super PACs like Priorities USA Action which raised $2 million. Concerns about transparency in political donations, especially with super PACs post-Citizens United, remain. Despite disclosure requirements, some contributions supporting Independent Expenditures (IEs) are not reported to the FEC if the source did not specify that the donation was for IEs. This report discusses how candidates secure their party's nomination for the presidency and how campaign finance law and practice impact the campaign. The electoral college phase of the election is separate from the campaign season and the popular vote, but its role in choosing a President and Vice President is rooted in the Constitution and political tradition. The electoral college represented an effort to provide for a presidential election free of undue influence by Congress, ensuring greater independence in the executive and giving states wide-ranging authority over the process. The electoral college system was established to give states authority over choosing electors, who were expected to be well-informed citizens. However, the system evolved over time due to constitutional amendments, state laws, and political party practices. The growth of political parties and democratic principles led to the current compound system governing U.S presidential elections. The electoral college system in the United States, established by the Constitution and later revised by the 12th Amendment, governs the indirect election of the President and Vice President. Over the past two centuries, federal and state laws, political party procedures, and political traditions have shaped the system into its current form. The electors, collectively known as the electoral college, play a key role in the election process. The electoral college system in the United States, established by the Constitution and recognized in federal law in 1845, is responsible for electing the President and Vice President. Each state is allocated electors based on its Senate and House of Representatives delegations, with a total of 538 electors including the District of Columbia. Electors are chosen through popular election in all states, nominated by political parties, and cannot be Senators, Representatives, or hold certain federal offices. Candidates for the office of elector are nominated by political parties and must gain a majority of electoral votes to be elected. If no candidate attains a majority, the House of Representatives elects the President and the Senate elects the Vice President in a contingent election. Presidential Election Day is set for the Tuesday after the first Monday in November every fourth year. Voters cast one vote for the team of candidates they support. The presidential election process involves voters casting their popular votes for a political party's ticket of electors supporting the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Electoral votes are then cast on a state-by-state basis, with the goal of winning by carrying states that collectively cast a majority of electoral votes. Winning a majority of battleground states is crucial to obtaining the necessary electoral vote majority. In the presidential election process, electoral votes are awarded on a state-by-state basis. Most states use a \"winner-take-all\" system where the winning ticket receives all electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska use a \"district\" system where votes are counted statewide and by congressional district. This allows for a more proportional allocation of electoral votes based on geographical support for different candidates. Presidential electors assemble in their respective states on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following the general election. They cast separate votes for the President and Vice President, selected by their political party. Electors are considered free agents under the Constitution and may vote for any person they choose, leading to rare instances of \"faithless electors\" voting differently. The electoral college votes are sent to Congress for formal declaration of the elected President and Vice President. Critics argue that the system is undemocratic and outdated, dating back to the 18th century. Critics of the electoral college system argue that it is undemocratic and outdated, with broad popular support for direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Survey research shows 62% favor an amendment for direct election, while 35% support retaining the electoral college. Critics also point out technical flaws, such as the potential for Presidents to be elected with fewer popular votes than their opponents. Presidents can win the electoral vote but lose the popular vote due to the winner-take-all system. This has occurred in 1876, 1888, and 2000. In 2000, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman received more popular votes but lost to George W. Bush and Richard Cheney who won more electoral votes. Critics argue that the general ticket system unfairly allocates electoral votes. Critics argue that the electoral college system unfairly allocates votes on a winner-take-all basis, leading to biases in favor of certain states and ethnic minorities. Defenders of the system claim that electors are chosen by voters in free elections, and that the system aligns with the Founders' intention for a federal election of the President with votes tallied in each state. Defenders of the electoral college system argue that it aligns with the Founders' intention for a federal election of the President, with votes tallied in each state. They reject claims of unfair advantage for less populous states and dismiss concerns about \"faithless electors,\" pointing out that very few have ever voted against instructions and none have influenced an election outcome. Many reform plans aim to eliminate the office of elector to prevent any potential mischief. The electoral college system promotes political stability by requiring parties to campaign broadly for electoral votes. From the late 1940s to 1979, debates in Congress focused on reforming or replacing the electoral college system. During the late 1940s to 1979, Congress actively considered electoral college reform or replacement through numerous hearings and debates. Despite some proposals gaining approval in the Senate and House, no amendment passed both chambers in the same Congress. After the defeat of a direct popular election amendment in 1979 and the departure of a key advocate in 1980, the issue of electoral college reform faded from public attention and Congress's agenda. Few reform proposals received significant action thereafter. After the 1980s, electoral college reform proposals dwindled in Congress. Despite occasional introductions, little support was shown for reform, even after the 2000 election \"misfire.\" In the 2008 election, Democratic candidates won with a significant popular vote margin, showcasing the system's effectiveness. Proposals for direct popular election continue to be introduced, but at a reduced rate compared to earlier years. The current chunk discusses a proposal introduced in the 112th Congress to elect the President and Vice President jointly by direct vote of US citizens, without considering state residency. There is little congressional interest in pursuing electoral college reform amendments due to past patterns and declining interest in recent decades. Recent proposals to reform the electoral college focus on substituting direct popular election, with some showing increasing complexity. The lack of recent interest in reform proposals may indicate declining support for the electoral college system. There is a possibility that supporters of the current system would defend the electoral college if its existence or integrity were threatened. Recent proposals for presidential election reform go beyond direct election substitution for the electoral college. They include provisions to enhance federal authority in various areas such as residence standards, citizenship definition, national voter registration, U.S. dependencies inclusion in the election process, election day holiday establishment, and ballot access standards. If approved, Congress would have the authority to establish national election standards superseding state and party practices. Congressional authority over federal elections is derived from the Constitution. The prospect of increased federal involvement in presidential elections raises concerns about potential unfunded mandates and the need for federal funding to cover additional costs imposed on state and local election authorities. Precedent for federal funding exists in the Help America Vote Act. The American Vote Act (HAVA) raises concerns about federal intrusion in state and local responsibilities regarding election administration. Questions arise about costs, efficiency, and implications for federalism. Some argue for a national election administration system to ensure every citizen can vote and every vote is counted accurately. Congressional action on electoral college reform is unlikely. Alternative plans for electoral college reform have emerged due to the unlikely prospect of congressional action. While only a constitutional amendment can change the electoral college fundamentally, states can modify some elements. States like Maine and Nebraska have adopted the district plan, acting as \"laboratories of democracy.\" The Constitution allows states to experiment with elector selection and vote allocation systems. Proportional and congressional district plan proposals have been discussed over the past decade. Over the past decade, proportional and congressional district plan proposals have been discussed in states as alternative plans for electoral college reform. In 2004, Colorado voters rejected a state constitutional amendment for proportional allocation of electoral votes. The amendment, if passed, would have affected the 2004 and future presidential elections. Despite national interest, Amendment 36 was defeated by a significant margin. In the 2008 election, the district plan would have given Democratic candidates five electoral votes and Republicans four in Colorado. Supporters argue it is fairer as it reflects voter preferences by congressional district and statewide. Nebraska's 2008 election results show the district plan in action. In the 2008 election, the district plan allocated electoral votes based on congressional districts and statewide results. Republicans won in the 1st and 3rd districts and statewide, while Democrats won in the 2nd district. This system gave Republicans four electoral votes and Democrats one in Nebraska. Advocates in California proposed a similar plan called the California Presidential Reform Act, aiming to reflect voter preferences more accurately. In 2004, California Counts proposed a district system for allocating electoral votes, which would have given Kerry-Edwards 33 electoral votes and Bush-Cheney 22. The organization failed to gather enough signatures to put the plan on the ballot in 2008. This sparked interest in similar plans in other states in 2011 and 2012. In 2011, Nebraska introduced legislation to return to winner-take-all electoral votes, while Pennsylvania and Wisconsin also discussed similar bills. LB21 was introduced in Nebraska to return to the winner-take-all system, with proponents arguing it would strengthen the state's influence in national politics. Opponents believed the district system promoted grassroots involvement and pointed to the split electoral vote in 2008 as proof of its validity. Some commentators suggested the change was driven by Republican concerns over energized Democratic voters in the 2008 election. In 2011, Senator Dominic Pileggi introduced Senate Bill 1282 in Pennsylvania, proposing a district plan for electors in the presidential election. The bill aimed to replace the general ticket system with a standard district system, where voters would cast a single vote for electors pledged to their candidates. The bill generated political controversy and was indefinitely postponed in April 2012. Senator Pileggi introduced a bill in Pennsylvania in 2011 to award electoral votes by congressional district, aiming to align the state's electoral college votes with the popular vote. Critics argued it was a Republican strategy to gain more electoral votes, while supporters claimed it would give voters a more significant say in presidential elections. Opponents criticized Pennsylvania's SB 1282 as a power grab to manipulate presidential elections and diminish voter voices in Democratic strongholds. Some Republicans also raised concerns about the bill potentially shifting campaigns from urban to suburban areas. Despite being referred to the Committee on State Government, interest in the proposal waned by November, with supporters indicating it was on hold indefinitely. No further action was taken during the 2012 legislative session. Wisconsin also saw similar district plan legislation proposed by State Representative Daniel Le Mahieu, with arguments mirroring those in Pennsylvania. Opponents in Wisconsin raised concerns that the district plan proposal would remove the state from being a \"battleground\" state in presidential elections, potentially leading to a loss of campaign resources. The National Popular Vote (NPV) campaign movement aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. No bill regarding the district system had been introduced in the legislature at the time of writing. The National Popular Vote (NPV) campaign proposes an interstate compact where states appoint presidential electors committed to the national popular vote winner, ensuring a unanimous electoral college decision. Originated by legal scholars, the NPV concept utilizes the Constitution's grant of power to states to direct the appointment of electors. The plan involves an interstate agreement where participating states appoint electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner. State election authorities would certify the popular vote in each state, which would be aggregated and certified nationwide. The participating state legislatures would then choose electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner. The process would only come into effect after states with a majority of 270 electoral votes approve the plan. If the national popular vote is tied, states would be released from their commitment under the compact. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan allows states to appoint electors based on the nationwide popular vote winner. If the national popular vote is tied, states can choose electors representing the winning presidential ticket in each state. NPV also allows the national popular vote winner to fill electoral college vacancies with their chosen electors. States can withdraw from the compact, but any withdrawal within six months of a presidential term's end would only take effect after the next President and Vice President are elected. NPV is managed by National Popular Vote, Inc., a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization founded in 2006. NPV, a 501(c)(4) entity, engages in political activity as long as it's not primary. Board members include former Senators and Representatives from both parties. NPV claims support from 2,110 state legislators and endorsements from major newspapers. The compact has been introduced in all 50 states and DC, with 8 states and DC adopting it by late 2011. In 2011, California joined the National Popular Vote compact, adding 55 electoral votes. The compact had support from 2,110 state legislators and endorsements from major newspapers. Despite active consideration in 11 additional states, no further approvals were made during the 2011-2012 legislative sessions. Businessman Tom Golisano became a spokesman for the National Popular Vote. Tom Golisano, a gubernatorial candidate, announced his support for the National Popular Vote campaign and would \"bankroll\" its efforts. Defenders of the electoral college system have started measures to protect it, with conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and State Government Leadership Foundation expressing concerns and launching campaigns against the NPV proposal. Arguments for and against the NPV proposal are similar to those for direct popular election, focusing on simplicity, logic, and fairness. The National Popular Vote movement advocates for a direct popular election to guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This eliminates various issues such as Presidents winning fewer votes than their opponent, faithless electors, and disfranchisement under the winner-take-all system. The National Popular Vote movement argues for the 12th Amendment, advocating for a direct popular election to ensure the Presidency goes to the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide. This would prevent candidates from focusing solely on \"battleground\" states, where the majority of resources are currently concentrated, leaving voters in other states effectively disenfranchised. The National Popular Vote movement argues for a direct popular election to prevent candidates from focusing on battleground states, where resources are concentrated, leaving voters in other states disenfranchised. Critics argue that spreading campaign resources in non-battleground states is questionable and not a significant economic stimulus. The National Popular Vote movement argues for a direct popular election to prevent candidates from focusing on battleground states, where resources are concentrated, leaving voters in other states disenfranchised. Critics argue that spreading campaign resources in non-battleground states is questionable and not a significant economic stimulus. Critics also argue that NPV would undermine the Constitution and overturn the Founders' original intent, as presidential elections are federal contests where states play an important role. The electoral college plays an important role in federalism, and a national popular vote would be a significant change. Opponents argue that NPV could lead to more contested elections and legal challenges, bypassing the Constitution's amendment process. Proponents believe NPV is necessary reform, but critics argue it goes against the Founders' intentions to make changing the Constitution difficult. Critics argue that the National Popular Vote plan seeks to circumvent constitutional safeguards and lacks a time limit for its implementation, unlike constitutional amendments. They question why NPV should be exempt from the standards set for amendments and suggest that it uses anti-democratic means to achieve a democratic goal. The National Popular Vote compact aims to override state citizens' votes with a nationwide popular vote total, potentially leading to a constitutional crisis. Critics question its constitutionality and argue it resembles a totalitarian system rather than a democratic federal republic like the United States. Derek T. Muller argues in Election Law Journal that the National Popular Vote plan is an interstate compact requiring approval from Congress due to its binding nature on states and time limits for withdrawal. He believes it would enhance the political power of participating states, potentially at the expense of others, making it unconstitutional without explicit congressional approval. The National Popular Vote plan is an interstate compact that could increase the political power of participating states by determining the outcome of the Electoral College, potentially at the expense of non-participating states. This could undermine the constitutional authority granted to states to appoint electors as they see fit, requiring congressional consent to ensure the validity of such agreements. The National Popular Vote compact allows states to make agreements on elector appointment without congressional approval. Critics argue it may violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting voting strength. The National Popular Vote compact may dilute the voting strength of minority populations in states by reducing their influence on presidential elections. Critics argue that the compact could violate the Voting Rights Act by requiring preclearance from all \"covered\" states before implementation. The National Popular Vote compact aims to make every person's vote for President equal in the United States, aligning with the Voting Rights Act. Court cases under the Act have not affected elections for the Presidency. In 2012, the Justice Department did not challenge California's participation in the NPV based on Voting Rights Act grounds. States have the authority to appoint electors, but federal court decisions have overturned state laws violating the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee. The 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee limits state discretion in selecting presidential electors. Court cases like Oregon v. Mitchell uphold Congress' power to set voting age and residency requirements for presidential elections. The Fourteenth Amendment limits state discretion in selecting electors, allowing Congress to enforce it and potentially challenge the National Popular Vote compact. Changes to the electoral college system are unlikely through constitutional amendment, state legislation, or the NPV campaign. Despite limited congressional interest in a constitutional amendment regarding direct popular election, amendments may be introduced in the 113th Congress. States may consider changes to their electoral vote allocation procedures, such as the district system, but widespread support for such experiments is lacking. The National Popular Vote campaign, despite its efforts, may face legal challenges and criticism, potentially diluting minority voter influence. The National Popular Vote campaign may have lost momentum, but an electoral college \"misfire\" could reignite interest. Presidential elections are a subject of scholarly study, media interest, and governmental activity. The enduring issues of the nominating process, campaign finance, and the electoral college remain relevant for 2012. The report provides Congress with background on contemporary presidential elections, highlighting potential major developments that could shape the process. Despite changes since 2008, the selection of presidents has remained largely unchanged since the 19th century. The topics discussed set boundaries for citizen, candidate, party, and outside group participation in elections. Members of Congress play a role in this process. Members of Congress play a role in presidential elections, overseeing federal roles and understanding the evolution of the process. This report serves as a resource for Congress in this regard."
