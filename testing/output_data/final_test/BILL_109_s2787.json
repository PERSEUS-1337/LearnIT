    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Western Hemisphere Energy Security Act of 2006\". Key findings are also included. Congress finds that the United States is the largest oil importer in the world, with a predicted 68 percent oil import rate by 2025. Two-thirds of global oil reserves are in the politically unstable Middle East, controlled by OPEC. Global fuel consumption is expected to double in the next 20 years, driven by Chinese and Indian economies, leading to increased competition for oil resources and potential Chinese involvement in Cuban oil and gas development. The United States adheres to the principle that the exclusive economic zone of a country is demarcated by a point equidistant to the maritime baselines of two countries. An example is Cuba's exclusive economic zone extending within 52 miles of the Florida Keys and 85.4 miles of the Florida peninsula. Cubapetroleo, Cuba's state oil company, signed an oil production sharing agreement with China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation. They also purchased 3 deep-water drilling rigs from the Chinese state enterprise for use in Cuba's exclusive economic zone in the Gulf of Mexico, which is divided into 59 exploration blocks. Each block is approximately 2,000 square kilometers with an average depth of 2,000 meters. The northernmost exploration blocks off the southwest coast of Florida have depths of up to 4,000 meters. A US Geological Survey report estimated significant undiscovered oil and gas reserves along the northern coast of Cuba. The national security strategy highlights China's increasing resource needs and concerns about their energy supply strategies. The Act aims to allow US oil and gas companies to operate in foreign exclusive economic zones adjacent to the US, citing national security, energy, and environmental interests. The Act allows US oil and gas companies to explore and extract hydrocarbon resources from foreign maritime exclusive economic zones adjacent to the United States. The Act defines a \"United States person\" as a citizen or lawful resident, or a non-individual entity majority-owned by such individuals. It authorizes US persons to engage in activities involving hydrocarbon resources. United States persons are allowed to engage in transactions for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction in foreign exclusive economic zones contiguous to the US. They can also export equipment without a license for these activities. Additionally, travel related to authorized hydrocarbon exploration and extraction activities is permitted. Section 910 of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to authorize travel-related transactions for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction activities in foreign maritime Exclusive Economic Zones contiguous to the US. Persons authorized for travel to Cuba under this section include full-time employees. Persons authorized for travel to Cuba under this section include full-time employees, executives, agents, and consultants of oil and gas producers, distributors, and shippers."
