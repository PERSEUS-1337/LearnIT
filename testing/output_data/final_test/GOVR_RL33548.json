    "content": "The CTBTO PrepCom detected North Korea's nuclear test in January 2016. Meetings were held in June and August 2016 to mark anniversaries and discuss nuclear testing issues. Pakistan reaffirmed its stance on nuclear testing, and the US collaborated on a UN Security Council Resolution. The United States is collaborating with other countries to draft a UN Security Council Resolution marking the 20th year after the signing of the CTBT on September 24. Efforts to curtail nuclear tests have been ongoing since the 1940s, leading to treaties like the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974. President Carter did not pursue ratification of the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) due to concerns about the need for continued nuclear testing. President Reagan later negotiated new verification protocols for these treaties, which were ratified in 1990. With the end of the Cold War, pressure for a CTBT increased. In the early 1990s, the U.S.S.R. and France initiated nuclear test moratoria, leading to the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment banning testing before July 1, 1993. President George H. W. Bush signed the bill into law in October 1992. The CTBT was negotiated in the Conference on Disarmament, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in September 1996, and opened for signature on September 24, 1996. The United States had signed but not ratified the CTBT as of August 2016. President Clinton extended the nuclear test moratorium through September 1994, citing concerns about undercutting nonproliferation goals and encouraging other nations to resume testing. President Clinton extended the nuclear test moratorium through September 1994 and pledged to conduct additional tests if needed. He also promised to focus the nuclear weapons laboratories on technology for nonproliferation and arms control verification. The CTBT was submitted to the Senate in 1997, but faced opposition from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Helms. In 1999, Senate Democrats pushed for consideration of the CTBT treaty, which faced opposition from Senators Helms and Lott. Despite hearings held by the Senate committees, the treaty lacked enough votes for approval. A vote was held on October 13, with 48 for, 51 against, and 1 present, resulting in rejection. The treaty then moved to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee calendar. The treaty moved to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee calendar, where it currently resides. The Bush Administration's Nuclear Posture Review in the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act directed a review of nuclear policy and strategy. J.D. Crouch stated there would be no change in the Administration's policy on nuclear testing, opposing CTBT ratification and adhering to a testing moratorium. The DOE is planning to accelerate its test-readiness program to reduce the time needed for testing. There are discussions about modifying existing weapons for greater capability and exploring non-nuclear solutions for dealing with hard and deeply-buried targets. The President has not ruled out testing in the future, but there are no current plans to do so. Critics have expressed concerns about the implications of these developments. Critics are concerned about the implications of the Administration's plan to streamline the nuclear arsenal into a war-fighting force, design new weapons, and abandon a moratorium on testing. Increased funding for test readiness could be seen as prior approval for testing. The National Academy of Sciences panel report concluded that verification capabilities for the CTBT are better than thought, adversaries couldn't significantly advance nuclear capabilities undetected, and the US can maintain confidence in its existing weapons. The U.N. draft document of August 5, 2005, called for a moratorium on nuclear test explosions until the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is in force. John Bolton objected to this provision, and the U.S. Administration, led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, does not support the CTBT and has no intention of seeking Senate ratification. The Administration maintains its policy on nuclear testing, with the Reliable Replacement Warhead reducing the need for underground testing. While supporting a voluntary moratorium, the Administration opposes ratification of the CTBT, citing the potential need for future testing to maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent. The Obama Administration expressed intentions to pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, emphasizing its importance in non-proliferation efforts. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates acknowledged the debate on ratifying the CTBT. The Obama Administration released its Nuclear Posture Review in April 2010, focusing on key objectives of nuclear weapons policies. The report presented the CTBT as a way to prevent nuclear proliferation and terrorism, reduce the role of U.S. nuclear weapons, and strengthen international support for non-proliferation measures. The Obama Administration emphasized the importance of the CTBT in preventing nuclear proliferation and terrorism, reducing reliance on nuclear weapons, and strengthening international non-proliferation efforts. U.S. ratification of the CTBT could lead other nuclear states towards disarmament and encourage non-NPT Parties to formalize a testing moratorium, enhancing global strategic stability. The Obama Administration highlighted the significance of the CTBT in promoting strategic stability by reducing the importance of nuclear weapons in national defense strategies. Vice President Biden prioritized ratification of the treaty and emphasized the need for Senate support. Under Secretary of State Tauscher outlined the Administration's strategy to secure Senate approval, aiming for a supermajority of 67 votes. The Obama Administration emphasized the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) for strategic stability. Senator John Kerry aimed to build bipartisan support for ratification, while Senator Mitch McConnell disagreed with the administration's pledge. The timeline for Senate consideration of the CTBT is uncertain, with the Administration focusing on the New START treaty first. The Obama Administration prioritized the New START treaty over the CTBT. New START replaced the expired START treaty, with President Obama signing it in April 2010. The Senate ratified New START in December 2010. Afterward, the Administration shifted focus to the CTBT, engaging the Senate for ratification. Ellen Tauscher, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, mentioned efforts to secure Senate support for the CTBT in September 2011. The Obama Administration prioritized the New START treaty over the CTBT, engaging the Senate for ratification. Rose Gottemoeller, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, emphasized the importance of information exchange on verification and stockpile stewardship capabilities with members and staff. She expressed optimism for continued interest in nuclear weapons and arms control on Capitol Hill. The plan for Senate ratification of the Treaty involves education, discussion, and debate. The reintroduction of the Treaty to the public aims to highlight the ability to maintain the nuclear stockpile without testing and ensure Treaty compliance. A global ban on nuclear testing is emphasized to prevent regional arms races and advancements in nuclear stockpiles worldwide. The Senate is working to re-familiarize Members with the Treaty on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). There is an emphasis on open dialogue and thorough consideration, with opportunities for Senators to ask questions and engage in discussions before any action is taken. The Administration is committed to a rigorous debate and discussion process before any decisions are made. In September 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated the Obama Administration's commitment to ratifying the CTBT. The United States supported the treaty at the 2015 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference and backed the CTBTO PrepCom's activities for treaty implementation. The United Kingdom, unable to test nuclear weapons due to past testing at the Nevada Test Site, ratified the CTBT in 1998. They conduct subcritical experiments with the US and maintain their own stockpile stewardship programs. The U.K. Atomic Weapons Establishment operates two sites: Aldermaston for R&D and some manufacturing, and Burghfield for final assembly, maintenance, and decommissioning of warheads. The U.K. and France collaborate on nuclear stockpile stewardship, with a joint facility in France and a Technology Development Centre in the UK. This supports their independent nuclear deterrent capabilities while complying with international obligations. The United Kingdom's nuclear force, consisting of Trident II (D-5) missiles on ballistic missile submarines, faces decisions on future weapons and the number of submarines to build. Scotland's referendum in 2014 on independence raised concerns about the U.K.'s nuclear deterrent, as all ballistic missile submarines are based in Faslane, Scotland. In October 2012, Alex Salmond of the Scottish National Party proposed a written constitution for an independent Scotland with a ban on nuclear weapons. The UK defense secretary mentioned no plans to move Trident submarines out of Scotland if independence were to happen. There were suggestions of relocating the Trident base to England. France conducted eight nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific from June 1995 to January 1996, despite criticism from many nations. President Jacques Chirac announced the end of French testing on January 29, 1996, and expressed support for a CTBT. France ended nuclear testing in 1996 and ratified the CTBT in 1998. Reports suggested Russia conducted low-yield tests, but some were determined to be earthquakes. Russia also conducted \"subcritical\" nuclear experiments not prohibited by the CTBT. Arguments against the CTBT include concerns about Russia and China conducting low-yield tests. Russia ratified the CTBT in 2000 and expressed support for the treaty in various statements over the years. President Dmitry Medvedev urged leading countries to sign and ratify the treaty promptly. The Russian scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences emphasized the importance of signing and ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty promptly to ensure its entry into force. Despite Russia's official support for the treaty, experts are concerned about the possibility of the CTBT collapsing due to lack of compliance from other nuclear powers. Russian experts are concerned about the pessimistic scenarios of CTBT collapse. Russia faces a choice between political dividends and the need to upgrade its nuclear capabilities. Officials have expressed support for the CTBT but are worried about the lack of progress in its entry into force. China conducted nuclear tests in the 1990s, justifying them by comparing to the US. Despite not participating in the moratorium, China announced a moratorium in 1996 and ratified the CTBT in 2000. China supported early entry into force of the CTBT in a 2004 white paper and committed to a test moratorium. As of August 2016, China signed but not ratified the treaty. India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998, announcing capabilities for a weaponized nuclear program. India has not conducted tests since then and questioned the US on signing a flawed treaty. India reaffirmed its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, stating it would not stand in the way of the CTBT's Entry into Force. India reserves the right to test if necessary for national interest, while also agreeing to continue its moratorium on testing as part of U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation. Joseph, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, highlighted India's commitment to maintaining its nuclear testing moratorium as a contribution to nonproliferation efforts. Discussions between the United States and India included the condition for India to uphold the moratorium in exchange for civil nuclear cooperation. In January 2007, National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan stated that India would not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty due to their voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also clarified in November 2007 that the U.S.-Indian nuclear agreement would not prevent India from conducting nuclear tests if necessary. In August 2009, a former Indian official expressed reluctance for India to sign the CTBT due to concerns about the yield of their 1998 hydrogen bomb tests. In response to pressure to sign the CTBT, Indian officials debated the need for further nuclear tests. Some claimed success with thermonuclear tests, while others urged against signing the treaty. A trade agreement with Japan stalled over CTBT signing, as India continued developing its nuclear weapons program, including a nuclear-powered submarine for ballistic missiles. India tested a nuclear-armed ballistic missile with a range of 3,000 km in April 2015 and was working on developing missile defenses. As of August 2016, India had not signed the CTBT. Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests in May 1998, with yields ranging from zero to 45 kilotons. Pakistan's weapons program heavily relies on foreign technology. Pakistan's stance on signing the CTBT was influenced by the sanctions imposed by the US after nuclear tests in 1998. Despite pressure, Pakistan stated it would not conduct further nuclear tests and delayed signing the treaty due to concerns about destabilization. Pakistan also expressed reluctance to sign unilaterally, citing its border with India as a factor. Pakistan's stance on signing the CTBT was influenced by the sanctions imposed by the US after nuclear tests in 1998. Despite pressure, Pakistan stated it would not conduct further nuclear tests and delayed signing the treaty due to concerns about destabilization. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues its nuclear weapons program, with reports of new plutonium reactors being operational and under construction. Pakistan has no plans to sign the CTBT, citing changed circumstances since 1998. Pakistan's nuclear program continues to progress with the operation of a third plutonium reactor and reports of a fourth one under construction. In February 2015, there were indications of a plutonium separation plant being completed, potentially enhancing Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Despite not signing the CTBT, Pakistan reaffirmed its stance against nuclear testing in various international forums. As of August 2016, 36 out of 44 specified states had ratified the CTBT. As of August 2016, 36 states had ratified the CTBT, including Pakistan. The remaining states, such as China, India, North Korea, the United States, Egypt, Iran, and Israel, have not ratified the treaty. Israel expressed commitment to ratifying the CTBT but cited concerns over regional political realities and the completion of the verification regime. Israel's equal status in the CTBTO policy making organs is hindered by the MESA group's paralysis due to some members not recognizing Israel. Egypt and Iran have not specified conditions for ratifying the CTBT. The MENWFZ proposal, supported by Egypt and Iran, aims to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, requiring Israel to give up its assumed nuclear weapons. The U.N. General Assembly resolution calls for all parties in the region to refrain from nuclear weapons possession. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) called for Israel to renounce nuclear weapons and join the NPT at the 2015 NPT Review Conference. Iran stressed the importance of universal adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and urged all states, including Israel, to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. The negotiations to halt North Korea's nuclear program involve multiple countries in the Six-Party Talks. In late 2004, North Korea threatened to use its nuclear weapons during talks. In 2005, they declared they had manufactured nukes for self-defense and were building more. The United States warned of punitive action if North Korea conducted a nuclear test. In September 2005, North Korea committed to abandoning nuclear weapons but later boycotted talks in November 2005. On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test, with varying estimates of the explosive yield ranging from 0.2 to 15 kilotons. This action was met with warnings and expressions of concern from Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea. North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test on October 9, 2006, with a yield of less than a kiloton. The test was confirmed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence through air samples. The event was considered a small nuclear explosion, possibly due to poor design or reduced plutonium usage. Siegfried Hecker, former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, believes North Korea tested a more advanced nuclear device in 2006, rather than a basic implosion device like Nagasaki. He suggests the test may have had a partial failure but still provided valuable insights for North Korea's military capabilities. North Korea's 2006 nuclear test may have involved a more advanced warhead than the Nagasaki bomb, potentially carried by a missile. Reports conflict on whether North Korea will conduct further tests, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice receiving no confirmation of a test halt from Chinese officials. Preparing for another test would involve redesigning the device and testing components, with a moratorium having little impact on the test program. Seismic analysis of the test suggests differences in wave patterns indicative of an explosive source. Seismic analysis can differentiate between earthquake and explosion waves based on arrival times. Factors like local geology and burial specifics complicate yield estimation. Mimicking a nuclear explosion's signature with simultaneous detonation is challenging. Seismic analysis can differentiate between earthquake and explosion waves based on arrival times. It is difficult to discriminate between conventional and nuclear explosions using seismological data alone. Nuclear explosions release radioactive isotopes that can be detected by specially equipped aircraft or ground stations. The ability of the seismic network to detect subkiloton tests has implications for the CTBT. The treaty's supporters argue that the CTBT verification regime is capable of meeting expectations, even for low-yield tests. North Korea conducted a second nuclear test on May 25, 2009, with an estimated yield of a few kilotons. The U.S. Intelligence Community assessed the underground explosion near P'unggye. Seismic signals detected by the International Monitoring System raised uncertainty about the nature of the test. Critics raised concerns about evasion scenarios and the potential development of nuclear weapons. Seismic signals from the 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests in North Korea were similar, but physical evidence of radioactive isotopes needed for conclusive proof was not detected by the International Monitoring System. The CTBTO PrepCom mentioned the importance of detecting radioactive noble gases like xenon to corroborate seismic findings, but so far, no xenon isotopes have been attributed to the 2009 event. The 2009 nuclear test in North Korea did not result in the detection of radioactive xenon by the International Monitoring System. Possible reasons for this include improved containment measures by North Korea, strategic test site selection, or the test being a large chemical explosion. The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1874 in response to North Korea's 2009 nuclear test, expressing grave concern and imposing various sanctions. In May 2010, radionuclide stations detected radioactive isotopes, raising questions due to faint seismic signals and North Korea's claim of a successful nuclear achievement. In response to North Korea's 2009 nuclear test, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1874, imposing sanctions. In 2013, North Korea conducted another nuclear test, using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force. The test raised debates on its significance and whether North Korea was preparing for more tests. The U.S. Intelligence Community assesses that North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion in the vicinity of P'unggye on February 12, 2013, with an explosion yield of several kilotons. The U.S. Geologic Survey reported a seismic magnitude of 5.1 for the test. The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization operates the International Monitoring System to detect nuclear tests. The CTBTO detected a seismic event with a magnitude of 5.0, larger than North Korea's previous nuclear tests. Seismic magnitude is an approximate measure of yield, affected by factors like rock type and moisture content. The CTBTO detected a seismic event with a magnitude of 5.0, larger than North Korea's previous nuclear tests. Factors affecting seismic signals include rock type, moisture content, and depth of the event. IMS stations provided data for estimating the location and depth of the test, indicating a shallow depth. The type of material used in the device, uranium or plutonium, is a key question. North Korea may be shifting towards using highly enriched uranium (HEU) for its next nuclear bomb test, as its plutonium production reactor remains shut down. There are indications that North Korea may conduct multiple bomb tests using both HEU and plutonium. In June 2013, there were reports of North Korea restarting its plutonium reactor. If radioactive gases leak from a nuclear test, quick collection and analysis can determine if uranium or plutonium was used. Analysis of radioactive gases by the IMS can confirm a nuclear explosion. Debris collected from the test can reveal information about the device, such as the presence of uranium or plutonium. The IMS and the United States collected radionuclides from the test site to determine if uranium or plutonium was used in the 2009 test. North Korea's success in preventing venting in 2009 may make venting unlikely for the 2013 test, which had a higher yield. Thorough analysis of debris collected may take days or weeks. The CTBTO detected radioactive isotopes of xenon consistent with a North Korean test on February 12, 2016. North Korea announced a successful \"hydrogen bomb\" test on January 6, 2016. The U.S. Geological Survey detected a seismic event near the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in North Korea. The U.S. government disputed North Korea's claim of detonating a hydrogen bomb on January 6, 2016, citing seismic signals consistent with a nuclear test in 2013. Experts doubt North Korea's technical capability to develop a hydrogen bomb due to the low yield of the test. As of August 2016, North Korea had not signed the CTBT. The Conference on Disarmament operates by consensus, with each member state able to block a decision. The CD's Ad Hoc Committee was given a mandate to negotiate a CTB in 1993, and the UN General Assembly approved a resolution for CTBT negotiation in 1993. The CD's 1994 session prioritized the negotiation of a CTBT. The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva prioritized the negotiation of a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) with the aim of extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NPT, which came into force in 1970, distinguished between nuclear \"haves\" and \"have-nots,\" with the P5 countries being the declared nuclear powers. Non-nuclear weapon states viewed the CTBT as a key indicator of commitment to nuclear disarmament. The NPT mandated reviews every five years, with a crucial review in 1995 to decide on the treaty's extension. The Review and Extension Conference in 1995 extended the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty indefinitely, accompanied by measures including goals for universality and disarmament. Nonnuclear States Party criticized the P5 for not concluding a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, arguing for a regime without nuclear weapons. The CTBT symbolized a regime without nuclear weapons, with nonnuclear states seeing NPT extension as leverage for CTBT. Some felt NPT was crucial for global security and should not be risked for CTBT negotiations. India emphasized linking CTBT to global disarmament and eliminating all nuclear weapons. India vetoed the draft CTBT treaty at the CD due to conditions not met by nuclear weapon states. Australia proposed a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly to adopt the treaty text for signing, which was approved by a majority vote on September 10. The 2000 NPT review conference saw 158 nations in favor, 3 against (India, Bhutan, Libya), 5 abstentions, and 19 not voting. Despite concerns over the U.S. rejection of the CTBT and other issues, the conference ended with a consensus adoption of a final document that included a 13-step Nuclear Disarmament Plan of Action. At the NPT Review Conference of May 2005, the CTBT was a point of contention. Various officials emphasized the importance of early entry into force of the treaty and universal adherence to it. Ambassador Ronaldo Sardenberg of Brazil highlighted the CTBT's role in disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The eighth NPT review conference in May 2010 at U.N. headquarters in New York saw strong support for the CTBT. Secretary of State Clinton and Indonesia's Minister for Foreign Affairs both expressed commitment to ratifying the treaty. Indonesia initiated the ratification process, reducing the number of nations needed for the CTBT to enter into force to eight. At the NPT Review Conference, NAM States Parties urged a ban on nuclear deterrence and testing for total elimination. The EU emphasized rapid CTBT entry into force. The original nuclear weapon states reaffirmed moratoria on nuclear test explosions and called for CTBT commitments. The ninth NPT Review Conference aimed at early entry into force of the CTBT and achieving its universality. Delegates called for ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by all nuclear-weapon States with expediency. Several preparatory committee sessions were held prior to the conference, emphasizing the importance of the CTBT and referencing the final document of the 2010 review conference. The Vienna Group of Ten firmly believes that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is crucial for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, emphasizing its importance in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. They stress the urgency of the Test-Ban Treaty's entry into force, as highlighted in the 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences. The Vienna Group of Ten emphasizes the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Over 100 states expressed support for the CTBT at a conference, with the Marshall Islands highlighting its significance in ending nuclear testing. However, the conference failed to produce a final document due to a lack of consensus on a Middle East nuclear-weapons-free zone. Austria proposed a Humanitarian Pledge as a separate initiative. Austria proposed a Humanitarian Pledge to cooperate in efforts to stigmatize, prohibit, and eliminate nuclear weapons. 127 states endorsed the pledge by April 7, 2016. The treaty prohibits any nuclear weapon test explosions, including low-yield tests and peaceful nuclear explosions. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) aims to ban all nuclear explosions, including low-yield tests. There is debate over whether the treaty covers tests with the smallest nuclear yield, with opponents arguing that the treaty is not clearly defined. Supporters maintain that the treaty prohibits experiments producing any nuclear yield. The CTBT was intentionally left without a specific scope definition by the negotiating parties. The CTBT was intentionally left without a specific scope definition by the negotiating parties to prevent loopholes. All states understand and accept the treaty as a \"zero-yield\" agreement. The treaty establishes the CTBTO to implement its provisions, consisting of three groups including the Conference of States Parties and an Executive Council with 51 member states. The CTBT establishes the CTBTO to implement its provisions, consisting of three groups including the Conference of States Parties and an Executive Council with 51 member states. The treaty establishes a verification regime with an International Monitoring System (IMS) and on-site inspections to monitor nuclear explosions worldwide. The CTBTO establishes 321 stations worldwide to monitor nuclear explosions, including seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide stations. As of August 2016, 283 stations had been certified, with 50 primary seismic stations providing real-time data to the IDC. The CTBTO Preparatory Commission has held conferences in Vienna to exchange knowledge on monitoring technologies relevant to the CTBT. The first conference, \"Synergies with Science,\" was in 2006. In 2008, the ISS Project was launched. The CTBTO Preparatory Commission launched the International Scientific Studies (ISS) Project to keep pace with scientific progress and strengthen cooperation with the scientific community. Conferences were held in 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 to report results. Large-scale exercises were conducted in Kazakhstan in 2008 and Jordan in 2010 to improve detection capabilities. A budget of $10.3 million was endorsed in 2011 for an integrated field exercise in 2014. In 2011, the PrepCom approved a $10.3 million budget for an integrated field exercise in 2014 held in Jordan. The exercise simulated an on-site inspection to detect a nuclear explosion using state-of-the-art techniques. The inspection team successfully narrowed down the regions of interest to find relevant features, including traces of radionuclides. The CTBTO PrepCom deemed the discovery of relevant radionuclides a success. Radioxenons, noble gases released from nuclear reactors, can be detected thousands of miles away and are useful in detecting nuclear explosions. Mo-99, used in medical tests, has a short half-life and must be continuously produced. Mo-99, with a short half-life of 65.9 hours, requires continuous production. However, its production emissions can interfere with IMS sensors used to detect nuclear explosions. To address this issue, efforts have been made to reduce radioxenon emissions from the production of Mo-99 and other medical radionuclides. Producers have pledged to minimize emissions and share data with CTBTO, while the P5 issued a statement on the topic during the 2015 NPT Review Conference. The 2015 NPT Review Conference emphasized the need for states to assess and reduce emissions from fission-based medical isotope production. A workshop in May 2015 discussed ways to reduce radioxenon emissions from medical isotope producers. The treaty allows for review conferences every 10 years to assess its effectiveness, but as of August 2016, it had not entered into force. The CTBT treaty is of unlimited duration, allowing states to withdraw if their supreme interests are jeopardized. Entry into force requires 44 states to deposit ratification instruments, with a minimum of two years after the treaty is opened for signature. President Clinton mentioned the possibility of withdrawal in 1995 as a condition for the US to enter the CTBT. The CTBT treaty requires 44 states to deposit ratification instruments, with a minimum of two years after the treaty is opened for signature. As of August 2016, India, North Korea, and Pakistan had not signed the treaty, while China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, and the United States had signed but not ratified it. If the treaty has not entered into force three years after being opened for signature, a conference of states can be held to accelerate ratification. The CTBTO PrepCom organizes Article XIV conferences annually to push for the entry into force of the CTBT treaty. In 2009, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged nations, including North Korea, to ratify the treaty and maintain a moratorium on nuclear testing. The 2009 conference emphasized the urgency of the treaty's entry into force, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivering remarks. The 2011 CTBTO PrepCom conference emphasized the urgency of the CTBT treaty's entry into force. Ellen Tauscher highlighted the Obama Administration's priority of ratification, with the U.S. providing additional funding to the CTBTO. The conference's final declaration stressed the importance of early entry into force and outlined 10 concrete steps towards that goal. The 2013 conference at U.N. Headquarters emphasized the importance of achieving early entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The final declaration reaffirmed the need for systematic efforts towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, highlighting the importance of maintaining momentum in building a verification regime. The 2013 conference at U.N. Headquarters emphasized achieving early entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and highlighted the importance of building a verification regime. The ninth conference in 2015 adopted 11 steps towards universalization of the Treaty and called for ratification by the eight states necessary for entry into force. The Protocol details the International Monitoring System and on-site inspection procedures. The CTBT establishes the CTBTO, which will come into existence when the treaty enters into force. As an interim measure, the PrepCom was established in 1996 to prepare for the effective implementation of the treaty. The PrepCom held 43 meetings from 1996 through 2014, with meetings scheduled for 2015. The PrepCom held 43 meetings from 1996 through 2014 and has scheduled meetings for 2015. In addition to meetings, the PrepCom offers educational resources like \"iTunes University\" for downloading CTBT briefings. Other events include working group meetings, advisory groups, training sessions, workshops, and a CTBT Science and Technology Conference in June 2015. Foreign ministers of CTBT-supporting nations also meet on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly to generate political momentum for entry into force. The foreign ministers of CTBT-supporting nations meet to sustain political momentum and public attention for the Treaty's entry into force. They adopt Joint Ministerial Statements open for adherence by other countries. Efforts include U.N. resolutions urging states to maintain nuclear test moratoria and ratify the CTBT. The Non-Aligned Movement conference in 2003 also supported these efforts. The Final Document of the CTBT conference in 2003 emphasized the importance of universal adherence to the treaty. Foreign ministers in 2004 called for prompt ratification, especially by key nations. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission urged all states to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay. The commission recommended provisional entry into force at the 2007 conference. It highlighted that U.S. ratification could influence other countries to follow suit. In September 2006, 59 foreign ministers urged all states to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without delay to improve chances for its entry into force. George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam Nunn also called for the U.S. to work towards a world without nuclear weapons, including ratification of the treaty. In response to calls for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), key figures like Mikhail Gorbachev and former U.S. officials have advocated for a renewed push towards nuclear disarmament and the implementation of the treaty. Former officials suggested a five-year renewable CTBT, while others emphasized the importance of supporting the International Monitoring System (IMS) even before CTBT ratification. Concerns were raised about the impact of resumed U.S. nuclear testing on global security and the risk of other nations following suit. On April 30, 2011, foreign ministers from 10 nations called for the signing and ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to enhance global security and non-proliferation efforts. A group of eminent personalities and experts was launched in 2013 to advance the CTBT's ratification by remaining Annex 2 States, issuing a statement in April 2014 emphasizing the need for innovative approaches. The GEM discussed the importance of the CTBT for global nuclear disarmament efforts. The first Preparatory Committee meeting for the 2010 NPT Review Conference emphasized the need for the CTBT's entry into force. Germany, on behalf of the EU, urged states to ratify the Treaty without delay. The EU reiterated its call for states to sign and ratify the CTBT without conditions. Several states expressed support for the CTBT at the second Preparatory Committee meeting in 2008. The fourth CTBT Ministerial Meeting in 2008 saw 96 nations calling for the treaty's ratification and continuation of the nuclear testing moratorium. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution urging states to sign and ratify the CTBT, with 175 in favor, 1 against (United States), and 3 abstentions (India, Mauritius, Syria). In December 2008, organizations issued a report listing ratification of the CTBT as part of a new centrist package of nuclear initiatives. The U.S. should continue to refurbish its stockpile without creating new nuclear weapon capabilities. The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States was divided on ratification of the CTBT. A Council on Foreign Relations task force believes the CTBT is in U.S. national security interests. Foreign ministers issued a joint statement urging all states to sign and ratify the Treaty without delay. In 2011, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution urging early entry into force of the CTBT, with strong support from all five nuclear weapon states. In 2012, a Ministerial Meeting reaffirmed support for the CTBT and noted the voluntary nuclear test moratorium as an international norm. On December 3, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution urging states to sign and ratify the CTBT. The U.N. General Assembly adopted resolutions urging states to sign and ratify the CTBT, with North Korea being the only country against it and India, Mauritius, and Syria abstaining from the vote. Secretary of State Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to ratifying the treaty. The PrepCom's 2016 budget is $117.9 million, with 70% collected by August 26. The U.S. assessment is $26.4 million, with $20.1 million outstanding. U.S. funding for the PrepCom in previous years was $16.6 million in FY2002, $18.2 million in FY2003, and $18.9 million in FY2004. The funding for the PrepCom in previous years ranged from $16.6 million in FY2002 to $31.0 million in FY2016, with additional special contributions in some years. The FY2016 actual funding for the CTBT International Monitoring System and CTBTO Preparatory Commission Special Contributions was $31.0 million with a special contribution of $2 million. The FY2017 request was $29 million with a special contribution of $3 million from the Foreign Operations budget under Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs. The funds are designated by the United States to improve specific detection technologies for nuclear explosions. The Obama Administration supported the CTBT Preparatory Commission activities with a budget of $33 million in FY2011, including a voluntary contribution of $10 million for specific projects to enhance the verification regime. They also paid off a prior years balance of $22.323 million in 2010. The Obama Administration provided funding for the CTBT Preparatory Commission activities, including specific projects to enhance the verification regime. In FY2012, the Administration requested $33.0 million for the IMS and $7.5 million for projects. The United States contributed $8.9 million in August and signed a Memorandum of Understanding for up to $25.5 million in September for the rebuilding of a monitoring station. The FY2013 request included a voluntary contribution of $33 million to support the CTBT verification regime. The Obama Administration provided funding for the CTBT Preparatory Commission activities, including specific projects to enhance the verification regime. The FY2014 request was $31.0 million for the IMS and $1.0 million for special projects. The FY2015 request was $30.3 million plus a special contribution of $1.7 million, the FY2016 request was a total of $33.0 million, and the FY2017 request was a total of $32.0 million. President Obama expressed commitment to seek peace and security in a world without nuclear weapons, while also maintaining a secure arsenal to deter adversaries. P5 states have programs for stockpile stewardship to maintain and upgrade their nuclear weapons. Nonnuclear nations are concerned that P5 states may design new warheads under a CTBT without testing. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was established by Congress to oversee these efforts. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was established by Congress in the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act to manage stewardship and related programs. Stewardship is funded through the Weapons Activities account, which includes Directed Stockpile Work, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Programs, Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, and Infrastructure and Safety. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages stewardship programs through the Weapons Activities account, which includes Directed Stockpile Work, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Programs, Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, and Infrastructure and Safety. The appropriations for Weapons Activities have increased over the years, with FY2017 requesting $8.846 billion. The FY2017 request for Weapons Activities was $9.24 billion. Stewardship is crucial for Senate advice and consent to CTBT ratification, with safeguards implemented since the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. President Kennedy's agreement to safeguards was key for Senate approval of the treaty, and safeguards have been modified over the years. President Clinton made changes to safeguards in 1995, aiming for a zero-yield CTBT goal. President Clinton established specific safeguards to ensure the United States' commitment to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), including a Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program, maintenance of nuclear laboratory facilities, capability to resume nuclear testing if necessary, research and development for treaty monitoring, and intelligence programs on global nuclear arsenals. President Clinton established safeguards for the CTBT, including intelligence programs on global nuclear arsenals and the ability to withdraw from the treaty for nuclear weapon safety concerns. The Senate modified these safeguards before ultimately defeating the resolution of ratification in 1997. President Clinton established safeguards for the CTBT, including a science-based stockpile stewardship program for maintaining the nuclear deterrent. The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act codified Safeguard F, requiring annual assessments of weapon safety, reliability, and performance by the directors of DOE nuclear weapons laboratories. The annual assessments of the safety, reliability, and performance of each weapon type in the nuclear weapons stockpile are conducted by the DOE nuclear weapons laboratories. The Commander of U.S. Strategic Command provides an assessment of the military effectiveness of the stockpile, including the need for underground nuclear tests. The Secretaries of Energy and Defense submit these reports to the President. The stewardship program ensures the maintenance of nuclear weapons. The stewardship program for maintaining nuclear weapons without testing was a crucial issue in the 1999 Senate debate on the CTBT. Opponents argued that stewardship offered no guarantee of maintaining weapons, while supporters believed the program was likely to work. Reports from 2009 raised concerns about stockpile stewardship. The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States and other reports highlighted concerns about the infrastructure and workforce for stockpile stewardship, noting risks to program stability and expertise in nuclear weapons. JASON found no increased risk to certification of deployed nuclear warheads from aging and life extension programs. In January 2010, experts called for stable funding to extend the lifetimes of nuclear warheads. Legislation required a plan to enhance safety and modernize the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Republican Senators urged a modernization plan including Lifetime Extension Programs for specific warheads. The U.S. nuclear deterrent requires full funding for modern warhead programs, stockpile surveillance, and facility replacements. Vice President Joe Biden highlighted the underfunding of nuclear facilities and laboratories. The FY2011 budget request for NNSA Weapons Activities aims to reverse this decline. The FY2011 budget for NNSA Weapons Activities aims to reverse the decline in funding for nuclear facilities and laboratories. The budget increased by $624.4 million to $7,008.8 million and includes plans to extend the service life of nuclear warheads, invest in the nuclear weapons complex workforce, fund projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Y-12 National Security Complex, and develop a new Uranium Processing Facility. Additionally, the President submitted New START to the Senate in May. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The directors of the three nuclear weapons laboratories support the approach outlined in the Nuclear Posture Review, which includes options for life extension without further nuclear testing. They believe this provides the necessary technical flexibility to manage the nuclear stockpile with an acceptable level of risk. The directors of the national security laboratories express concerns about the adequacy of stockpile stewardship to sustain the nuclear arsenal, citing limitations in mitigation actions for extending warhead lives and inadequacies in the surveillance program. Senators McCain and Kyl also raise concerns about the New START Treaty. Senators McCain, Kyl, and Corker express concerns about the New START Treaty and the need for fully funded nuclear weapons modernization programs. Funding shortfall for Weapons Activities remains a key issue in the debate over the treaty. The debate over New START focused on funding for the nuclear weapons program and complex. Republicans wanted guarantees on modernization promises. The FY2011 continuing resolution maintained most spending at FY2010 levels, with an exception to fund Weapons Activities at $7,008.8 million. Additional funds were offered in November 2010. Republicans tied their support for New START to a budget increase. The Obama administration offered an additional $4 billion over five years for the U.S. nuclear weapons complex to secure Republican support for the New START treaty. Senators Kyl and Corker analyzed the funding plan and highlighted a 20% loss in purchasing power for nuclear security activities since FY2005. The Obama administration offered an additional $4 billion over five years for the U.S. nuclear weapons complex to secure Republican support for the New START treaty. A memo highlighted concerns about the funding plan, including the need for more funds for uranium and plutonium facilities, stockpile surveillance, and a caution against further cuts to the nuclear stockpile without corresponding reductions in other nations' stockpiles. In a letter dated November 30, Senators Kerry and Lugar asked the directors of national laboratories for their opinion on the revised Section 1251 report. The directors responded on December 1, expressing satisfaction with the update as it addressed concerns about funding shortfalls and reduced risks to the program. The House authorized the requested amount for Weapons Activities in FY2012, while the Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $1 reduction. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a reduction of $1 million for Weapons Activities appropriations, while the House and Senate Appropriations Committee proposed larger cuts. The Administration requested $7,577.3 million for FY2013, with a commitment to fund the Uranium Processing Facility and the CMRR Nuclear Facility. The CMRR-NF was intended to support pit production but received no funds in the FY2013 request. The FY2013 request did not include funds for the CMRR Nuclear Facility, proposing to defer its construction for at least five years. NNSA planned an alternative plutonium strategy to allow PF-4 to manufacture 20 to 30 pits per year. The Administration also requested an increase in spending on the Uranium Processing Facility. The change to CMRR-NF was controversial, with Thomas D'Agostino presenting the case for deferring the facility to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The NNSA is adjusting its plutonium strategy by deferring construction of the CMRR-NF project at Los Alamos National Laboratory for at least five years. This decision will save approximately $1.8 billion from 2013 to 2017, which can be used for other priorities such as Weapons Lifetime Extension programs and infrastructure needs. The appropriations committees did not provide funds for the facility as requested. The Armed Services Committees supported using prior year funds for the CMRR-NF project, expressing concerns about deferring the replacement project for at least 5 years. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended authorizing $150.0 million for CMRR-NF due to potential adverse impacts on nuclear modernization programs. The committee recommended authorizing $150.0 million for CMRR-NF construction out of funds appropriated for Weapons Activities for FY2013. The Administration strongly objects to beginning construction of the CMRR facility in 2013, suggesting a deferral for at least five years due to fiscal constraints. An interim strategy will be implemented to support plutonium pit manufacturing and storage needs until a long-term solution is in place. Section 3114 of the conference report required the construction of CMRR-NF with a cost limit of $3.7 billion. The CMRR-NF construction cost should not exceed $3.7 billion, with operations starting by December 31, 2026. $70.0 million in FY2013 NNSA funds are allocated for construction. No construction funds were authorized for FY2013, and as of late December 2012, closure elements for CMRR-NF were reportedly completed. For FY2015, focus shifted to required capacity instead of facilities. The Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 mandated ramping up pit production to 80 per year by 2027. A letter from Senator Jon Kyl and others urged continuation of CMRR-NF by 2024, emphasizing the link between nuclear modernization and treaties like New START. The FY2016 budget request included figures for Weapons Activities from FY2016-FY2020. The FY2016 budget request aligned closely with the November 2010 update to the 1251 report, with only a $53 million difference. The Administration proposed a plutonium strategy for FY2015, including updating pit production equipment, relocating operations, cleaning out storage vaults, and utilizing the RLUOB building for pit production support. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has plans to increase pit production capacity to manufacture 30 pits per year by 2026 and potentially up to 80 pits per year by 2030. This involves building modules near PF-4 for plutonium work and reusing retired pits in warhead life extension programs. NNSA uses various experiments to simulate nuclear explosions for data collection in the absence of nuclear testing. The NNSA conducts subcritical experiments at the Nevada National Security Site to better understand nuclear explosion behavior. These experiments involve plutonium being shocked by high explosives, but no critical mass is formed to prevent a nuclear chain reaction. Most experiments are done in the U1a tunnel complex, with one conducted in a vertical shaft configuration. The goal is to assess radioactive decay. Subcritical experiments (SCEs) are conducted at the Nevada National Security Site to assess the impact of radioactive decay on aged plutonium and maintain the reliability of nuclear weapons. These experiments do not result in a nuclear chain reaction and have been used to certify the W88 pit. Critics argue that SCEs could aid in designing new weapons without testing and are inconsistent with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The cost of subcritical experiments ranges from $5 million to $30 million. NNSA stated that subcritical experiments cost between $5 million and $30 million. As of August 2015, there have been 28 SCEs conducted at the Nevada National Security Site. The Nevada National Security Site has conducted multiple subcritical experiments, including Bacchus, Barolo A and B, Pollux, and Leda. These experiments provide valuable data for verifying computer codes important to stockpile missions. While most experiments used plutonium, Leda used surrogate material. The experiments do not involve enough plutonium to sustain a chain reaction or approximate any part of weapons design. The Joint Actinide Shock Physics Experimental Research (JASPER) Facility conducts experiments using high-velocity projectiles on plutonium targets to simulate nuclear weapon conditions. These experiments help refine computer codes for certifying the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Between 2001 and 2015, numerous JASPER experiments were conducted, with a mix of plutonium and surrogate materials used. In addition to JASPER, NNSA facilities conduct various experiments to support stockpile stewardship, including the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHT) Facility at Los Alamos, the Contained Firing Facility operated by Livermore, the National Ignition Facility at Livermore, the Z-Machine at Sandia, and the Omega laser facility at the University of Rochester. These facilities investigate properties of material, radiation, plasma, and other aspects of nuclear explosions at extreme temperatures and pressures. The Z-Machine at Sandia, Omega laser facility at the University of Rochester, High Explosive Application Facility at Livermore, high explosive facilities at Los Alamos, Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), proton radiography at Los Alamos, Big Explosives Experimental Facility at NNSS, TA-55 at Los Alamos, and U1a facility at NNSS are used for studying material properties, chemical explosives, neutron generation, proton radiography, high-explosives detonations, and properties of plutonium and other metals. Subcritical and hydrodynamic experiments are conducted at U1a facility at NNSS. The NNSS conducts subcritical and hydrodynamic experiments using non-nuclear surrogate materials to mimic nuclear properties. An experiment called \"Leda\" on August 12, 2014, involved plutonium surrogate material and high explosives to implode a 'weapon-relevant geometry.' This experiment was preparatory for future subcritical experiments. Concerns about the readiness for nuclear tests were raised in reports by the DOE's Office of Inspector General in September 2002. President Clinton had directed the DOE to be prepared for a nuclear test within three years of a decision to do so. The Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security of the US Nuclear Stockpile recommended reducing test readiness from three years to 18 months by the end of FY2005. Funding was provided in FY2004 to support this transition, with a focus on meeting the current 24-month requirement before pursuing the more aggressive goal of an 18-month readiness posture. The FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act recommended reducing test readiness from three years to 18 months by October 1, 2006. NNSA Administrator Linton Brooks aimed to achieve this goal, with full funding provided in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The House Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Primary Assessment Technologies campaign request by $15.0 million. The campaign request for test readiness was reduced by $7.5 million in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. NNSA's FY2006 test readiness request was $25.0 million to achieve an 18-month test readiness posture by October 1, 2006. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman confirmed DOE's commitment to meeting this requirement during a Senate hearing. Ambassador Brooks explained the rationale for the 18-month test readiness posture before the Senate committee. The House committee favored a 24-month posture, citing the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. Funding for test readiness was reduced to $20.0 million in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, with DOE directed to maintain the 24-month posture. The National Defense Authorization Act also provided $20.0 million for test readiness in FY2007. For FY2007, NNSA requested $14.8 million for test readiness, achieving the 24-month posture in FY2005. The House committee emphasized the importance of maintaining the 18-month readiness posture for national security. Funding shortfalls hindered DOE from meeting the 18-month posture requirement. The House and Senate recommended providing the requested amount in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5427). NNSA did not request funds for test readiness in FY2008. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the decision not to request funds for test readiness in FY2008 and added $20,000,000 to support the 24-month test readiness posture at the Nevada Test Site. The Committee questioned the Administration's choice to eliminate funding for nuclear test readiness after previously insisting on an 18-month readiness posture for national security. The NNSA proposed a wasteful investment in the FY2008 budget by allowing degraded test readiness activities. Section 3112 of H.R. 1585 repealed the requirement for an 18-month nuclear test posture and mandated a biennial report on test readiness. The FY2009 budget estimates $10.4 million for test readiness, with a target of 24 to 36 months. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee authorization bills include the requested amount for test readiness. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating FY2009 funds for test readiness, citing the success of the Stockpile Stewardship program as a superior alternative to nuclear testing. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 provided $5.4 million for test readiness. NNSA transferred responsibility for infrastructure maintenance at the NTS to the RTBF program in FY 2010. NNSA stated in November 2010 that Test Readiness is supported through the Stockpile Stewardship Program and experiments at the Nevada National Security Site in U1a. The required test readiness posture is to be able to conduct a test within 24 to 36 months as mandated by Presidential Decision Directive 15. DOE's Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP) details NNSA's plan to maintain readiness. The FY2016 SSMP states that the status of nuclear test readiness has not changed significantly since 2014. NNSA focuses on scenarios where tests may be needed to resolve technical issues in the stockpile, with the expectation that additional tests could be completed in 1 to 2 years. NNSA does not have plans to resume a continuous nuclear test program. The NNSA maintains a nuclear test readiness posture, with the capability to conduct an underground test within 24 to 36 months of a directive from the President. Test readiness activities are now funded under different programs, and activities solely for test readiness have been eliminated in the past decade. Activities solely for test readiness have been eliminated in the past decade. A limited test for the U.S. nuclear deterrent could be conducted in 6 to 10 months, but it is not part of stockpile stewardship. A 6-month readiness scenario would be relevant if testing were to resume for policy reasons. The CTBT is a contentious issue, with arguments for and against the treaty. Supporters believe the U.S. can maintain deterrence without testing through the stockpile stewardship program. As of August 2015, weapons laboratories completed 19 annual assessments of the stockpile, with the 20th in progress. Treaty supporters argue existing weapons meet deterrent needs, while opponents believe testing may be necessary to maintain confidence and counter new threats. The debate also questions the sufficiency of monitoring and verification capabilities. Supporters argue that advances in monitoring, like the International Monitoring System, make it difficult for evaders to conduct undetected tests. They believe any tests would be too small to impact the strategic balance. Opponents see opportunities for evasion, such as detonating explosions in large underground cavities to muffle seismic waves, potentially putting the US at a disadvantage. The treaty is seen as making technical contributions to nonproliferation by limiting weapons programs, with some supporters viewing it as a key step towards nuclear disarmament. NATO members, except the US, have ratified the CTBT. Opponents argue a strong nuclear deterrent is crucial for nonproliferation. In 2012, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences released a report on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, highlighting improvements in U.S. ability to maintain nuclear weapons without testing. The report emphasized progress in the stockpile stewardship program and advancements in detecting clandestine nuclear activities. The 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences highlighted advancements in U.S. ability to maintain nuclear weapons without testing, emphasizing progress in the stockpile stewardship program and improved detection of clandestine nuclear activities. The report stated that further progress in detecting nuclear tests is likely, and continued support is crucial for maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile. It also mentioned that some actions could occur even under a CTBT, such as development of simple nuclear weapons by states without them, and not every threat would require a return to U.S. nuclear testing. Key findings included better-than-anticipated technical capabilities for stockpile maintenance without nuclear-explosion testing. The United States has the technical capabilities to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons without testing. Advances in monitoring seismic stations and radionuclide networks have greatly improved detection capabilities. A strong national commitment to workforce recruitment, infrastructure recapitalization, and science and technology is essential for sustaining the stockpile. The United States has the technical capabilities to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons without testing. Russia and China would need multi-kiloton tests to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons, which could be detectable by U.S. monitoring capabilities. Other states seeking modern thermonuclear weapons would also require multi-kiloton testing for confidence in performance. The United States has the technical capabilities to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile of nuclear weapons without testing. Russia and China would need multi-kiloton tests to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons, which could be detectable by U.S. monitoring capabilities. C. Paul Robinson and Jack Murphy have criticized the 2012 NAS report on nuclear testing, pointing out flaws in the evasion methods and seismic monitoring aspects. The NAS report discusses the high likelihood of detecting evidence of a nuclear explosion with a yield greater than 0.1 kilotons during a CTBTO on-site inspection. Murphy questions the definitions of 'high likelihood' and 'sufficient precision' in location estimates. The report also includes a table for a 10% detection probability, which Murphy equates to identification and monitoring capability. Murphy questions the 10% detection probability threshold in the NAS report, highlighting the uncertainty in extrapolations for this threshold. Some critics point to caveats and imprecise wording in the report, suggesting significant uncertainty in maintaining a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile without testing. Critics question the sufficiency of resources and national commitment to stockpile stewardship due to Congress not providing full funding for Weapons Activities in FY2012 and the Administration requesting less for FY2013. The threshold levels for IMS seismic detection are now below 1 kt worldwide for fully coupled explosions, which critics argue is not a likely form of test for determined evaders. Critics argue that evaders could use evasion tactics such as decoupling seismic signals or detonating devices in remote ocean areas to avoid detection by a CTBTO on-site inspection. They also point out that nations conducting clandestine nuclear tests would likely hinder an OSI in various ways to prevent detection. The CTBT events include the Article XIV Conference in New York, the Science and Technology Conference in Vienna, Pakistan's stance on nuclear testing, the Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference, a workshop on isotope production, Angola ratifying the CTBT, and an agreement with Ecuador to build monitoring stations. The CTBTO PrepCom conducted an Integrated Field Exercise in Jordan to test on-site inspection procedures for detecting clandestine nuclear tests. The Republic of the Congo ratified the CTBT, and North Korea's nuclear test site showed decreased activity. The CTBTO PrepCom meetings and international efforts towards nonproliferation and disarmament, including Niue's ratification of the CTBT, are highlighted. President Kennedy's proposal for a comprehensive test ban is also mentioned. The House Armed Services Committee passed H.R. 1960, the FY2014 defense authorization bill, with an amendment related to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Delegates at the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference called for the entry into force of the CTBT. International Monitoring System stations detected radioactive activity between April 8 and 14. Between April 8 and 14, International Monitoring System stations detected radioactive isotopes of xenon consistent with the North Korean nuclear test of February 12. North Korea conducted a nuclear test on February 12. Chad ratified the CTBT. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution urging countries to sign and ratify the CTBT. Staff from various national laboratories conducted a subcritical experiment named \"Pollux.\" Lassina Zerbo was elected as the next Executive Secretary of the CTBT Organization Preparatory Commission. A group of foreign ministers reaffirmed their support for the CTBT. Foreign ministers reaffirmed support for the CTBT, with Niue becoming the 183rd state to sign the treaty. The National Research Council released a report on technical issues, while Indonesia ratified the CTBT as the 157th state. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution urging prompt signature and ratification of the treaty. The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization endorsed a budget of $10.3 million for an integrated field exercise in 2014 to improve on-site inspection capabilities. A conference on accelerating CTBT entry into force was held at U.N. headquarters in New York. Guinea became the 155th state to ratify the CTBT, and Ghana ratified the treaty as well. Ellen Tauscher, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, emphasized the importance of the CTBT. The Obama Administration is engaging in an education campaign to ratify the CTBT, with support from foreign ministers and a report suggesting risks. The CTBTO held a simulated inspection in Jordan, and the U.S. prepares for Senate reconsideration of the Treaty. Ministers issued a joint statement urging all states to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay. NNSA conducted the 24th subcritical experiment at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site. U.N. General Assembly declared December 3 as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests. Central African Republic and Trinidad and Tobago ratified the CTBT. Indonesia announced the initiation of the ratification process for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The eighth Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference reaffirmed the importance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

The curr_chunk provides references to government reports and documents related to nuclear security, including a recent nuclear test conducted by the United States in 1992 named \"Divider.\" President Bush signed the FY1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, P.L. 102-377, which restricted U.S. nuclear testing. Russia and France also extended their test moratoriums, and negotiations for a multilateral test ban began at the Vancouver summit. President Clinton announced a plan to continue the test moratorium, while China conducted the world's first nuclear test since 1992. The Conference on Disarmament prioritized negotiating a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The United States, China, and Russia extended their test moratoriums, with negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) being a top priority.
