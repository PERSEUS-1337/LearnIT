    "content": "The \"Home Building Lending Improvement Act of 2012\" aims to provide guidance to Federal and State bank regulators for banks and thrifts to offer financing to home builders, ensuring stable financing and aiding in revitalizing the housing market. The \"Home Building Lending Improvement Act of 2012\" requires Federal banking agencies to initiate guidance or rulemaking within 3 months for financial institutions making real estate loans to home builders. The measurement triggering additional scrutiny on construction loans will be adjusted to 125 percent of bank capital. The \"Home Building Lending Improvement Act of 2012\" sets a hard cap on loans but considers other factors like risk management practices. Federal banking agencies cannot prevent qualified institutions from lending to home builders unless there is a valid reason. Builders in good standing cannot be compelled to call loans. The appropriate Federal banking agency cannot force a financial institution to call a real estate loan of a home builder in good standing. If the collateral of the home builder decreases in value, the agency allows workout activities to improve prospects. The appropriate Federal banking agency allows workout activities to improve the prospects for repayment of home builder loans, within a 24-month period following the issuance of guidance. No real estate loan can be charged off without agency approval. The appropriate Federal banking agency allows workout activities for home builder loans within a 24-month period. Financial institutions must consider reasonable workout activities for loans and reclassification is not required unless there is a legitimate reason. The Federal banking agency allows workout activities for home builder loans within a 24-month period without reclassification unless there is a legitimate supervisory or accounting reason. Improved CAMEL composite ratings from 3, 4, or 5 to 1 or 2 will take effect immediately after final guidance is issued. Federal banking agencies must coordinate to ensure consistency and comparability in their guidance and regulations. The Federal banking agencies must issue final guidance or regulations to implement the Act within 6 months of enactment or 3 months after proposal. The guidance and regulations will be enforced by the agencies and will not override state laws unless there is inconsistency. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
