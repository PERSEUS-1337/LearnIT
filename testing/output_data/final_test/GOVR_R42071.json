    "content": "The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) was established in 1989 to promote trade and investment liberalization in the region. APEC has 21 members including China, Taiwan, and the United States. The Bogor Goals aim for free trade by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies. APEC focuses on trade facilitation to enhance efficiency. APEC prioritizes trade facilitation through voluntary liberalization measures, open regionalism, and consensus-based decision-making. Member economies announce their liberalization plans through Individual Action Plans. The host member organizes meetings throughout the year, including the annual Economic Leaders' Meeting. The United States hosted in 2011 with a theme of \"Creating a seamless economy.\" The United States has chosen the theme for the 2011 APEC meetings as \"Creating a seamless economy in the Asia-Pacific region.\" Senior-level meetings will be held in Honolulu, HI between November 8 and 13, starting with the fifth Senior Officials Meeting. This will be followed by a Finance Ministers' Meeting and an APEC Ministerial Meeting co-hosted by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. The agendas for these meetings have not been disclosed. The APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu, hosted by President Obama, will focus on regional economic integration, sustainable development, and regulatory convergence. President Obama is expected to push for progress on the formation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). It is unknown if he will hold separate bilateral meetings with other leaders. The APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Honolulu, hosted by President Obama, will focus on regional economic integration and the formation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). The United States envisions the FTAAP as a comprehensive free trade agreement, while other APEC members see it as the culmination of APEC's \"open regionalism\" model or a free trade agreement centered in Asia. The meeting may also address the status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. The Obama Administration has prioritized the Asia-Pacific region in its foreign policy, as seen through Secretary Hillary Clinton's early visits to Asian countries. In 2009 and 2010, President Obama and Secretary Clinton made high-level visits to Asia, emphasizing the importance of U.S. relations in the region. They attended APEC and U.S.-ASEAN Leaders' Meetings, with efforts to strengthen ties and seek membership in the East Asia Summit. The Obama Administration actively pursued progress in the ongoing TPP negotiations and promoted it as a model free trade agreement for the 21st century. The heightened U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific region raised questions about APEC's role in U.S. foreign policy, with the EAS seen as the main geopolitical association in the region. The Obama Administration promoted the TPP as a model free trade agreement for the 21st century, aiming to create the FTAAP envisioned by APEC. However, not all APEC members agree with this representation, with concerns raised by Chinese scholars about U.S. motivations. Some observers question the consistency of the TPP with APEC's goals and approach to trade liberalization. The Obama Administration also highlighted the importance of ASEAN in Asia-Pacific relations. The East Asia Summit (EAS) serves as a forum for dialogue on strategic, political, and economic issues among 16 members, including ASEAN nations and other key players in the region. President Obama is scheduled to attend the EAS in Bali, Indonesia, following the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. The East Asia Summit (EAS) aims to promote stability and economic prosperity in the region, with goals including trade expansion and liberalization. The United States and Russia were invited to join in 2010, with Secretary Clinton outlining five key principles for U.S. engagement. These principles include collaboration with EAS members, viewing ASEAN as a regional fulcrum, focusing on important issues like nuclear proliferation and climate change, and complementing work done in other forums like APEC. The EAS aims to promote stability and economic prosperity in the region, with goals including trade expansion and liberalization. Secretary Clinton outlined five key principles for U.S. engagement, emphasizing collaboration with EAS members and leveraging bilateral relations to promote U.S. goals. The EAS agenda focuses on geopolitical and security issues, while APEC remains the primary forum for economic and trade discussions in the Asia-Pacific region. China and Malaysia support the \"10 + 3\" approach to Asian economic integration, while Australia, India, and New Zealand have also been involved in discussions. According to analysts, Australia, India, and New Zealand were added to the EAS at Japan's insistence as a counterweight to China. China is suspicious of the US joining the EAS to prevent an Asian-based free trade association excluding the US. The US aims to align the agendas of APEC and EAS, while remaining open to other nations' ideas on economic development paths. The EAS plays a role in economic development discussions, with APEC and TPP aiming to create a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The US supports a high-standard free trade agreement within the TPP framework, while some APEC members have differing views on the path to forming an FTAAP. President Obama hopes to reach an agreement on the TPP framework by the end of the year. Some APEC members, including China, are skeptical about the TPP as a model for the 21st century FTAAP. APEC has been exploring alternative models for regional economic integration, such as ASEAN+3, ASEAN+6, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, under pressure from the United States. APEC aims to promote regional economic integration through initiatives like ASEAN+3, ASEAN+6, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The organization plays a crucial role in shaping and addressing trade and investment issues for the future Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). The APEC is working on sectoral initiatives in areas like investment, services, e-commerce, rules of origin, standards, trade facilitation, and environmental goods. Representatives of current APEC members involved in TPP negotiations may announce a broad framework of the agreement during APEC meetings. Chinese officials are concerned about U.S. intentions in pursuing a high-standard TPP, viewing it as part of a containment policy towards China. The U.S. decision to join the EAS is seen by Chinese officials as part of a containment policy towards China. They criticize the lack of transparency in TPP negotiations with APEC members and question the compatibility of TPP with APEC's approach to trade liberalization. If TPP is finalized, it may only extend trade privileges to its members, contrary to APEC's \"open regionalism.\" The U.S. is considering a formulation that would make APEC an incubator for trade innovations, with the TPP adopting the results. This would potentially lead to a larger FTAAP. The Obama Administration is focusing on strengthening relations with ASEAN. The U.S. is making efforts to enhance relations with ASEAN by appointing the first resident U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN, holding U.S.-ASEAN Summits, signing ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and joining the EAS. Some ASEAN members and analysts are skeptical about U.S. commitment, suspecting it is focused on relations with China. The Obama Administration recognizes ASEAN's importance in the EAS and supports their plans for an ASEAN Community by 2015. ASEAN is actively involved in free trade agreements with China, South Korea, and the European Union. The United States may not welcome ASEAN's agreements with other nations that exclude the U.S. There is tension between the Obama Administration's focus on ASEAN and the importance of APEC in trade policy discussions. ASEAN members, supported by China, are exploring alternative models for regional economic integration where ASEAN plays a central role. ASEAN cannot participate in APEC/TPP due to some members not being part of APEC. The upcoming APEC meetings in November will focus on strengthening regional economic integration and expanding trade by addressing \"next-generation\" trade issues. The Obama Administration aims to prioritize innovation, small and medium-sized enterprises' participation in trade, and improving supply chains for international trade. The upcoming APEC meetings will focus on strengthening regional economic integration, promoting sustainable economic growth in \"green industries,\" and facilitating trade through regulatory cooperation. The Obama Administration aims to make APEC more effective in promoting trade liberalization and investment facilitation. Critics view APEC as a \"talk shop,\" but supporters highlight its success in reducing trade barriers and facilitating trade. APEC's voluntary, consensus-based approach lacks newsworthy events like binding trade agreements. Congressional interest focuses on U.S. trade policy, relations with China, and budgetary matters. Implementing APEC's vision of trade liberalization has been challenging for the U.S. One issue before Congress involves changes in trade laws for tariff rate reductions. The U.S. joined APEC's Business Travel Card program in 2007 for pre-cleared entry to member economies. The APEC Business Travel Card program allows pre-cleared entry to member economies for three years without needing visas. H.R. 2042 aims to integrate this program with existing traveler programs like Global Entry. The bill has passed in the House and is now under Senate consideration. APEC has become a point of contention in U.S.-China relations due to China's assertiveness in Asia and trade agreements negotiations. Some Chinese officials and scholars see the U.S. using APEC to push for trade agreements as part of a containment strategy against China. The U.S. contributes to APEC's budget, with previous direct financial support at $901,000 per year. Additional funds were allocated for hosting APEC in 2011."
