The report focuses on legislative language and funding for these commissions created since the 96th Congress. It does not cover noncommemorative congressional commissions or other commemorative entities. Since the 96th Congress, 21 commemorative commissions have been identified through a database search. Bills creating these commissions are regularly introduced in Congress, but most are not enacted. The report focuses on legislative language and funding for these commissions, which oversee celebrations for milestone anniversaries. Since the 96th Congress, 21 commemorative commissions have been identified through a database search. These commissions were created to commemorate individuals or historical events on milestone anniversaries. The statutes establishing these commissions outline their mandate, membership structure, duties, and termination date. Legislators have flexibility in designing the composition and organization of each commission to align with Congress's goals, resulting in unique organizational structures and powers for each commission. The establishment of commemorative commissions is typically outlined in legislation, with specific findings or purposes justifying their creation. Membership and appointment structures vary among these commissions, resulting in unique organizational powers for each. The legislation governing commemorative commissions may require specific Members of Congress to be part of the commission, appointed by congressional leaders. Recommendations for membership can also be made by congressional leaders to other leaders or the President, limiting the autonomy of individual Members in the appointment process. The autonomy of a Member in appointing or recommending commission membership can be limited by statutory requirements for specific qualifications. These limitations can make finding suitable appointments more challenging but also allow Congress to retain control over the nomination process. Most commemorative commissions do not compensate members, except for reimbursing expenses related to their service. The duties of these commissions are numerous and varied. The duties of commemorative commissions are varied, including studying ideas for commemoration, submitting reports to Congress, identifying historical sites, recommending actions for preservation, and organizing events in commemoration of individuals or events. The commemorative congressional commissions are authorized to hold public meetings, secure information from federal agencies, and accept gifts and donations. For example, the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission could secure information directly from federal agencies to carry out its duties. The Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission, like other commemorative commissions, is authorized to accept donations of money, services, and property related to Benjamin Franklin. They have powers to contract with public and private entities, use the mails like US agencies, and hire staff as needed. Pay rates are specified, but the commission has flexibility to set actual rates. They can also accept voluntary contributions. Many commemorative commissions are authorized to accept voluntary services and work with the General Services Administration for administrative support. They encourage collaboration with private groups, state and local governments, and other federal entities. Many commemorative commissions collaborate with private groups, state and local governments, and other federal entities for general commemoration activities. Federal funds allocated to these commissions are just a part of the total funding used nationwide for such events. For instance, P.L. 107-41 directed the Brown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission to work with the Brown Foundation for Educational Equity in Topeka, Kansas, and other relevant entities to coordinate observances of the Brown decision anniversary. Similarly, P.L. 98-101 tasked the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution to engage private organizations and state/local governments. The Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution was established to coordinate activities nationwide, serve as a clearinghouse for information, and encourage participation in bicentennial events. Commemorative commissions typically have termination dates based on specific criteria and can be funded through appropriations or nonfederal money. Commemorative commissions may be authorized to fundraise or accept donations, with varying levels of funding approved since the 96th Congress. Some commemorative commissions are authorized specific levels of funding, while others are authorized \"such sums as necessary\" for unspecified fiscal years. Commissions may be funded through specific appropriations or general agency appropriations. For example, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution received funding from both regular annual and supplemental appropriations acts, while the Women's Progress Commemoration Commission was funded through general appropriations for the National Park Service. The funding structure for commemorative commissions can change, with some receiving specific appropriations while others are funded through general agency appropriations. For example, the Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission was funded under the \"National Recreation and Preservation\" heading of the NPS appropriations in FY2005. The NPS appropriations fund commemorative commissions like the Jamestown 2007 celebration. Legislation allows commissions to accept donations of money, property, and services. For example, the Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Commission and James Madison Commemorative Commission were authorized to accept donations. The authorizing language for commemorative commissions allows them to accept donations with specific limitations. For example, P.L. 98-375 set limits on donation values, while P.L. 115-102 specified that all expenses must be covered by donated funds. Most statutes do not mention fundraising explicitly. The authorizing language for commemorative commissions allows them to accept donations with specific limitations, without explicitly mentioning fundraising. Examples include the Jamestown 400th Commemoration Commission, Eisenhower Memorial Commission, Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission, and Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution Commission, all authorized to accept donations of money, property, or personal services. The Commission may accept donations of money, property, or personal services from non-Federal sources to defray operational costs. They can also accept donations related to specific themes such as the transatlantic slave trade or the Brown v. Board of Education anniversary. The Centennial of Flight Commission and other commissions can accept donations of money, property, or personal services. Some commissions are authorized to accept only nonmonetary donations. While none of the 21 commemorative commission statutes discussed specifically authorize fundraising, commissions could be given authority to fundraise by language similar to the Commemorative Works Act. The National Museum of African American History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission statute authorizes fundraising to raise a percentage of total costs from private sources before construction can begin. Congressional commission costs vary depending on factors like staff numbers and duration. Some commissions have full-time staff and provide compensation to members, while others only reimburse for travel expenses. Many congressional commissions are funded through congressional appropriations but can also accept donations of money and volunteer labor to offset costs. Commission costs vary based on factors such as the number of commissioners, meeting frequency, and publication production."
