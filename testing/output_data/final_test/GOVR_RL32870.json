The Bush Administration opposes this move, citing concerns about human rights and arms export policies. The European Union is contemplating lifting its arms embargo on China, which has been in place since 1989. The Bush Administration opposes this decision due to concerns about human rights and arms export policies. Congress is examining the implications for U.S. political and security interests regarding Europe and China, as well as potential options to discourage the EU from lifting the embargo. The current disagreement between the US and Europe over technology transfers and defense procurement presents an opportunity for closer coordination of policies, including controls over military-related exports and strategy towards China. The US has important interests in maintaining strong alliances with common approaches toward China, engaging Beijing on economic, political, and military fronts. Concerns remain about human rights, democracy, weapons proliferation, and military practices in China. The United States has called for the EU to maintain the arms embargo on China and strengthen export controls due to fears of instability in the Taiwan Strait resulting from China's military modernization with European defense technology. Taiwan remains a major issue that could lead to conflict between the US and China. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) governs U.S. policy towards Taiwan, including offering arms for self-defense. The TRA does not commit the U.S. to intervene in threats to Taiwan but declares it is U.S. policy to maintain the capacity to resist any coercion jeopardizing Taiwan's security. The question arises about U.S. forces' capability to deter or defeat the PLA in the event of the use of force. U.S. forces have the capability to deter or defeat the PLA, not only in the event of a use of force but also coercion against Taiwan. Tensions between the PRC and Taiwan have been ongoing since the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996, with concerns about Taiwan's self-defense and U.S. support. Congress oversees diplomacy towards Europe and has pressured EU member states not to lift the arms embargo. Additionally, Congress has expressed concerns about China's human rights policies. The EU's policy towards China, especially regarding human rights and arms sales, has raised concerns in Congress. There is worry that lifting the arms embargo could lead to EU countries selling defense technology to China, potentially undermining U.S. export controls. In May 2004, the House passed a provision to impose procurement sanctions against foreign persons transferring military items to China. Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Henry Hyde expressed concerns about sharing technology with China through commercial sales. Senator Joseph Biden stated that lifting the embargo is not supported by Congress. At a Senate hearing in March 2005, Senator Lugar warned against increasing European military transfers to China, urging a reassessment of sales of critical military technology. Senator Biden also called for maintaining the arms embargo on China and strengthening the Code of Conduct on arms sales. Representatives Hunter, Skelton, Hyde, and Lantos convened a joint hearing in April 2005 to address these concerns. In 2005, US Representatives opposed lifting the EU's arms embargo on China. The US had previously suspended military contacts and arms sales to China in response to the Tiananmen Crackdown. The ban on arms sales was imposed by President George H.W. Bush in 1989 and later codified in sanctions passed in 1990. In response to sanctions, China canceled the \"Peace Pearl\" program in April 1990. President Bush closed out four suspended FMS programs in December 1992. Congress oversees sanctions prohibiting the export of certain items to China, with waivers granted in some cases. Presidents Bush and Clinton issued waivers for satellite projects from 1989 to 1998. President George W. Bush issued waivers in January 2002. In response to sanctions, China canceled the \"Peace Pearl\" program in April 1990. President Bush closed out four suspended FMS programs in December 1992. Congress oversees sanctions prohibiting the export of certain items to China, with waivers granted in some cases. Presidents Bush and Clinton issued waivers for satellite projects from 1989 to 1998. President George W. Bush issued waivers in January 2002 to export bomb containment and disposal unit for Shanghai fire department and equipment to clean up chemical weapons in China. European countries also took action in response to the Tiananmen Crackdown, with the EU arms embargo on China based on a 1989 political declaration. The EU's precursor, the European Community, issued a declaration in June 1989 condemning the \"brutal repression\" in China and calling for the cessation of executions and respect for human rights. The declaration included measures such as suspending military cooperation, reducing cultural and technical programs, and prolonging visas for Chinese students. While not legally binding, the declaration represents a political commitment for all EU members to uphold. Each member implements the arms embargo differently, allowing some countries to export certain military equipment to China. The EU's arms embargo on China has loopholes that allow some countries to export military equipment. China has been pressuring the EU to lift the embargo since 2003, leading to a review process in 2004 driven by France and Germany. The effectiveness of the embargo and wider defense export control policies have been questioned. The EU's arms embargo on China has loopholes that allow some countries to export military equipment. China pressured the EU to lift the embargo in 2003, leading to a review process in 2004. The decision to end the embargo requires unanimity among all member states of the EU. EU leaders reaffirmed their political will to work towards lifting the embargo at a meeting in Brussels in December 2004. No firm date was set for ending the embargo. The EU did not set a firm date for ending the arms embargo on China, but it was strongly suggested that it would be lifted in spring 2005. France and Germany supported lifting the embargo, while the UK and Netherlands had concerns about the strategic implications. By early 2005, there was enough consensus among EU members to lift the embargo in May or June 2005. The decision was based on the belief that the embargo was ineffective and would only be lifted if a stronger EU export control regime was in place. The EU considered lifting the arms embargo on China in spring 2005, contingent on implementing a stronger export control regime. However, the decision was delayed due to China's adoption of the \"Anti-Secession Law\" in March 2005, which warned against Taiwan's independence efforts. The European Union criticized China's \"Anti-Secession Law\" for potentially escalating tensions and creating a difficult political environment. The US expressed concerns that lifting the arms embargo could pose a threat to Taiwan and US forces in Asia. Despite EU plans for tighter export controls, US officials remained opposed to arms sales to China due to human rights concerns. The EU is hesitant to lift the arms embargo on China due to strong US opposition and human rights concerns. The new German government under Chancellor Angela Merkel is less enthusiastic about lifting the embargo without US consent. Despite ongoing dialogue, analysts believe the EU is politically committed to eventually lifting the embargo, which China argues is outdated. The EU is facing strong US opposition and human rights concerns regarding the potential lifting of the arms embargo on China. The Bush Administration argues that China's human rights violations still exist and that expanded EU defense sales to China would harm US security interests. The US believes that lifting the embargo would reduce leverage on China to improve its human rights situation. The US opposes lifting the arms embargo on China due to human rights concerns. They believe it would signal to China that it can continue violating human rights and isolate the US. Pressure on Beijing to reexamine the Tiananmen Crackdown would also decrease. The US has urged China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Discussions have been held with EU countries about lifting the embargo on arms sales to China. The US opposes lifting the arms embargo on China due to human rights concerns and believes others should maintain their embargoes as well. The Bush Administration lodged diplomatic protests with EU members regarding the reconsideration of the arms embargo against China. Representative Steve Chabot questioned Secretary of State Colin Powell about the EU's stance, with Powell expressing opposition due to the PLA's missiles aimed at Taiwan and sensitive political issues in Taiwan. The State Department criticized China's poor human rights record in 2004, citing numerous abuses and suppression of religious and political groups. China's human rights situation was said to have suffered negative developments, with authorities quick to suppress dissent, especially before sensitive political events. The PRC government cracked down on Uighur separatists and Muslim leaders under the pretext of the war on terrorism. The US State Department decided not to introduce a resolution on China's human rights abuses after China released a Uighur woman, citing \"significant steps\" on human rights. The decision not to end the arms embargo on China was influenced by the impending release and concerns about human rights violations during the Tiananmen Crackdown. The State Department emphasized that the conditions leading to the embargo, including the imprisonment of demonstrators and lack of accountability for the crackdown, have not changed. China maintains its justification for using military force during the crackdown and continues to suppress public commemoration of the event. Zhao Ziyang, the former premier who opposed the crackdown, was put under house arrest. Zhao Ziyang, who opposed the Tiananmen Crackdown and was later put under house arrest, died on January 17, 2005. The Chinese government allowed only a simple funeral for him and continued to suppress dissenting voices calling for a reassessment of the crackdown. In March 2005, former leaders of the pro-democracy movement and activists wrote a letter to European officials expressing concerns about the lack of improvement in human rights in China since 1989. In early February 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice opposed lifting the arms embargo on China due to concerns about human rights and military balance in Asia. President Bush also warned European allies about defense-related transfers affecting the balance between China and Taiwan during his visit to Brussels. Rice later warned about the delicate military balance in Asia during her first visit to Asia as Secretary of State in March 2005. Since becoming Secretary of State in March 2005, Condoleezza Rice publicly expressed concerns about China's military spending and power, warning against any actions that could alter the balance in the Pacific region. She emphasized that the European Union should not contribute to China's military modernization with European technology, as the United States has historically defended the Pacific. There are doubts about the effectiveness of U.S. leverage and diplomacy towards China due to mixed messages in engagement policies. The United States has a policy of engagement towards China, supporting Taiwan's self-defense while adhering to the \"one China\" policy. There are concerns about whether this policy has promoted stability, democracy, and human rights in China. The tone towards Taiwan shifted from supporting defense to criticizing its leader in 2003. The United States has a policy of engagement towards China, supporting Taiwan's self-defense while adhering to the \"one China\" policy. Concerns have been raised about the Administration's focus on arms sales to Taiwan over promoting cross-strait dialogue. U.S. criticism of European defense trade with China has been harsher than that of Russian or Israeli sales. China has demanded the EU lift its arms embargo, arguing it is political discrimination. China claims it does not intend to buy massive weapons from the EU. The EU is considering lifting its arms embargo on China, which raises concerns for the US. This could potentially increase China's military capabilities, strengthen its defense industries, and pose threats to Taiwan and US forces. China's military modernization aims to build offensive capabilities against Taiwan and its allies. The US deployed aircraft carrier battlegroups near Taiwan in response to China's military modernization and increased PLA capabilities. Concerns were raised about the shifting balance of power in the Taiwan Strait in China's favor, with the PLA engaging in a missile buildup and posing threats to US forces in the region. The PLA has increased its offensive, mobile short-range ballistic missiles, with an estimated 650-730 missiles targeted at Taiwan in 2005. China's rising military budgets have accelerated military modernization, with total defense spending estimated at up to $90 billion in 2005, making it the third-highest in the world and the highest in Asia. China's defense spending in Asia, including Japan, has been increasing significantly. China's announced military budget for 2004 was around US$25 billion, doubling from 1999. In 2005, China projected a defense budget of nearly US$30 billion. U.S. experts believe that China's publicly announced budget does not reflect the full resources allocated to the PLA. The military budget has been increasing annually since 1989, showing a strong emphasis on military modernization. China's military budget has increased annually since 1997, with double-digit growth since 1998. China has been able to increase foreign arms purchases, primarily from Russia, with procurement doubling since 1999. Sales to China accounted for 40-45% of Russia's total arms exports in 2004. In 2004, Russian arms sales to China were valued at $5.7 billion, accounting for 40-45% of Russia's total arms exports. China's major arms purchases from Russia since 1990 include fighters, submarines, destroyers, and air defense missile systems. China has also acquired technology through foreign arms sales and assistance. China has developed its domestic defense industries through foreign arms sales and assistance, acquiring new weapons programs such as Su-27 fighters, AWACS aircraft, destroyers, frigates, submarines, nuclear-powered attack submarines, satellites, and space launch vehicles. The United States and Europe are concerned about China's development of ballistic missiles, land-attack cruise missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. European defense-related sales to China have doubled from 2002 to 2003, reaching 416 million euros. European military-related sales to China have significantly increased since the 1990s, with sales in 2003 being eight times higher than in 2001. Items sold include howitzers, helicopters, radars, jet engines, avionics, and diesel engines for naval ships and submarines. Notable sales include radar systems from the U.K., engines for naval strike fighters from Rolls-Royce, diesel engines for destroyers and submarines from Germany, air combat radars from Italy, and diesel engines for frigates from France. European military-related sales to China have significantly increased since the 1990s, with notable items including howitzers, helicopters, radars, jet engines, avionics, and diesel engines for naval ships and submarines. The Bush Administration has expressed concerns about EU sales of military equipment to China, citing issues with fire control radars, aircraft engines, submarine technology, and maritime search radars. There are worries about potential gains for China if the arms embargo is lifted due to these sales. China has expressed intentions to gain military benefits from the removal of the EU's arms embargo. Reports speculate on potential purchases such as airborne warning systems, jet engines, French Mirage fighters, and German submarines. However, some argue that China is unlikely to buy complete French fighters or German submarines. European companies could sell components and subsystems, like command, control, and communications, to China, enhancing the integration of weapons. China's leverage could increase without the arms embargo, allowing for stronger negotiations for platforms and technology transfers from Russian suppliers. European companies could sell components and subsystems to China, enhancing weapon integration. This would give China stronger leverage in negotiating deals for platforms and technology transfers from Russian, Israeli, European, or other bidders, especially with the absence of strict European export controls. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged the importance of limiting competitors in the Chinese market, emphasizing the potential for future Russian-European cooperation in high-tech projects for China. Additionally, a 2004 article highlighted China's aspirations to access top technological products from Britain, Germany, and France to improve its conventional weaponry. China is unlikely to replace its domestic and Russian fighters and naval vessels with Western platforms, instead seeking technology transfers and co-development. It has a need for various technologies from European countries such as missile, submarine, engine, electronics, and stealth technology. Importing advanced equipment aims to enhance China's national defense industry. European companies like EADS and Thales of France have shown interest in selling components and subsystems to China for weapon integration. European defense companies, including EADS and Thales of France, are interested in selling components to China for weapon integration. Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. of Britain believes that lifting the arms embargo could expedite the export licensing process. Meanwhile, experts are monitoring China's acquisition of advanced technologies for its navy, but European firms may hesitate to expand defense business with China due to potential costs. BAE Systems and EADS are cautious about jeopardizing their business with the U.S. Defense Department by selling military equipment to China. Concerns arise about China copying Western technology and becoming a competitor in the aerospace sector. China aims to establish its own global satellite navigation system. China aims to establish its own global satellite navigation system and the Pentagon has warned against lifting the EU arms embargo on China, citing concerns about technology transfer and military implications. China would seek joint ventures with European companies to acquire expertise and technology, including advanced defense technology, space technology, radar systems, early warning aircraft, submarine technology, and electronic components for precision-guided weapons. This acquisition of European defense technology would significantly improve PLA capabilities in the medium to long term, giving China greater leverage over Russia and Israel. The Pentagon warned that such an acceleration of China's military modernization would have direct implications for stability in the Taiwan Strait and the safety of U.S. personnel, as well as shift the regional balance of power. Both political and economic considerations are driving EU proclivities towards China. The EU is considering lifting the arms embargo on China to strengthen arms export control and develop a strategic partnership. They view China as a rising power with implications for global challenges. The EU believes engagement with China would be mutually beneficial and hopes to further integrate China into the international system. Some EU member states, like France and Germany, are more supportive of lifting the arms embargo on China, while others are hesitant. European leaders believe China shares their vision for a strong United Nations and multilateral governance. Critics argue that countries like France are eager to engage with China to promote a multipolar world. China has been actively engaging with the EU as a whole, contrasting with perceived U.S. ambivalence towards European integration. EU officials see building relationships with major powers like China as crucial for their Common Foreign policy. The EU is considering lifting the arms embargo on China to strengthen their Common Foreign and Security Policy and enhance their role on the world stage. EU leaders believe that removing the embargo would symbolically improve relations with China, although critics argue it may send a negative signal about EU-China relations. The intention is not to increase arms sales to China, but to remove a psychological barrier to better relations. In January 2005, Javier Solana, the EU's High Representative for CFSP, stated that lifting the arms embargo on China would be a political decision rather than a military one. Concerns about China's human rights record persist among some EU member states, but others argue that China has changed since 1989. The European Parliament opposes lifting the embargo on human rights grounds, but the decision rests solely with the member states. The EU asserts it will pressure China to improve human rights despite the embargo end. Some EU member states aim to increase defense sales to China. European defense companies seek access to China's defense market due to limited opportunities in the US market. French officials argue for European sales. French officials advocate for European sales of weapons technologies to China, despite concerns about potential impacts on the US defense market. Some Europeans push back against US criticism, pointing out that other countries like Russia and Israel also export arms to China without reprimand. Many EU member states have non-military economic objectives for lifting the arms embargo on China, such as deepening foreign investment and closing trade deficits. Analysts believe that China's orders are crucial for European-owned Airbus, and some suspect US opposition is driven by economic interests and competition concerns. EU officials argue for lifting the embargo. EU officials argue that the EU's arms embargo on China is not effective due to its vague language and varying interpretations among member states. While some claim the embargo has prevented sales of certain weapons systems to China, others believe it has had little impact. French officials assert they will not sell advanced weapons to China even if the EU embargo is lifted. Some analysts fear a ripple effect where other countries may increase sales to China to compete with European sellers. EU member states have their own export controls and follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. The EU has criteria for reviewing arms export license requests, including consistency with international commitments, risks of human rights violations, armed conflicts, and terrorism, as well as effects on regional peace and security. EU member states follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. In June 2000, the EU adopted a Common List of Military Equipment covered by the EU Code to standardize arms exports across member states. The Code also applies to dual-use goods for police or military use, with regulations on export licenses. EU members established rules to control arms brokering to prevent embargo circumvention. The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports includes regulations on brokering activities and requires member states to obtain written authorization and keep records for at least 10 years. Many Europeans believe the Code has been more effective in blocking arms sales to China than the 1989 embargo, as it sets specific criteria and reporting requirements, exerting peer pressure on member states to comply. Under the denial notification procedure, member states must provide information on refused licenses and reasons for denial before authorizing a license for the same transaction. The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports requires member states to consult each other before authorizing a license that was previously denied. Critics argue that the Code lacks transparency and accountability, as it does not mandate notification of granted licenses. Member states are supposed to submit confidential annual reports on defense exports, but concerns remain about the Code's effectiveness in its current form. The EU Code of Conduct on arms exports lacks transparency and accountability, as it does not provide complete details of actual arms exports made by EU states. Critics argue that reporting requirements do not offer a clear picture of all EU arms exports, leading to suspicions of understating defense deals with China. Additionally, there is a lack of uniformity in reporting practices among EU member states. The EU's Code of Conduct on arms exports lacks transparency due to varying reporting practices among member states. Some countries like the UK, Italy, and the Czech Republic do not provide detailed breakdowns of their licenses, while France and Germany are able to categorize their licenses for reporting purposes. Critics argue that the Code is not legally binding or enforceable, raising doubts about its effectiveness as a politically binding commitment. Some argue that the EU's Code of Conduct on arms exports lacks transparency and effectiveness as a politically binding commitment. They point to the increase in EU arms sales licenses to China as evidence. EU officials maintain that while the Code is not legally binding, all member states are expected to implement its common foreign policy goals. Suggestions have been made to transform the Code into an EU Common Position to ensure enforcement in national legislation. The EU's Code of Conduct on arms exports lacks transparency and effectiveness as a politically binding commitment. Enforcement would still be up to the competent authorities in the EU's member states, leading to potential differences in implementation. Member states are unlikely to cede sovereignty over their national export control policies to the Union. The EU is working to revise and strengthen the Code. The EU is revising and strengthening its arms export control Code to improve effectiveness. The United States opposes lifting the arms embargo on China and urges the EU to maintain it. EU officials assure that lifting the embargo will not increase arms sales to China, as per the \"standstill clause.\" Plans include adopting a revised Code of Conduct and new measures for arms exports. The EU is revising its arms export control Code to enhance transparency and accountability, with a focus on measures for countries like China. The strengthened Code and a new \"toolbox\" aim to tighten regulations on technology transfers and dual-use goods. Political approval from EU leaders is pending for these initiatives. The EU is revising its arms export control Code to tighten regulations on technology transfers and dual-use goods. The new \"toolbox\" will require member states to exchange information on defense export licenses granted and denied, aiming to establish a baseline for compliance with the EU's \"standstill clause\" on China. However, doubts remain about the credibility and enforcement of these measures. EU member states are skeptical about improving the Code of Conduct for arms exports and increasing information-sharing. Some states resist sharing detailed license information citing company confidentiality. The duration of the \"toolbox\" is uncertain, with some advocating for a few years and others for a decade. EU officials aim to address U.S. concerns about lifting the arms embargo on China by strengthening export controls and seeking commitments on human rights. The EU aims to address U.S. concerns by seeking commitments from China on human rights, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and refraining from re-exporting arms. They also propose establishing a \"no sell\" list with the U.S. to restrict specific weapons and technologies from being exported to China. The EU seeks commitments from China on human rights and nonproliferation of weapons, including not selling equipment to China's security forces for repression. They plan to deepen involvement in the Taiwan Strait dispute for a peaceful resolution and engage in a strategic dialogue with the EU on arms embargo and Asian security issues. The EU plans to engage in a strategic dialogue with China on arms embargo and Asian security issues, but the talks will not be a negotiation over lifting the embargo. Concerns arise that lifting the embargo could strain US-European relations and NATO alliance, as some in Washington doubt the EU's ability to control arms sales to China responsibly. This could worsen transatlantic tensions amid existing disagreements over foreign policy. The EU's decision to lift the arms embargo on China may impact US-European relations and NATO alliance. Washington may question the EU's ability to control arms sales responsibly, potentially straining transatlantic tensions. EU's efforts to create a more robust arms export control regime could demonstrate commitment to being reliable security partners and protect US interests in the region. European policymakers are addressing U.S. concerns about lifting the arms embargo on China, while some Europeans criticize the U.S. for not consulting with allies on international issues. There are worries that U.S. opposition could hinder EU's efforts to develop a common foreign policy. Concerns also exist about potential impacts on U.S.-European defense cooperation if the arms ban on China is lifted. The potential lifting of the EU arms embargo on China could hinder U.S.-European defense cooperation on weapons systems and technology transfers. This could lead to increased U.S. fears of re-exportation of military equipment or sensitive weapons technologies to China, potentially impacting defense industrial cooperation and sales between the U.S. and EU countries. The potential effects of lifting the EU arms embargo on China could impact U.S. defense sales to EU countries significantly. For example, from 2000-2003, the U.S. had notable arms sale agreements with Poland, Greece, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The Defense Ministry of the United Kingdom estimated future business with American defense contractors to reach $13 billion. U.S. defense industries are concerned about potential restrictions on exports to EU nations. The United States has significant restrictions on exports to EU nations, with the potential for EU states to curtail or end the supply of defense articles to the U.S. This could lead to delays in production and increased costs until domestic sources are identified and qualified. Efforts have been made to exempt the United Kingdom from U.S. arms export controls, seeking a waiver from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to allow for the export of defense items without a U.S. export license. Efforts have been made to exempt the United Kingdom from U.S. arms export controls, seeking a waiver from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to allow for the export of defense items without a U.S. export license. Certain allied countries with strict arms export controls may obtain U.S. defense articles with minimal regulatory review, but concerns remain about U.K. export controls and re-transfer controls. Congress passed a provision in 2004 for expedited processing of U.K. requests for U.S. defense articles, but review under U.S. law and regulations is still required. European frustration with U.S. export controls on sensitive weapons technologies may influence the EU decision on lifting or maintaining the embargo. Some European defense policymakers are doubtful about obtaining ITAR waivers, potentially leading to the lifting of the EU arms embargo on China. Supporters emphasize the importance of a strong transatlantic partnership to address challenges posed by China's rise. Despite tensions, the arms embargo issue presents an opportunity for collaboration between the United States and Europe. The tensions over the EU arms embargo on China have created an opportunity for a U.S.-European dialogue on security challenges in East Asia. However, there are concerns that if the U.S. sanctions European companies in response to the embargo being lifted, it could harm transatlantic relations and hinder allied cooperation on global issues. Ending the embargo without improving dialogue could reduce Western leverage on China for human rights improvements. There are concerns that lifting the EU arms embargo on China could reduce Western leverage on China for human rights improvements and reexamination of the Tiananmen Crackdown. The US policy towards China has focused on peaceful engagement but remains vigilant to destabilizing moves. China's pursuit of advanced military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region is seen as hindering its own national greatness. Concerns about China's rising economic, political, and military power conflict with U.S. strategic interests for global peace and stability. The Bush Administration's 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review aims to prevent hostile domination in critical areas, following the EP-3 aircraft collision crisis with China. The review acknowledges the potential for regional powers to develop significant capabilities. In the near future, regional powers may pose a threat to stability in critical regions, particularly in Asia. Concerns about the emergence of a military competitor with a strong resource base in the East Asia littoral region have been raised. The EU has also recognized nonproliferation issues with China, as seen in the Joint Declaration on Nonproliferation and Arms Control. There are concerns about foreign cooperation with PRC defense-industrial corporations benefiting some engaged in weapons proliferation, including to unstable areas like the Middle East. The United States has imposed sanctions on PRC entities involved in weapons proliferation, with European companies also cooperating with PRC organizations of concern. For example, Eurocopter signed an agreement with CATIC to assemble helicopters, leading to sanctions imposed on CATIC in 2002 and 2004. Italy's Iveco company has also cooperated with North China Industries. Italy's Iveco company collaborated with North China Industries Corporation (NORINCO) to produce an anti-tank weapon. U.S. sanctions have been imposed on NORINCO multiple times, as well as on other PRC entities in shipbuilding and space industries. Alcatel's sale of the Chinasat-9 communication satellite undermines U.S. sanctions on PRC weapons proliferation. The EU's potential lifting of its arms embargo on China has raised concerns in the U.S. about supporting an aggressive PRC posture in Asia. U.S. efforts to maintain stability in Asia have intensified since 2004, focusing on resuming cross-strait dialogue. The EU's potential lifting of its arms embargo on China has raised concerns in the U.S. about supporting an aggressive PRC posture in Asia. This attention could lead to a review of U.S. arms sanctions on China, including waivers for sanctions imposed for the Tiananmen Crackdown. In 2002, the State Department considered exporting Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to China. China's organizers and American exporters could urge transfers of U.S. security equipment for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which could also be used for internal security. Concerns in the U.S. government are rising over China's military modernization being offensive and destabilizing, posing a threat to U.S. forces and allies. Japan, in particular, is increasingly worried about the PLA's buildup, with incidents like submarine intrusions into Japanese waters causing tensions. The United States and Japan expressed concerns over China's military modernization and its impact on security in East Asia. Japan opposed lifting the arms embargo, citing potential negative effects on regional security. The PLA Navy deployed a Sovremenny destroyer to disputed waters between China and Japan, raising tensions over gas and oil drilling rights. U.S. diplomacy with the EU could impact security interests of allies. U.S. diplomacy with the EU could impact U.S. security interests and those of allies like Japan, especially regarding the EU's arms embargo and concerns about arms suppliers to the PLA. The Pentagon submits annual reports to Congress on PRC military power, including significant sales and transfers of military hardware, expertise, and technology to China. Congress expanded reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002. The 2002 report discussed arms sales by former Soviet states, excluding Israel and other countries. The 2004 report raised concerns about the EU's arms ban and highlighted U.S. concerns about China's human rights abuses. This could impact EU member states with strong human rights advocacy traditions. Some new EU members from Central and Eastern Europe may be receptive to U.S. arguments against lifting the EU embargo on arms sales to China. The U.S. should avoid strategies that divide the EU and instead focus on raising concerns about Russian and Israeli arms sales to China. Encouraging a strengthening of the EU's Code of Conduct on arms sales could help address transatlantic tensions and provide transparency to EU member states. The sale of arms within the EU could be influenced by peer pressure, urging the EU to strengthen its Code of Conduct on arms sales. The United States could also encourage the EU to align its Military Control List with international arrangements like the Wassenaar Arrangement. Promoting a cooperative strategy towards China and East Asia is also suggested. Many Europeans were surprised by the strong U.S. opposition to lifting the EU arms embargo on China. The U.S. could engage in a sustained dialogue with European allies on East Asia, including intelligence-sharing and consultations on arms sales to the region. This approach would allow the U.S. to express concerns about specific arms transfers to China without infringing on EU sovereignty. The United States could seek bilateral agreements with individual EU member states to constrain arms sales to China and possibly ban the transfer of sensitive U.S. weapons or technology. This could minimize controversies over sales to China and ensure U.S. interests are considered, although it is uncertain if EU member states would be open to such arrangements. Some EU member states may prefer an EU-wide agreement to harmonize export controls. Congress could engage in discussions with the European Parliament to shape the transatlantic debate on East Asia. The European Parliament has passed resolutions urging the EU to maintain the arms embargo on China. Members of Congress could encourage continued vigilance on the embargo and EU-China relations. If the EU lifts its arms embargo on China, Members of Congress are prepared to restrict U.S. sales of defense articles and technology to EU member states that sell certain items to China. This would prevent U.S. defense exports and advanced military technology from being redirected to China. Restrictions could be imposed through specific conditions in contracts or amendments to the Arms Export Control Act. Additionally, restrictions on U.S. military procurement from EU states could be considered. The United States may impose restrictions on defense industrial cooperation with EU states selling weapons to China, including suspending joint defense projects like the Joint Strike Fighter program.
