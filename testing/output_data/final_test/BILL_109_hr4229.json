    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Plan B for Plan B Act of 2005\". It includes findings. The Food and Drug Administration has deemed Plan B safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy, with a high success rate if taken soon after unprotected intercourse. Manufacturers submitted an application to switch Plan B to over-the-counter status for all ages, and a panel voted in favor of its non-prescription use. The Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B for over-the-counter use for all ages, despite initially deeming the application not approvable. Barr Pharmaceutical supported marketing Plan B as a prescription drug in response to the FDA's decision. The FDA delayed a decision on Plan B application, with a set deadline for action. However, on August 26, 2005, the FDA did not approve or disapprove the application, opting to publish a notice instead. On August 31, 2005, Susan F. Wood resigned from her position at the FDA due to the Administration's refusal to issue a final decision on the Plan B application, citing concerns about overruling scientific and clinical evidence. On September 1, 2005, the FDA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The FDA issued a notice to request comments on potentially codifying the Administration's interpretation of a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which could cause unnecessary delays in the approval process for Plan B to become an over-the-counter drug. The FDA will make a decision on the marketing of emergency contraception. The FDA will approve or disapprove the supplemental new drug application for Plan B within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. If the Commissioner fails to meet the deadline, the application is deemed approved unless stated otherwise in the Federal Register. Definitions include the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and formal response. The term \"formal response\" refers to the July 16, 2003 response supporting the marketing of Plan B as a prescription drug for women 15 years and older and a nonprescription drug for women 16 years and older. \"Plan B\" is defined as 0.75 mg levonorgestrel tablets, and a \"prescription drug\" is subject to section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A \"supplemental new drug application for Plan B\" was submitted on April 21, 2003 by Women's Capital Corporation. Women's Capital Corporation, controlled by Barr Pharmaceuticals, submitted a request to the FDA to make Plan B available without a prescription for all ages. The FDA issued a non-approvable letter to Barr Pharmaceuticals on May 6, 2004."
