Sanctions have negatively impacted U.S. relations with the region, resulting in a decline in military training aid and hindering democracy programs. While most Members of Congress support shielding U.S. citizens from ICC prosecution, there is growing opposition to using sanctions to influence countries. The U.S. aid restrictions on ICC member countries have sparked a policy debate, particularly in Latin America. Some Members of Congress oppose using sanctions to influence countries to sign Article 98 agreements. The issue of aid restrictions is likely to be discussed in the 110th Congress. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first permanent world court with jurisdiction over war crimes and human rights abuses. 104 countries have ratified the Rome Statute to become members of the ICC. The United States does not recognize ICC jurisdiction over its soldiers or civilians. The ICC, based in The Hague, can hear cases referred by the U.N. Security Council or member states, and its prosecutor can initiate investigations. The ICC works with national law enforcement agencies to make arrests and bring defendants to The Hague. The ICC has received referrals from state parties and the U.N. Security Council, leading to investigations and arrest warrants issued for individuals involved in cases in Northern Uganda and Darfur, Sudan. Analysts suggest that the Bush Administration's opposition to the ICC has softened, especially since allowing the referral of the Darfur situation to the ICC in 2005. The U.S. government fully supports bringing those responsible for crimes in Darfur to justice through the ICC. Despite initial objections to the court, there are doubts about a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the ICC. The U.S. aims to protect its military and civilians from ICC prosecution. The United States objects to the Rome Statute due to concerns about ICC jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers and civilians. They seek immunity provisions through the U.N. Security Council and bilateral agreements with ICC parties to prevent extradition to the ICC. The Bush Administration has pursued \"Article 98 agreements\" since 2003, with Angola being the 100th country to sign such an agreement in 2005. The United States has not publicly announced any new Article 98 agreements since 2005, but more may have been made. These agreements involve states promising not to surrender each other's citizens to the ICC without prior agreement. Supporters compare them to SOFAs for protecting soldiers abroad. Critics see them as unnecessary and accuse the U.S. of pressuring developing countries into signing. The U.S. has agreements with fifteen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with thirteen in force. Table 1 shows the status of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean regarding the ICC and Article 98 agreements. Countries subject to sanctions are those that are ICC parties without an Article 98 agreement with the US. Argentina is exempt due to its \"major non-Nato ally\" status. Bolivia initially had a waiver but it expired in 2004. Most Article 98 agreements in the region were signed in 2003. In 2003, only four additional countries in Latin America and the Caribbean signed Article 98 agreements. Some countries opposed U.S. efforts, citing concerns about sovereignty. Politicians accused the U.S. of blackmailing governments into agreements. The campaign was unpopular in South America, where citizens support accountability and international law. Mexico ratified the Rome Statute in October 2005, despite potential consequences from the U.S. The United States is considering cutting military and economic assistance to countries that do not have Article 98 agreements with them. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act prohibits military aid to such countries, leading to potential consequences for Mexico and Chile. The ASPA terminated military assistance to countries without Article 98 agreements, exempting NATO allies. The President can waive aid restrictions if in the national interest. The Nethercutt Amendment prohibited ESF assistance to non-compliant countries. The Nethercutt Amendment exempts NATO members and major non-NATO allies from aid restrictions. The President can waive economic assistance prohibitions for selected countries without prior notice to Congress if deemed important to national interest. Countries eligible for Millennium Challenge Account grants will not lose eligibility due to Article 98 issues. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act re-enacted the Nethercutt Amendment, requiring the President to notify Congress before invoking a waiver for any country deemed of strategic interest to the United States. The FY2007 Defense Authorization modified ASPA to end the ban on IMET assistance to ICC member countries without Article 98 agreements. The President signed the bill into law on October 17, 2006. The FY2007 Defense Authorization modified ASPA to end the ban on IMET assistance to ICC member countries without Article 98 agreements. The President signed the bill into law, P.L. 109-364, on October 17. Restrictions on Foreign Military Financing (FMF) remain in place under ASPA. Another bill introduced during the 109th Congress, H.R. 5995 (Engel), aimed to lift all restrictions on U.S. aid to ICC member countries without Article 98 agreements, requiring the repeal of ASPA and the Nethercutt Amendment. These laws have impacted U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. In FY2003, the United States provided $4.65 million in IMET training to 12 countries sanctioned by ASPA. In FY2004, aside from Bolivia, none of those countries participated in IMET due to ASPA-related sanctions, resulting in a loss of $1.9 million in FY2005. Some countries experienced acute aid cuts, including Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, due to FMF cutbacks totaling $4.4 million. In FY2004, the United States provided economic aid through the security-related ESF program to strategic countries of interest, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. Funding decisions are made by the State Department, with programs managed by USAID and the State Department. 11 Latin American countries have received ESF funding in recent years. In FY2004, ESF assistance totaling $42.6 million was provided to countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru for democracy, rule of law, and economic growth programs. Policy debates arose due to ASPA-mandated aid restrictions, leading to shifts in U.S. security cooperation in Latin America. The Bush Administration was divided on continuing to link U.S. assistance to Article 98 agreements in 2006. The Bush Administration was divided on continuing to link U.S. assistance to Article 98 agreements. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that invoking ASPA sanctions on key U.S. military allies may be counterproductive, and waivers of military aid restrictions are being considered on a case-by-case basis. The Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense Review suggested a possible de-linking of military training programs from ASPA. Adolfo Franco of the U.S. Agency for International Development hinted at the potential lifting of ICC-related sanctions against Latin American countries. The Administration was considering lifting sanctions on Latin American countries affected by Article 98, with debates on improving U.S. relations in the region. A Senate hearing expressed concerns about missing diplomatic opportunities due to ASPA sanctions. The Senate hearing focused on the political and military effects of ASPA and Nethercutt sanctions in Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the potential loss of U.S. diplomatic influence in the region. Analysts warned that the reduction of IMET opportunities could lead countries to seek military training from China, Russia, or Venezuela. ESF restrictions were seen as hindering structural reforms in Andean countries and damaging U.S. standing in the region. The effort to punish countries for not signing Article 98 agreements was perceived as bullying. The witnesses suggested ways to mitigate negative consequences of ASPA on Latin America and the Caribbean, such as encouraging national interest waivers or declaring more countries as major non-NATO allies. General Bantz Craddock highlighted the unintended consequences of ASPA, stating that without IMET funding, countries couldn't afford courses in the U.S. General Bantz Craddock and Senator John McCain expressed concerns about the negative impact of ASPA sanctions on military aid programs in Latin America. Senator McCain emphasized the high cost of unsubsidized courses in the U.S., hindering long-term relationships with future leaders. Other senators also echoed worries about military aid cuts. Representative Dan Burton urged the Bush Administration to reconsider ASPA sanctions due to concerns about China's influence in the region. By fall 2006, waivers were being considered to lift restrictions on FY2006 IMET and ESF. In 2006, the Bush Administration waived restrictions on FY2006 IMET and ESF funds for several countries, including Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay. President Bush also waived Nethercutt restrictions on FY2006 ESF assistance for Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Ecuador, Kenya, Mali, Mexico, Namibia, Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Samoa, South Africa, and Tanzania. The 109th Congress took action to end the ban on IMET restrictions but left Nethercutt aid restrictions in place. The Senate unanimously consented to a conference report on the FY2007 Defense Authorization bill, which was signed into law on October 17, 2006. The agreement modified ASPA to end the ban on IMET assistance to ICC member countries without Article 98 agreements. FMF restrictions remain in place, and the issue of aid restrictions related to the ICC is likely to be considered in the 110th Congress."
