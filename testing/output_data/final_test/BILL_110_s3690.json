    "content": "The \"Homeowner Assistance and Taxpayer Protection Act\" requires restructuring loans owned by the government, including mortgages acquired and held by federal property managers, as outlined in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. SEC. 102 requires lenders to participate in the Hope for Homeowners program when homeowners elect to participate. SEC. 103 aims to help families save their homes in bankruptcy. The text discusses amendments to Section 1322(b) of title 11, United States Code, allowing modification of secured claims on the debtor's principal residence in bankruptcy. The debtor must have insufficient income to retain possession of their residence by curing a default and maintaining payments while the case is pending. They must provide for payment of the secured claim equal to the allowed amount, for a period not exceeding 40 years, at a fixed annual interest rate. The annual interest rate for secured claims in bankruptcy cases is based on the Federal Reserve's published mortgage yield, with a risk premium. A conforming amendment is made to section 1325(a)(5) of title 11, and a waiver of counseling requirement is added for homes in foreclosure under section 109(h) of title 11. The debtor is exempt from certain requirements if they certify a foreclosure sale of their principal residence. Additionally, the debtor is not liable for any fees related to a claim secured by their principal residence during the bankruptcy case. The debtor is exempt from fees related to a claim secured by their principal residence during bankruptcy, unless notice is filed with the court and served on the debtor and trustee within a specified timeframe, and the fees are lawful and reasonable. Failure to provide notice results in a waiver of any claim for fees. The waiver of fees related to a claim secured by the debtor's principal residence during bankruptcy is emphasized, with any attempt to collect such fees considered a violation of specific sections of the law. Additionally, a bankruptcy plan can include the waiver of prepayment penalties on such claims. Amendments are made to prohibit claims arising from violations of consumer protection laws in the bankruptcy process. The amendments to title 11 of the United States Code prohibit claims for damages or rescission based on violations of consumer protection laws in bankruptcy cases. These amendments apply to cases initiated under title 11 on or after the enactment of this Act. TITLE II--PROTECTING TAXPAYERS\n\nSEC. 201.
