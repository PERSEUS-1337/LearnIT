    "content": "The potential for biomass to meet U.S. renewable energy demands is being explored. Non-food and other types of biomass, such as manure, have traditionally been considered waste material. Policy makers are encouraging the conversion of biomass into liquid fuels, electricity, or thermal energy due to high fuel prices, environmental concerns, and sustainability issues. Cellulosic biomass, like crop residues and woody biomass, is gaining interest as it does not directly compete with food production. Biomass is being investigated for additional purposes beyond liquid fuel, such as on-site heating. Biomass, including various organic materials like food crops, wood waste, and animal manure, can be converted into energy for heating, lighting, and electricity. It is considered a renewable resource with potential to produce less greenhouse gas than fossil fuels. Despite challenges like availability and location, biomass is being explored for diverse sources such as algae, construction debris, and food waste. Woody biomass is not readily available year-round, expensive to transport, lacks performance data, and may not meet quality specifications for fueling electric generators. It has potential for energy production through direct burning or conversion to liquid fuels. Forest biomass, with excess hazardous fuels, is of interest for reducing catastrophic wildfires. Biomass, defined as organic matter available on a renewable basis, can be used as a feedstock for energy production. Various laws have provided definitions for biomass, including agricultural crops, wood, animal wastes, and municipal wastes. Woody biomass from forests, with excess hazardous fuels, shows potential for reducing catastrophic wildfires. The laws contain multiple biomass definitions from various acts and the tax code since 2004. These definitions are included in provisions and programs to support research, development, technology transfer, and reduce technology. The laws contain multiple biomass definitions from various acts and the tax code since 2004, which support research, development, technology transfer, and reduce technology costs for landowners and businesses. Two comprehensive definitions for energy production purposes are found in Title IX of the 2008 farm bill and Title II of EISA, each defining renewable biomass slightly differently. Both definitions include crops, crop residues, plants, algae, animal waste, food waste, and yard waste. The 2008 farm bill and EISA have different definitions for renewable biomass, with the former including biomass from federal lands as biofuel feedstock, while the latter excludes biomass removed from federal lands and crops from forested lands. There were discussions in the 113th Congress to expand the EISA definition to include biomass from federal lands for the RFS biofuels mandate, but no legislation was enacted. Advocates and opponents have differing views on the definition of renewable biomass in the 2008 farm bill. Advocates aim to use waste woody biomass from federal lands and other forested lands for renewable energy, while opponents are concerned about potential land disturbance, especially timber harvesting on federal lands. Opponents of using wood waste for renewable energy are concerned about potential land disturbance, wildlife habitats, water quality, and carbon release. Uncertainty exists regarding biomass definitions in the 2008 farm bill and EISA hindering biomass feedstock development. Landowners and businesses entering the biomass feedstock market face challenges such as economic stability, revenue generation, and greenhouse gas emissions. Woody biomass potential varies by region, with biomass stock mainly on private forest land in the southeastern US and federal land. Recent legislation has supported the development of biomass as a renewable energy source, with provisions for Indian tribes to carry out biomass energy projects. However, there are also efforts in Congress to hinder biomass use for energy production, impacting feedstock development. Recent legislation has supported biomass development as a renewable energy source, with provisions for Indian tribes to implement biomass energy projects. However, there have been attempts in Congress to hinder biomass use for energy production, affecting feedstock development. The success of biomass feedstock programs will depend on landowner participation rates and the definition provided in supporting legislation for financial and technical assistance. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) in the 2008 farm bill offers financial and technical support to landowners for biomass feedstock development. The legislation's biomass definition determines eligible material sources and lands for biomass removal, impacting crop choices and locations for bioenergy production. Decisions on crop types, locations, and energy uses are influenced by biomass definitions in legislation. Multiple definitions may be included to meet program requirements. Environmental groups, private entities, and federal agencies closely monitor biomass definitions in Congress. Minimal debate on biomass occurred in the 113th Congress, with bills introduced to modify its definition. In the 113th Congress, there was minimal debate on biomass definitions, with bills introduced to modify its definition. The 114th Congress may further discuss the biomass definition in relation to energy issues like the Renewable Fuel Standard or energy tax incentives."
