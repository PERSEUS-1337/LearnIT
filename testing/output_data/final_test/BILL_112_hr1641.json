The 109th and 110th Congress passed acts prioritizing human space flight goals, focusing on establishing a sustained human presence on the Moon to advance exploration, commerce, science, and U.S. preeminence in space as a stepping stone for future Mars exploration and beyond. The 111th and 112th Congress reaffirmed the commitment to developing a heavy lift capability for space exploration, with a focus on the Moon as a potential destination for sustained human presence and technological advancement. A sustained human presence on the Moon would inspire public interest in space exploration, motivate young people in math and science, challenge American industry to develop technologies, and have significant economic impact through commercial applications of space technologies. The economic impact of space technologies is significant, with products ranging from semiconductors to healthcare technologies like portable x-ray machines and MRIs. Returning to the Moon is crucial for national security, as technologies developed by NASA's human space flight program are important for military applications. China and Russia are advancing their lunar exploration plans with the intention of colonizing the Moon, recognizing the strategic importance of human space flight. The United States must maintain capabilities for unfettered operation in space to prevent ceding the domain to other nations. SEC. 3. MISSION. The United States must maintain capabilities for unfettered operation in space to prevent ceding the domain to other nations. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to return to the Moon by 2022 to develop a sustained human presence, in line with the goals of promoting exploration, commerce, science, and US preeminence in space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration aims to establish a sustained human presence on the Moon to advance exploration, commerce, science, and US space leadership, serving as a stepping stone for future Mars exploration and beyond. The budget of NASA will align with this objective."
