    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs, federal contracting opportunities, disaster recovery loans, and entrepreneurial education. Since 1953, the SBA has provided assistance to small businesses through training programs, initially provided in-house but now increasingly outsourced to third parties. Over 1.2 million entrepreneurs and small business owners receive training from SBA-supported resources. The SBA supports training for entrepreneurs and small business owners through various programs, including financial support for 14,000 resource partners. This includes SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE chapters. The SBA receives an annual appropriation of $247.7 million for programs like management and training, HUBZone administration, and State Trade and Export Promotion. The SBA receives an annual appropriation for programs like SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE chapters. Congress specifies the appropriation amount for SBDCs and the Microloan Technical Assistance Program in its annual appropriation act. The SBA is not legally required to adhere to the recommended amounts but has traditionally done so in the past. The Department of Commerce provides management and technical assistance training for small businesses through programs like the Minority Business Development Agency and the Economic Development Administration's Local Technical Assistance Program. Efforts focus on building local organizational capacity in economically distressed areas by funding projects for feasibility studies and consultation with small businesses. Congressional hearings have highlighted the need to improve program efficiency by eliminating duplication of services. The Obama and Trump Administrations recommended ending the PRIME technical assistance program due to overlap with SBA's microlending intermediaries. The House Committee on Small Business suggested integrating SBA's training programs into the SBDC program or other agencies to avoid duplication. Congress is exploring ways to enhance the measurement of program effectiveness. The report examines federal small business management and technical assistance training programs, their structures, budgets, administration, and oversight. It also discusses legislation such as the RISE After Disaster Act of 2015, which authorizes additional financial assistance for SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE to help small businesses in disaster areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 relaxed requirements for Microloan intermediaries, allowing them to spend up to 50% of grant funds on technical assistance. It also authorized SBDCs to assist small businesses in disaster areas outside their state for up to two years after a presidential declaration. Additionally, the Developing the Next Generation of Small Businesses Act of 2017 is discussed. The Developing the Next Generation of Small Businesses Act of 2017, introduced during the 115th Congress, aimed to enhance entrepreneurial development services by requiring the SBA to use authorized programs like SCORE, WBCs, and SBDCs. It included increased funding for WBCs, raised grant awards, and allowed waivers for nonfederal matching requirements under certain circumstances. Additionally, modifications were made to the SCORE program requirements. The SBA supports various management and technical assistance training programs, including Small Business Development Center Grants Program, Microloan Technical Assistance Program, Women's Business Center Grants Program, Veterans Business Development Programs, SCORE, PRIME Technical Assistance Program, 7(j) Technical Assistance Program, Native American Outreach Program, and other initiatives. The report presents the legislative history, operating structures, functions, and budget for each program. The report presents the budget and performance outcomes of various SBA programs, including the University Business Development Center pilot program established in 1976 to provide counseling and training for small businesses. The SBDC program, authorized by P.L. 96-302 in 1980, relies on the private sector and universities to provide management assistance to small businesses. Funding can be provided to various entities including state governments, regional entities, and institutions of higher education. Funding is allocated among states on a pro rata basis. SBDC funding is allocated among states based on population percentages. If funding exceeds $90 million, the minimum level is $500,000 plus a percentage of the excess amount. In 1984, SBDCs were required to match SBA funding with nonfederal sources, including cash and in-kind contributions. Advisory boards and full-time staff were also mandated. The SBA provides grants to SBDCs hosted by universities, colleges, and state agencies for training small businesses and entrepreneurs. Services are delivered on a nonfee basis through 63 lead service centers across states and territories. SBDCs manage service centers across the US and territories, assisting over 443,000 clients in FY2018. They helped form 14,422 new businesses and received increasing appropriations from $115.0 million in FY2015 to $131.0 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $110.0 million for FY2018 and FY2019. P.L. 114-88 expanded SBDCs' role by authorizing additional financial assistance for up to two years. The SBA's Office of Entrepreneurial Development designed a multi-year study to assess the impact of programs offered to small businesses through SBDCs. The 2014 survey was sent to 70,262 SBDC clients who had received counseling assistance in 2012. The 2014 survey of SBDC clients who received counseling assistance in 2012 showed high satisfaction rates: 90.7% found the services beneficial, 87.8% rated their counselor's knowledge and expertise as excellent or above average, 86.2% reported an excellent or above average working relationship with their counselor, and 94.4% would recommend the SBDC to others. P.L. 114-88 authorizes the SBA to provide additional funding to assist small businesses in disaster areas. The SBDCs can provide assistance to small businesses in presidentially declared disaster areas for up to two years. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress aimed to enhance SBA's entrepreneurial development programs and add SBDC data collection requirements. Similar legislation was also introduced in the 114th Congress. The SBA's Microloan lending program was authorized by Congress in 1991 to help women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs access capital. The program aims to assist small businesses in areas with a lack of credit and make loans to intermediaries for small-scale loans. The SBA's Microloan program provides small-scale loans averaging $10,000 to start-up, growing small businesses for working capital or equipment acquisition. Grants are given to intermediaries for marketing and technical assistance. The program was initially a five-year demonstration project and became permanent with the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The Microloan Technical Assistance Program offers management and technical training to borrowers. The Microloan program provides small loans to small businesses for working capital or equipment acquisition. There are 147 active Microloan intermediaries across 49 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Intermediaries can receive a technical assistance grant of up to 25% of their loan balance. Grant funds are used for marketing, management, and technical assistance for borrowers and prospective borrowers. Intermediaries must contribute 25% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources. The Microloan program provides small loans to small businesses for working capital or equipment acquisition. Intermediaries typically require borrowers to participate in training programs. The Microloan Technical Assistance Program provided counseling services to 21,800 small businesses in FY2018. Funding for the program increased from $22.3 million in FY2015 to $31.0 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $25.0 million for the program in FY2018 and FY2019. The Microloan program requested $25.0 million for FY2018 and FY2019. P.L. 115-141 relaxed requirements for Microloan intermediaries. The Women's Business Center Renewable Grant Program was established by P.L. 100-533 in 1988. The Women's Business Center program was established in 1988 by P.L. 100-533 to provide financial assistance to organizations supporting women-owned businesses. It was later expanded and given permanent legislative status in 2006 by P.L. 109-108. The SBA awards grants of up to $150,000 per year to WBCs, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years. The Women's Business Center program was established in 1988 to provide financial assistance to organizations supporting women-owned businesses. Grants of up to $150,000 per year are awarded to WBCs, with the possibility of renewal for up to five years. The Women's Business Center program provides financial assistance to organizations supporting women-owned businesses. WBCs completing the initial five-year grant period can apply for additional funding intervals with a matching requirement. WBCs assisted over 151,000 clients in FY2018 and helped form 11,687 new businesses. The Women's Business Center program received recommended funding amounts from Congress for FY2015 to FY2019. The SBA is required to conduct annual examinations of each WBC. Data from the SBA's 2014 client survey on WBCs is not yet available. The survey of 2,997 WBC clients showed an 17.7% return rate. 80% found counselor services useful, leading to changes in management practices for 61% of clients. P.L. 114-88 expanded WBC roles to provide financial assistance in disaster areas. H.R. 1774 from the 115th Congress aimed to enhance entrepreneurial development services by requiring the SBA to utilize authorized programs like SCORE, WBCs, and SBDCs. It proposed an increase in funding for WBCs to $21.75 million for FY2018-FY2021, raised the annual grant award to $185,000, and allowed waivers for the nonfederal matching requirement. Similar legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-50) was adopted by Congress to address the diminishing support for veteran-owned small businesses at the SBA. The act emphasized the SBA's responsibility to include veterans in its financial and technical assistance programs, making veterans a target group for various SBA programs. It also required the SBA to collaborate with SCORE for better outreach to veterans. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 mandated the SBA to partner with SCORE and SBDCs to provide counseling, training, and entrepreneurial assistance to veterans, including service-disabled veterans. It also required the SBA to conduct studies, offer training and counseling, assist veterans with procurement opportunities, and provide distance-learning options for veteran entrepreneurs. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) administers management and training programs for veteran-owned businesses, including the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities Consortium of Universities and the Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE) program. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development offers various training programs for veteran-owned businesses, including the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities Consortium of Universities and the Veteran Women Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE) program. Additionally, there are programs like Operation Endure and Grow, Boots to Business, and a 3-day conference that provide training on business planning, marketing, accounting, finance, operations, human resources, and work-life balance. The SBA offers training programs for veteran-owned businesses, including the Entrepreneurship Track Overview, Introduction to Entrepreneurship, and Foundations of Entrepreneurship. The Boots to Business Reboot program assists veterans who have transitioned to civilian life, while the Veterans Business Outreach Centers provide management and technical assistance training at 22 locations.

The SBA has partnered with various organizations to provide management and technical assistance training to small businesses since the 1950s. The SBA has partnered with organizations to provide training to small businesses since the 1950s. In 1964, SCORE was launched as a national volunteer organization with financial assistance from the SBA. Congress has authorized the SBA to take actions related to SCORE, such as allowing nonprofit organizations to use SBA facilities and services. The Small Business Act Amendments of 1967 and subsequent legislation granted the SBA authority to work with SCORE, allowing for travel expenses and expanding expertise beyond SBA clients. SCORE, authorized by the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, receives grants from the SBA to provide mentoring, training workshops, and online resources to small businesses. With 350 chapters and over 800 branch offices across the US, SCORE's network of 11,000 volunteer counselors assisted 686,208 clients in FY2018. SCORE received funding recommendations from Congress for FY2015-FY2019, with the Trump Administration requesting a lower amount for FY2018 and FY2019. A survey in 2014 assessed the effectiveness of SCORE's programs, with a 10.9% return rate from 13,548 surveys sent to clients who received mentoring in FY2013. The 2014 survey of SCORE clients showed that a majority agreed that SCORE was important to their success, helped them change business strategies, add employees, and grow business revenue. P.L. 114-88 expanded SCORE's role by authorizing the SBA to provide additional financial support. H.R. 1774 expanded SCORE's role by authorizing the SBA to provide additional financial assistance to SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE in disaster areas. Legislation introduced during the 115th and 114th Congresses modified SCORE program requirements and added provisions for online counseling. Subtitle C of the 1999 amendment to the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act authorized the SBA to establish a grant program for microenterprise technical assistance and capacity building. The program provides grants to nonprofit organizations delivering microenterprise services to disadvantaged entrepreneurs, intermediaries, microenterprise development organizations working with local communities, and Indian tribes. The SBA ensures that no private organization exists within an Indian tribe's jurisdiction before providing assistance. The SBA was directed to ensure that at least 50% of grants benefit very low-income persons, including those on Indian reservations. The PRIME program provides assistance to organizations helping low-income entrepreneurs. The PRIME program supports organizations assisting low-income entrepreneurs lacking training and education to access capital for their small businesses. Grants include Technical Assistance, Capacity Building, Research and Development, and Discretionary Grants. Awards are given annually with the possibility of up to four years of funding. Award amounts vary. The PRIME program offers grants for up to four years, with award amounts varying. Grantees cannot receive more than $250,000 or 10% of total funds in a fiscal year. Minimum grant for technical assistance is $50,000. Funding is allocated for technical assistance, capacity building, and research. Recipients must match 50% of funding from nonfederal sources. The SBA regulations allow for reductions or eliminations of matching fund requirements for PRIME grants, not exceeding 10% of total funds. The PRIME program has received recommended funding of $5.0 million annually since FY2015, despite past budget requests for its elimination. The Trump Administration proposed no funding for the program in FY2018 and FY2019. The SBA issued regulations in 1970 under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to assist small disadvantaged businesses. In 1978, P.L. 95-507 granted the SBA statutory authority to provide financial and other services to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. The SBA's 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance Program provides counseling and training in various areas to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, including financing, management, accounting, marketing, and identifying new business opportunities. Eligible individuals and businesses include 8(a) certified firms, small disadvantaged businesses, businesses in high unemployment areas, or owned by low-income individuals. The 7(j) program assisted 6,483 small business owners in FY2018 and has received recommended funding of $2.8 million annually since FY2015. The SBA established the Office of Native American Affairs in 1994 to provide management and technical assistance to Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and indigenous people of Guam and American Samoa for government contracting, entrepreneurial education, and capital access. The SBA's Office of Native American Affairs provided assistance to 1,549 small businesses in FY2018, offering workshops, training webinars, and online classes for Native American entrepreneurs. Congress recommended $2.0 million in funding for the Native American Outreach Program annually since FY2015, with the Trump Administration requesting $1.5 million in FY2018 and FY2019. The SBA has recommended appropriations for three Obama Administration management and training initiatives: Entrepreneurial Development Initiative (Regional Innovation Clusters), Entrepreneurial Education, and Growth Accelerators. The agency has supported regional innovation clusters since FY2009, partnering with small business suppliers in robotics in Michigan. Additional clusters were rolled out in FY2010 and FY2011, with funds awarded to 10 clusters in FY2011. In FY2012, these clusters generated $48 million in private capital and $6.5 million in early stage investment. The SBA has received funding for regional innovation clusters from SBIR and STTR awards, as well as federal government contracts. Congress recommended appropriations for the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative in FY2014-2017, but the Trump Administration requested no funds in FY2018 and FY2019. Currently, there are 56 federally supported regional innovation clusters, with the SBA involved in 40 of them. The SBA supports 40 clusters focusing on business development, intellectual property, finance, marketing, and technology commercialization. The Entrepreneurship Education initiative started in 2008 as E200, assisting inner-city small businesses. It was renamed the Emerging Leaders initiative in FY2009 and the Entrepreneurial Education initiative in FY2013. The Entrepreneurial Education initiative, previously known as the Emerging Leaders Initiative, offers a seven-month executive leader education series to high-growth small businesses in underserved communities. Participants receive specialized training, resources, and networking opportunities to strengthen their business model and promote economic development. They also create a strategic growth action plan to access support for business growth. The Entrepreneurial Education initiative, funded by the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurship Education, initially trained 200 small businesses in 10 communities. It has since expanded to 27 communities in FY2012 and received $40.0 million in funding for training in 40 locations in FY2014. Congress included the initiative in its list of SBA programs to be funded for the first time. The Entrepreneurship Education initiative, funded by the SBA's Office of Entrepreneurship Education, received funding recommendations from Congress for FY2014 to FY2019. The program was offered in 60 cities in FY2018, serving over 800 small business owners who met specific criteria. The SBA describes growth accelerators as organizations that assist entrepreneurs in starting and scaling their businesses. Growth accelerators, run by experienced entrepreneurs, help small businesses access capital and mentors to accelerate success. In FY2012, the SBA sponsored meetings with university officials, entrepreneurs, and accelerators to discuss mentoring high-growth entrepreneurs. This culminated in a White House event to formalize the network and provide best practices for engaging universities in innovation and entrepreneurship. In FY2014, the Obama Administration requested $5.0 million for the growth accelerator initiative, but Congress recommended $2.5 million. The funding was intended for matching grants to universities and private sector accelerators to start or scale accelerator programs. The SBA dropped the 4:1 private-sector match requirement to have a larger impact, offering 50 grants of $50,000 each. The SBA announced 50 growth accelerator grants of $50,000 each in 2014, receiving over 800 applications. Congress recommended funding for the program in subsequent years, with matching fund requirements. The Trump Administration requested no funding in FY2018 and FY2019. Additional grants were awarded in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The SBA plans to make Growth Accelerator awards in FY2019 using both the FY2018 and FY2019 funding amounts. The MBDA provides training to minority business owners to assist them in obtaining contracts and financial awards, while the Economic Development Administration's Local Technical Assistance Program promotes efforts to build and expand local organizational capacity in distressed areas. The Executive Order 11625, issued by Richard M. Nixon in 1971, clarified the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to support minority business enterprises. The MBDA received increasing appropriations from FY2015 to FY2019. The Trump Administration proposed reducing funding in FY2018 and FY2019. The MBDA's mission includes training minority business owners to become suppliers to private corporations and the government. The MBDA helps create and retain jobs, assists minority-owned businesses in obtaining contracts and capital awards. The EDA provides financial assistance to economically distressed areas in the US through various programs. The EDA's Local Technical Assistance Program provides grants for economic development projects in distressed areas, focusing on feasibility studies and consultation with small businesses. Funding for the program has varied in recent years, with the Trump Administration proposing to close the EDA. The House Committee on Small Business has raised concerns about the duplication of services within the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs, suggesting that they should be integrated into the SBDC program or taken over by other agencies. The Obama Administration recommended eliminating the PRIME program due to overlap with the SBA's Microloan Technical Assistance Program, and the Trump Administration also suggested cutting the PRIME program, Growth Accelerators Initiative, and Entrepreneurial Development Initiative. The Growth Accelerators Initiative and the Entrepreneurial Development Initiative may be eliminated due to overlap with private-sector mechanisms for local business development. Congress has approved funding for Boots to Business and Boots to Business: Reboot initiatives. The SBA's oversight of WBCs and coordination with SBDCs and SCORE chapters have been assessed by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Based on our review, WBCs lacked guidance from SBA on coordinating efforts with SBDCs and SCORE chapters. WBCs used various methods like MOUs and information-sharing meetings to coordinate, but faced challenges due to similar performance measures and competition among service providers. The SBA's management and technical assistance training programs should be merged to address challenges in the delivery of entrepreneurial services. The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce argues for a restructuring to improve efficiency and coordination among service providers. The SBA's management and technical assistance training programs should be unified into one organization for better coordination and efficiency in delivering entrepreneurial services. Advocates suggest merging them into the SBDC Program due to its broader connections and diverse locations. Separate management and training assistance programs for specific groups are essential to address their unique challenges and needs. For example, women's business centers provide a welcoming environment tailored to the needs of women entrepreneurs, fostering a supportive culture for them to pursue their dreams. The Association of Women's Business Centers' executive director argued for continued and expanded funding for WBCs, highlighting their effectiveness in serving clients and growing programs. They emphasized the satisfaction of clients compared to other entrepreneurial development efforts and called for improved communication and oversight within the SBA. Enhanced coordination and oversight of SBA programs are crucial for maximizing resources and sharing best practices among providers. The House passed the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009, emphasizing the unique mandates and local connections of Entrepreneurial Development programs. Coordination within the network can benefit entrepreneurs and small firms by ensuring efficient use of resources. The Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009 aimed to enhance oversight and coordination of the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs by creating a new online, multilingual distance training program. It required the SBA to coordinate its programs with state and local economic development agencies, report annually to Congress on program coordination, and improve program delivery for federal entrepreneurial development activities. During the 112th Congress, bills like the SUCCESS Act of 2012 and the Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act of 2012 aimed to improve coordination and program delivery for federal entrepreneurial development activities. Discussions also included merging SBA's programs with those offered by other federal agencies. The GAO identified 53 business management and technical assistance programs sponsored by the SBA and other federal agencies, aiming to improve program performance and achieve savings. This was part of routine investigations required by P.L. 111-139 to identify duplicative goals and activities within government departments. The GAO identified 53 business management and technical assistance programs sponsored by the SBA and other federal agencies, questioning the effectiveness of a fragmented system. The House Committee on Small Business suggested consolidating programs to serve entrepreneurs more efficiently and opposed increased funding for management and training initiatives under the Obama Administration. Representative Sam Graves questioned the necessity of SBA's entrepreneurial development initiatives and the need for increased funding, suggesting potential overlap with existing private and public sector efforts. He highlighted the importance of using authorized programs like SCORE, WBCs, and SBDCs for delivering services. The SBA requires authorized entrepreneurial development programs like SCORE, WBCs, and SBDCs to provide quarterly and annual performance reports detailing accomplishments, budget expenditures, client fees, success stories, and economic impact data. The SBA requires authorized entrepreneurial development programs to provide performance reports detailing accomplishments, budget expenditures, client fees, success stories, and economic impact data. Congress has considered expanding outcome-based measures for SBA programs to determine effectiveness. During the 112th and 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to enhance data collection and reporting requirements for the SBA's entrepreneurial development programs, including job creation and program performance data. This would involve issuing annual reports on all entrepreneurial development activities undertaken, detailing program descriptions, operating procedures, grant awards, and lists of awardees, contractors, and vendors. The legislative language reintroduced during the 115th Congress in H.R. 1774, the Developing the Next Generation of Small Businesses Act of 2017, includes requirements for data collection and reporting on small business management and technical assistance training programs. Congressional interest in these programs has grown due to the role of small businesses in job creation and retention during economic recoveries. Effective training programs are seen as crucial for small businesses to lead job creation. Technical assistance training programs are crucial for small businesses to lead job creation and retention during economic recoveries. Small firms generate a significant percentage of new positions and play a vital role in job creation. Investing in America's job creators through programs like SBA's Entrepreneurial Development Programs is essential for helping small firms access capital and grow their businesses. The SBA's Entrepreneurial Development Programs provide crucial management and technical assistance training for small businesses to access capital and grow. These programs offer needed services that are not available elsewhere, helping small businesses increase sales, profits, longevity, and job creation. The goal is to ensure small businesses have the tools and information they need to succeed, whether it's exporting, using broadband, or supporting veteran entrepreneurs. The SBA's Entrepreneurial Development Programs provide essential management and technical assistance training for small businesses to access capital and grow. There is a consensus on the need to make federal programs more effective for small businesses' economic recovery, but there are disagreements on how to achieve this goal. Some suggest increasing funding for existing programs, using outcome-based measures, and temporarily reducing federal matching requirements for the SBA. Some argue for merging existing programs to enhance efficiency and focus resources on SBDCs to better serve all small business groups. Advocates believe this would improve communication and ensure all centers cater to the needs of small business owners. The management and technical assistance training centers aim to serve all small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs, leading to more sustainable funding and standard operating procedures. Opponents argue that merging programs may result in the loss of targeted services for specific constituencies with unique needs."
