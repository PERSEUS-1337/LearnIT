    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"America's Youth Commission Act of 1999\". Congress finds that American youth, up to 18 years old, are the freest, most educated, and most affluent generation in the nation's history. Despite favorable conditions, there are serious flaws in the social fabric leading to destructive behaviors among some youth, hindering their potential contributions to freedom's cause. Youth violence and lack of respect for others in America, highlighted by incidents in various cities, reveal destructive behaviors among some youth. School pranks and high levels of alcohol and drug use, often combined with gun violence, further hinder the potential contributions of this generation. The media in America exposes youth to high levels of violence and degrading content, leading to a \"culture of death\" that influences their behavior. The structure of family, neighborhoods, work, and community has also undergone significant changes in the United States. The community in the United States has transformed in the last 30 years due to economic growth, impacting families' aspirations and livelihoods. Factors like static purchasing power, mergers, production dislocation, higher family mobility, rising foster children levels, and suburbanization have led to a more fluid social structure. This has resulted in less continuity for youth in nurturing relationships with family and community. The social consequences of these changes, along with the pervasive influence of media, highlight the need for attention towards developmental attachments by adults towards youth, which have become more fragile in today's society. Establishment of the National Commission on the Impact of United States Culture on America's Youth (referred to as the \"Commission\") with the duty to assess the influence of American culture on youth. The Commission will investigate the condition of contemporary youth in America compared to prior generations, focusing on family, neighborhood, schools, work, and community involvement. It will also analyze the origins and trends of antisocial and violent behavior among American youth, including the influence of organizations and cultural elements. Additionally, the Commission will identify successful initiatives that involve youth in positive development to curb antisocial behavior. The Commission will investigate antisocial behavior among American youth and provide recommendations for averting and reducing violence. Recommendations will be given to parents, families, organizations, and authorities to build positive developmental experiences for youth.
