    "content": "The Act titled \"Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act\" defines terms like Federal land, Non-federal land, Map, and Post related to land parcels in Jackson County, Mississippi. The Act defines terms like \"Post\" as Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699 and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. It allows the Secretary to exchange Federal land with the Post for non-Federal land of equal value, determined by an independent appraiser. The Secretary can exchange Federal land with the Post for non-Federal land of equal value, as determined by an independent appraiser. If the values are not equal, they can be equalized through cash payment or adjustments to acreage. The Post must pay for survey costs, environmental documentation, and other administrative costs related to the land exchange. The Secretary will refund any excess amount paid by the Post if the actual costs of the land exchange are less than the amount collected. Amounts received from the Post for reimbursement will be credited to the fund used for the exchange costs. Under subparagraph (A), amounts were credited and are available for the same purposes and conditions as the fund or account to which they were credited. The exact acreage and legal description of Federal and non-Federal land for exchange will be determined by satisfactory surveys. The exchange will be carried out through a quitclaim deed or other legal instrument, subject to mutually satisfactory terms and conditions. The exchange of Federal and non-Federal land authorized under this section is subject to valid existing rights and title approval by the Secretary. Any non-Federal land acquired will be administered as part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, and the boundary will be modified accordingly. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
