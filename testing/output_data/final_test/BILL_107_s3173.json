The \"Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide Act of 2002\" amends the United States Code to provide health insurance for non-Federal employees through the Office of Personnel Management. The program is administered in accordance with defined terms and regulations under chapter 89. The \"Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide Act of 2002\" establishes health insurance for non-Federal employees through the Office of Personnel Management. The program ensures no increase in contributions or decrease in benefits under chapter 89, with methods for enrollment and contract requirements. The \"Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide Act of 2002\" mandates that carriers offer the same benefits to eligible individuals as to employees, annuitants, and family members. The Office may waive requirements if a carrier faces limitations in delivering services, lacks state licensing, or has enrollment restrictions. The \"Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide Act of 2002\" allows waivers for carriers facing limitations in offering health benefits plans due to enrollment restrictions. Carriers must submit a petition detailing their efforts and proposed date for offering the plan. Waivers can be granted for any period determined by the Office. Eligibility for enrollment in a plan under this act is outlined in section 9054. Sec. 9054 outlines eligibility for enrollment in a health benefits plan under the \"Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide Act of 2002.\" Individuals can enroll unless they are already enrolled in a plan under chapter 89. Sec. 9055 discusses alternative conditions for enrollment, including the treatment of individuals with previous health insurance coverage and the administration of separate risk pools for individuals under this chapter and chapter 89. Each contract may include a preexisting condition exclusion. The preexisting condition exclusion under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows coverage to begin within 1 year of enrollment, with adjustments for prior coverage. A lapse of up to 63 days before enrollment is not considered a break in continuous coverage. Rates for health benefits plans under this chapter may differ from those offered under other plans. Rates and premiums for health benefits plans under this chapter are negotiated similarly to those under chapter 89 and adjusted for administrative costs. Age may be a factor in determining rates, and incentives for longevity of coverage are provided. No government contribution is made for covered individuals. Reenrollment after termination is only allowed after 6 months. Coordination with social security benefits is also addressed. Benefits under this chapter are offered to individuals entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act, in coordination with social security benefits, similar to coverage under chapter 89. Non-Federal employer participation defines terms like 'employee', 'non-Federal employer', and 'total premium amount' for health benefits plans. The Office will regulate non-Federal employer participation in offering health benefits plans to employees. Employers must contribute to employee premiums based on the number of employees. Employers with 2 or fewer employees are not required to contribute, while those with more than 2 employees must make contributions. Non-Federal employers must contribute to employee health plan premiums based on the number of employees. The contribution percentages vary depending on the number of employees, with a minimum contribution required for employers with more than 2 employees. Participating employers must ensure that eligible full-time employees can enroll in a health plan. Each eligible full-time employee may enroll in a plan under this chapter. Participating non-Federal employers cannot offer a health insurance plan to employees unless it is continuously offered after the enactment of this chapter. If coverage is offered under this chapter and another plan, all employees must be treated equally, and financial incentives cannot be used to encourage enrollment in the non-chapter plan. Section 3 of the Act introduces technical and conforming amendments related to health benefits plans for non-Federal employees. It mandates that contracts under this chapter must include a provision for carriers to offer required health benefits plans. Additionally, a new chapter 90A for Health Insurance for Non-Federal Employees is added to the table of chapters. Section 4 states that the Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment and apply to contracts starting from 2003 and onwards."
