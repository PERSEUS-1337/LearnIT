    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 17406 of the Education Code in California is being amended. Section 17406 of the Education Code in California allows the governing board of a school district to lease real property without bidding, for a minimum rental of $1 a year, to construct buildings for the school district. The building's title will vest in the school district at the end of the lease, with terms determined by the governing board. For public projects in California, including school district buildings, contractors must meet prequalification requirements outlined in the Public Contract Code, submitting a verified financial statement and questionnaire. Section 17407 of the Education Code is amended to require adequate consideration for rental property leases, in compliance with the California Constitution. This amendment is effective until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute. The governing board of a school district may enter into an agreement with a person, firm, or corporation to construct a building on a designated site and lease it to the school district. The title to the building and site will vest in the school district at the end of the lease, with provisions for earlier transfer if needed. The governing board of a school district may enter into an agreement with the lowest responsible bidder for construction, requiring security. Bids must be published in a newspaper for two weeks before opening. The agreement for a public project must include prequalification requirements for prospective bidders. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute. Section 17407.5 of the Education Code prohibits school districts from entering agreements with entities unless they commit to using skilled and trained workers for projects in apprenticeable occupations in the building and construction trades. This includes subcontractors at every tier. The definition of \"apprenticeable occupation\" is provided in the section. (3) \"Skilled and trained workforce\" refers to workers who are skilled journeypersons or apprentices in an approved apprenticeship program. At least 30% of skilled journeypersons must be apprenticeship program graduates for the applicable occupation. As of January 1, 2017, 40% of skilled journeypersons must be apprenticeship program graduates, increasing to 50% by January 1, 2018, for work on the contract or project by the entity and its subcontractors at every tier. As of January 1, 2019, 60% of skilled journeypersons on the contract must be apprenticeship program graduates approved by the chief or federal Secretary of Labor. For occupations without approved programs before 1995, up to half of the graduation percentage can be met by journeypersons who started before program approval in the project county. A \"skilled journeyperson\" is defined as a worker who has graduated from an approved apprenticeship program or has equivalent on-the-job experience. The commitment to using a skilled and trained workforce for a project can be established in various ways. The entity must agree to comply with the requirements and provide monthly reports to the school district. Failure to do so will result in the school district ceasing payments. The entity must comply with the requirements and provide monthly reports to the school district, which will be public records open to inspection. If the school district has a project labor agreement, the entity must become a party to it. The entity must also provide evidence of the agreement binding all subcontractors. Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code applies to public projects funded by the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act or state school bonds over $1 million. The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act and state school bonds over $1 million are subject to Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code. If a school district enters into a construction contract, prospective bidders must submit a prequalification questionnaire and financial statement verified under oath. The governing board must adopt a rating system for bidders based on these documents. The standardized questionnaire and financial statement for bidders must cover the same issues as the Department of Industrial Relations guidelines. Prospective bidders must use a standardized proposal form provided by the school district for their bids. Bids not using the provided form will be disregarded. The proposal form required for submission must not be accepted from entities that are required to prequalify or use subcontractors that are not prequalified at least 10 business days before the bid opening. The school district may require the submission of prequalification documents earlier than 10 business days before the bid opening. The governing board of the school district may establish a process for prequalifying prospective bidders on a quarterly or annual basis, valid for one calendar year. This process includes prequalifying contractors for building construction projects. The governing board of the school district can prequalify or disqualify subcontractors for specialty classifications. Bidders must include prime contractors and specific subcontractors like electrical, mechanical, and plumbing contractors. (j) A list of prequalified general contractors and electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors must be provided by the school district to bidders before the public opening of sealed bids. The list may be required to be available more than five business days before the bid opening. \n(k) Electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractors are contractors licensed under specific codes outlined by the Contractors\u2019 State License Board. The section applies to contracts awarded on or after specific dates. The Director of Industrial Relations must submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018, evaluating violations of the Labor Code on school district projects and recommending improvements to the prequalification system for contractors and subcontractors. The section will be inactive starting January 1, 2019, and will be repealed by July 1, 2019."
