    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bombing Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that the number of criminal bombing incidents in the United States has doubled since 1988, with hundreds of millions of pounds of explosives purchased without permits. One-third of bombs used in crimes contain black powder or smokeless powder. Recent terrorist attacks like the World Trade Center bombing demonstrate the grave dangers of bomb attacks. Effective regulation of interstate commerce in explosives is necessary, requiring changes in the regulatory framework. The Congress recognizes the increase in criminal bombing incidents in the United States since 1988, with a significant amount of explosives being purchased without permits. The protection of citizen safety and infrastructure necessitates stricter regulation of explosives transactions due to the diverse substances involved and their impact on interstate and foreign commerce. SEC. 3. PERMITS FOR PURCHASE OF EXPLOSIVES. Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to regulate the transportation, distribution, and receipt of explosive materials in interstate or foreign commerce. The amendments apply to conduct engaged in after an 18-month period. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue final regulations within 6 months of the enactment of the Act regarding the amendments to explosive materials laws. States will be notified of the regulations to consider revising their own laws. SEC. 4 amends Section 843(a) of title 18, United States Code, by adding requirements for license applicants and setting fees for licenses and permits. SEC. 5 addresses the use of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for investigating applicants. The Secretary of the Treasury can use the national instant criminal background check system to investigate license or permit applicants under chapter 40 of title 18, United States Code. Requirements for purchasing black powder and smokeless powder are also outlined. SEC. 6 amends Section 845 of title 18, United States Code, regarding the purchase of black powder and smokeless powder. The amendment includes limitations on quantities for commercially manufactured black powder and smokeless powder. SEC. 7 introduces enhanced penalties. SEC. 7 of the bill mandates the United States Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for violations of certain provisions in title 18 of the United States Code. SEC. 8 of the bill introduces civil and criminal forfeiture of property involved in explosives offenses under chapter 40 of title 18, United States Code. This includes property used in violations or conspiracies related to the importation, manufacture, distribution, and storage of explosive materials."
