    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Partnering to Detect and Defeat Tunnels Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that tunnels have been used for centuries worldwide to avoid detection or circumvent defenses, including for criminal activities like smuggling drugs, weapons, and humans, as well as for terrorist or military purposes such as surprise attacks or detonating explosives. The Department of Homeland Security has been addressing the growing threat of tunnels on the southern border of the United States. Terrorists have been actively using tunnels for attacks, as seen in the conflict in Gaza in 2014 and reports from Syria. Terrorist organizations are adopting successful tactics like using tunnels, posing a threat to the United States and its allies. Congress believes it is crucial to develop technology to detect and counter tunnels, partnering with affected countries. Israel, facing serious tunnel threats, should be the first partner in addressing this challenge. Development of tunnel detection technology is crucial to counter the threat posed by terrorist organizations using tunnels. Israel, facing serious tunnel threats, should be the first partner in addressing this challenge. The Secretary of Defense aims to partner with Israel and other allies to develop and deploy tunnel detection technologies through agreements for research, testing, and operational activities. The Secretary of Defense plans to partner with allies to develop tunnel detection technologies. The lead agency for this initiative will be designated by the Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Director of National Intelligence will appoint a senior intelligence officer to manage intelligence on tunnel use. Annual reports on progress will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress on instances of tunnel attacks, trends worldwide, technologies used by adversaries, Defense Department capabilities, partnerships with allies for tunnel detection, and funding plans. The Secretary of Defense will report to Congress on tunnel threats and funding plans for countering them, including appropriations for research, development, and security programs."
