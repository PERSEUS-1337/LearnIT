    "content": "Absentee voting is on the rise in the United States, especially on the west coast where Oregon conducts elections by mail and Washington state sees most ballots cast absentee. California has also seen a steady increase in absentee ballots, reaching about one-third of all ballots in 2004. In addition to these states, 25 others allow \"no-excuse\" absentee voting, and some states even permit permanent absentee voter registration. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 allows military personnel, their spouses, U.S. citizens abroad to vote absentee in federal elections. The trend towards absentee voting is increasing in the United States, with various state laws and the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act allowing more voters to cast their ballots remotely. Critics raise concerns about fraud and lack of polling place safeguards for absentee voting. Despite these concerns, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) has limited provisions related to absentee voting. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) has limited provisions related to absentee voting, with most pertaining to military and overseas voters. Several bills aimed to increase absentee voting by eliminating restrictions and requiring states to permit any eligible voter to vote absentee. Some bills also focused on specific provisions such as accepting absentee ballots with insufficient postage and establishing standards for fraud prevention. Several bills aimed to increase absentee voting by eliminating restrictions and requiring states to permit any eligible voter to vote absentee. H.R. 3094 required the EAC to establish best practice guidelines for treatment of absentee ballots of military and overseas voters. S. 414 required that voter rolls at polling places indicate which voters have requested or submitted an absentee ballot. H.R. 533, H.R. 939, H.R. 4141, S. 17, and S. 450 would have permitted all absentee ballots to be accepted for at least 10 days following the election. S. 4018 would have established a grant program to assist states in replacing polling-place voting with vote-by-mail, delineated required procedures, and required the EAC to develop best practices and provide technical assistance. HAVA requires voting systems to be accessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility. It mandates at least one accessible system in each polling place starting in 2006 and fully accessible systems purchased with HAVA funds starting in 2007. DREs can provide improved accessibility through features like magnified ballots, audio ballots, and special interfaces for physically challenged voters. Some argue that paper-based systems can be made sufficiently accessible, either electronically or mechanically, as an alternative to controversial DREs for addressing accessibility needs. Others believe that the risks associated with DREs can be managed through administrative measures. Three bills required HAVA accessibility requirements to be met through modular voting architecture. H.R. 550, H.R. 939, and S. 450 mandated voting systems for disability access to separate vote functions and provide verification options on paper or other mediums. States were required to train election officials on assisting disabled voters, and the EAC to develop best practices for voter verification. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires voting systems to provide alternative-language accessibility, in accordance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Legislation such as H.R. 9 and S. 2703 have reauthorized these provisions, while bills like H.R. 550 and H.R. 997 address voter verification and official government functions in English. H.R. 4408 and S. 3828 aimed to eliminate Voting Rights Act requirements for providing voting materials in languages other than English. Controversy arose in 2004 over Diebold Corporation's CEO's commitment to deliver Ohio for President Bush, raising concerns about partisan conflicts of interest. Election-reform advocates have long voiced concerns about potential biases and business relationships among vendors, election officials, and testing laboratories. Some advocates propose government or nonprofit laboratories for certification of voting systems to address conflicts of interest, while others believe no additional measures are necessary. Several bills, such as H.R. 470 and H.R. 3094, aimed to establish standards for conflicts of interest by certification laboratories and manufacturers, including software manufacturers and prohibiting partisan political activities. H.R. 470 and H.R. 3094 aimed to establish standards for conflicts of interest by certification laboratories and manufacturers, including software manufacturers, and prohibiting partisan political activities. H.R. 533 prohibited conflict of interest more broadly, including entities involved with voting machines, under EAC standards. H.R. 939 and S. 450 prohibited officers of voting system companies from participating in prohibited political activities in any election where their system is used. Early voting allows voting before election day, usually in person, while absentee voting involves mail-in ballots. Early voting, implemented in Texas in 1963, is growing in popularity with 23 states offering it in 2004 compared to 13 in 2000. Voters can cast ballots at various locations before election day, with varying days and hours. Critics argue that early voting can distort the electoral process and be susceptible to fraud. One drawback is that early voters may miss out on late campaign developments. Early voting, growing in popularity with 23 states offering it in 2004 compared to 13 in 2000, allows voters to cast ballots before election day. Critics argue it can distort the electoral process and be susceptible to fraud. Maryland's early voting law was rejected by a Court of Appeals ruling, citing the need to amend the Constitution. Despite controversies, the trend of states offering early voting is increasing. The trend of states offering early voting is increasing. Various bills such as H.R. 533, H.R. 939, H.R. 3557, S. 17, and S. 450 aimed to mandate early voting implementation. H.R. 2104 allowed states to permit early voting at local jurisdictions. S. 414 proposed indicating voter participation on polling place rolls. Calls have been made to abolish the EAC after HAVA payments end, transferring voting system guidelines to NIST. The bills H.R. 533, H.R. 939, H.R. 3557, S. 17, and S. 450 aimed to provide funding and rulemaking authority to the EAC. H.R. 550 offered permanent authorization without specifying funding levels. H.R. 533 and S. 17 authorized $23 million, while H.R. 939 and S. 450 authorized $35 million for FY2006 and beyond. These bills exempted the EAC from the Paperwork Reduction Act, required budget estimates to be sent to the White House and Congress, and mandated NIST to provide technical support. H.R. 939 and S. 450 also allocated $4 million for technical support and authorized an additional $20 million for recounts, voter-verification systems, and security for FY2006-10. H.R. 939 and S. 450 would repeal the HAVA prohibition on EAC rulemaking, while H.R. 533 and S. 17 would provide rulemaking authority. Acts of deception during elections, such as voter registration application discarding and misinformation, are prohibited by federal law, but certain actions are not expressly forbidden. Some states have made certain election practices illegal, while federal bills like H.R. 533, H.R. 939, H.R. 3094, H.R. 4463, S. 450, S. 1975, and S. 4069 aim to prevent deception in elections and impose penalties for violations. The federal bills, such as S. 414 and S. 4034, aim to address election irregularities by criminalizing actions like destruction of property and tampering with voting systems. Vote-buying is also prohibited under federal law. Some suggest holding elections on weekends to increase voter turnout. Opponents argue against making election day a federal holiday, citing existing alternatives like early and \"no-excuse\" absentee voting. Various bills have proposed different approaches, including changing election day to the first consecutive Saturday and Sunday in November. S. 144 proposed changing election day to the first consecutive Saturday and Sunday in November, addressing the lack of consistent election data across states. Some jurisdictions only report the number of votes for each candidate, making it difficult to track residual votes. HAVA mandates the EAC to be a national resource for election information but does not require specific data collection. The EAC has developed an election-day survey for standardizing data collection by states and jurisdictions. H.R. 939 and S. 450 require reporting of election data to the EAC within six months, with a report to Congress within nine months. Reform proposals for the electoral college system are common, with several bills introduced in the 109th Congress. Several reform proposals for the Electoral College were introduced in the 109th Congress, including bills that would change the date for the meeting of electors and require certificates of ascertainment to be sent by expedited methods. Additionally, some bills aimed to abolish the Electoral College and establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President. H.J.Res. 36 proposed limiting direct election to cases where the winner receives a majority of votes cast. HAVA provides methods for enforcing compliance, including civil action by the U.S. Attorney General and state grievance procedures. There is debate over individuals' right to federal court action for alleged violations. H.R. 470 aimed to require polling places to post notice of state complaint procedures and limit eligibility for filing complaints about voting machines. H.R. 550 and H.R. 2250 aimed to enforce HAVA requirements by allowing individuals to file complaints with the U.S. Attorney General and initiating investigations of voting irregularities. The bills also granted the EAC authority to conduct audits and impose penalties for violations. Only U.S. citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia are eligible to vote in presidential elections. Residents of commonwealths, territories, and the District of Columbia are not eligible to vote in presidential elections or have voting representatives in Congress. Various bills in the 109th Congress proposed extending voting rights to these groups, including H.J.Res. 1, H.J.Res. 17, H.R. 190, H.R. 398, H.R. 5410, S. 195, H.R. 2043, and H.R. 5388. These bills aimed to grant voting rights for President, Vice President, and congressional elections to these regions. H.R. 873 provided for a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. HAVA contains deadlines for state and local jurisdictions to comply with requirements in the act, including provisional voting, voter information, and voter identification requirements. Implementation of these requirements appears to have been successful. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) includes deadlines for state and local jurisdictions to comply with various requirements such as provisional voting, voter information, and voter identification. Concerns have been raised about meeting the deadline for requirements like computerized statewide registration lists and fully accessible voting systems. The EAC has determined that lever machines cannot meet HAVA's auditability requirements. Additional voting system requirements for full accessibility have been added for systems purchased with funds under title II after 2007. The aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita created challenges for Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in meeting HAVA requirements. States struggled with displaced voters, damaged voting equipment, and recruiting poll workers. Some HAVA funds were used for recovery efforts instead of meeting the law's requirements. Three bills (H.R. 3734, H.R. 4197, and S. 1867) allowed displaced victims of Hurricane Katrina to vote under UOCAVA in federal elections from 2006 to 2008. H.R. 4197 proposed $50 million in FY2006 for EAC grants to replace equipment damaged by the hurricane. S. 2166 also covered restoring and replacing records for absentee voting and registration for military and overseas voters. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) has seen incremental adjustments in recent years, including allowing a single absentee application for multiple federal elections and extending the period covered by a single application. These changes aim to address challenges faced by military and overseas voters in voting absentee. Efforts to improve the efficiency of UOCAVA's performance, including provisions in bills like S. 2507, S. 2766, S. 2767, and H.R. 5122 (P.L. 109-364) for military and overseas voting, continued the Interim Voting Assistance System (IVAS) for military voters through the 2006 elections. Reports on IVAS and efforts to utilize electronic methods for registration and voting were required. The 2004 federal election had a high number of observers, including some from the OSCE invited by the U.S. State Department. The OSCE was invited by the U.S. State Department to observe the 2004 federal election. State laws vary on observer access, with some proposing steps to ensure nonpartisan observers can observe elections. Bills like H.R. 533 and S. 17 required states to allow access for specified classes of observers. HAVA authorized payments to states to meet election requirements. HAVA authorized payments to states for election requirements, including $650 million for voting equipment and administration. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of funding, with some arguing it's insufficient. Critics also claim ongoing costs could burden state and local jurisdictions without continued federal funding. The proposed bills, H.R. 533, S. 17, H.R. 939, H.R. 3557, and H.R. 550, aim to provide federal funding to states to meet HAVA requirements for election administration. H.R. 939 specifically authorizes $3 billion for FY2006 and ongoing payments, including $500 million for voter-verification and audit-capacity requirements. States would be required to establish procedures for fund disbursement. H.R. 939 and S. 450 had provisions for federal funding to meet HAVA requirements for election administration. H.R. 939 required immediate disbursement of payments to local jurisdictions, while S. 450 did not have this requirement. H.R. 5777 prohibited the use of HAVA payments for political purposes, and H.R. 6363 ensured Puerto Rico received equal treatment for HAVA payments. In 2004, controversy arose over state elected officials' activities related to elections, including official actions and conflicts of interest. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires each state to have a chief state election official, usually the secretary of state, who is a partisan office. Some states appoint this official through a bipartisan board. Arizona, California, and Ohio considered legislation in 2006 to regulate political activities of state or local officials. In 2006, legislation was introduced to regulate the political activities of state or local officials with election responsibilities. H.R. 834, H.R. 939, S. 391, and S. 450 prohibited chief state election officials from participating in campaigning for federal elections they oversee. The issue of long lines at polling places in 2004 raised concerns about voting system distribution and pollworker efficiency. Some states are exploring innovations like \"vote centers\" to reduce wait times on election day. Advocates of early and no-fault absentee voting argue that it can help ease waits on election day. Legislation such as H.R. 533 and S. 17 required states to follow standards set by the EAC for voting systems and pollworkers at polling places. H.R. 939 and S. 450 mandated states to provide a minimum number of voting systems, pollworkers, and resources at each voting site to ensure wait times of one hour or less, with flexibility for unforeseen circumstances. The EAC would establish remedial plans for jurisdictions where a significant number of voters experienced long waits. H.R. 4989 required states to follow specific standards for polling places, pollworkers, and voting stations to reduce wait times. It also directed the EAC to develop guidance, provided for enforcement through a private right of action, and allocated $50 million for implementation. Additionally, the bill aimed to study alternative methods for obtaining pollworkers, as many are volunteers with minimal training and compensation for long workdays. Many pollworkers have little training and are often retired, not technologically proficient, and work long hours. There are staffing problems in lower-income jurisdictions. HAVA established programs to recruit college and high school students as pollworkers. Research shows inadequate training for pollworkers. Legislation like H.R. 533, H.R. 939, and S. 450 aim to improve pollworker training. Pollworkers receive training on specified topics no earlier than three months before the election. H.R. 2250 required states to certify pollworker training programs and provide necessary funds. In the United States, officials are mostly chosen through single member, plurality elections. Parliamentary elections use proportional systems. Proportional representation has been used at the local level in the U.S. for electing multiple representatives. Cumulative voting allows voters to split their votes. The curr_chunk discusses alternative voting methods such as cumulative voting and instant-runoff elections. It mentions that federal law does not allow proportional representation for House seats but proposes H.R. 2690 to permit multiseat districts and proportional voting. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of instant-runoff voting and proportional representation in federal contests. It also mentions the establishment of a commission to explore alternative methods of electing Members of the House. Additionally, it highlights the provisions of HAVA regarding provisional ballots and free access systems for voters. The curr_chunk discusses the controversy surrounding the provisional ballot requirement under HAVA, which varies in implementation across states and can impact close contests. Provisional balloting may become less significant with the implementation of other voting methods. The controversy surrounding provisional ballots under HAVA is discussed, with various bills requiring provisional ballots to be counted if cast at any polling place in the state where the voter is registered. Implementation of safeguards to prevent double voting is also mandated. H.R. 939 and S. 450 required that provisional ballots be eligible for counting regardless of where they were cast or ID requirements. State officials had to develop procedures for timely processing and counting of these ballots following EAC guidelines. H.R. 4989 prohibited jurisdictions from asking for additional ID from voters who met the bill's requirements. The bill required provisional ballots to include all necessary information for voting, mandated active notification to voters on ballot status, prohibited recounts before counting provisional ballots, and treated rejected provisional ballots as voter registration applications. It also specified that the counting of provisional ballots would be determined by state voting laws. H.R. 4989 would repeal the HAVA requirement for voters using provisional ballots during extended polling hours. State laws vary for ballot recounts triggered by close races, candidate requests, voter requests, or suspected irregularities. Some suggest partial hand recounts for all elections to prevent fraud and errors. Some suggest partial hand recounts for all elections to prevent fraud and errors, especially when triggered by close races, candidate requests, voter requests, or suspected irregularities. The likelihood of detecting irregularities in a recount depends on factors like the size and structure of the recount. A nationwide, partial manual recount could pose logistical challenges due to different state standards for what constitutes a vote. If the EAC performed the recounts instead of states, it would involve hand counting millions of ballots. If the EAC performed recounts instead of states, varying standards would be needed for accuracy. Machines are more accurate than humans in counting ballots, especially if choices are printed. However, machines may struggle with ambiguous markings or technical issues. H.R. 533 required states to follow recount standards to prevent errors and fraud. H.R. 550 mandated random, unannounced hand counts of voter-verified records for general elections, with 2% of precincts per state audited. States had to provide requested information for audits, and certification of results was prohibited until audit publication. The EAC could conduct additional hand counts if needed, and legal action could be taken for relief. The bill mandated random, unannounced hand counts of voter-verified records for general elections, with 2% of precincts per state audited. Legal action could be taken for relief regarding audit actions. The EAC would conduct additional hand counts if necessary, and states were restricted to one congressional apportionment every ten years. H.R. 830, H.R. 2642, H.R. 4094, and S. 2350 proposed limiting states to one congressional redistricting after each census, with some requiring the use of independent commissions. H.R. 5451 and S. 2693 aimed to adjust census figures to account for illegal immigrants in apportionment. Voting eligibility in the U.S. has historically focused on suffrage, with early requirements based on land-ownership, age, and sex. Voting eligibility in the U.S. historically focused on suffrage, initially limited to landed freemen of 21 years or older. The U.S. Constitution did not address eligibility or election procedures, leading to varied practices across states. Uniform eligibility requirements were later established through amendments. Registration practices evolved to control the franchise and cater to political parties' interests, with citizenship and residency requirements implemented in response to immigration and machine politics. The South implemented the white primary to exclude African Americans from party membership and voting in primaries. The white primary, poll taxes, literacy tests, and other discriminatory devices were eventually banned, illustrating the history of voter registration as a means for limiting participation. Universal suffrage in the 20th century reduced policy debates on enfranchisement, except for voting by convicted criminals. States vary in allowing felons to vote, with most prohibiting voting while incarcerated, on parole, or probation. Restoration procedures also vary, with some states automatically restoring rights after a specified period, while others require special petition or action. H.R. 663, H.R. 939, H.R. 2398, H.R. 4762, and S. 450 aimed to protect the voting rights of U.S. citizens with criminal convictions, allowing voting unless serving a sentence, on parole, or probation for a felony. They proposed civil actions for violations, required notification of voting rights reinstatement, and provided additional remedies. H.R. 1300 focused on limiting voting restrictions to incarcerated felons. H.R. 4202, similar to H.R. 1300, limited voting rights for incarcerated felons and addressed concerns about the security of computer-assisted voting systems, particularly direct-recording electronic systems. Experts disagree on the seriousness of security issues and proposed solutions, with some suggesting established practices can address concerns while others believe significant changes are necessary. Significant changes are proposed for voting systems, including the use of open source software, prohibiting wireless communications, adopting stringent security standards, and developing systems for voter verification. Some experts advocate for these changes before wider adoption of Direct-Recording Electronic systems, while others believe current safeguards are sufficient. The EAC adopted the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) in December 2005, which are technical standards for voting systems. Developed in cooperation with NIST, the guidelines contain security provisions but do not require open-source software or specific security process standards. The EAC is also developing a HAVA-required voting-system testing and certification program. The EAC, in collaboration with NIST, is working on a HAVA-mandated voting-system testing and certification program to replace the VSS program. Some experts argue that open-source code is more secure than closed-source code used in current voting systems, which also rely on proprietary commercial off-the-shelf software. It is unlikely that companies providing closed-source software would disclose their code as HAVA defines voting systems to include components like ballot definition and voter materials, which likely use proprietary software. It is unlikely that any voting system currently in use in the United States, except hand-counted paper-ballot systems, could meet an open-source requirement due to the use of proprietary software. The impact of an open-source requirement on the marketplace for voting systems is uncertain, as it could attract new companies but also lead to some manufacturers withdrawing from the market to protect their competitiveness. Defining which components of voting systems would be affected by an open-source requirement could help address potential problems. The use of a reference collection like NIST's National Software Reference Library involves determining digital signatures for deposited software to compare with software received by jurisdictions for voting machines. This method allows for testing software integrity without revealing proprietary code, but it may not detect malicious code hidden during the development process. Other methods are available to reduce the risk of tampering. H.R. 533, H.R. 550, H.R. 939, and S. 450 proposed using open-source software in voting machines and establishing software standards. H.R. 3094 required disclosure of software code for public inspection and notification of any alterations. H.R. 550 prohibited code alteration without recertification. H.R. 470 mandated testing software in voting machines before elections. H.R. 3094 mandated that election software be digitally signed by all custodians and made publicly available. The use of wireless communications in voting systems poses security risks, with some experts advocating for cryptographic methods to enhance security. The EAC has recommended against using wireless communication in voting systems, as it is considered the least secure. Legislation such as H.R. 550, H.R. 939, and S. 450 have prohibited the use of wireless, power-line, or concealed communication devices in voting systems. Security measures should focus on personnel, technology, and operations. The development, acquisition, and implementation of hardware and software, as well as policies and procedures, are key elements in ensuring the security of voting systems. Studies in Maryland, Ohio, and California have identified concerns in DRE security, including software, hardware, and personnel practices. Recommendations have been made to address these risks, particularly in operations and personnel. HAVA does not have explicit requirements regarding these elements but does emphasize technological security. The development, manufacture, and deployment of voting systems require technological security measures. Legislation such as H.R. 470, H.R. 550, and H.R. 3094 mandate security controls for voting-system manufacturers, including background checks and chain of custody documentation for software. H.R. 939 and S. 450 prohibit voting systems from manufacturers that do not meet security standards set by NIST. H.R. 3910 required criminal background checks for election officials involved in vote tabulation and certification, along with other provisions related to testing laboratories disclosing information to the EAC for certification. The bills also mandated the EAC to report to Congress on security review and certification processes for voting systems, provide security consultation services, and include provisions in voluntary voting system guidelines. Some concerns have been raised in recent elections about possible confusion among voters resulting from changes to election laws and procedures. HAVA requires certain information to be posted at polling places but does not mandate public notice of changes. Proposed bills would require states to provide public notice before an election of any changes in state election-administration law. Additionally, states would be required to publish all election-related laws, regulations, procedures, and practices on an Internet website. Voter error was a significant issue after the 2000 election, leading to the replacement of voting machines in many jurisdictions. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) addressed high voter error rates by funding the replacement of punchcard and lever-machine systems with ones that provide error detection and correction. However, hand-counted paper ballot, punchcard, and central-count systems were exempt from this requirement. There are no established standards for voter-error rates, and the VVSG only contains standards for machine error. Voter intentional mismarking or failure to vote on ballot items can be problematic due to ballot secrecy. Some observers have called for national benchmarks for residual votes, with proposed bills aiming to eliminate exceptions for punchcard and central-count voting systems under HAVA. These bills also required the EAC to establish a uniform benchmark for residual-vote error rates based on good practices in representative jurisdictions, with jurisdictions not allowed to exceed the benchmark. Additionally, the EAC would study and report on communities with historically high rates of intentional undervoting compared to the national average. HAVA requires certain voters who registered by mail to present specific forms of identification. This requirement applies to first-time registrants who have not previously voted in a federal or local election in the state. Acceptable forms of identification include a current photo ID, a copy if voting by mail, or a document showing the voter's name and address. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires certain voters who registered by mail to present specific forms of identification, including a current photo ID or a document showing the voter's name and address. States have enacted laws to implement these requirements, with some having more stringent identification requirements than HAVA. Voters who cannot present identification are allowed to cast a provisional ballot. Several bills were introduced in Congress to modify the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requirements, including allowing the use of affidavits for first-time voters registering by mail and establishing standards for voter identity verification. Some bills aimed to provide free durable registration cards for voters, while others required government-issued photo identification for in-person voting or mailed applications. H.R. 3910, H.R. 4462, H.R. 5913, and H.R. 4844 introduced requirements for voter identification, including state-issued photo ID, proof of citizenship, and federal or state-issued photo ID for voting in federal elections. Provisional ballot voters had 48 hours to provide required identification, with exceptions for military overseas voters. S. 414 and other bills proposed voter identification requirements, including presenting government-issued photo ID for in-person voting and providing identification information for absentee voting. Funding was also authorized for free photo identification cards for registered voters without them. H.R. 2250, H.R. 4989, H.R. 5913, and H.R. 4844 proposed funding for voter identification cards and photo identification required for voting. H.R. 4844 specifically required states to provide photo identification to qualified and indigent voters at no cost. S. 414 would have authorized $5 million for EAC grants to states for pilot programs related to voter identification. S. 414 proposed $5 million for EAC grants to states for pilot programs marking voters with indelible ink. H.R. 3557 aimed to provide paid or unpaid leave for employees to vote. H.R. 3910 would have required states to test voting systems for accuracy. The passage of the HAVA in 2006 addressed voter registration problems by requiring computerization and integration of voter registration systems at the state level. However, the lack of a clear national standard for statewide systems has led to uncertainties in development and compliance. Issues include concerns about system integrity, registration accuracy, fraud, and the impact of new registrations. The validity of new registrations, concerns about fraud and abuse, and the impacts of challenging voter registrations at polling places are key issues. Six states allow election-day registration, while others have registration deadlines. Some propose election-day registration to remove barriers for new voters, but others argue it may increase costs and fraud risks. Several bills have been introduced to require election-day registration at polling places. Several bills, including H.R. 939 and S. 450, aimed to require states to allow election-day registration at polling places. HAVA mandates specific statements and questions on mail-in registration forms regarding age and citizenship. Some bills proposed replacing these requirements with an affidavit. Other bills, such as H.R. 4462, sought to mandate proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Additionally, H.R. 4989 aimed to ensure states accept the federal voter registration form. The HAVA identification requirements were expanded to include those not registering in person with a government employee and allowed the use of social security numbers for voter identification. H.R. 6253 aimed to criminalize falsely claiming U.S. citizenship for voter registration or voting. Some states allow online voter registration, while others require forms to be submitted by mail or in person. Bills like H.R. 533, H.R. 939, S. 17, and S. 450 required states to offer Internet voter registration and set standards for it. H.R. 939 and S. 450 also mandated a study by the EAC on the feasibility of Internet voter registration. The study may include Internet registration as part of the process. NVRA requires states to notify applicants of application status. HAVA mandates notification for incomplete citizenship questions and allows for corrections. Bills like H.R. 939 and S. 450 require states to accept voter registration applications with certain guidelines. These bills also establish a presumption for registration and acceptance of corrected applications. H.R. 3557, H.R. 4989, H.R. 3094, and S. 414 proposed changes to voter registration processes, including allowing timely completion of forms, broadening correction provisions, prohibiting rejection for correctable errors, and adjusting submission deadlines. The use of third parties for form distribution was also addressed in H.R. 2250. H.R. 2250, H.R. 5776, and H.R. 3910 proposed restrictions on distribution of voter registration forms by persons with felony convictions and set requirements for form collection and submission. H.R. 3910 prohibits payments on a commission basis for distributing or collecting voter registration applications. NVRA requires states to make efforts to remove ineligible persons from voter rolls, excluding failure to vote as a reason for removal. HAVA also mandates the removal of ineligible registrants from statewide lists. The proposed bills H.R. 533, H.R. 939, S. 17, and S. 450 aim to ensure public notice and notification before removing names from voter registration lists. H.R. 3094 requires notice 45 days before an election, while H.R. 4989 mandates notification and review before removal, with special rules for removal due to death. H.R. 939 and S. 450 also restrict the disclosure of removal reasons without a court order. H.R. 2778 and S. 414 allow removal of non-voters after two election cycles without response to notifications or registrar contact. H.R. 3094 prohibits removal from voter registration lists for felony conviction or death unless accuracy standards are met. HAVA requires technological security measures for computerized lists. Bills like H.R. 550, H.R. 939, and S. 450 aim to certify security measures for statewide voter-registration lists. H.R. 4989 mandates guidance for audits of lists. H.R. 4225 proposes omitting addresses for victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking. H.R. 4225 would require states to omit the address of victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or stalking from voter registration lists. S. 414 aims to make voter registration lists interoperable between states. H.Con.Res. 73 and S.Con.Res. 63 support National High School Seniors Voter Registration Day. H.R. 4989 mandates posting voter lists and polling places online. S. 414 criminalizes paying someone to register to vote and aims to improve voter verification. Paper-based document ballot systems offer more verifiability than non-document systems like DREs. Current DREs lack independent records of voter choices, while document ballots allow voters to verify their choices before casting them. Many computer security experts advocate for a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) to address the lack of transparency in Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems. The VVSG considers VVPAT as an example of independent verification systems, which can be paper or nonpaper. HAVA mandates a permanent paper record for the voting system for recounts but does not specify individual ballots or their use in recounts. HAVA requires voter verification of selected votes before casting, without specifying the method. Various bills proposed a voter-verifiable paper ballot, with some differences in details. Some bills mandated a permanent paper ballot as the record of the vote, while others specified it as the true record in case of discrepancies between electronic and paper records. Several bills proposed requirements for paper ballots to address inconsistencies between electronic and paper records. H.R. 704 and S. 330 mandated the use of paper records for recounts and audits, with S. 330 designating it as the correct record in case of irregularities. H.R. 550 and H.R. 704 required paper ballots to be suitable for manual audits equivalent to hand-counted systems. H.R. 939 and S. 450 specified archival quality for paper ballots and limited state payments for voter-verification requirements. H.R. 6187 and S. 3943 proposed reimbursement for jurisdictions using paper ballots as an alternative to DREs or lever machines. H.R. 6200 mandated hand-counted paper ballots. H.R. 6200 mandated hand-counted paper ballots for presidential elections, while H.R. 533 and S. 17 required voting systems to offer various verification options for voters. The EAC was directed to issue standards for this requirement, with voter-verified records serving as the official count if they differ from the voting system tallies. In the 2004 and 2006 elections, the debate over the necessity of Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems led to varying state requirements. While some argue for a federal mandate under HAVA, others believe the decision should be left to the states to avoid stifling innovation. Bills introduced in Congress reflected this debate, with different approaches to VVPAT implementation. Several bills introduced in Congress regarding voting rights and election processes are noted. H.Con.Res. 73 supports National High School Seniors Voter Registration Day. H.Con.Res. 247 expresses concerns about photo ID requirements for voting. H.J.Res. 1 proposes an amendment for voting rights in US territories. H.J.Res. 8 introduces the Every Vote Counts Amendment.
