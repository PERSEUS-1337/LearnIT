    "content": "PROTECTIONS FOR CREDIT REPORTS OF MINORS: The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include additional protections for credit reports of minor consumers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to provide protections for credit reports of minor consumers. Consumer reporting agencies must create a blocked file for a minor consumer upon request by a covered guardian. The Bureau will establish procedures for identifying the guardian and minor, creating or converting blocked files, and unblocking files. The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows a covered guardian to request the unblocking of a file for a minor consumer. An alert statement is included in the unblocked file if the minor was a victim of fraud or identity theft before turning 18. The Bureau determines fees for creating, converting, or unblocking a file for a minor consumer. No fees can be charged to a minor victim of fraud or identity theft before their 18th birthday. Resellers must include alert statements in consumer information for those with alert statements in their file. The section defines an alert statement as a notification to potential users of a consumer report that the consumer may be a victim of fraud or identity theft. It must be prominently displayed for easy visibility. The term 'blocked file' refers to a file for minor consumers where a consumer reporting agency maintains limited information and blocks any input without permission from a covered guardian. Covered guardians include legal guardians and custodians of minor children. The Fair Credit Reporting Act defines a \"minor consumer\" as an individual under 18 years of age. The Act also specifies that a covered guardian for a minor consumer can be a legal guardian, custodian of a minor child, or the State agency responsible for a child in foster care. The Fair Credit Reporting Act defines a \"minor consumer\" as an individual under 18 years of age and provides additional protections for their credit reports."
