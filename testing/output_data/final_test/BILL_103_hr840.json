    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Stalker Reduction Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that stalking is often part of domestic violence, with insufficient data on its extent. Nearly 30% of female murders are due to domestic violence. Many states lack legislation on stalking, causing prolonged suffering for victims. \"Enactment of state anti-stalking legislation is necessary due to the prevalence of stalking as part of domestic violence, with many states lacking proper laws on the issue.\" Programs regarding stalking are being amended to increase awareness, reporting, and prevention of stalking. States must have anti-stalking laws in effect to avoid a 25 percent reduction in formula grant funds. In order to receive formula grant funds, states must have anti-stalking laws that prohibit individuals from willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly following or harassing others with threats of imminent death or serious bodily harm. The law must include minimum penalties for first offenses and violations of restraining orders. The text chunk outlines the penalties for domestic violence offenses, including imprisonment ranging from 1 to 10 years. It also mandates the development of training programs for law enforcement and judicial personnel, reporting of domestic violence offenses to a central registry, and requiring judicial personnel to search the registry for civil restraining orders. The curr_chunk states that judicial personnel should report information about a defendant to law enforcement if there is an outstanding warrant. The curr_chunk states that state databases should be established. Each State receiving funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 must allocate 5 percent for developing records on stalking and domestic violence. This includes maintaining records on complaints and arrests, automating records, and improving report quality to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Director, in consultation with the Bureau of Justice Statistics, will establish guidelines for this purpose. The Director may waive compliance with subsection (a) or authorize a State to reduce the minimum amount required to allocate under subsection (a) if the quality of the State's records on stalking and domestic violence complaints and arrests does not justify the allocated amount. SEC. 5. The Bureau of Justice Statistics will define stalking terms and create a national database on stalking civil protective orders within 2 years. SEC. 6. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will submit annual reports evaluating State anti-stalking efforts and legislation."
