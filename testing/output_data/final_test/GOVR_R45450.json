    "content": "Statutory inspectors general (IGs) are independent officials who prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in federal departments and agencies. They lead offices that conduct audits, investigations, and evaluations to improve programs. IGs exist in over 70 federal entities, with origins dating back to the late 1950s. In 1976, Congress established the first statutory IG for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services) to combat inefficiencies and mismanagement. This model was later replicated for the Department of Energy IG in 1977. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established statutory IGs for federal agencies to conduct audits and investigations, promote efficiency, and operate independently from agency management. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established statutory IGs for federal agencies to promote efficiency and operate independently. Subsequent amendments aimed to expand the number of IGs, enhance their independence, transparency, and accountability. Amendments in 1988 increased the total number of IGs and created a new category for \"designated federal entities.\" The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-409) established the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) to oversee the IG community, increased salary rates for IGs, added reporting requirements, and provided additional authorities to enhance their independence. The Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016 aimed to enhance IG access to agency records by exempting them from the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. It also directed CIGIE to resolve jurisdictional disputes between IGs and altered the membership structure and investigatory procedures of the CIGIE Integrity Committee. The Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016 required IGs to submit corrective action recommendations to agency heads and congressional committees. There are four types of statutory IGs based on criteria like authorizing statute and oversight jurisdiction. As of January 2019, there were 74 statutory IGs in the federal government, governed by the IG Act. As of January 2019, there were 74 statutory IGs in the federal government, governed by the IG Act. These IGs oversee various federal entities and components, including legislative branch agencies like AOC, GPO, GAO, LOC, and USCP, as well as executive branch intelligence agencies like CIA and IC. Additionally, there are special IGs for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP). The Inspector Generals (IGs) in the federal government oversee various entities and components, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components. Some entities have multiple IGs, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Treasury. Congress authorizes IGs to oversee multiple entities, either permanently or temporarily, due to agency reorganizations or congressional concerns. IGs have expanded jurisdiction over certain agencies or programs, with examples provided in Table 3. Congress can temporarily expand IG jurisdiction to include operations of unaffiliated agencies, as seen with the GAO IG serving as the IG for the Commission on Civil Rights. IGs conduct reviews of government programs through performance audits, inspections, or investigations in response to mandates, requests, or self-initiation. IG reviews consist of audits, inspections, and investigations. Audits follow GAGAS standards, while inspections and investigations follow CIGIE standards. IG audits require more depth in evidence and documentation compared to inspections. Both audits and inspections involve programmatic analysis related to compliance, internal control, or efficiency. Performance audits are broader in scope compared to inspections or evaluations and investigations. They assess agency-wide program implementation across multiple components and facilities. Unlike audits and inspections, IG investigations focus on alleged misuse or mismanagement of agency resources by individuals and can result in disciplinary actions. IGs have broad authority to conduct audits and investigations, focusing on specific actions of agency employees for misconduct. They aim to establish and protect IG independence from undue influence, with the ability to access records and information related to agency programs and operations. IGs have the authority to request assistance from other government agencies, subpoena information, administer oaths, hire staff, and respond to complaints of waste, fraud, and abuse. The discussion compares statutory authorities and requirements by IG type, highlighting variations in structures and operations. Special IGs and other permanent IGs have different authorizing statutes but share mandated authorities and responsibilities. IGs in the legislative branch are authorized under specific statutes that incorporate provisions of the IG Act, subject to interpretation. Special IGs and permanent IGs in the legislative branch focus on evaluating programs within their affiliated agencies, such as the DHS IG assessing information security programs. The IG Act authorizes IGs in the legislative branch to evaluate programs within their affiliated agencies, focusing on security programs and practices. Oversight jurisdiction can extend to nonfederal third parties like contractors and grantees. Special IGs have cross-agency jurisdiction to evaluate specific programs, operations, or activities, regardless of the implementing agencies. For example, SIGAR oversees federal funding for Afghanistan reconstruction, while the DOD IG focuses on reconstruction activities under DOD's purview. Statutory IGs are appointed under different methods, with 37 out of 74 appointed by the President, requiring Senate confirmation. The IG for SIGAR is the only one appointed by the President alone without Senate confirmation, while 37 IGs are appointed by the heads of their affiliated federal entities. IGs can be appointed by the heads of their affiliated federal entities, with different removal or transfer methods depending on their branch. Executive branch IGs are removable by the President, while legislative branch IGs are removable by their entity heads. Additional procedures are required for certain IGs, such as DFE IGs headed by a board, committee, or commission. The removal process for various permanent IGs in the executive and legislative branches involves written concurrence from board members or entity heads, with advanced notice requirements to Congress. The removal process for permanent IGs in the executive and legislative branches involves written concurrence from board members or entity heads, with advanced notice requirements to Congress. Statutory IGs may serve indefinitely, except for the USPS and USCP IGs, which have term limits. Budget estimates for executive branch IGs must be developed separately from their affiliated entities, with transparency into requested amounts before modification by agency heads and the President. The budget formulation process for Inspectors General (IGs) involves submitting annual budget estimates to agency heads and the President, who can modify them. Key steps include the IG submitting a budget estimate to the affiliated agency head, the agency head compiling a budget request for the IG to the President, and the President submitting an annual budget to Congress that includes the IG's original budget estimate. The budget formulation process for Inspectors General (IGs) involves submitting annual budget estimates to agency heads and the President. This process provides budgetary independence by enabling Congress to perceive differences between the budgetary perspectives of IGs and affiliated agencies or the President. Congressional investigations have questioned whether the President consistently follows the IG Act's transparency requirements for budget formulation. Treatment of budget estimates for other permanent IGs in the legislative branch varies. The budget formulation process for Inspectors General (IGs) involves submitting annual budget estimates to agency heads and the President. Federal laws provide separate appropriations accounts for establishment IGs in the executive branch, ensuring budgetary independence. Some IGs have historically developed separate budget estimates, and recent calls have been made for legislative branch agency budget requests to include separate sections for IG budget estimates. The budget formulation process for Inspectors General (IGs) involves submitting annual budget estimates to agency heads and the President. Federal laws provide separate appropriations accounts for establishment IGs in the executive branch, ensuring budgetary independence. Special IGs may be funded through separately listed accounts. Statutory IGs have reporting obligations to Congress, the Attorney General, agency heads, and the public, with some reports being periodic and others triggered by specific events. The IG Act requires establishment and DFE IGs to issue semiannual reports summarizing their activities, including audits, inspections, and evaluations with unimplemented recommendations and potential cost savings. Reports must be submitted to entity heads, Congress, and the public by April 30 and October 31 each year, with additional comments allowed from agency heads. The affiliated entity head must make the report available to the public within 60 days. Other permanent IGs issue semiannual reports with varying content requirements. IC IG's report includes less information on OIG activities. Special IGs issue quarterly reports with detailed financial statements. Permanent IGs must immediately report serious issues to their entity heads. The affiliated entity head must transmit a report on serious problems to Congress within seven days, known as a \"seven-day letter.\" IGs for executive branch agencies must identify top management and performance challenges annually. Special IGs issue quarterly reports with financial statements. The IG Act requires covered IGs to submit a statement on top management and performance challenges (TMPCs) to the affiliated entity head 30 days before the entity's Annual Financial Report (AFR) or Performance and Accountability Report (PAR). Some IGs have chosen to identify TMPCs, and in April 2018, CIGIE released a report on common TMPCs. Federal laws mandate transparency for IG reports and corrective action recommendations, with semiannual reports required to be publicly available. The IG Act mandates transparency for IG reports and corrective action recommendations. Audits, inspections, and evaluation reports must be posted on the OIG's website within three days. Semiannual reports are required to be publicly available for some permanent IGs in the legislative branch. Other permanent IGs in the executive branch are not explicitly required to make reports publicly available. The IG Act mandates transparency for IG reports and corrective action recommendations, requiring audits, inspections, and evaluation reports to be posted on the OIG's website within three days. Some permanent IGs in the legislative branch are required to make semiannual reports publicly available, while others in the executive branch are not explicitly required to do so. Certain IGs have chosen to post specific reports on their websites, with varying levels of detail provided. The Special Inspectors General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) must make quarterly reports available to the public and post them on a public website in English and other widely used languages in Afghanistan. The extent to which special IGs must post individual audits, inspections, or evaluation reports on their websites or other public websites is unclear. Many IGs participate in Oversight.gov, an electronic repository launched in October 2017 that features a searchable database for IG reports from 2000 to present. Oversight.gov allows filtering of reports by criteria like specific IGs, review type, or keyword. 71 out of 74 IGs have posted reports on the website as of January 2019. IGs decide which reports to post, with some reports only available on Oversight.gov and not on individual OIG websites. CIGIE is the primary oversight body for the IG community, replacing previous coordinating bodies. CIGIE, the primary oversight body for the IG community, is responsible for addressing integrity, economy, and effectiveness issues across government agencies. It provides training academies for IG personnel and coordinates external peer reviews to enhance professionalism and effectiveness. CIGIE oversees IG community, conducts external peer reviews, investigates IG wrongdoing, identifies IG candidates, and issues cross-jurisdictional reports. CIGIE oversees IG community, conducts external peer reviews, investigates IG wrongdoing, identifies and vets candidates for IG positions, and issues cross-jurisdictional reports. The council is financed by IG member offices through contributions to a revolving fund. Other interagency mechanisms support coordination among IGs for specific issues, such as the Lead Inspector General for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Lead Inspector General (LIG) oversees programs and operations for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) across DOD, Department of State, and U.S. Agency for International Development. The Council of Inspectors General on Financial Oversight (CIGFO) facilitates information sharing among nine financial regulatory agencies and addresses top management challenges. The role of statutory IGs in government oversight is crucial, with Congress playing a key role in establishing their structures and authorities. IGs have a dual reporting structure to advise agencies on program improvement and report to Congress. It is important for IGs to have the necessary resources and authorities to fulfill their oversight roles as government programs and operations become more complex and interconnected. The role of statutory IGs in government oversight is evolving as agency programs and operations become more complex and interconnected. IGs may face increasing demand to review program performance, analyze specialty programs, and use complex analytical methods. Congress may consider options to enhance IG structures and functions as their role evolves. IG independence is crucial, but there is no standard definition for it. IG independence is derived from statutory authorities and requirements, including integrity in appointments and transparent budgets. Challenges exist in ensuring IGs have the necessary independence. Different perceptions of independence among IGs, agencies, and Congress may impact statutory authorities. A GAO report emphasized that independence is a mindset for auditors. The independence of auditors is primarily a state of mind and is influenced by various internal and external factors. Assessing auditor independence is subjective and can lead to disagreements. Internal factors include self-interest and familiarity with agency personnel, while external factors include statutory authorities and political influence. Maintaining a balance between IG independence and agency management is crucial, as outlined in the IG Act's dual reporting structure. The IG Act established a dual reporting structure for IGs to report to Congress and agency heads, creating potential tension. IGs must maintain independence to assess programs objectively while fostering a working relationship with agencies. Appointment and removal methods impact IG independence and effectiveness, with opinions varying on the level of impact. Some argue that the method of appointing IGs through the PAS strengthens independence, while others fear politicization and reduced effectiveness. Similar concerns exist for IG removal methods, with suggestions to limit removals \"for cause\" to enhance independence. Some argue that the method of appointing IGs through the PAS strengthens independence, while concerns exist about the impact of removal methods on IG accountability and vacancies. The vetting and confirmation processes for IGs may lead to prolonged vacancies and the use of acting IGs, potentially affecting their independence and effectiveness. The appointment process for Inspectors General can impact their independence and effectiveness, with concerns about the influence of political pressure on acting IGs compared to permanent IGs. Acting IGs may face challenges in setting long-term strategies and priorities, but some argue they are not inherently less independent than permanent IGs. Acting IGs have the same authorities and standards as permanent IGs, prioritizing independence. They can develop recommendations but lack enforcement power, with agencies responsible for implementation. Concerns exist about unimplemented recommendations due to agency follow-up procedures and tracking issues. Some observers suggest improving audit follow-up and oversight of IG recommendations by implementing standardized procedures, defining roles and responsibilities, using uniform terminology for recommendation status, tracking and reporting on all recommendations, prioritizing recommendations, and creating a centralized database. OIGs require personnel with a mix of skills to fulfill their missions of preventing government waste, fraud, and abuse. Traditionally, OIG workforces consist mainly of auditors and investigators. The OIG workforce has diversified beyond auditors and investigators, with some arguing for expertise in specialty areas like IT, cybersecurity, and data analysis to enhance audit quality and recommendations. Building IT expertise within an OIG could improve audit findings and recommendations for securing legacy IT systems. Observers suggest that IG reviews should focus more on program outcomes to enhance agency operations and increase effectiveness. Some IGs already assess program outcomes alongside compliance and outputs. The Labor IG audit found that the Job Corps program struggled to place participants in meaningful jobs due to noncompliance with policies and ineffective transition services. Some argue that statutory requirements hinder IG effectiveness by focusing on outputs rather than outcomes. Evaluating IG performance in peer reviews could impact how audits and investigations are approached. Some suggest reforms to strengthen coordination and oversight of the IG community, such as enhancing peer review processes, expanding the Integrity Committee's duties, and improving reporting requirements by standardizing templates and enhancing data analytics capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses enhancing coordination and resource sharing among Inspectors General (IGs), reforming the funding model for the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), and providing a list of statutory IGs by type. It also mentions the need for a direct appropriation for CIGIE to fulfill its duties effectively. The tables compare selected statutory authorities and requirements across different types of statutory Inspectors General (IGs) in the federal government. These authorities and requirements are mandated in the authorizing statutes, including incorporation by reference provisions for special IGs and other permanent IGs in the legislative branch. The text discusses how interpretation may vary regarding the application of subsequent amendments to the IG Act for special IGs and other permanent IGs in the legislative branch. It defines terms like \"identical requirement\" and \"similar requirement\" in relation to the IG Act. The IG Act requirements may or may not apply to listed IGs, as their authorizing statutes do not explicitly state the requirement. The interpretation of subsequent amendments to the IG Act varies for special IGs and other permanent IGs in the legislative branch."
