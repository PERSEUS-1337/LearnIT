    "content": "During U.S. wars, civilian ships have supported military operations by transporting supplies and personnel. Merchant mariners, civilians working on these vessels, have historically served in various capacities. In World War II, 8,500 merchant mariners were killed and 11,000 wounded. In recent conflicts like OEF and OIF, U.S.-flagged commercial vessels crewed by merchant mariners delivered 63% of military cargo to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Additionally, government-owned vessels crewed by civilian federal employees and contractors transported 35% of military cargo. Merchant mariners have always played a crucial role in supporting U.S. war efforts. Currently, only limited groups of World War II-era merchant mariners are eligible for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Legislation was introduced after World War II to provide benefits to merchant mariners comparable to those of other World War II veterans. One bill, H.R. 2346, aimed to provide benefits to merchant mariners similar to those under the GI Bill. Legislation was introduced after World War II to grant veteran status and benefits to merchant mariners similar to other World War II veterans. Testimony both in favor and opposition to H.R. 2346 was heard, with concerns raised about the freedom of merchant mariners to make decisions and their higher earnings compared to Navy personnel. H.R. 476, introduced in 1947, aimed to expand benefits for merchant seamen related to health care, disability, and education, but no legislation was enacted immediately after the war. The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 granted veterans' benefit eligibility to civilians who served as Women's Air Forces Service Pilots (WASPS) during World War II. It also provided the Secretary of Defense the authority to extend \"active duty\" status for eligibility for federal veterans' benefits to other groups of civilian federal employees or contractors who rendered service to the Armed Forces. Regulations implementing this act delegated the authority to grant active duty status to civilian groups to the Secretary of the Air Force. The Department of Defense Civilian/Military Service Review Board was established by 1000.20 to review applications for active duty status based on factors like military control and discipline. In 1982 and 1985, the Secretary of the Air Force rejected applications for active duty status for oceangoing merchant mariners who served during World War II, as recommended by the Review Board. The Secretary of the Air Force rejected applications for active duty status for oceangoing merchant mariners who served during World War II based on limited military training, lack of exclusive service for the Armed Forces, and insufficient military control. The application of Operation Mulberry group was also rejected due to its broad and diverse nature. The application of merchant mariners who participated in Operation Mulberry was rejected, but those who served only on blockships were approved. The Civilian/Military Review Board recognized the unique military mission performed by the blockship group during the Invasion of Normandy, stating that it was not a typical Merchant Marine task. This group was created specifically for that time and place in World War II. A lawsuit was filed challenging the denial of active duty status for merchant mariners following the 1985 rejections. A lawsuit was filed challenging the denial of active duty status for World War II oceangoing merchant mariners and those who participated in World War II invasions. The U.S. District Court ruled that the Secretary of the Air Force erred in rejecting their applications and remanded them for reconsideration in 1988. In 1988, the Secretary of the Air Force granted active duty status for World War II-era merchant mariners for veterans' benefits. The Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1988 extended burial benefits to merchant mariners serving from 1945 to 1946. However, in 1999, it was determined that their service during this period is not considered active duty for other VA benefits. Only specific groups of merchant mariners are eligible for veterans' benefits administered by the VA, including those who served on blockships in support of Operation Mulberry and American merchant mariners in oceangoing service during the period of armed conflict from December 7, 1941, to August 15, 1945. During the period of armed conflict from December 7, 1941, to August 15, 1945, eligible merchant mariners served satisfactorily aboard merchant vessels in oceangoing service, including near foreign voyages and public vessels. Additionally, those who served between August 16, 1945, and December 31, 1946, as crew members of vessels operated by the War Shipping Administration or the Office of Defense Transportation are also eligible for veterans' benefits. During World War II, merchant mariners served on vessels in various bodies of water under the US government, but many faced challenges accessing veterans' benefits due to delays in eligibility. For example, they missed out on GI Bill benefits and VA disability compensation for nearly 40 years. H.R. 154 aims to address these issues. H.R. 154, the Honoring Our WWII Merchant Mariners Act of 2017, aims to provide compensation to former World War II-era merchant mariners who missed out on VA benefits for nearly 40 years. The legislation would offer a one-time payment of $25,000 to eligible mariners who served between December 7, 1941, and December 31, 1946. A total of $125 million would be authorized for these benefits, available until expended. Eligible individuals have one year from enactment to apply for compensation. H.R. 154 aims to compensate former World War II-era merchant mariners with a one-time payment of $25,000. This legislation would place them in a unique position compared to other civilians and veterans, as they would be the only group eligible for compensation for lost benefits. Only groups eligible for cash compensation from the VA without demonstrating financial hardship or service-connected disability."
