    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring the Partnership for County Health Care Costs Act of 2009\". Congress finds that the 8th Amendment requires medical care for individuals in jails, detention centers, and prisons. The Federal Government does not provide health benefits to inmates under certain programs, but beneficiaries released from custody can still receive benefits. The cost of providing health care in prisons and jails has increased due to high incarceration rates, infectious diseases, chronic conditions, substance abuse treatment, mental illness, aging prison populations, rising prescription drug costs, and mandatory sentencing laws. This places a burden on local governments negatively impacted by recession and budget deficits. Jails often have a higher instance of mentally ill inmates. The rising cost of bail has led to an increase in jail population and health care costs for inmates, disproportionately affecting African-Americans and Latinos. Terminating benefits for those in county jails awaiting trial violates the presumption of innocence. Individuals charged with a crime and incarcerated but not convicted should remain eligible for Federal health benefits until convicted or acquitted. SSI payments should be suspended until the inmate is released or completes their sentence. SEC. 3. Removal of inmate limitation on benefits under Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, and SCHIP. The amendment removes the limitation on benefits for individuals in custody pending disposition of charges under Medicaid, Medicare, and SSI. The amendment removes the limitation on benefits for individuals in custody pending disposition of charges under Medicaid, Medicare, and SSI. Supplemental security income benefits will be withheld until the individual is no longer in custody or paid to their estate if they die while in custody. The effective date of the amendments is the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning more than 60 days after the enactment of the Act."
