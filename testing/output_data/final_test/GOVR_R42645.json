    "content": "The U.S.-Japan alliance in the Asia-Pacific region faces challenges due to local concerns about the U.S. military presence on Okinawa, particularly regarding the relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps Air Station. The uncertainty surrounding the presence of American forces on Okinawa is a critical concern for national security decision-makers, raising questions about the sustainability of the alliance. Some Okinawans view the U.S. military presence on the island as contentious. The relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma (MCAS Futenma) on Okinawa is seen as discriminatory by some locals, with concerns about suppression of democratic expression. The planned move to Camp Schwab in Henoko, known as the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF), aims to alleviate safety and noise issues for the community and boost economic development in the area. The relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Camp Schwab in Henoko was aimed at boosting economic development in the area. Japan agreed to pay around 60% of the estimated $10.3 billion costs, but implementation has been a struggle due to political turmoil in Tokyo and resistance in Okinawa. Yukio Hatoyama, during his term as Prime Minister, supported the Henoko FRF site after examining various options to resolve the Futenma conundrum. Successive prime ministers have endorsed the 2006 plan to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Camp Schwab in Henoko, but many Okinawans now insist on closure of Futenma and relocation outside the prefecture. The U.S. Congress raised concerns about the costs of moving Marines to Guam and blocked funds for the realignment. In April 2012, the U.S. and Japan adjusted the policy by \"de-linking\" the transfer of Marines to Guam with progress on the new base in Henoko. About 9,000 U.S. Marines are slated to be transferred to locations outside of Japan. In December 2013, Governor Hirokazu Nakaima approved the construction of the FRF in Okinawa, despite previous campaign promises. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered financial support and other concessions to secure approval. Abe's commitment to relocating Futenma and his strong political position likely influenced Nakaima's decision. In the November 2014 Okinawa gubernatorial election, incumbent governor Hirokazu Nakaima lost to Takeshi Onaga, who opposed the construction of the Futenma replacement facility. Onaga's anti-base stance has reenergized the movement against the U.S. military presence on Okinawa and the fate of the Futenma base. Governor Onaga has been actively working to halt construction of the FRF and challenge Tokyo and Washington's relocation plan. Governor Onaga is using legal means to prevent the construction of the Futenma replacement facility, leading to legal proceedings between the Okinawa prefectural government and the central government. Despite potential delays, the central government is expected to eventually override Onaga's objections. The construction of the new facility will involve challenges for law enforcement officials and engineers, with offshore runways requiring 21 million cubic meters of soil for reclaimed land. The construction of the Futenma replacement facility involves challenges for law enforcement officials and engineers, with 21 million cubic meters of soil needed for reclaimed land. The bulk of this soil will be delivered by ship from other areas of Japan. Construction is expected to be finished by April 2022 at the earliest, with the possibility of a faster completion if Tokyo commits more resources. The Abe Administration aims to return MCAS Futenma to local control as soon as possible. Accelerating construction of the Henoko FRF under the existing agreement poses law enforcement challenges for Japan, especially in dealing with anti-base protesters. The Okinawan Prefectural Police and Japanese Coast Guard are involved in preventing disruptions to the land reclamation operation. The mayor of Nago City has refused to cooperate, potentially causing delays. Okinawa's strategic importance has increased in recent decades. The U.S. military presence in Japan, particularly Okinawa, is crucial for fulfilling security obligations in the Asia-Pacific region, including responding to humanitarian disasters. The deployment of MV-22 \"Osprey\" aircraft to Okinawa is part of this strategic presence. The deployment of MV-22 \"Osprey\" tilt-rotor aircraft to Okinawa has enhanced the operational capability of the Marines stationed there due to their greater range and speed. The intensification of the territorial dispute between Japan and China over small islands in the East China Sea has provided another rationale for the approximately 19,000 marines stationed on Okinawa, which is strategically located near the disputed islands. The potential role of U.S. Marines in defending uninhabited islands from invasion is unclear, but their operational capabilities align with such a mission. The importance of Okinawa's location for U.S. security interests in East Asia is widely recognized. There is debate on the number of marines needed in Okinawa for U.S. security interests in East Asia. Some suggest maintaining 5,000-10,000 marines while pre-positioning supply vessels in Japanese waters. Defense officials advocate for substantial marine presence in Asia, with plans for rotational deployment through Guam and Australia. Congressional concerns focus on cost and implementation, but not on the necessity of the Marine presence. The proximity of Okinawa to the Asian continent makes it vulnerable to missile attacks, especially with China's increasing ballistic missile capabilities. Hardening U.S. military facilities against air and missile attacks is a priority for Congress. Native Okinawans generally have negative attitudes towards U.S. military bases due to a complex history and relationships with Japan and the United States. Okinawa, a group of islands in Japan, has a unique ethnic identity separate from mainland Japan. The islands were historically neglected by the Japanese government until World War II, when they became a battleground for the U.S. military. The Battle of Okinawa in 1945 resulted in significant casualties, with many civilians forced to commit mass suicide. This dark episode is remembered by Okinawans as a tragic part of their history. During American administration, Okinawans had no political authority or legal redress for crimes committed by U.S. servicemembers, leading to grievances among locals. The Korean War and Vietnam War brought more U.S. soldiers to the island, increasing revenue but also adding to the residents' grievances. After Okinawa reverted to Japanese sovereignty in 1972, crimes by American servicemembers decreased but remained a concern for locals. The Japanese government took steps to address Okinawans' grievances, such as increasing rent for land on U.S. military bases and prosecuting crimes in Japanese courts. Despite efforts to placate them, many Okinawans still feel victimized by policies from Tokyo and Washington. Some residents appreciate the economic benefits of hosting bases, while others resent the presence of American forces. Some locals in Okinawa resent outsiders focusing on environmental issues over economic development. Pro-relocation authorities cite the village of Henoko as an example of local citizens in favor of U.S. facilities, possibly due to monetary compensation. There is a \"generation gap\" between older Okinawans and younger residents regarding the anti-base activist movement. The anti-base movement remains strong and vocal in Okinawa, with opposition stemming from concerns about the American presence. The opposition to U.S. military bases in Okinawa stems from concerns about personal safety, noise, crime, and the environment, as well as pacifism and anti-militarism. Some residents support the U.S.-Japan security alliance but object to the burden placed on Okinawa. Tensions escalated after a 12-year-old girl was raped by U.S. servicemembers in 1995, leading to a massive anti-base protest and the establishment of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) to address grievances. The establishment of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) aimed to alleviate burdens of base-hosting communities. SACO led to improvements on Okinawa, but distressing incidents like a military helicopter crash near MCAS Futenma in 2004 offset these changes. The unwillingness to close Futenma without a replacement facility has led to perceptions of discrimination against Okinawans by Tokyo and Washington. Media outlets in Okinawa, such as the Ryukyu Shimpo and Okinawa Times, are critical of mainland discrimination in base negotiations. The concerns in Okinawa include the lack of coverage on the U.S. military's humanitarian response to disasters, criticism of the proposed permanent military presence, environmental worries about the FRF construction at Henoko, and the potential harm to the Oura Bay ecosystems, particularly the endangered dugong. Activists are concerned about the impact of the proposed base construction on the endangered dugong species. Disputes have arisen over the environmental impact study conducted by the Japanese government. A U.S. federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the DOD seeking to prevent construction on grounds of harm to the dugong. Environmental worries also include the impact of toxic substances stored on U.S. bases from the Vietnam War era. Efforts to make the U.S. presence in Okinawa more sustainable have been ongoing for years. The 1996 SACO Final Report mandated the release of land in Okinawa used by the U.S. military since World War II. Efforts to adjust the U.S. military presence in Japan were boosted by the Defense Policy Review Initiative in 2002. The 2005 Security Consultative Committee joint statement between the U.S. and Japan outlined 19 areas for alliance transformation, including improving interoperability and relocating U.S. marines from Okinawa to Guam. The implementation plan for the DPRI was detailed in the \"U.S.-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation,\" endorsed in subsequent joint statements. The relocation of U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam was dependent on progress at Camp Schwab and Japanese financial contributions. Alternative proposals for relocating MCAS Futenma have been suggested, including building a heliport or integrating facilities at an existing U.S. base. The controversy surrounding the relocation of MCAS Futenma has overshadowed progress in implementing other elements of the DPRI. The U.S. Navy's Carrier Air Wing Five is being relocated from Naval Air Facility Atsugi to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to reduce safety risks and noise. The Japanese government built a new offshore runway at the Iwakuni base, which began handling civilian flights in December 2012. The squadron of KC-130 cargo aircraft relocated to MCAS Iwakuni from Futenma in 2014, improving interoperability of the U.S.-Japan alliance through joint training activities. Japan conducts joint exercises overseas with the U.S. military and has access to new training facilities on Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. Discussions continue on increasing shared-use military facilities to mitigate impacts of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. The DPRI and SACO agreements have led to various actions to reduce noise pollution and increase access for local fishermen in Okinawa. Several plots of land, including Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield and Gimbaru Training Area, have been turned over to local authorities. Recommendations have been made to accelerate the schedule of land returns, especially from Camp Kinser. Officers recommend accelerating land returns, particularly from Camp Kinser, to reduce resentment towards the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. In response to Governor Nakaima's request, the U.S. and Japan reached an environmental stewardship agreement allowing Japanese inspectors early access to reversion facilities. New conduct policies for U.S. troops in Okinawa have led to a significant drop in reported crimes involving military personnel since 2013. Alliance security arrangements have historically been negotiated between Washington and Tokyo, often overlooking local concerns. The political landscape in Okinawa regarding the U.S. military presence is complex and involves leaders from local village wards up to the Prime Minister's office. Prime Minister Hatoyama's involvement in the Futenma controversy in 2009 and 2010 raised tensions between the U.S. and Japan. Despite efforts by previous LDP governments, little progress was made in resolving the challenges of the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. The Abe government seemed to break this stalemate. The Abe government broke the stalemate over the U.S. military presence on Okinawa by pressuring key politicians in late 2013. However, in late 2014, Okinawan citizens voted out Nakaima, who approved the landfill permit for the FRF, and supported the new governor, Takeshi Onaga. Okinawa hosts a disproportionate share of U.S. military facilities and personnel due to its strategic location and history of U.S. occupation. Okinawa hosts a significant portion of U.S. military personnel, with some locals feeling discriminated against by mainland Japan. The Abe Administration has engaged in talks regarding the U.S. military presence, but positions have not changed. Okinawa receives subsidies from the central government in exchange for hosting U.S. troops, with a recent increase in economic development funding announced by Prime Minister Abe. The Okinawa governor's office holds significant influence over developments in the prefecture, with the authority to approve or reject off-shore landfill construction. Former governor Nakaima approved a landfill permit for offshore runways at Camp Schwab, removing the governor's office's political leverage. The central government plans to provide at least 300 billion yen annually through 2021 for economic development in Okinawa. Takeshi Onaga, Nakaima's successor as governor, opposes the plan to relocate Futenma inside Okinawa and has employed various strategies to prevent or delay construction at the Henoko site. Nakaima, initially in favor of the relocation, changed his position due to political shifts and public opposition, calling for the base to be located outside the prefecture during the 2010 gubernatorial campaign. Governor Nakaima requested conditions for his approval of the landfill permit to construct the FRF, including the termination of operations at MCAS Futenma within five years, the return of Camp Kinser within seven years, the deployment of Osprey aircraft outside of Okinawa, and revisions to the SOFA for on-base investigations. Prime Minister Abe agreed to provide financial support for various projects in Okinawa, including a second runway at Naha airport and a railway system. However, the Japanese government cannot act unilaterally on base-related issues without U.S. consent. Governor Nakaima approved the landfill permit, pressuring the Abe government to fulfill promises regarding the U.S. military presence. The U.S. government is willing to negotiate on some issues but rejects closing the Futenma base before a replacement facility is operational. Governor Onaga is using tactics to delay construction at the Henoko site. Governor Onaga attempted to negotiate a new base relocation plan with the central government but faced resistance. He demanded the Ministry of Defense to halt work on offshore landfill at Henoko. An expert commission found the prior approval of the landfill permit to be illegal, leading Onaga to revoke the permit in October 2015. Despite his efforts, a Cabinet Minister rejected Onaga's actions, prompting him to seek screening by a third-party council for dispute resolution. On the political front, Onaga aims to raise awareness of the issue beyond mainland Japan. Onaga has sought wider attention for the issue of U.S. military presence on Okinawa, meeting with U.S. officials to oppose the Futenma relocation plan. His stance has energized anti-base groups in Okinawa and sparked opposition rallies in mainland Japan. The Futenma relocation plan in Nago City, Okinawa faces opposition from Mayor Inamine and some city council members. Despite a majority of voters opposing the new base construction, economic benefits have led to mixed feelings among residents. The Henoko village residents support the relocation of Futenma base for economic benefits, despite opposition from environmentalists. Congress has oversight on military realignment initiatives in Japan and Guam, with doubts raised by Senate Armed Services Committee members. Members of the House Armed Services Committee have supported the Marine Corps realignment in the Asia-Pacific, while three Senators criticized the U.S. military realignment plans in East Asia as \"unworkable and unaffordable.\" Senator Webb proposed alternatives to the realignment plans in East Asia, including transferring Marine Corps assets to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa and moving Air Force assets to Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report stating that the Department of Defense had not adequately estimated the costs involved in the military posture transformation in Japan and Guam. The initial estimate was $10.3 billion. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the actual costs for moving Marines and their dependents to Guam would be more than double the Department of Defense's estimate, at $23.9 billion. Concerns about the escalating costs and uncertainties surrounding the realignment led Congress to reject funding for the plan in the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the costs for moving Marines to Guam would be more than double the Department of Defense's estimate, at $23.9 billion. Congress rejected funding for the plan due to concerns about escalating costs and uncertainties. The planned realignment of Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam was put on hold until certain justifications and assessments were provided, including a Master Plan for construction, progress on the Futenma base relocation, and infrastructure and construction cost plans on Guam. The April 2012 \"de-linking\" agreement did not alleviate congressional concerns. Senators Levin, McCain, and Webb expressed serious unanswered questions to Defense Secretary Panetta. Secretary Panetta raised serious questions about the emerging agreement between the administration and Japan regarding basing arrangements. These questions include cost estimates, military sustainment, force management, and broader strategic operations in the region. Congress has oversight and funding responsibilities for the agreement, and a new proposal should have congressional support. An independent assessment of the U.S. strategic posture in the Asia-Pacific was required by the FY2012 NDAA, with a report delivered by CSIS to the Secretary of Defense in mid-July 2012. The report delivered in mid-July 2012 to the Secretary supported DOD's strategy for U.S. defense posture in East Asia. It recommended implementing the April 2012 agreement, including the construction of the FRF. While the Henoko plan was deemed the best option, budgeting and political obstacles were acknowledged, suggesting exploring other alternatives like Kadena Integration and infrastructure improvements on Guam. The realignment of the Marine Corps in the Asia-Pacific region has been ongoing since 2013, with Congress restricting some spending for the realignment on Guam. The FY2013 NDAA prohibited DOD spending for the realignment on Guam, except for design work, environmental assessments, and construction to support the Marine Corps presence on the island. Senators Webb, Levin, and McCain emphasized the need for DOD to clarify the strategy behind its force-posture planning. The FY2013 NDAA restricted DOD spending for the Marine Corps realignment on Guam, citing concerns about operational risks and wasteful spending. The FY2014 NDAA continued this approach with a freeze on spending, except for some construction projects. The GAO criticized DOD for unreliable cost estimates and a lack of integrated planning for the realignment. Senator McCain reiterated concerns about inadequate planning during a visit to Japan in August 2013. In 2013, Senator McCain expressed concerns about DOD's lack of plans for the Marine Corps realignment. In August 2014, DOD submitted a Master Plan to Congress detailing the future of the Marine Corps on Guam. The Guam Master Plan does not mention the Marine Corps relocation from Okinawa to Hawaii. Construction on the Henoko FRF could support the Marine Corps realignment. Senator McCain praised the approval of the landfill permit in December 2013, paving the way for the FRF construction and U.S. Marines redeployment. Governor Onaga met with U.S. Senators in June 2015. The U.S. Senators affirmed support for the Henoko FRF plan during Governor Onaga's visit in June 2015. The FY2015 NDAA allows DOD to proceed with military construction on Guam, using Japanese government funds. Challenges remain, but Congress' removal of restrictions should aid in the Marine Corps realignment and reducing the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. U.S. and Japanese officials committed to refurbishment projects at MCAS Futenma. Officials committed to refurbishment projects at MCAS Futenma in a joint statement issued by the bilateral Security Consultative Committee in April 2012. The projects are crucial for the base's operations, but Okinawans may see them as a sign that the U.S. and Japan do not plan to close the base as promised. The joint consolidation plan released in April 2013 states that Futenma will be handed over to local authorities no earlier than 2022. The base's location in a densely populated area raises concerns about noise levels and potential incidents that could further fuel opposition to the U.S. military presence on the island. The U.S. Marine Corps replaced CH-46E helicopters with MV-22 Osprey aircraft at the Futenma base in 2012 and 2013, causing public outcry in Okinawa. The arrival of Ospreys in 2013 was met with smaller protests. Concerns about safety and potential crashes persist, with a crash of an HH-60G Pave Hawk in 2013 renewing fears among Okinawans."
