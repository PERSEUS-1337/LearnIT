    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medical Care Revenue Enhancement Act of 2005\" includes a demonstration project to improve business practices of the Veterans Health Administration. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a demonstration project to improve business practices of the Veterans Health Administration through a performance-based contract not exceeding $10,000,000. The project will last for two years starting more than 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project at two medical centers within the same service area of the Veterans Health Administration. The project aims to improve recovery rates from third-party payors. The contractor for the project will be selected within three months after the project's start. The contractor for the demonstration project must have experience in health care charge processing. Functions include standardizing billing activities, reengineering processes, and implementing industry standards for performance measures. The demonstration project requires the establishment of a database with third-party payor information for veterans' healthcare. The Secretary may specify additional business practice requirements. A VHA Project Manager must be designated as a full-time employee at a medical center where the project is conducted. Employee protection measures ensure no reduction in full-time equivalent employees during the project. The Department of Veterans Affairs employees at medical centers conduct a demonstration project. Progress reports on project implementation are submitted to Congress periodically after specific time periods. The progress reports on the implementation of the demonstration project, including steps towards contractor selection and project initiation, are submitted to Congress periodically within a 180-day period from the contract award. The Secretary will submit interim reports to Congress on the operation of the demonstration project, including assessments on debt recovery, contractor performance, and estimated cost savings to the Department. After the conclusion of the demonstration project, the Secretary will submit a final report to Congress, including recommendations for implementing the recovery system permanently and expanding it to other Veterans Health Administration facilities. The Comptroller General will review the project continuously and submit reports. The Comptroller General will submit reports to Congress on findings and recommendations regarding the demonstration project after one and two years of operation. $10,000,000 is authorized for the project under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs."
