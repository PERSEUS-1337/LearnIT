    "content": "The Klamath River Basin, located along the California-Oregon border, has been a focal point for water and species management discussions. Severe drought conditions in 2001 intensified competition for scarce water resources, leading to conflicts among various interests. The federal government's significant role in water management in the region is due to the operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Water Project and management of federal lands, including wildlife refuges. The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) aim to settle water allocation issues for irrigators and wildlife refuges, restore fish species, and potentially remove non-federal hydroelectric dams. Signed in 2010 by various groups, including state and non-federal interests, these agreements address key environmental and economic concerns in the Klamath River Basin. The Klamath River Basin, spanning Oregon and California, is the focus of agreements involving water allocation, restoration of fish species, and potential removal of non-federal hydroelectric dams. Congressional oversight and authorization are required for key components of these agreements, with current focus likely on their implications. The Klamath Basin, spanning Oregon and California, drains into the Klamath River and is one of the largest systems in the western United States for flow and salmon production. It has a total population of approximately 287,000 with a total economic output of $10 billion. Native American tribes make up 6% of the population. The basin is divided into Upper and Lower subbasins for water management purposes. The Upper Klamath Basin, part of the Klamath River system, includes Oregon's largest lake, Upper Klamath Lake. It covers 8,060 square miles but only contributes 12% of the basin's water runoff. Upper Klamath Lake is shallow and nutrient-rich, worsened by agricultural development, making it \"hypereutrophic.\" Upper Klamath Lake is now hypereutrophic due to agricultural development, causing excessive algae blooms and harm to resident species. The Klamath Project diverts water for irrigation, converting fish habitat into farmland and providing water for 1,400 farms in the Upper Basin. The project relies on Upper Klamath Lake for storage, but its shallowness makes storing water difficult. The Klamath Project in the Upper Klamath Lake area faces challenges due to the lake's shallowness, making water storage for irrigation difficult. The project relies on annual precipitation and snowmelt for water supply, lacking a hydroelectric component. Approximately 180,000 acres of irrigated lands in the upper basin are not dependent on the project for deliveries, with agriculture being a significant part of the local economy. Major crops include wheat, malt barley, potatoes, onions, and alfalfa. Agriculture in the Upper Klamath Basin includes wheat, malt barley, potatoes, onions, and alfalfa, with an estimated annual value of $156 million in 2007. Agriculture accounts for 10% of jobs and 7.3% of economic activity in the region, supporting other sectors. The area also includes six wildlife refuges known as the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex, attracting migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway. Irrigation water from the Klamath Project also supports the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge. The Klamath Project provides water to the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge and the Tule Lake NWR. These refuges have a unique agreement for farming. Two endangered fish species, Lost River and shortnose suckers, are important in water allocation debates due to declines attributed to various factors. The Klamath Tribe relies on suckers for ceremonial purposes and sustenance. Iron Gate Dam blocks salmon passage, but historical studies suggest significant runs of Chinook and coho salmon existed north of the dam. The Lower Klamath Basin contributes 88% of the basin's runoff and receives water from four tributaries. The Lower Klamath Basin receives water from four tributaries: the Shasta, Scott, Salmon, and Trinity rivers. Agriculture is a prominent activity in the Lower Basin, with irrigated agriculture using water from these rivers. The area is also managed by the U.S. Forest Service for various purposes. The Lower Klamath River provides habitat for 13 anadromous fish species, including coho salmon, Chinook salmon, and steelhead. The population of coho salmon in the area has significantly declined since the mid-20th century. The coho salmon population in the Lower Klamath Basin has declined significantly since the mid-20th century. Coho were listed as threatened under the ESA in 1997. A petition to list the Upper Klamath and Trinity Rivers Chinook salmon ESU was submitted in 2011, with NMFS expected to make a decision on listing in early 2012. The Klamath also supports a fall run of Chinook salmon and winter and summer runs of steelhead below Iron Gate Dam. The steelhead population in the Klamath basin below Iron Gate Dam has also declined, but is not in danger of extinction. Salmon are crucial for tribes in the Lower Basin, like the Yurok, Hoopa Valley, and Karuk, who have suffered economic and cultural impacts from the decline in salmon populations. The tribes have rights to 50% of the Chinook salmon harvest and have reported significant catches in the past. The decline in salmon has affected cultural events like the First Salmon Ceremony, marking the passage of the first spring Chinook salmon up the Klamath River. The Klamath River supports commercial and sport fisheries off California and Oregon coasts, with Chinook salmon being a significant source of revenue. Commercial fishing in the area has generated nearly $6 million annually since 1986, but restrictive regulations and low fish populations have harmed local economies. The Lower Basin waters are managed by Reclamation as part of the California Central Valley Project, including the Trinity River Division. The Trinity River Division (TRD) of the Central Valley Project, completed in 1964, diverts water from the Trinity River to the Sacramento River watershed. Congress directed restoration efforts in 1984 to restore fish and wildlife levels in the Trinity River ecosystem. Ongoing restoration activities have increased Trinity River flows and addressed water quality issues. The Lower Klamath River's water quality affects species migrating to the Trinity River, including Trinity River salmon. Stakeholders on the Trinity River, like the Hoopa Valley Tribe, are involved in Klamath River restoration debates. There are seven dams on the Klamath River and its tributaries, with six owned by PacifiCorp known as the Klamath Hydroelectric Project (KHP). The dams provide hydroelectric power for the basin and regulate water for hydroelectric generation at other dams. The Klamath Hydroelectric Project (KHP) consists of seven dams, six owned by PacifiCorp, regulating water for hydroelectric generation and serving other purposes like irrigation and recreation. These dams, built between 1918 and 1962, provide approximately 2% of PacifiCorp's total electric generating capacity. J.C. Boyle and Iron Gate dams include structures to mitigate effects on fisheries. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for licensing. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for licensing non-federal dams like the Klamath Hydroelectric Project (KHP). The original FERC license for the KHP expired in 2006, and PacifiCorp applied for relicensing in 2004. FERC issued an environmental impact statement in 2007 with recommendations for fish passage and environmental upgrades. However, a new long-term license has not been granted due to issues with state certification under the Clean Water Act and negotiations. The KHP is currently operating on a temporary annual license. Six federally recognized tribes in the Klamath Basin, ranging in size and living in different parts of the river, play a significant role in natural resource debates. Fisheries and other resources are crucial for these tribes, but their interests and agreements vary, sometimes leading to conflicts. Three of the six tribes have signed agreements so far. The Klamath Basin is home to six tribes with varying interests and agreements, leading to conflicts at times. Three tribes - Klamath, Yurok, and Karuk - have signed agreements. The Klamath Tribe's water rights have been contentious due to a treaty with Congress in 1864, granting exclusive fishing rights. The Supreme Court recognizes implied water rights for reservations, with the Klamath Tribe needing water for fishing, hunting, and gathering. The Klamath Tribe's water rights, with a priority date of the reservation, have been a source of tension among Klamath River water users since the tribe's reservation was terminated in 1954. Courts have recognized the tribe's reserved water rights, with hunting and fishing rights dating back to \"time immemorial\" and irrigation rights to 1864. Tension persists among different tribes in the Klamath Basin despite previous decisions acknowledging the Klamath Tribe's water rights. The state of Oregon is currently undertaking a water rights adjudication to quantify historic water rights, including tribal reserved water rights, in the Klamath Basin. This process aims to clarify tribal rights and address tensions between tribes and non-tribal water users. The Klamath Project has faced water and species management issues, with significant events in 2001, 2002, and 2006 bringing national attention to the region. In 2001, Reclamation reduced water deliveries to the Klamath Project to protect endangered fish. In 2002, thousands of fish died due to poor water conditions. In 2006, NOAA restricted ocean fishing for salmon. The federal government provided emergency funding of at least $170 million in response to these events in the Klamath Basin. Between 2001 and 2008, the federal government provided emergency aid totaling approximately $35 million and $60 million for events in the Klamath Basin. Additional funding was allocated for a pilot water bank, drought initiatives, and farm bill provisions. The focus of the report shifts to settlement agreements in Appendix B. Between 2001 and 2008, the federal government provided emergency aid totaling approximately $35 million and $60 million for events in the Klamath Basin. The focus then shifts to settlement agreements in Appendix B, which aims to address water and endangered species issues in the Klamath Basin through talks led by the federal government between 2002 and 2010. Participants included state governments, tribes, counties, irrigators, fishermen, and conservation groups, resulting in the signing of the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) in February 2010. The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) outline actions to restore fish populations, provide water and power supplies, and remove dams. Congressional authorization, secretarial determination on dam removal, and funding are required for implementation. The KBRA and KHSA agreements, while not directly involving Congress, are essential for full implementation. They are officially linked, with signatories supporting simultaneous enactment. Some provisions assume additional actions. The KBRA, negotiated between 2005-2010, aims to restore fish populations, ensure water and power supplies, and remove dams in the Klamath Basin. The KBRA aims to provide water assurances for agricultural users, communities, and wildlife refuges in the Klamath Basin. It would allocate water based on inflow scenarios, with surplus supplies for other uses. The agreement also includes funding for fisheries restoration and assurances for dam removal. Tribes would agree not to assert water and fishery rights in exchange for these benefits. The KBRA aims to provide water assurances for agricultural users, communities, and wildlife refuges in the Klamath Basin. It includes funding for fisheries restoration, dam removal, and allocation of water based on inflow scenarios. Tribes would give up water and fishery rights in exchange for benefits, with federal responsibilities contingent on Congress enacting authorizing legislation. The KBRA aims to provide water assurances for agricultural users, communities, and wildlife refuges in the Klamath Basin. It includes funding for fisheries restoration, dam removal, and allocation of water based on inflow scenarios. Tribes would give up water and fishery rights in exchange for benefits, with federal responsibilities contingent on Congress enacting authorizing legislation. Parties are not bound by promises or obligations from the federal government. Funding for KBRA actions would be discretionary if authorized by Congress. State governments have similar flexibility. The KBRA's fisheries program aims to restore Klamath Basin fisheries, complementing the KHSA by opening habitat above Iron Gate Dam to anadromous species. The KBRA aims to open 420 miles of habitat above Iron Gate Dam to anadromous species like salmon, steelhead, and lamprey through habitat restoration, fish reintroduction, monitoring, and improving flow conditions and water quality. The goals include restoring and maintaining fish habitats, establishing sustainable fish populations, and providing harvest opportunities. The fish restoration process would occur in two phases, with priorities and criteria set for projects over the next 10 years. The KBRA aims to open 420 miles of habitat above Iron Gate Dam to anadromous species like salmon, steelhead, and lamprey through habitat restoration, fish reintroduction, monitoring, and improving flow conditions and water quality. Phase I actions would be monitored by the federal government to determine effectiveness and develop phase II of the restoration plan, collaborating with the Klamath Basin Coordinating Council and considering public input. The main goal is to reestablish anadromous species in the Upper Basin above Iron Gate Dam. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has adopted a plan to establish self-sustaining populations of Chinook, steelhead, and lamprey in the area. The plan includes investigations to determine resources needed for reintroduction and actions to manage the populations once reestablished. Screening of irrigation diversions is crucial to prevent entrainment of reintroduced fish. The Water Resources Program (WRP) of the KBRA aims to provide more water for fish by limiting water diversion from the Klamath River. Additional measures in the WRP include water leasing and storage to increase water availability for fish. The KBRA aims to increase water availability for fish through measures like water leasing, conservation, and additional storage. It includes commitments to minimize adverse impacts from reintroducing aquatic species above Iron Gate Dam. The KBRA also requires consideration of alternatives to water use limitations related to the Klamath Reclamation Project, while attempting to minimize future impacts on listed fish species under the ESA. The KBRA aims to settle water resource issues in the Klamath Basin through a Water Resources Program, establishing set schedules for water diversions and funding efforts to increase water supplies and develop new power sources. The agreement also includes commitments to minimize impacts on listed fish species and encourages dispute resolution before litigation. The KBRA aims to settle water resource issues in the Klamath Basin through a Water Resources Program, establishing set schedules for water diversions and funding efforts to increase water supplies and develop new, low-cost power. The agreement includes provisions for a defined range of water diversions for the Klamath Project and refuges, with estimated costs of $258 million in federal funds. This aims to prevent legal challenges and potential shut off of Klamath Project waters, as seen in 2001. The KBRA establishes diversion limits for the Klamath Project and Refuges based on forecast water inflows, potentially reducing the likelihood of legal action. The limits are tied to three inflow scenarios and trigger corresponding allocations for water usage during different periods. The KBRA sets diversion limits for the Klamath Project and Refuges based on forecasted water inflows, aiming to reduce legal disputes. These limits vary depending on inflow scenarios and determine water allocations for different periods. In \"dry\" years, the Reclamation Project may see increased diversions, but overall, allocations are expected to decrease compared to past years. Efforts funded under the KBRA are intended to reduce project-related surface water demand, with the exact impact still unclear. Refuges are set to receive more water on a consistent schedule, except during \"extreme drought\" years designated by Oregon, where support for diversions is not required. A \"Drought Plan\" placeholder allows for additional water allocation to fish and wildlife during low water years, potentially modifying allocations in some \"dry\" years. The KBRA outlines strategies for drought designation, including payments for reduced irrigation diversions. The Off-Project Water Program settles water rights disputes and proposes a Water-Use Retirement Program to increase inflows into Klamath Lake. The WRP also aims to expand water storage and availability in the basin. The KBRA aims to expand water storage in the basin through various efforts, including reconnecting Barnes Ranch and Agency Lake Ranch for additional storage, and investigating additional storage options in Long Lake. \"Environmental water\" in the KBRA refers to water intended to benefit fish species and aquatic resources in the Klamath Basin. The KBRA does not define specific water allocations for environmental water but assumes any excess water will go towards environmental purposes. It allows for leasing farmland within refuges and supports practices that enhance waterfowl management. The KBRA does not determine or quantify water rights. The KBRA provides a framework for settling disputes between Klamath Project users and tribal water rights holders, limiting diversions to enhance fisheries. Tribes agree not to assert claims against the US related to water management decisions. The KBRA also includes provisions for low-cost power to replace hydropower and withdrawal of certain claims in the Klamath Basin Adjudication. The KBRA aims to provide low-cost power supplies for Klamath Project and off-project irrigators, funding new renewable power development to replace previous sources. Reclamation would pursue preference power from Bonneville Power Administration. Total costs for power provisions estimated at $50 million. Other actions outside of fish restoration and water/power supplies are termed \"sustainable communities.\" The KBRA aims to ensure sustainable communities in the Klamath Basin, with a focus on economic well-being for tribes and counties. Four basin tribes participated in negotiations, with three agreeing not to assert their rights over defined allocations in exchange for support for economic revitalization projects and fisheries restoration. The agreement also includes funding for the transfer of privately owned land to the Klamath Tribe. The KBRA aims to ensure sustainable communities in the Klamath Basin by providing economic support to tribes and counties. It includes funding for tribal commitments, compensation for lost property taxes, and regulatory assurances. The total federal cost for tribal commitments was estimated at $87 million, with additional costs if the Hoopa Valley Tribe joins. Oregon and California are expected to cover the estimated $23 million for lost property taxes. The KBRA provides regulatory assurances for federal agencies implementing regulations relevant to the Klamath Basin. It includes actions to avoid negative impacts on users, a process for issuing biological opinions, and consideration of actions like water retirement and wetlands restoration to benefit fisheries. Coordination and oversight are primarily conducted by the Klamath Basin stakeholders. The KBRA is overseen by the Klamath Basin Coordinating Council, promoting collaboration among stakeholders and coordinating implementation. The Council also manages restoration activities, dispute resolution, and public involvement through various committees. The KBRA involves a variety of stakeholders from agriculture, recreation, commercial fishing, environmental, tribal, recreational, and county interests. Advisory groups like the Klamath Basin Advisory Council (KBAC) and Technical Advisory Team (TAT) provide recommendations for implementing the Restoration Agreement. A Technical Advisory Team (TAT) and an Upper Basin Team (UBT) would be created to provide recommendations on water management and oversee the Water Use Retirement Program in the Klamath Basin. The KBRA estimates $3.3 million for coordination and oversight activities. The Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) outlines a process for potential removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp. It includes provisions for interim dam operation, transfer, decommissioning, and removal. Additionally, PacifiCorp would transfer Keno Dam to the Bureau of Reclamation and relinquish its role as operator of Link River Dam. The KHSA outlines a process for potential removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp. It includes provisions for interim dam operation, transfer, decommissioning, and removal. PacifiCorp would transfer Keno Dam to the Bureau of Reclamation and relinquish its role as operator of Link River Dam. Implementation of certain components of the KHSA requires authorization by Congress, with ongoing actions not explicitly needing congressional approval. The dam removal study, a central component of the KHSA, is being conducted under Reclamation's general authorities. However, a congressional authorization is necessary to finalize the Secretary's determination on dam removal. The Secretary is expected to make a final determination on dam removal by late March 2012. The KHSA outlines the process for potential removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp. It includes provisions for interim dam operation, transfer, decommissioning, and removal. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to answer two central questions related to dam removal by March 31, 2012: Will facilities removal advance restoration of salmon fisheries? Is facilities removal in the public interest? If dam removal is not recommended, a Detailed Plan must be prepared for implementing dam removal. The KHSA outlines the process for potential removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp. If dam removal is not recommended, a Detailed Plan must be prepared for implementing dam removal. In the event of a negative determination, the KHSA requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide prior notice so parties can consider potential changes to the original agreement. If no agreement is reached, all dams would remain under PacifiCorp's ownership, and the FERC relicensing process would resume. The agreement provides detailed requirements for an affirmative determination on dam removal, which could take different forms depending on the designated entity. The KHSA outlines preconditions for dam removal, including passage of federal legislation, state funding approvals, cost overrun plan, and state concurrence with dam removal entity designation. Ownership of dams would transfer to the removal entity after these conditions are met. After meeting preconditions outlined in the KHSA, ownership of dams would transfer to the removal entity. PacifiCorp would operate the dams for electricity until at least 2019, with removal scheduled for 2020. The removal entity, whether federal or non-federal, must develop a plan specifying dam removal actions. Dam removal costs are capped at $450 million, with $200 million from ratepayer increases and $250 million from the State of California. The KHSA outlines the transfer of dam ownership to a removal entity after meeting preconditions. Dam removal costs are capped at $450 million, with estimates ranging from $238 million to $493 million. Stakeholder views on the Klamath agreements vary, with some supporting and others opposing them. A majority of interest groups involved in settlement negotiations endorsed both agreements, citing varied reasons for support such as water certainty and dam removal. Opponents have concerns about economic damages, lack of environmental protections, and subversion of laws. Parties supporting the agreements include states of Oregon and California, tribes, counties, and environmental groups. Other groups and individuals were not part of the agreements. Supporters of the agreements, including states of California and Oregon, as well as the Obama Administration, believe that the agreements offer a potential solution to long-standing resource conflicts in the Upper and Lower Basins. They highlight the costs incurred from previous conflicts, such as supplemental funding, crop insurance payments, federal agency actions, and litigation costs. They argue that linking the agreements is crucial for addressing these issues. Supporters of the agreements believe they offer a potential solution to long-standing resource conflicts in the Upper and Lower Basins, highlighting the costs incurred from previous conflicts. Various groups support specific provisions in the agreements, such as environmental groups supporting irrigation allocations in exchange for dam removal assurances. PacifiCorp supports dam removal under the agreements. PacifiCorp supports dam removal under the KHSA as the most cost-effective option for its ratepayers, avoiding costly improvements for fish passage and water quality. The agreement allows for partial dam removal funded by ratepayers and the State of California, while also permitting the company to operate the dams until 2019. Some groups and individuals oppose the Klamath agreements and argue against their authorization. Some parties oppose the Klamath agreements, citing concerns about damaging the region's economy and putting farmers out of business. Notable opponents include Siskiyou County, the Klamath Off-Project Water Users Association, various tribes, and environmental organizations like Waterwatch of Oregon and Oregon Wild. Some residents and officials oppose dam removal due to potential loss of property taxes and lake frontage. The agreements are criticized for not adequately benefiting fisheries and giving too much to farmers. The Hoopa Valley Tribe is critical of the lack of defined water amounts for fish and doubts federal funding for restoration actions. Uncertainties in fisheries restoration under the KBRA are also highlighted. Some environmental groups oppose the Klamath agreements, citing disproportionate benefits to PacifiCorp and irrigators at the expense of fisheries. Waterwatch of Oregon and Oregon Wild criticize various provisions, including the lack of performance metrics for fisheries restoration. Some environmental groups, including Waterwatch of Oregon and Oregon Wild, criticize the Klamath agreements for lacking defined water supplies for fish and allowing lease-land farming on wildlife refuges. They call for voiding the agreements and resuming water quality certification processes under the Clean Water Act to push for dam upgrades or removal. Congressional authorization is needed for the agreements to move forward, with bills introduced in the 112th Congress to authorize them without significant changes. Congress may focus on endorsing strategies and actions in the Klamath agreements, considering federal obligations and expenditures, and the role of the federal government in the basin. Explicit authorizations are likely needed for many provisions to move forward. Without congressional authorization, provisions in the Klamath agreements, such as dam removal and various programs, may not be able to proceed. Supporters argue that the federal government has a responsibility to address issues in the basin due to its significant role in resource allocation conflicts. Congress must decide on the extent of federal involvement in endorsing the Klamath legislation. The Klamath agreements, involving the Reclamation Project, ESA implementation, and fisheries management, are seen as a crucial consensus to solve regional issues. Supporters believe they will save the government from future costs and create job opportunities. Opponents argue the government is not obligated to approve the agreements, as similar actions could occur through existing processes. Some stakeholders believe the Klamath agreements amount to federal overreach and may harm the local economy, particularly in agriculture and recreation. Others argue against federal authorization due to concerns about undermining existing laws and responsibilities, or failing to achieve goals. The cost to the federal government for implementing the agreements is a major point of contention. The federal government funds actions in the KBRA, including water resources, fisheries restoration, and tribal components. The estimated federal costs for implementing the Klamath agreements have been revised downward to $798.5 million over 15 years. Approximately $262 million in ongoing funding could be redirected towards KBRA actions, resulting in a lower figure of $536 million for new federal funding. Any proposals for new federal funding could potentially alter this split. Proposals for new federal funding under existing authorities could potentially alter the split of funding for the Klamath agreements. Cost estimates for dam removal under the KHSA have not changed significantly, with initial studies estimating potential costs of $290 million. A major question is whether the Secretary will recommend the federal government as the dam removal entity and how additional costs, such as those from lawsuits, would be handled. There is no formal estimate of potential future savings to state and federal governments associated with the agreements. Supporters of the Klamath agreements argue that enacting them could lead to cost savings for federal and state governments, potentially reducing the need for additional aid and litigation expenses. They believe that the agreements would encourage parties to pursue alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, decreasing the likelihood of future litigation costs. However, opponents point out that these savings are not guaranteed, and supplemental appropriations and litigation expenditures may still be necessary. Additionally, supporters suggest that the agreements could bring about significant economic benefits. The Department of Interior estimated the value of restoring the Klamath at $15-$84 billion, but many dispute these estimates as unrealistic and question the methodologies used. Obtaining new funds and appropriations for restoration activities may be challenging due to procedural hurdles in the House and a constrained budgetary environment. In a constrained budgetary environment, lack of appropriations or progress in the KBRA could impact support for agreements among parties, potentially leading to conflicts. Congressional authorization of agreements would endorse federal actions and provisions like dam removal, which requires study and congressional approval. Authorization for the Secretary of the Interior to make final determinations on dam removal is a crucial step in the process. Congress's decision on legislation will play a key role in determining if dam removal will proceed. Some argue that granting the Secretary this authority is equivalent to congressional approval for dam removal, while others believe it may not necessarily stop dam removal if alternative processes are pursued. The Klamath agreements present complex questions for Congress to consider. The Klamath agreements present complex questions for Congress to consider, including the potential end or limitation of conflicts in the Klamath Basin. While the agreements aim to settle some legal conflicts, they do not determine water rights or resolve all claims in the basin. The Klamath Basin Adjudication will continue to address outstanding claims by water users. The KBRA addresses claims between Klamath Project water users and tribal water users, allowing for future claims by other parties. Fish population declines have various causes, and restoration efforts will vary in success. Restoration efforts in the Klamath ecosystem face uncertainties due to various factors like ocean conditions and climate change. Removing lower dams on the Klamath River could open up 420 miles of fish habitat, decrease algal blooms, and improve salmon survival. The KBRA aims to enhance habitat, screen diversions, and mimic natural river conditions. The draft environmental impact study in 2011 by DOI suggested that removing four dams on the Klamath River could benefit fisheries, with an 81% increase in Chinook salmon production and restoration of 68 miles of potential coho habitat. Supporters believe dam removal would lead to long-term gains for the Klamath Basin's fisheries. Some argue that long-term benefits of dam removal may be overshadowed by short-term harm from sediment release. DOI suggests timing removal in winter to minimize impact on fish migrations. An expert panel funded by Fish and Wildlife Service warns of high suspended sediment levels for up to eight months, impacting spawning gravels for years. Benefits of dam removal depend on resolving pre-existing water quality issues in the Klamath River. The Klamath River issues can be addressed through the KBRA, with dam removal alone not enough to restore salmon and other fish. Resident species like Lost River and shortnose suckers may benefit from KBRA fisheries and water programs. Improving water quality in Klamath Lake is challenging due to natural conditions, but KBRA actions could enhance stream flows and water quality, benefiting species productivity. Potential impacts of dam removal on the basin have been studied, including sediment release concerns and impacts on fish migrations. Potential impacts of dam removal on the Klamath River basin include loss of flood storage, reduced property values, decreased white water rafting opportunities, and loss of hydroelectric power. The dams represent 2% of PacifiCorp's generating capacity, producing 716,000 MWh annually, with potential greenhouse gas emissions from replacement power sources. The DOI studied the economic effects of agreements related to dam removal on the Klamath River, estimating $225 million in benefits to various sectors. They projected $1.32 billion in forgone hydropower benefits and $41 million in forgone recreation benefits. The potential impact on the Endangered Species Act implementation is still uncertain. The Klamath agreements may impact the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, with disagreements on the extent of the impact. Supporters believe the agreements will be considered under the ESA, but it is unclear how this will be accommodated. Some groups argue that certain provisions, like water allocations for irrigators, could undermine the ESA. Supporters of the Klamath agreements believe they will provide more resources to improve environmental quality for listed fish species, leading to positive mitigation actions. However, some groups argue that the defined water allocations for irrigators could harm fish species and undermine the Endangered Species Act. The agreements could also put pressure on rulemaking agencies to adopt biological opinions favoring the Water Resources Program. The Klamath agreements aim to improve water quality to increase fish abundance, encouraging voluntary actions from landowners. Some believe these agreements could lead to more cooperative efforts for species recovery. There is debate on whether the agreements should be considered separately by Congress or altered to remove controversial elements. Signatories have stated their support is contingent on both agreements being authorized concurrently. The Klamath agreements aim to improve water quality and increase fish abundance through voluntary actions from landowners. There is debate on whether Congress should consider authorizing the agreements separately or altering them to remove controversial elements. Signatories support both agreements being authorized concurrently to avoid fracturing the coalition of supporters. If Congress materially changes the agreements, it could trigger meet-and-confer or dispute resolution processes outlined in the agreements. Some groups suggest alternative solutions to the issues addressed in the Klamath agreements, arguing that processes under the Clean Water Act or FERC relicensing could prompt PacifiCorp to take action on dam removal or fish passage sooner than the 2020 deadline set in the agreements. Supporters of the agreements disagree, stating that such a process would be contentious and lengthy. Some argue that the current status quo may be preferable to the provisions in the Klamath agreements, citing existing federal spending and potential future costs of litigation. They believe that prolonging conflicts in the basin is better than the trade-offs made in the agreements. Without congressional authorization of the agreements, federal actions could be hindered, including dam removal and water rights assurances under the KBRA. Ongoing activities like operation of Klamath projects would likely continue regardless. The Klamath agreements could face termination if Congress does not enact the required legislation. Parties may amend the agreements to make them more acceptable or continue with ongoing activities despite the lack of authorization. The agreements aim to resolve conflicts among various interest groups but are viewed differently by different stakeholders. The Klamath Basin agreements aim to resolve long-term issues but depend on complex ecological processes. Congress must consider costs, benefits, and potential scenarios. Recent controversies stem from Reclamation's operation of the Klamath Project affecting endangered species. The controversy in the Klamath Basin arose in April 2001 when Reclamation's proposed operation of the project jeopardized endangered species. This led to a decision to withhold water from farms, impacting around 200,000 acres of land. Farmers threatened to forcibly open Reclamation head gates in response. In July 2001, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton announced additional water release from Upper Klamath Lake to Klamath Project irrigators, providing about 30% of their usual water supply. Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge did not receive water from the lake but obtained water from other sources. Regional economic losses were partially offset by measures including over $30 million in funding. The 2001 Reclamation plan had some mitigating measures, such as federal disaster payments, additional water allocations, and water from banks and pumping. A 2002 study found that the regional economy did better than expected due to crop insurance and disaster assistance programs. However, the economic impact varied for individual irrigators, with some facing severe water shortages while others were not affected. The controversy surrounding the 2001 biological opinions led to a review of the scientific findings by the Secretary of the Interior. In 2001, the Secretary of the Interior sought a review of scientific decisions by the National Research Council regarding Upper Klamath Lake management regimes. The committee found insufficient data to support the proposed regimes for the 2001 growing season. In 2002, a \"Fish Crisis\" occurred when thousands of adult salmon died in the lowermost 40 miles of the Klamath River mainstem, prompting renewed water management concerns. In 2002, a significant fish kill in the Klamath River prompted concerns about water management decisions made by the Klamath Project. Despite increased rainfall, water deliveries to farms were based on agreements with NMFS and FWS, leading to reduced mainstem flow below Iron Gate Dam, potentially impacting coho salmon populations. The Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations and others filed a lawsuit to challenge these reduced flows. The court found the 2002 biological opinion and agency action to be arbitrary and capricious, allowing their implementation for short-term flows. The FWS and NMFS released draft biological opinions indicating that Reclamation's 10-year plan would jeopardize sucker species and downriver coho salmon. Higher lake levels were not required except in dry years. The PCFFA lawsuit challenged Reclamation's plan, criticized by fishermen and the California Department. The final biological opinions from FWS and NMFS, released on May 31, 2002, found Reclamation's 10-year plan likely to jeopardize ESA-listed species. NMFS focused on depletions of Iron Gate Dam flows, increasing risk to coho salmon, while FWS focused on sucker losses at Project dams, water quality effects, and habitat loss in Upper Klamath Lake. FWS and NMFS developed alternatives to avoid jeopardizing effects of Project operations. Reclamation rejected final biological opinions for the 10-year plan and operated under a one-year plan instead. Despite claiming compliance with the opinions, over 33,000 adult salmon died in September 2002, mainly Chinook salmon. Controversial water management decisions in the Upper Basin were believed to contribute to the fish kill, but the direct cause was an epizootic disease. Stressful conditions and other factors also played a role. The fish kill in September 2002, mainly Chinook salmon, was caused by an epizootic disease. Factors like high fish densities, low river flow, warm water temperatures, and impeded fish passage contributed to the spread of the disease. The conditions were ideal for pathogens to infect salmon, leading to a high number of salmon deaths. The 2006 Klamath Fishery Disaster Determination highlighted the importance of Klamath River fall Chinook salmon stocks in the commercial salmon troll fishery. When Klamath returns fall below 35,000 naturally spawning adults, the fishery may face closure. This decision is based on the impact of weak Klamath Chinook salmon stocks on the overall fishery. In 2006, weak Klamath Chinook salmon stock led to restrictions in the West coast ocean salmon fishery due to low spawning numbers. Factors like poor ocean conditions and diseases contributed to the decline. Regulations were implemented to limit catch, resulting in an 81% decrease in landings compared to previous years. Governors of Oregon and California sought a fishery disaster declaration based on the 2006 forecast. In 2006, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary of Commerce for the Klamath River fall Chinook salmon based on low returns. $60.4 million was allocated for affected recipients, and assistance was distributed to Oregon and California fishermen and Indian tribes. Despite improvements in 2007, the 2008 ocean fishery was limited by low salmon returns. In 2008, the ocean fishery was limited by low fall Chinook salmon returns to the Sacramento River."
