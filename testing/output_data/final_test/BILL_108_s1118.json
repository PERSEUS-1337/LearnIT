The Champlain Valley has significant cultural and natural resources, with evidence of human habitation since the glaciers retreated. The waterways in the area played a crucial role in the establishment and development of the United States and Canada during different eras, including European exploration by Samuel de Champlain. The Champlain Valley has rich historical resources, with well-preserved artifacts and structures from eras such as exploration by Samuel de Champlain, military campaigns like the French and Indian War, American Revolution, and War of 1812, and maritime commerce with canals, boats, and steamships. These eras are best described by the theme \"The Making of Nations and Corridors of Commerce.\" The Champlain Valley has a rich historical heritage shared with Canada and Quebec, with a focus on heritage tourism to boost the economy while preserving historical resources. The theme of \"The Making of Nations and Corridors of Commerce\" is central to the region's history. The Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership was established to recognize the historical, cultural, and recreational resources of the region in Vermont and New York. Its purpose is to assist in preserving and interpreting these resources for the benefit of present and future generations. The Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership aims to preserve, protect, and interpret resources for the benefit of the people of the United States. It seeks to revitalize the economy and increase tourism in the Champlain Valley, encourage partnerships among governments and organizations, and collaborate with Canada and Quebec to promote the history of the region.
