    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. The Congress finds that returning brownfield sites to productive use could create jobs and generate new tax revenues, while also protecting natural resources and open spaces. Lack of funding for redevelopment is a major obstacle, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a key role in supporting community development and land use in urban areas through grants under the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's initiative provides funding for brownfields redevelopment, including land acquisition and economic development activities. To be eligible for grant funds, communities must pledge community development block grant funds as collateral for a loan guarantee. Delinking grants from loan guarantees removes a barrier for many local communities. The Act aims to provide cities and towns with more flexibility and accessibility for brownfields development by offering incentives and separating grants for brownfields from community development block grant funds. SEC. 123 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 introduces the Brownfields Development Initiative to promote the redevelopment of contaminated sites. The Secretary may award grants to eligible public entities and Indian tribes for environmental cleanup and development of brownfield sites, including mine-scarred lands.
