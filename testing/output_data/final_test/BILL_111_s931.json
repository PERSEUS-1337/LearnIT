    "content": "The \"Arbitration Fairness Act of 2009\" may be cited as the Act. The Act includes findings. The Federal Arbitration Act was originally intended for disputes between commercial entities of similar power but now applies to consumer and employment disputes, leading to many individuals being forced into binding arbitration. Private arbitration clauses strip individuals of their rights, often without their awareness. These clauses are becoming increasingly common in various industries, forcing people to give up their rights as a condition for employment, medical care, purchasing goods, and more. Arbitration companies may be biased towards corporate interests, undermining public law for civil and consumer rights. Arbitrators in mandatory arbitration have significant freedom to ignore laws and rules, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability in protecting civil and consumer rights. Corporations often include unfair provisions in arbitration clauses that disadvantage individuals, such as stripping them of statutory rights and banning class actions. Some courts have upheld unfair mandatory arbitration clauses, stripping individuals of their rights and banning class actions, despite supposed Federal policy favoring arbitration over individual rights. SEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF EMPLOYMENT, CONSUMER, FRANCHISE, AND CIVIL RIGHTS DISPUTES. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended to include a new chapter on arbitration of various disputes. The text defines a \"civil rights dispute\" as a dispute related to discrimination based on race, sex, disability, religion, national origin, or other factors in various areas such as education, employment, housing, and government programs. The term 'consumer dispute' refers to a disagreement between an individual seeking real or personal property, services, money, or credit for personal, family, or household purposes and the seller or provider of such goods or services. The term 'employment dispute' refers to a disagreement between an employer and employee as defined in the Fair Labor Standards Act. The term 'franchise dispute' refers to a disagreement between a franchisee and franchisor related to a contract granting the right to operate a business under a prescribed marketing plan. The text discusses the validity and enforceability of predispute arbitration agreements in various disputes such as employment, consumer, franchise, or civil rights disputes. It states that such agreements shall not be valid or enforceable in these cases. The applicability of this chapter to arbitration agreements is determined by Federal law. The court, not the arbitrator, decides the validity and enforceability of such agreements. This chapter does not apply to arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements. The amendment waives the right of an employee to seek judicial enforcement of rights under the Constitution, State constitution, or statutes. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended with technical changes. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended with technical changes related to the application of certain chapters and sections. Title 9 of the United States Code is amended with technical changes related to the application of certain chapters and sections, including the item relating to section 208.

The effective date of this Act and its amendments is the date of enactment, applying to disputes or claims arising thereafter."
