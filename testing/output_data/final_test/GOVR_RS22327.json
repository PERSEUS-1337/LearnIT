    "content": "Division C defines a \"covered person\" to include the United States and individuals involved in the administration or use of covered countermeasures. Immunity from tort liability is granted under the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims related to the design, development, testing, manufacture, distribution, and use of covered countermeasures. Covered countermeasures include qualified pandemic or epidemic products, security countermeasures, and certain drugs or biological products. The terms \"qualified pandemic or epidemic product,\" \"security countermeasure,\" and authorized drugs or biological products are defined in Division C. Qualified pandemic or epidemic product refers to products used to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat, or cure a pandemic or epidemic. Security countermeasure is defined as specified in the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary of HHS approves countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents. Declarations have been made for pandemic countermeasures against various threats, including anthrax, botulism, radiation syndrome, smallpox, and influenza strains. In response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius issued declarations limiting liability for harm from certain influenza antivirals and vaccines. Division C allows liability only for \"death or serious physical injury\" caused by \"willful misconduct,\" defined as intentional acts without legal justification and in disregard of known risks. The Secretary of HHS will further restrict actions qualifying as 'willful misconduct' through regulations. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff. The burden of proof in cases involving \"willful misconduct\" for death or serious physical injury is on the plaintiff, requiring clear and convincing evidence. This standard is higher than the usual burden of proof in civil cases. Acts or omissions regulated by Division C or the FDCA do not constitute willful misconduct if no enforcement action has been initiated or if the action has been resolved without penalties. The new federal cause of action created by Division C allows injured parties to seek damages for willful misconduct, with suits under state tort law prohibited. The cause of action cannot be brought against federal employees and can only be pursued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, applying the substantive law of the state where the misconduct occurred. The new federal cause of action created by Division C allows injured parties to seek damages for willful misconduct. Cases will be assigned initially to a panel of three judges for pretrial motions, with a single judge running the trial proceedings. The new federal cause of action allows injured parties to seek damages for willful misconduct. A single judge will run the trial, ruling on motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment. Damage awards will be reduced by collateral source benefits, with no right of subrogation for collateral sources. Noneconomic damages may be awarded in proportion to the percentage of responsibility. Under the new federal cause of action, defendants may only be liable for damages in proportion to their percentage of responsibility for harm to the plaintiff. This means that if one defendant is 25% responsible and the other is 75% responsible, the plaintiff can only recover up to 25% of their noneconomic damages from the first defendant. Economic damages can be recovered up to 100% from either party if joint and several liability is applicable. Rule 11 sanctions can be imposed for filing frivolous claims or defenses. Rule 11 sanctions for filing frivolous claims or defenses are mandatory, with sanctions being discretionary. A new section of the Public Health Service Act establishes the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund\" for compensating individuals for serious injuries caused by covered countermeasures. Eligible individuals can choose between accepting compensation from the fund or pursuing a federal cause of action, but not both. The new federal cause of action allows individuals to choose between compensation from the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund\" or pursuing a federal cause of action, but not both. Compensation from the fund is based on specific sections of the Public Service Health Act for injuries from certain countermeasures against smallpox, including medical benefits, lost employment income, and death benefits. Division C eliminates tort liability except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, aligning with other federal tort reform statutes. Division C falls between immunity for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Injured persons can seek compensation from the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund if Congress allocates funds. Over 50 federal statutes grant immunity to private parties but hold the U.S. government liable under the FTCA. In some cases, victims may be left without a remedy if the government is not liable under the FTCA. The U.S. government is never liable for punitive damages under the FTCA, even in states that allow them. Congress may immunize private parties and establish federal compensation programs, such as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Some federal compensation programs, like the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, provide immunity for government contractors involved in atomic weapons testing. Other statutes cap damages or establish federal causes of action while still applying state law."
