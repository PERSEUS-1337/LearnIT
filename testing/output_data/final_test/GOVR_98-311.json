    "content": "The Senate's standing committees have the flexibility to determine their own procedures, but must adhere to the Senate's rules. This report outlines the rules and directives governing committee organization, meetings, hearings, and reporting. It focuses on requirements applicable to most Senate committees handling legislative matters. Each Senate committee must adopt written rules to govern its proceedings, which must be published in the Congressional Record by March 1 of the first session of each two-year Congress. Amendments to committee rules become effective only after being published in the Record. Each Senate committee must adopt written rules to govern its proceedings, published in the Record. Committees are authorized to meet and hold hearings during Senate sessions or recesses. Meetings are restricted after two hours of Senate session or after 2:00 p.m., except for the Appropriations and Budget Committees. Other committees can waive this requirement with unanimous consent. The Senate committees must designate a regular meeting day, but in practice, they often meet more frequently than required. The chair of a committee can call additional meetings at their discretion, and three members can request a special meeting if needed. If the chair fails to schedule the meeting, a majority of committee members can file a motion to hold it. A majority of committee members can file a written motion to schedule a meeting at a specific date and time, which is a rarely used option. This may encourage committee chairs to schedule meetings requested by other members. Committee meetings are generally open to the public, but can be closed by a vote under certain circumstances. The committee or subcommittee can vote to close a meeting under specific circumstances, such as national security concerns, privacy invasion, or disclosure of confidential information. The decision to close the meeting is made in open session through a motion and a subsequent rollcall vote. The committee can decide to close a meeting through a second rollcall vote in open session. The next ranking member of the majority party presides in the absence of the committee chair. A committee can set its own quorum requirement for meetings, with a minimum of one-third of the membership. The committee chair is responsible for maintaining order and can close a meeting until order is restored. Proxy voting is not allowed to constitute a quorum. A committee may adopt rules permitting proxy voting, but only if the absent Senator has been notified and requested their vote be cast by proxy. Proxies cannot be counted for quorum. Each committee must maintain a transcript or recording of meetings, which must be posted online within 21 business days unless waived by majority vote. The Rules and Administration Committee may waive the requirement for public announcement of hearings in cases of technical barriers. Standing committees have the authority to investigate matters within their jurisdiction and issue subpoenas for persons and documents. Committees must announce hearing details in advance, but this rule does not apply to the Appropriations and Budget Committees. Committees can set their own quorum requirements for hearings. Rule XXVI, paragraph 7(a)(2) allows committees to set their own quorum requirement for taking sworn testimony, with some committees allowing testimony with just one member present. Witnesses must file a written statement before appearing, staff can provide summaries of testimony with committee approval. The committee can prepare daily summaries of received testimony, with approval from the chair and ranking minority member. The minority can select witnesses to testify on at least one day during hearings. Open hearings may be broadcasted on radio and television, with committees having the authority to print or post hearings. Each committee is authorized to print its hearing records and material submitted at hearings. Records belong to the Senate and are open for review by any Member. Transcripts or recordings must be posted online within 21 days of the meeting. Printed hearings should be available to Senators before floor consideration of a measure. Before the Senate begins floor consideration of a measure, committees have the authority to originate bills and resolutions within their jurisdiction. Senators can raise a point of order against committee amendments that contain significant matters outside the committee's jurisdiction. A majority of the committee must be present when voting to report a measure. Before the Senate begins floor consideration of a measure, committees have the authority to originate bills and resolutions within their jurisdiction. A majority of the committee must be physically present when voting to order the reporting of any measure, matter, or recommendation. The motion to report a measure or matter requires the support of a majority of the members present, with proxy votes prohibited unless specifically allowed by committee rules. Ratification of prior actions is required when a measure or matter is reported in accordance with committee rules. When a measure or matter is reported properly by a committee, it ratifies previous committee actions. The Senate rules do not mandate a written report when a bill is reported, but if one is filed, specific items must be included. A committee member can include their supplemental views in the committee's report by giving notice and filing them within three days of the vote. Rollcall votes must be included in the report, except if previously announced. Cost estimates are required under the Congressional Budget Act. The committee report on a measure or committee amendment must include comparisons with committee allocations, a cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for the first fiscal year and following four fiscal years, and an estimate of new budget authority for state and local governments. This requirement excludes continuing appropriations and applies only if timely submitted by CBO. The committee report on a measure must include comparisons with committee allocations, a cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and an estimate of new budget authority for state and local governments. The report must also show what the measure proposes to repeal or amend existing law, and evaluate its anticipated impact in various areas. The report accompanying a bill or joint resolution must describe how the provisions of the measure apply to the legislative branch or why they do not. A point of order can be made on the floor against Senate consideration of a measure if the accompanying report does not comply with this requirement. Preemption information; An authorizing committee's report must address the extent of preemption of state, local, or tribal laws, including costs and benefits. Unfunded mandates; An authorizing committee's report must describe any federal mandates included in a bill or joint resolution. Joint resolution with federal mandate must include description of mandate. Tax law complexity analysis required for measures amending Internal Revenue Code with widespread applicability. Only one report allowed for bills referred to multiple committees. The report may be printed in numbered parts by different committees. Timely filing of reports is required, and the chair must ensure prompt reporting of measures to the Senate. A majority of a committee can request a measure to be reported within seven days. Layover requirements mandate a one-day wait before Senate consideration of committee-reported measures. The Senate requires written reports on measures or matters to be available for two calendar days before consideration, with the possibility of waiver by leaders. Exceptions include declarations of war or national emergency and joint resolutions of disapproval with statutory deadlines."
