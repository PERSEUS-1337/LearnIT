    "content": "The \"Streamline Vehicle Conversions Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Clean Air Act to include emission certification requirements for aftermarket conversion systems. The \"Streamline Vehicle Conversions Act\" amends the Clean Air Act to include emission certification requirements for aftermarket conversion systems. Definitions for aftermarket conversion system and aftermarket conversion test group are provided. Certificates of Conformity for aftermarket conversion systems do not expire and continue to apply in subsequent years. The \"Streamline Vehicle Conversions Act\" states that recertification of aftermarket conversion systems is not required for the same test group covered by the certificate. Names of test groups covered by a certificate of conformity do not change annually. The Administrator will establish criteria for identifying similar vehicle makes, models, manufacturers, emission standards, and model years for aftermarket conversion purposes. The \"Streamline Vehicle Conversions Act\" allows aftermarket conversion system manufacturers to use the same test group for certification without recertification. The Administrator can approve the aftermarket conversion test group for a certificate of conformity. Additionally, manufacturers can request carryover certification for additional model years by demonstrating the similarity of the aftermarket conversion system and vehicle specifications to those in the original certificate of conformity. The Administrator can approve aftermarket conversion systems for certification based on the original certificate of conformity. Manufacturers can use the same emission test data for multiple test groups and utilize assigned deterioration factors without sales limits. Testing requirements may be waived for certifying aftermarket conversion systems. The Administrator may waive emission testing requirements for aftermarket conversion systems if the manufacturer demonstrates it is appropriate. Regulations for on-board diagnostic systems ensure effectiveness in monitoring emissions components and consider limitations in accessing proprietary technology. Conversion of older vehicles to alternative fuel operation outside of the useful life specified by the original equipment manufacturer's certificate of conformity is not considered tampering if the aftermarket conversion system is appropriately matched to the vehicle's engineering sophistication. Upon conversion of older vehicles to alternative fuel operation, the aftermarket conversion system must be well-designed and installed to maintain emission performance. A label stating the vehicle has been equipped with an aftermarket conversion system must be affixed to the motor vehicle. The aftermarket conversion system must be installed outside of the vehicle's useful life. The Administrator can issue an order to prohibit the installation of a system if it degrades emission performance."
