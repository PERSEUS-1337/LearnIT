    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow certain alcohol manufacturers to purchase advertising space from on-sale retail licensees under specific conditions related to venue seating capacities in various counties. The amended Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code allows alcohol manufacturers to purchase advertising space from on-sale retail licensees based on venue seating capacities in different counties, including Kern, San Bernardino, Yolo, Fresno, and Riverside County. An outdoor stadium in Tulare County with a seating capacity over 1,500, a motorsports complex in San Bernardino County with a speedway seating at least 50,000, and an exposition park in Los Angeles County with a grandstand seating over 8,000 and multiple exhibition halls. An outdoor soccer stadium with a seating capacity of at least 25,000 seats in Carson, an outdoor tennis stadium with a seating capacity of at least 7,000 seats in Los Angeles County, an outdoor track and field facility with a seating capacity of at least 7,000 seats, and an indoor velodrome with a seating capacity of at least 2,000 seats. Additionally, an outdoor professional sports facility with a seating capacity of at least 4,200 seats in San Joaquin County, a fully enclosed arena with a seating capacity of over 13,000 seats in Inglewood, and an outdoor stadium with a seating capacity of at least 68,000 seats in Santa Clara. A beer manufacturer, winegrower, distilled spirits rectifier, or manufacturer may advertise at an outdoor stadium if the major tenant does not hold a retail license. Advertising can also be placed in the stadium's on-sale licensed premises. Sonoma State University owns a complex for cultural and entertainment events with various venues, including concert halls and outdoor seating areas. Advertising space can be purchased from the owner, tenant, or licensee. In San Diego County, there is a fairgrounds with a horse racetrack and sports facilities. An outdoor stadium in San Diego with a seating capacity of at least 43,000 seats allows beer, wine, and spirits manufacturers to purchase advertising space. The agreement must not influence the sale of specific brands at the stadium, and revenue from the advertising cannot be shared with the on-sale licensee providing food and beverages. An outdoor stadium in Inglewood with a seating capacity of at least 70,000 seats allows beer, wine, and spirits manufacturers to purchase advertising space. The agreement must not influence the sale of specific brands at the stadium, and revenue from the advertising cannot be shared with the on-sale licensee providing food and beverages. The advertising space or time purchased in connection with events at the outdoor stadium or fully enclosed arena must not be owned by a community college district. Advertising space or time should only be bought for live events at the premises and not at any hotels within the exposition park. The on-sale licensee can serve other brands of beer, wine, and distilled spirits from competing wholesalers in addition to the brands they advertise. Any advertising purchases must be made through a written contract with the manufacturer or agent. The on-sale licensee can serve various brands of alcohol from different wholesalers. The major tenant of the outdoor stadium and the owner or long-term tenant of the complex are also allowed to serve alcohol, regardless of holding an on-sale license. Any alcohol manufacturer or distributor who illegally forces a wholesaler to fulfill contractual obligations may face misdemeanor charges, including imprisonment or fines up to the value of the contract plus $10,000, and potential license revocation. Any on-sale retail licensee who pressures a wholesaler to solicit advertising from alcohol manufacturers or distributors may face misdemeanor charges, including imprisonment or fines up to the value of the advertising plus $10,000, and potential license revocation. The Legislature requires separation among manufacturing, wholesale, and retail interests in alcohol production and distribution to prevent market domination and excessive sales through aggressive marketing. Exceptions to tied interests must be limited to prevent undermining the general prohibition. The Legislature finds that a special law is necessary for unique conditions in San Diego and Inglewood. This act is an urgency statute to ensure fair application of alcoholic beverage control laws in San Diego and Inglewood for eligible facilities."
