    "title": "AB 929",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 638.50 of the Penal Code defines terms related to wire and electronic communication, including \"wire communication,\" \"electronic communication,\" and \"pen register.\" A pen register records dialing and routing information but not the contents of a communication. It excludes devices used for billing or cost accounting purposes by communication service providers or customers. A trap and trace device captures identifying information of a communication source but not the content. A court order is required to install or use a pen register or trap and trace device, except for specific purposes such as operating a communication service or protecting rights and users. The Penal Code allows for the use of trap and trace devices to protect users from abuse or unlawful use of service. Violations can result in fines or imprisonment, with a defense available for good faith reliance on authorized orders. A peace officer can apply to a magistrate for authorization to use a pen register or trap and trace device in a criminal investigation. The application must be in writing, under oath, and include relevant details about the investigation. The magistrate can authorize the installation of a pen register or trap and trace device ex parte if it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and there is probable cause to believe it will lead to the recovery of stolen property, evidence of a felony, or property used in the commission of a felony. The magistrate can authorize the installation of a pen register or trap and trace device ex parte if there is evidence of sexual exploitation of a child, unlawful restraint of a person, violation of labor laws, or commission of a felony or misdemeanor related to Fish and Game or Public Resources Code. The magistrate can authorize the installation of a pen register or trap and trace device to assist in locating individuals involved in felonies or misdemeanors related to Fish and Game or Public Resources Code. Information acquired must not disclose the physical location of the subscriber, except as determined by the telephone number. An order issued must specify certain details. An order issued for a pen register or trap and trace device must specify the identity of the person involved in the criminal investigation, the telephone line details, the offense related to the information obtained, and may include directions for necessary assistance. An order issued under this section authorizes the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device for up to 60 days, with the possibility of extensions for another 60 days upon a new application showing continued probable cause. An order authorizing the installation of a pen register or trap and trace device must be sealed and not disclosed to the subscriber or any other person unless ordered by the court or for compliance with specific sections. Upon presentation of an order by a peace officer, a provider of communication service or other person must immediately provide all necessary assistance for installing a pen register unobtrusively, as directed by the order. Upon request, a provider of communication service or other person must immediately install a trap and trace device as directed by a peace officer's order, providing all necessary information and technical assistance. Results of the device must be provided to the peace officer at regular intervals during business hours unless otherwise ordered by a magistrate. The magistrate may examine the person seeking a pen register or trap and trace device, take affidavits, and grant oral approval for their installation in emergency situations based on probable cause. There is probable cause for immediate installation of a pen register or trap and trace device in emergency situations. Written application must be submitted within two court days after installation, and if approved, the order is retroactive to the time of oral approval. In emergency situations, a pen register or trap and trace device can be immediately installed without an authorizing order. The use must end when the information is obtained, the order is denied, or by the second full court day after installation. Providers of communication services must be compensated for their expenses. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
