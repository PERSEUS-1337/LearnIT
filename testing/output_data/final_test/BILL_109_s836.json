    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fuel Economy Truth in Labeling Act\". Congress finds that the Environmental Protection Agency's current method for estimating fuel economy is flawed, overestimating fuel economy by up to 30 percent. The EPA's highway cycle assumes lower speeds than many state highway limits, leading to a potential 17 percent drop in fuel economy for modern vehicles driving at 70 mph. Fuel economy can drop by 17 percent for modern vehicles driving at 70 mph instead of 55 mph, and by nearly 10 percent at 65 mph. The Environmental Protection Agency's maximum acceleration rate is 3.3 mph per second, while most consumers accelerate as fast as 15 mph per second, nearly 5 times the EPA tests. The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy tests do not accurately reflect real-world conditions due to neglecting a wide range of outdoor temperatures and not accounting for the use of air conditioning in vehicles. This can significantly affect fuel economy results. The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy tests do not accurately reflect real-world conditions due to neglecting trip lengths and using artificial fuels for engine certification tests. This can lead to overestimating fuel economy and understating emissions in actual vehicle use. The Environmental Protection Agency should consider requiring manufacturers to post fuel economy realized on commercially available fuel, as current technology improving fuel at or near the point of use is excluded by engine manufacturers. SEC. 3. UPDATED FUEL ECONOMY TESTING PROCEDURES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will revise test procedures to consider factors affecting vehicle fuel economy, such as speed limits, acceleration rates, temperature variations, air conditioning usage, city test cycle lengths, and other fuel depleting features. Deadlines for rulemaking procedures will be initiated within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Environmental Protection Agency will revise test procedures for vehicle fuel economy, considering factors like speed limits, acceleration rates, and temperature variations. Within 18 months of initiating the rulemaking procedure, a final rule containing the revised test procedures will be promulgated."
