The President's proposed federal payments to the District of Columbia for FY2007 include $455.8 million for court operations, defender services, offender supervision, and criminal justice coordination, representing 76% of the total budget. Additionally, $75.9 million is allocated for education and tuition assistance, while $8.5 million is requested for security planning. The District's city council approved a $9.2 billion operating budget for FY2007, with a request for $634 million in special federal payments. The proposed budget for FY2007 includes increased funding for public education, economic development, regulation, and human support services. It also allocates funds for affordable housing, tuition assistance grants, a hiking and biking trail, and security and emergency support. The FY2007 budget includes $40 million for security and emergency preparedness, with $25 million for bioterrorism preparedness and $15 million for emergency planning and security. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 mandates spending ceilings for each fiscal year, guiding House and Senate appropriators in fund allocation. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $87.8 billion budget authority suballocation for FY2007 on June 6, 2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $597 million suballocation for the District of Columbia as part of the $87.8 billion subcommittee spending allocation for FY2007. Congress reviews and may modify the District's budget before it is forwarded to the President for approval or veto. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 5576 for FY2007, including $575.2 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia. The bill recommends $35.1 million for the city's college tuition assistance program and $40.8 million for public schools and education choices. The House version of H.R. 5576 for FY2007 includes provisions that District officials want eliminated or modified, such as those related to medical marijuana, abortion, and needle exchange. City officials have requested Congress to remove the ban on medical marijuana and lift restrictions on the use of District funds for abortion. Funding for security planning would be reduced from $13.5 million to $8.5 million, with cuts to bioterrorism preparedness and a forensic laboratory. No new appropriations are provided for a nature trail along the Anacostia River. The House version of H.R. 5576 for FY2007 includes provisions related to medical marijuana, abortion, and needle exchange. Congress has authority to ban medical marijuana use, as upheld by a Supreme Court decision. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for 2007, S. 3660 (P.L. 109-281), which would appropriate $597 million in special federal payments. The bill includes funding for various programs, such as $33.2 million for the city's college tuition assistance program and $206.6 million for court operations. Additionally, the bill recommends funding for bioterrorism preparedness activities and a forensic laboratory for the District. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for 2007, allocating $597 million in federal payments. The bill includes funding for various programs, such as college tuition assistance, court operations, a nature trail along the Anacostia River, improvements in the foster care system, Navy Yard Metro Station, marriage development accounts, and the public library system. Provisions in the bill prohibit the use of funds for needle exchange programs, medical marijuana initiatives, abortion services except in specific cases, and promoting statehood or voting representation in Congress. The 109th Congress did not complete consideration of the Act before adjourning. The Congress did not complete consideration of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for 2007 before adjourning. Instead, they enacted a series of budget resolutions, including the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. This resolution appropriated federal funds for the District of Columbia at either the FY2006 level or the House-passed FY2007 funding level. Additionally, the resolution allowed the District to spend local funds for specific programs and activities identified in the House-passed bill. The Congress passed H.J.Res. 102 (P.L. 109-383) on December 9, 2006, providing funding through February 15, 2007. The District's operating budget for FY2007 is $9.1 billion, including $7.751 billion in operating funds and $1.486 billion in enterprise funds. The budget also includes $2.341 billion in capital outlays, with $63 million allocated for a new baseball stadium. Funding for a needle exchange program is a key policy issue for Congress, touching on home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug use. Proponents of needle exchange programs argue they reduce HIV spread among drug users by providing clean needles. Opponents claim these programs endorse illegal drug use and advocate for drug treatment instead. The debate also involves home rule and the city's ability to use local funds for such programs. Congress initially prohibited federal and District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY1999 Appropriations Act. The FY1999 Appropriations Act prohibited federal and District funds for needle exchange programs. The FY2001 Appropriations Act continued the prohibition on federal and District funds but allowed private funding for needle exchange programs. The FY2001 Act also restricted the location of privately funded needle exchange activities. The FY2002 District of Columbia Appropriations Act prohibits the use of District and federal funds for needle exchange programs. Prevention Works operates a privately funded needle exchange program and is required to track public and private funds. District officials tried to lift the prohibition on District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY2004 Appropriations Act, but were unsuccessful. The final bill allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs. The District of Columbia is seeking to lift restrictions on using local funds for needle exchange programs, despite federal and District funds being prohibited for this purpose. The city's medical marijuana initiative is also a controversial issue. The District of Columbia faced restrictions on counting ballots for a 1998 voter-approved medical marijuana initiative. A lawsuit challenged Congress's power to block the initiative, with a court ruling in favor of allowing the city to tally the votes. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent the initiative's implementation. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative (Initiative 59) was certified by the Board of Elections and Ethics. Language prohibiting the implementation of the initiative was included in P.L. 106-113 (113 Stat. 1530), the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2002, P.L. 107-96 (115 Stat. 953), continued to prohibit the District government from implementing the initiative. Challenges to Congress's power to block the initiative's implementation were brought to court by the Marijuana Policy Project and Medical Marijuana Initiative Committee in 2001. The District's effort to put a medical marijuana initiative on the November 2002 ballot was initially blocked by a congressional rider prohibiting the use of public funds for this purpose. A U.S. district court judge later ruled this ban unconstitutional, citing a violation of First Amendment rights. The Justice Department appealed the decision, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ultimately reversed the ruling on September 19, 2002. The Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that Congress can regulate interstate drug marketing, even in states where marijuana is legalized for medical use. Legislation prohibits federal funds for implementing medical marijuana initiatives, with the city council trying to use only local funds for this purpose. The District of Columbia faces ongoing debates with Congress over public funding for abortion services. Since 1995, federal and District funds have been prohibited for abortion services, except in cases of endangerment to the mother's life, or rape/incest pregnancies. Congressional intrusion into local matters is a concern for District officials. In 1980, Congress limited public funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia. From 1979 to 1988, federal funds could only be used for abortion in cases of endangerment to the mother's life, rape, or incest. In 1989, funding restrictions were further tightened to only allow abortion in cases where the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy continued. President Reagan supported this change and threatened to veto the appropriations act if it was not modified. President Bush also vetoed the act in 1989. In 1989, President Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue but signed P.L. 101-168 after Congress included language prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases where the mother's life was endangered. The District successfully removed the provision limiting funding for abortion services in the FY1994 act, which also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, subsequent appropriations acts limited the use of funds for abortion services. The appropriations acts limited the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mother's life was endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The House and Senate versions of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2007 continued to prohibit the use of funds for abortion services, except in instances of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is endangered. The District budget for FY2007 included language prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services. P.L. 107-96 lifted the congressional prohibition on the use of District funds for implementing the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, allowing unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to register as domestic partners. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, approved in 1992, permits unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to register as domestic partners for health benefits. The act was delayed until 2002 due to a congressional prohibition. District employees can add their domestic partners to their health care policy for an additional charge. The Health Benefits Program allows the purchase of family health insurance coverage for employees and their family members, including domestic partners. Opponents argue that it devalues marriage and grants unmarried couples the same standing as married couples. A bill introduced in Congress aims to define marriage as between a man and a woman in the District of Columbia. Supporters of lifting the ban on District funds believe it is a matter of home rule. As of 2004, many states, local governments, companies, colleges, and universities offer health insurance benefits to domestic partners. The House version of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2007 allows the use of District funds to administer the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant program, providing grants for undergraduate students' postsecondary education. Students can receive up to $10,000 per year to cover the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition at public institutions outside the District, with a maximum award of $50,000. The Tuition Assistance Grant program provides funding for undergraduate students' postsecondary education, offering grants for in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees. Private institutions in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) can also receive grants, with a maximum award of $50,000. Funding for the program increased over the years, with the total number of students served steadily rising. Mayor Anthony A. Williams expressed concern about funding for the DCTAG program, with H.R. 5576 proposing $35.1 million and S. 3660 proposing $33.2 million. Both bills allow prioritization of awards based on academic merit, income, and need. Administrative expenses would be capped at $1.2 million. Federal payment for school improvement has been included in the District of Columbia appropriations act since 2004. Funding of $40.8 million has been allocated for school improvement in the District of Columbia. This includes $13.0 million for public schools, $13.0 million for charter schools, and $14.8 million for school vouchers. The aim is to support traditional public and charter schools while evaluating the effectiveness of a voucher program for private school enrollment. S. 3660 would appropriate $40.0 million for K-12 school improvement in the District of Columbia, with funds allocated for public schools, charter schools, and school vouchers. The program aims to support low-income families by enabling children to attend private schools in the district. Low-income District of Columbia residents can apply for scholarships up to $7,500 to cover tuition, fees, and transportation for private schools. Recipients are chosen through a lottery and can continue receiving scholarships if family income stays below 200% of the poverty level. Priority is given to students in public schools needing improvement under Title I-A, but all eligible students can apply. The scholarship program in the District of Columbia is open to all eligible students, regardless of their previous school enrollment. The program includes an evaluation component to assess academic achievement, school choice expansion, and impact on students and public schools. By Fall 2005, 1,716 scholarship recipients were enrolled in 60 participating private schools out of 4,047 eligible applicants. Approximately 10% of the estimated 40,500 eligible students have applied for scholarships, with $14.8 million appropriated for the program. H.R. 5576 and S. 3660 propose appropriations for the D.C. scholarship program, with funding allocated for assessments. S. 3660 also includes provisions for income eligibility thresholds, allowing students from certain years to remain eligible. These changes were later incorporated into the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The District of Columbia's local educational agencies (LEAs) are financially dependent on the government. The fiscal year for public schools in D.C. starts more than a month after the academic year, unlike most states where it runs from July 1 to June 30. The 2004 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act amended the fiscal year for DCPS and public charter schools starting from FY2007. The fiscal year for DCPS, public charter schools, and UDC in D.C. was set to be from July 1 through June 30 starting from FY2007. However, the transition to this new fiscal year calendar was not completed on schedule. Mayor Anthony Williams expressed concerns that changing the fiscal year for DCPS could lead to non-compliance with accounting principles, potentially resulting in audit report qualifications for the District of Columbia government in FY2007. The audit report for FY2007 noted a qualification based on a departure from GAAP and GASB requirements. Transitioning the fiscal year from October 1-September 30 to July 1-June 30 may cost up to $15 million and require a nine-month \"transition\" fiscal year. Consideration is needed for adjustments in funding for education agencies during a nine-month fiscal year."
