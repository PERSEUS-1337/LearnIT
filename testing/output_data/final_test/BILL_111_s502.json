    "content": "The \"Older Worker Opportunity Act of 2009\" may provide a tax credit for employing older workers in flexible work programs under the SEC. 45R Flexible Work Credit. The SEC. 45R Flexible Work Credit offers eligible employers a tax credit equal to 25% of qualified wages for providing health insurance coverage and maintaining a qualified trust. Qualified wages are defined as wages paid to eligible individuals during the taxable year. The SEC. 45R Flexible Work Credit provides a tax credit to eligible employers for 25% of qualified wages paid to individuals aged 62 or older participating in a formal flexible work program. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 3306. The term 'wages' for the SEC. 45R Flexible Work Credit is defined by section 3306 without any dollar limitation. Rules similar to section 51(c) apply, and wages paid after December 31, 2012 are not included. Only the first $6,000 of wages per year per individual can be considered. A 'formal flexible work program' is defined as a program of an eligible employer. A formal flexible work program of an eligible employer consists of core time and flex time. Core time should not exceed 20 hours per week, 3 days per week, or 1,000 hours per year. Core time is when an employee must perform work-related services as determined by the employer. Flex time is the time outside of core time when work-related services are also required. A formal flexible work program must allow for at least 1 year of participation and maintain the same health insurance benefits for participants working at least 20% of a full-time schedule. Participants in a formal flexible work program are entitled to health insurance coverage based on the employer's contribution for full-time employees. They can also participate in a retiree health benefits plan and receive pension benefits without reduction. Participants in a formal flexible work program can participate in a defined benefit plan of the employer like a full-time employee. Service credited to a participant is based on their work schedule compared to a full-time employee. Final average earnings for benefits must not decrease when entering the program. Participants in a formal flexible work program can join a defined contribution plan of the employer, with matching contributions. Pension benefits cannot be forfeited for participants under specific rules. The Security Act of 1974 prohibits discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees in a retirement program. Certain individuals are ineligible, and regulations may be prescribed to ensure compliance with the law. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new flexible work credit under section 45R(a). Additionally, to prevent double benefits, section 280C is amended to include reference to the new credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The new flexible work credit under section 45R applies to wages paid after December 31, 2008."
