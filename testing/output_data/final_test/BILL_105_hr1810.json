A new section on Education Investment Accounts is added to Part VIII of subchapter F of chapter 1. The \"Higher Education and Learning Promotion Act\" adds a new section on Education Investment Accounts to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An education investment account is exempt from taxation but subject to taxes on unrelated business income. Limitations include only one account per individual and the first established account being treated as an education investment account. The education investment account is established for the purpose of paying qualified higher education expenses. Contributions must be in cash or securities. Only one account per individual is allowed, with the first account being treated as an education investment account. The trustee must ensure that the trust meets specific criteria, including market availability of securities, contribution limits, and account holder age restrictions. Trust assets cannot be invested in certain ways. The trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts, must not be commingled with other property except in specific funds, and any balance in the education investment account must be used before the beneficiary turns 30. The distribution of trust assets to the account holder or beneficiary must occur within 30 days of the account holder attaining age 30 or in case of death. Contributions are deemed made on the last day of the preceding taxable year if made on account of that year and before the deadline for filing the tax return. Qualified higher education expenses are defined similarly to section 529(e)(3) but reduced by certain amounts. The term 'eligible educational institution' is defined in section 135(c)(3). An 'account holder' refers to the individual for whom an education investment account is established. Tax treatment of distributions is generally governed by specific rules. Any amount paid or distributed from an education investment account is included in gross income, except when used exclusively for qualified higher education expenses. Special rules apply for payments to eligible educational institutions. The distribution from an education investment account is taxable unless used for qualified higher education expenses. An additional 10% tax applies if the distribution is not used for educational expenses, with exceptions for disability, death, or scholarships. The distribution from an education investment account is taxable unless used for qualified higher education expenses. Exceptions include distributions made on account of the account holder's death or disability, or scholarships received that do not exceed the amount of the scholarship. Excess contributions can be returned before the due date of the tax return. Excess contributions to an education investment account exceeding $1,000 must be accompanied by net income and reported as gross income. Rollover contributions are exempt from this rule. The tax treatment of education investment accounts allows for rollover contributions within a 60-day period, with special rules for death and divorce similar to section 220(f). Amounts distributed are subject to rules similar to section 408(e), treating any distributed amount as not used for qualified higher education expenses. The tax treatment of education investment accounts includes rules for rollover contributions, special rules for death and divorce, and treatment of distributed amounts as not used for qualified higher education expenses. Community property laws are disregarded, custodial accounts are treated as trusts under certain conditions, and trustees are required to report on education investment accounts. The trustee of an education investment account must report to the Secretary and the account holder on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required. Individuals associated with an education investment account are exempt from certain taxes on prohibited transactions. The tax imposed on transactions involving an education investment account may be waived if the account no longer qualifies as such under section 530. Additionally, failure to provide reports on education investment accounts is subject to penalties under Section 6693. The text discusses amendments to section 530 regarding education investment accounts, including coordination with the savings bond exclusion and clerical amendments. Amendments to section 530 include the addition of a new item to the table of sections for part VIII of subchapter F of chapter 1. Amendments to section 530 include changes to the headings and tables of parts and sections related to higher education savings entities. SEC. 6693 imposes penalties for failure to report on individual retirement accounts or education investment accounts. Effective date for amendments is after December 31, 1996. SEC. 3 extends exclusion for educational assistance programs permanently. SEC. 4 modifies tax treatment of qualified state tuition programs. Exclusion of distributions for educational purposes under section 529(c)(3) is amended. Distributions for qualified higher education expenses are now included to cover room and board under section 529(e)(3). The term 'qualified higher education expenses' is redefined to include the cost of attendance for a designated beneficiary at an eligible educational institution. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996."
