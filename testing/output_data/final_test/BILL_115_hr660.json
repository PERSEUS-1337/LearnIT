    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bureau of Reclamation Transparency Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of the Bureau of Reclamation's aging water resources infrastructure, valued at $94.5 billion in 2013, which supports various sectors in 17 states. Efforts have been made to manage these assets, including the annual Asset Management Plan review. Actionable information on infrastructure conditions at the asset level, including maintenance needs due to aging infrastructure, is crucial for Congress to oversee Reclamation facilities and meet public needs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"asset\" in this Act refers to various assets used by the Bureau of Reclamation to manage water resources, including facilities, equipment, and structures essential to their mission. The Asset Management Report includes the annual plan prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation and any publicly available information summarizing their efforts to evaluate and manage infrastructure assets. Major repair and rehabilitation needs refer to significant nonrecurring maintenance activities at Reclamation facilities, including safety-related dam maintenance and deferred major maintenance. The term \"Reclamation facility\" refers to infrastructure assets owned by the Bureau of Reclamation at a Reclamation project, while a \"Reclamation project\" is a project owned by the Bureau of Reclamation, including reserved works and transferred works. \"Reserved works\" are buildings, structures, facilities, or equipment owned by the Bureau of Reclamation for which operations and maintenance are performed by Bureau employees or through a contract. The term \"transferred works\" refers to a Reclamation facility where operations and maintenance are carried out by a non-Federal entity under a formal agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation. SEC. 4. Asset management report enhancements for reserved works. The Secretary must submit an Asset Management Report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The report describes efforts to maintain reserved works at Reclamation facilities and standardize data reporting. It also includes a detailed assessment of major repair needs. The Asset Management Report to Congress must include a detailed assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for all reserved works at Reclamation projects, along with an itemized list of individual facility needs. The list should include budget estimates and categorical ratings for each item. The system for assigning ratings must be consistent with specified requirements. The Secretary must issue guidance on the rating system for Reclamation facilities under paragraph (2)(B). The Asset Management Report required under subsection (a) must be made publicly available, including on the Internet. The Secretary may exclude sensitive or classified information from the public version of the Asset Management Report but must provide a version containing this information to specific committees. The report must be updated every 2 years and consultation may be required. The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of the Army and water and power contractors to prepare and update the Asset Management Report. SEC. 5. Asset Management Report enhancements for transferred works. The Secretary will coordinate with non-Federal entities for reporting on major repair needs of transferred works similar to section 4(b). A rating system for transferred works will be developed based on input from water and power contractors, and included in updated Asset Management Reports. SEC. 6. OFFSET. The Federal share of a project's cost authorized by the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 will be reduced by $2,000,000."
