Leftist guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries emerged in response to these issues. The shift of coca production to Colombia in the 1980s increased drug violence. In 2002, \u00c1lvaro Uribe was elected president with a plan to reduce violence. Uribe served as president of Colombia from 2002-2010, known for his aggressive efforts to reduce violence. He was succeeded by Jan Manuel Santos in 2010. Colombia is the United States' fourth-largest trading partner in Latin America, with significant imports and exports between the two countries. Machinery parts, oil, electrical machinery, and organic chemicals were major U.S. exports to Colombia, while mineral fuels, primarily crude oil, were the main imports. Despite the relatively small level of trade between the two countries in 2010, the U.S. International Trade Commission predicted minimal impact on output or employment from the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) is projected to have minimal impact on output or employment for most sectors of the U.S. economy. However, new U.S. investment in Colombia could support increased economic growth, employment, and exports to the United States. Proponents argue that the CFTA would provide market access for U.S. products and new opportunities for farmers and ranchers. The largest changes in U.S. output and employment are projected for the cereal grains and sugar sectors. Changes in U.S. employment are projected to be in cereal grains (0.3%), sugar cane (-0.3%), and textiles (-0.3%). U.S. investment in Colombia could support economic growth and employment in Colombia. U.S. proponents are concerned about trade agreements with Ecuador. Colombia's current trade partners include the Andean Community, Chile, Mexico, Latin American countries, Canada, and four European countries. The country's labor force is 18.4 million, with 23% in agriculture, 19% in manufacturing, and 58% in services. Nearly 60% work in the informal sector, and the unemployment rate was 12% in 2010. Since 1966, Colombia's unionization rate has declined to 4.4% with 815,000 members out of an 18.4 million workforce. In 1999, only 1.36% of the labor force had collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 75% of port workers are on non-labor contracts, preventing union membership. The debate on the CFTA includes concerns about the high number of trade unionists murdered annually in Colombia. The Escuela Nacional Sindical (ENS) in Colombia provides independent information on human rights and labor issues. Data shows a decrease in the number of trade unionist homicides since 2001, with discrepancies in counting criteria among different sources. Teachers make up the largest percentage of union members who were victims of violence by illegal armed groups in Colombia, representing 53% of all trade unionist homicides according to government statistics. Their work situates them in rural, conflict-ridden parts of the country, contributing to their vulnerability. The homicide trend line from 1999-2003 coincides with a spike in coca cultivation in Colombia, highlighting the correlation between drug production and violence against trade unionists. Colombia accounts for a significant portion of worldwide trade unionist homicides. Colombia's share of world trade-unionist-related homicides ranges from 49% to 86% between 1999 and 2006. Proponents argue that Colombia's high percentage may be due to better documentation. Opponents of the Colombia FTA focus on the overall trend in homicides. The Colombian government highlights the decline in homicides since 2002 and recent efforts to reduce fatalities. In 2009, 1,550 trade unionists were under a protection program in Colombia, which accounted for 14% of all persons under protection. The decline in union membership from 13% in 1965 to 4.4% in 2010 is attributed to violence and employer tactics. Mandatory high nonwage benefits are also seen as a factor in reducing formal employment and union membership. Family welfare programs impact formal employment and union membership, leading to an increase in informal employment. The comparison of trade unionist homicides to general population homicides shows a lower rate for unionists. Long-term trends in trade union violence measures have shown reductions in assassinations and arbitrary detentions since 2004. Opponents argue that comparing random crime statistics to targeted assassinations is not meaningful. Opponents of the CFTA focus on death threats as a means of intimidation, which have increased while homicides have decreased. They also raise concerns about impunity for perpetrators of violence against trade unionists. The violence against trade unionists in Colombia is perpetrated by paramilitaries, guerrillas, and the Colombian military. Amnesty International USA reported that paramilitaries were responsible for 49% of human rights abuses, security forces for 43%, guerrilla forces for 2%, and criminals for 4%. Progress has been made in bringing perpetrators to justice, with a special sub-unit created to investigate and prosecute 1,272 criminal cases of violence against trade union members. Progress has been made in prosecuting 1,272 criminal cases of violence against trade union members in Colombia. As of February 2010, there were 248 convictions, resulting in the conviction of 350 individuals, including 216 imprisonments. However, the Director General of the ENS highlighted that since 1986, perpetrators of homicides of trade unionists have rarely been identified and brought to justice. The AFL-CIO also raised concerns about the lack of convictions for the masterminds behind these crimes. The AFL-CIO outlined labor and human rights conditions for Colombia to meet before the US would approve the CFTA, including convictions for trade unionist murders and enforcement of labor laws. Colombia's ability to protect workers and enforce labor standards is a concern for many observers. The AFL-CIO outlined conditions for Colombia to meet before the US would approve the CFTA, including convictions for trade unionist murders and enforcement of labor laws. Colombia's ability to protect workers and enforce labor standards is a concern for many observers. Colombia's ratification of ILO core labor standards is scrutinized, with strengths and weaknesses in worker rights protection highlighted in the State Department's reports. Colombia's labor laws define a \"worker\" as a direct hire with an employment contract, leaving some workers in three groups treated as indirect hires. Unions face legal restrictions, but continue to advocate for labor code revisions. Collective bargaining is not fully implemented in the public sector. Reports indicate some instances of forced or compulsory labor, including by children, despite legal prohibitions. Forced labor, including child labor, is a significant issue in Colombia, with armed groups using it in coca cultivation and other sectors outside government control. Children are exploited in the production of various goods like clay bricks, coal, and pornography, often under dangerous conditions. Despite laws protecting children from exploitation, child labor remains prevalent in informal and illicit sectors. The government sets a minimum wage annually, with the 2010 minimum wage reported at $285. The 2010 monthly minimum wage in Colombia was $285, a 3.6% increase from the previous year. The national minimum wage was deemed insufficient for a decent standard of living. Enforcement of minimum wage in the informal sector was lacking. Occupational safety and health protections were enforced in the formal sector, but issues like a shortage of inspectors led to high levels of industrial accidents and poor working conditions. The Colombia FTA included labor enforcement measures to uphold ILO core labor principles. The Colombia FTA included labor enforcement measures to uphold ILO core labor principles, with opponents arguing that only the concepts, not the details of the ILO Conventions, would be enforceable. Proponents highlighted Colombian progress in protecting workers, including a successful personal protection program for union members and increased funding for investigating crimes against trade unionists. The government has also engaged in greater social dialogue with international union organizations, impacting national labor policy. Other legislative approaches have been proposed for further protection. The \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" aims to enhance labor rights in Colombia and facilitate the U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement. Opponents argue that Colombia still lacks adequate protections for trade unionists, citing ongoing violence and limited progress in prosecuting perpetrators. Passage of the Colombia FTA implementing legislation on October 21, 2011 (P.L. 112-42) is seen as a potential hindrance to the progress made by the Colombian government on worker rights protections. Proponents argue that approving the FTA and the resulting economic growth is crucial to safeguarding trade unionists in Colombia."
