    "content": "The Act titled \"Numismatic Rarities Certainty Act of 2006\" deals with the disposition of certain United States coins. The Numismatic Rarities Certainty Act of 2006 amends Subchapter II of chapter 51, US Code by adding a new section regarding the inventory and disposition of US coins, medals, and numismatic items made before and after 1933. Coins, medals, or numismatic items made before 1933 not in possession of the US Government are not considered its property unless reacquired. Items made after 1932 are subject to specific conditions for consideration. The Numismatic Rarities Certainty Act of 2006 addresses the inventory and disposition of US coins, medals, and numismatic items made after December 31, 1932. If such items come into the possession of the US Government, they are transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action. The Secretary of the Treasury determines the number and condition of coins, medals, or numismatic items of the same denomination, quality, type, and year of production as the referred item. They must ensure that a suitable number of these items are retained for historical purposes. The Secretary may dispose of excess coins, medals, or numismatic items through public auction if they exceed the appropriate number for historic preservation and public display. The Secretary may dispose of excess coins, medals, or numismatic items through public auction, with proceeds deposited in an endowment fund for the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. No provision authorizes the United States Mint to establish a national museum of money or any other museum. The Secretary can auction off excess coins, medals, or numismatic items considering factors like maximum return to the Government, interest of the numismatic community, and interest of the general public. Unsold items may be destroyed if deemed excessive. The Secretary of the Treasury can auction off excess coins, medals, or numismatic items, with unsold items considered obsolete and disposed of in accordance with section 5120. Additionally, an inventory of these items must be conducted every 5 years. The Secretary of the Treasury must conduct an inventory of excess coins, medals, or numismatic items every 5 years and report findings to the President and Congress. The term \"numismatic item\" is defined as in section 5134(a)(3). The Secretary of the Treasury conducts an inventory of excess coins, medals, and numismatic items every 5 years."
