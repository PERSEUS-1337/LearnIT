    "content": "The \"Restoration of Parental Rights and State Sovereignty Act of 2015\" allows states to retain rights and authorities they do not expressly waive in public education and parental rights over the education of their children. The Act allows states to retain rights and authorities not waived in public education and parental rights over their children's education. States must expressly approve grant programs to receive assistance and waive rights inconsistent with Secretary-imposed requirements. Assistance can only be released after state legislature approval. The Act requires state legislature approval for grant programs to receive assistance, waiving rights inconsistent with Secretary-imposed requirements. For states with biennial legislatures, approval is not needed in non-legislative years. The Act requires state legislature approval for grant programs to receive assistance, waiving rights inconsistent with Secretary-imposed requirements. During a year when the State legislature meets, subsections (a) and (b) apply, and if the State legislature did not meet in the most recent year, the State may disapprove the grant program by law. The definition of State Authority includes any administering agency, officer, employee, or local government authority of the State. This section applies in each State starting on the 90th day after the end of the first regular session. The Restoration of Parental Rights and State Sovereignty Act of 2015 requires state legislature approval for grant programs, starting on the 90th day after the end of the first regular session and continuing in subsequent years until otherwise provided by law. The Act requires state legislature approval for grant programs, with funds not allocated to a State if not accepted. A State with a biennial legislature meets every other year. Congress's intent is outlined in the Act. Congress intends to reserve control over public education and parental rights to the States and individuals, except for Federal obligations to enforce minimum standards of equal protection and due process. This is reflected in the amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, emphasizing the restoration of state sovereignty over public education and parental rights. The text chunk includes sections 9541 to 9544, covering states retaining rights, dedication of savings to deficit reduction, definition of State with biennial legislature, and the intent of Congress."
