The \"Student Disciplinary Fairness Act of 2015\" establishes the Office of School and Discipline Policy within the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to reduce juvenile incarceration and criminal records resulting from school-related activities. The Office is tasked with collecting data on juvenile students' arrest and incarceration for school rule violations, promoting alternatives to detention, and studying the impact of school resource officers on arrest rates.
