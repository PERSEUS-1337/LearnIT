    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women's Preventive Health Awareness Campaign\". Congress finds that well-woman visits are essential for women's preventive care, providing screenings, medical history, exams, counseling, and vaccinations. These visits improve access to healthcare, identify disease risk factors, and help prevent chronic conditions. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in women, with many women forgoing needed care due to cost. Between 2002 and 2010, screening mammography rates among women aged 50 to 64 in the US declined from 79% to 73%. In 2010, only 45% of 18 to 64-year-olds reported ever receiving an HIV test. Among sexually active females aged 16-25, only 44.7% were screened for Chlamydia. The proportion of women aged 22 to 30 who never had a Pap test increased from 6.6% in 2000 to 9.0% in 2010. In 2007, 29.3% of US women delivering a live birth did not receive prenatal care. Between 2006 and 2010, one-third of pregnancies were conceived within 18 months of a previous birth, highlighting the importance of improved access to birth control for better maternal and infant health outcomes. Additionally, over half of pregnancies in the US are unintended, emphasizing the need for better family planning and prenatal care. Improved access to family planning is crucial as one-third of pregnancies were conceived within 18 months of a previous birth, which can harm the mother's health. Investing in family planning can also lead to significant cost savings, with taxpayers saving more than $5.00 in Medicaid-related expenses for every $1.00 invested. SEC. 399V-6.
