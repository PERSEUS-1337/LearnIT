    "content": "The \"Asset Forfeiture Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. Amendments are made to Chapter 63. The \"Asset Forfeiture Act of 1993\" is amended by adding a new section on criminal forfeiture. It states that a person convicted of certain violations shall forfeit any property obtained from the illegal scheme to the United States. The procedures of the Controlled Substances Act apply to such forfeitures. After a seizure of property ordered forfeited, the Attorney General disposes of it under section 1349. The Postal Service hands over seized property to the Attorney General for disposal. If forfeited property cannot be located, transferred, or diminished in value, the court orders the forfeiture of other property up to the same value. Sec. 1348. Civil forfeiture allows the seizure of property derived from illegal schemes under sections 1341 or 1343. The Attorney General or Postal Service can seize such property with or without a court process, depending on the circumstances. The government can seize property incident to a lawful arrest or search, or if the property has been subject to a prior judgment in favor of the United States. A warrant can be sought for property forfeiture under this section. Procedural matters for forfeiture follow the Controlled Substances Act, and the Postal Service can assist in performing functions related to forfeiture. The government can seize property under section 1341 or 1343, and related civil forfeiture proceedings can be stayed upon motion. The Attorney General or Postal Service will dispose of forfeited property under section 1349, depositing proceeds in the Assets Forfeiture Fund after deducting costs. The Postal Service has the authority to conduct administrative forfeitures and deposit forfeited property or proceeds in the Postal Service Fund. Property rights not transferable to the US will expire. Defendants or associates cannot purchase forfeited property. Courts can restrain property sale pending appeal. The Attorney General and the Postal Service can make rules for the disposition of forfeited property, including retaining it for official use, transferring it to law enforcement agencies, selling property not required to be destroyed by law, and involving the General Services Administration in the process. The General Services Administration may take custody of forfeited property and dispose of it according to the law, restore property to victims, destroy harmful property, or dispose of funds as provided by law. \"Criminal forfeiture, civil forfeiture, and disposition of forfeited property are outlined in sections 1347, 1348, and 1349.\""
