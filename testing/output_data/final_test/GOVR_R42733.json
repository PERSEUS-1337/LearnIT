    "content": "In an effort to reduce youth smoking, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned all cigarette flavorings except menthol. This ban was a response to the popularity of flavored cigarettes among youth. While menthol cigarettes also appeal to youth, they are widely smoked by adults. Congress authorized the FDA to consider banning or modifying menthol in cigarettes based on scientific evidence, but no action has been taken yet. Clove cigarettes, banned by the Act, are mainly imported from Indonesia. The United States and Indonesia, both members of the World Trade Organization, have agreements on trade regulations for non-menthol flavored cigarettes imported from Indonesia and domestically produced menthol cigarettes. The TBT Agreement requires equal treatment for imported and domestic products, while regulations must not be more restrictive than necessary. Indonesia filed a claim with the WTO, arguing that the Tobacco Control Act treats imported clove cigarettes unfairly compared to domestically produced menthol cigarettes. The panel agreed with Indonesia on certain violations but rejected others. The United States appealed the decision to the Appellate Body. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's conclusion that the Tobacco Control Act violated Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement by treating clove cigarettes less favorably than menthol cigarettes. It interpreted Article 2.1 in conjunction with Article III:4 of the GATT 1994, stating that likeness is based on the competitive relationship of the products. The Appellate Body considered this a case of de facto discrimination and allowed detrimental impacts on like imported products if due exclusively to legitimate reasons. The Appellate Body rejected the US ban on clove cigarettes while allowing menthol cigarettes, stating that both share the characteristic of masking tobacco smoke harshness. The ban aimed to prevent flavored cigarettes appealing to youth smokers. The Appellate Body questioned the justification for exempting menthol cigarettes from the ban on flavored cigarettes, noting that regular cigarettes containing nicotine would still be available. Indonesia's claim that the Tobacco Control Act was overly trade restrictive was dismissed by the panel. The ban's purpose of reducing youth smoking was deemed a legitimate regulatory end. The panel found that Indonesia failed to prove the ban on clove cigarettes was more trade restrictive than necessary to reduce youth smoking. Indonesia also complained about the interval between publication and effective date of the Tobacco Control Act. The panel found that Indonesia failed to prove the ban on clove cigarettes was more trade restrictive than necessary to reduce youth smoking. Indonesia argued that the term \"reasonable interval\" in the Tobacco Control Act meant not less than six months, based on the Doha Ministerial Decision. The panel considered this interpretation but ultimately determined that the Act violated Article 2.12. The Appellate Body concluded that the Doha Ministerial Decision was not a legally binding interpretation. The Appellate Body determined that the Tobacco Control Act violated Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement. Indonesia presented a prima facie case which the United States failed to rebut, leading to the violation. In response, the United States indicated it would maintain the ban on clove cigarettes while respecting its WTO obligations. The United States has not yet decided on a course of action regarding the treatment of imported clove cigarettes under the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body found that the Tobacco Control Act treats imported clove cigarettes less favorably than domestic menthol cigarettes, violating Article 2.1. This case provided insight into the interpretation of \"likeness\" and \"treatment no less favourable\" in the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body focused on the object and purpose of the TBT Agreement, particularly the second, fifth, and sixth recitals in the Preamble. It emphasized expanding on existing GATT disciplines and ensuring technical regulations do not create unnecessary trade obstacles. The Appellate Body emphasized the importance of ensuring technical regulations do not create unnecessary trade obstacles, as stated in the fifth and sixth recitals of the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body emphasized the importance of balancing the desire to avoid trade obstacles with Members' right to regulate technical regulations in accordance with the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body noted that Article 2.1 applies to technical regulations defining product characteristics and production methods. The Appellate Body emphasized the importance of balancing trade obstacles with Members' right to regulate technical regulations in accordance with the TBT Agreement. It concluded that technical regulations may provide relevant elements for determining product likeness and less favorable treatment to imported products. The similarity between Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 was noted, suggesting a focus on interpreting Article 2.1 in the context of the TBT Agreement and considering other contextual elements. The Appellate Body recognized the similarity between Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 for their core terms and regulatory purposes. The panel's approach of letting the regulatory purpose influence the likeness analysis was rejected by the Appellate Body. The Appellate Body rejected the panel's approach of letting the regulatory purpose influence the likeness analysis. Likeness determination under the TBT Agreement and GATT 1994 is about the competitive relationship between products, with regulatory concerns playing a role in analyzing less favorable treatment. Regulatory concerns primarily relate to less favorable treatment analysis. The United States appealed the panel's findings that clove and menthol cigarettes are like products based on end-uses and consumer tastes. The panel found that both types of cigarettes share the same end-use of being smoked, but the US argued that they serve different purposes - menthol for addiction satisfaction and clove for a pleasurable experience. The Appellate Body distinguished between end-uses and consumer tastes and habits in their analysis. The Appellate Body distinguished between end-uses and consumer tastes and habits, stating that end-uses describe the functions of a product while consumer tastes reflect appreciation of these functions. They agreed with the US that comparing end-uses should consider satisfying addiction to nicotine and creating a pleasurable experience. The Appellate Body found that both menthol and clove cigarettes serve the end-uses of creating a pleasurable smoking experience and satisfying addiction to nicotine. The number of 'addicts' smoking menthol does not exclude clove cigarettes from satisfying nicotine addiction. The Appellate Body upheld the finding of likeness between menthol and clove cigarettes for satisfying addiction and creating a pleasurable experience, considering both appeal to youth for starting to smoke. The United States argued that the panel should have considered adult smokers' tastes and habits in addition to youth smokers when analyzing the likeness between clove, menthol, and regular cigarettes. The Appellate Body agreed, stating that the market defines the scope of relevant consumers' preferences. The Panel should have assessed the tastes and habits of all relevant consumers of clove and menthol cigarettes, including adult and youth smokers, to determine likeness under the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body agreed that products can be considered like even if they are highly substitutable for some consumers but not for others. The Appellate Body noted that products can be considered like if they are substitutable within a segment of the market, even if tastes and habits vary among consumers. The Panel found that young smokers perceive clove and menthol cigarettes as sufficiently substitutable, supporting the conclusion that these products are alike under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement. The Appellate Body found that clove and menthol cigarettes are like products for consumer tastes and habits, despite variations among adult smokers. The United States argued that the panel should have compared the treatment of imported cigarettes from all Members, not just clove and menthol. The United States complained about the treatment of imported clove cigarettes compared to domestic products, arguing that the panel did not consider all products on the market and erred in linking the treatment to their origin. Indonesia and the US disagreed on what constitutes less favorable treatment regarding the impact on imported products. The United States argued that the treatment of imported clove cigarettes compared to domestic products constituted less favorable treatment, while Indonesia disagreed on what constitutes less favorable treatment regarding the impact on imported products. The Appellate Body considered the meaning of \"technical regulation\" and how it relates to product characteristics and production methods. This suggests that any distinction based solely on product characteristics or production methods may not necessarily result in less favorable treatment. The Appellate Body analyzed Article 2.1 and 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, stating that technical regulations should not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade. They clarified that Article 2.1 does not prohibit obstacles to trade a priori, as long as they are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The Appellate Body clarified that Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement does not prohibit obstacles to international trade a priori, as long as they are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. The sixth recital of the TBT Agreement's preamble allows Members to take measures for the protection of human life or health, as long as they are not applied in a discriminatory manner or as a disguised restriction on trade. The purpose of the TBT Agreement is to balance trade liberalization with Members' right to regulate. Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement prohibits discrimination but allows detrimental impacts on imports from legitimate regulatory distinctions. The Appellate Body referenced Article III:4 of GATT 1994 to explain the concept of 'treatment no less favourable' in relation to imported products. The Appellate Body clarified that a detrimental impact on imported products does not automatically indicate less favorable treatment under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement. Panels must assess if the impact stems from a legitimate regulatory distinction or discrimination against imports, considering the specific circumstances of the case and the even-handedness of the technical regulation. The Appellate Body clarified that a detrimental impact on imported products does not automatically indicate less favorable treatment under Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement. Panels must assess if the impact stems from a legitimate regulatory distinction or discrimination against imports, considering the specific circumstances of the case and the even-handedness of the technical regulation. The United States argued that the panel should have included all relevant imported and domestic products in the analysis to determine if the Tobacco Control Act treated clove cigarettes less favorably than menthol. The Appellate Body disagreed with the United States' argument that the panel should have considered menthol cigarettes imported from all Members in the analysis. They found that the panel did not err in focusing on Indonesian clove cigarettes as the group of like products imported from Indonesia. The product scope of the less favorable treatment analysis starts with the group of like products from the complaining Member. The United States argued that the panel should have included non-menthol domestically produced flavored cigarettes in the comparison. However, the Appellate Body noted that the US did not challenge the exclusion of these cigarettes and confirmed they had a small market share. Therefore, the Appellate Body could not determine if the panel erred in excluding them from the analysis. The Appellate Body considered it safe to assume that inclusion of non-menthol domestically produced flavored cigarettes in the comparison would not have altered the panel's conclusion that the group of like domestic products consisted of menthol cigarettes. The United States argued that the panel should have considered the effect of the Tobacco Control Act on domestically produced non-menthol flavored cigarettes before the ban went into effect. The Appellate Body agreed that a panel can consider evidence predating its establishment for a less favorable treatment analysis, especially in de facto discrimination claims. The panel's statement about the absence of non-menthol domestic flavored cigarettes at the time of the ban was related to assessing costs, not less favorable treatment. The United States argued that the exemption for menthol cigarettes was to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system and preventing a black market, but the panel rejected these as legitimate objectives, stating they were a way for the U.S. to avoid costs while imposing them on clove cigarette producers. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's conclusion that Section 907(a)(1)(A) violated Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement, noting that most clove cigarettes in the US came from Indonesia. Non-clove flavored cigarettes affected by the ban had a small market share. The Appellate Body found that Section 907(a)(1)(A) discriminated against clove cigarettes imported from Indonesia, as they had a significant market share in the US. The ban on clove cigarettes was not justified by public health concerns, as menthol cigarettes, which also appeal to youth smokers, were not similarly restricted. The Appellate Body rejected the U.S. justification for not banning menthol cigarettes, stating that it would not overwhelm the health care system or lead to a black market. They upheld the conclusion that exempting menthol cigarettes from the ban on flavored cigarettes was discriminatory against imported clove cigarettes. Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement requires a reasonable interval between the publication of regulations and their enforcement, which the Tobacco Control Act did not provide. The Tobacco Control Act did not provide a reasonable interval between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force. Indonesia argued that a six-month interval was required based on the Doha Ministerial Decision, which provides a legally binding interpretation according to the WTO Agreement. The panel must consider the Doha Ministerial Decision as a possible subsequent agreement on the interpretation of \"reasonable interval\" in the TBT Agreement. The decision to adopt an interpretation requires a three-fourths majority of Members based on a recommendation by the Council overseeing the Agreement's functioning. The panel considered the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(3)(a), which states that subsequent agreements between parties should be taken into account for treaty interpretation. Indonesia established a prima facie case that a US law violated WTO rules, which the US failed to rebut. The Appellate Body analyzed the Doha Ministerial Decision and the WTO Agreement on legally binding interpretations in their decision-making process. The WTO Agreement on legally binding interpretations in IX:2 outlines strict decision-making procedures, requiring a three-fourths majority for adoption. The Appellate Body's decision was limited to the lack of a recommendation from the relevant Council, stating that the Doha Ministerial Decision did not constitute a multilateral interpretation under Article IX:2. The Appellate Body concluded that paragraph 5.2 did not meet the requirements of Article IX:2 of the WTO Agreement. It also considered whether paragraph 5.2 could be seen as a subsequent agreement under the Vienna Convention. The United States argued that decisions not following the procedures of Article IX:2 cannot be considered a subsequent agreement. The Appellate Body rejected the U.S. argument regarding legally binding interpretations under Article IX:2 of the WTO Agreement and subsequent agreements under Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention. They explained that multilateral interpretations under Article IX:2 provide a means for Members to adopt binding interpretations clarifying WTO law for all Members. This contrasts with Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention, which is a rule of treaty interpretation using subsequent agreements between parties to interpret treaty provisions. Panels and the Appellate Body are required to apply customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention, to clarify disputes. The Appellate Body clarified that interpretations developed in dispute settlement proceedings are binding only on the parties involved. They also discussed the use of customary rules of interpretation, including Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention, to clarify disputes. The Appellate Body considered whether a decision by Members could qualify as a subsequent agreement for interpreting covered agreements. The Appellate Body analyzed whether paragraph 5.2 expressed an agreement among Members on the interpretation of WTO law, referencing the International Law Commission's definition of subsequent agreements for interpretation. The Appellate Body interpreted paragraph 5.2 as an agreement among Members on the meaning of \"reasonable interval\" in the TBT Agreement, based on the Vienna Convention's definition of subsequent agreements. The Appellate Body concluded that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision clarifies the meaning of \"reasonable interval\" in the TBT Agreement, requiring at least six months for producers in exporting Members to adapt to new technical regulations. The Appellate Body ruled that Indonesia successfully established a prima facie case of inconsistency with Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, showing that the United States failed to rebut Indonesia's argument regarding the six-month period for adapting to new technical regulations. The Appellate Body ruled that Indonesia established a prima facie case of inconsistency with Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement, shifting the burden to the importing Member to rebut. Exceptions to Article 2.12 include urgent circumstances like safety, health, or national security, where a six-month interval may not be reasonable. Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement states that a \"reasonable interval\" must be provided for producers to adapt to importing Member's technical regulations. If producers can adapt in less than six months, a period of six months or more is not considered reasonable. Importing Members can depart from the six-month interval if it is ineffective to fulfill legitimate objectives. The Appellate Body disagreed with the panel's allocation of the burden of proof regarding the \"reasonable interval\" under Article 2.12 of the TBT Agreement. Indonesia set forth a prima facie case that the United States failed to rebut. The United States failed to rebut Indonesia's prima facie case at the Dispute Settlement Body meeting regarding the Tobacco Control Act aimed at reducing youth smoking by removing \"trainer cigarettes\" from the market. The United States disagrees with the Appellate Body's conclusion that the Tobacco Control Act breaches the TBT Agreement, citing concerns about the regulatory distinctions between different types of cigarettes for public health reasons. The United States disagreed with the Appellate Body's decision on the Tobacco Control Act, arguing that the panel failed to explain why it rejected the U.S. regulatory approach. The U.S. asserted that the Appellate Body should have overturned the panel's conclusion instead of engaging in its own analysis without citing supporting facts. The U.S. criticized the Appellate Body for putting itself in the position of a regulator by weighing the risks and benefits of including menthol cigarettes in the ban. The United States criticized the Appellate Body for substituting its judgment on including menthol cigarettes in the ban, expressing concern over the lack of factual analysis. They also disagreed with the determination that the Tobacco Control Act's three-month interval was unreasonable. The United States criticized the Appellate Body for its treatment of the Doha Ministerial Decision and burden of proof in Article 2.12 claims under the TBT Agreement. They argued that the Appellate Body's interpretation undermines safeguards in the WTO Agreement and reverses the burden of proof for technical regulation claims. The United States intends to implement the Appellate Body's recommendations regarding a measure banning clove and other flavored products, emphasizing the scientific community's support for the ban. The United States plans to implement a ban on clove and other flavored cigarettes, supported by the scientific community for public health benefits. The ban is deemed necessary and not overly trade restrictive, with a 15-month compliance period agreed upon with Indonesia. The scientific community supports the ban on clove and other flavored cigarettes for public health benefits. The United States intends to maintain the ban on clove cigarettes while respecting its WTO obligations. The Appellate Body found that the ban on clove cigarettes violated the TBT Agreement by favoring menthol cigarettes, which are domestically produced. The Appellate Body determined that the ban on clove cigarettes violated the TBT Agreement by favoring menthol cigarettes. The United States argued that banning menthol cigarettes could overwhelm the healthcare system, but the Appellate Body noted that nicotine is the addictive ingredient in cigarettes and regular cigarettes would still be available. The Appellate Body found that a ban on clove cigarettes violated the TBT Agreement by favoring menthol cigarettes. It determined that paragraph 5.2 of the Doha Ministerial Decision is not legally binding but constitutes a subsequent agreement on the meaning of \"reasonable interval.\" A complaining Member establishes a prima facie case by showing less than six months between publication and effective date, while a responding Member can rebut by proving the time provided is reasonable. The U.S. intends to maintain the ban on clove cigarettes while respecting WTO obligations. Compliance date set for July 24, 2013."
