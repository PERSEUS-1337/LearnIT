    "content": "The text chunk discusses a 2-year extension of the deduction of health insurance costs for self-employed individuals and an increase in taxes on tobacco products. The extension applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. The tax rates on cigars and cigarettes are being amended, with an increase in the tax rate on cigars to $1.359 per thousand and a tax equal to 15.41 percent of the price for which large cigars are sold, not exceeding $36.25 per thousand. The tax rates on cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes are being increased. The tax on cigarettes is raised to $14.50 per thousand, on cigarette papers to 0.91 cent, and on cigarette tubes to 1.81 cents. The tax rates on smokeless tobacco products such as snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco are being adjusted. The new rates are 43.50 cents for snuff, 14.5 cents for chewing tobacco, and 81.6 cents for pipe tobacco. On tobacco products manufactured or imported into the US before January 1, 1995, and held for sale, taxes are imposed based on weight and price. Small cigars are taxed at 23.4 cents per thousand, large cigars at 2.66% of the price but not exceeding $6.25 per thousand, small cigarettes at $2.50 per thousand, and large cigarettes at $5.25 per thousand. Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes are based on the length, with different rates for different sizes. Cigarette papers are taxed at 0.16 cents for each 50 papers or fraction, while cigarette tubes are taxed at 0.31 cents for each 50 tubes or fraction. Taxes on tobacco products vary based on type and weight. Snuff is taxed at 7.5 cents per pound, chewing tobacco at 2.5 cents per pound, and pipe tobacco at 14.1 cents per pound. Liability for tax on tobacco products imposed by paragraph (1) applies to those holding cigars, cigarettes, cigarette paper, cigarette tubes, snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco on January 1, 1995. The tax is due and payable on February 15, 1995, following the same method as taxes under section 5701 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (3) Defines various tobacco products for tax purposes based on specific subsections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (4) Exempts retail stocks of tobacco products held on January 1, 1995, from the taxes imposed. (5) Provides exceptions for tobacco products in foreign trade zones. Foreign trade zones exempt certain tobacco products from taxes and customs duties if requested before January 1, 1995, and entered into the US after that date. Tobacco products like cigars, cigarettes, snuff, and chewing tobacco, placed under customs supervision before January 1, 1995, and entered into the US from a foreign trade zone after that date, are subject to taxes and treated as held for sale on January 1, 1995. The amendments made by this section apply to tobacco products like cigars, cigarettes, snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco removed after December 31, 1994."
