The \"Global AIDS Research and Relief Act of 2001\" highlights the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with findings stating that it will surpass historical infectious disease outbreaks in terms of impact. Over 36 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, with a significant number of children affected. Over 1.4 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with 600,000 new infections in a year, mostly babies born to HIV-positive women. Sub-Saharan Africa, with 10% of the world's population, has over 25.3 million HIV/AIDS cases. Worldwide, there have been 21.8 million deaths due to HIV/AIDS, with over 80% in sub-Saharan Africa. 13.2 million children have lost at least one parent to AIDS, including 12.1 million in sub-Saharan Africa. The National Intelligence Council estimates a continued increase in AIDS cases. The National Intelligence Council predicts a significant increase in AIDS orphans globally, leading to social, economic, and political challenges. The discovery of nevirapine offers a cost-effective way to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, fostering collaboration between the US and other countries. Implementing a mother-to-child antiretroviral drug strategy can reduce HIV transmission and mortality rates in developing regions, leading to social change and improved health infrastructure. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a significant concern globally, with economic costs projected to reduce GDP by up to 20% in some sub-Saharan African nations by 2010. UNAIDS estimates over 5.8 million cases in South and Southeast Asia, with the Caribbean having the second-highest HIV infection rate after sub-Saharan Africa. Russia is emerging as a new hotspot for the pandemic, with a rising number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses expected. More Russians are expected to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS by the end of 2001 than all cases from previous years combined. Despite discouraging statistics, some developing nations like Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand have implemented successful prevention programs. US financial support for medical research and disease containment has beneficial ramifications for millions affected by HIV/AIDS. The Act aims to prevent human suffering and ensure economic development. The Act aims to help ensure economic development, stability, and national security in the developing world by advancing research to understand the causes of HIV/AIDS and develop an AIDS vaccine. The Act includes additional assistance authorities to combat HIV and AIDS. Paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 are amended to address the international dilemma of children with HIV and the importance of intervention programs. The agency responsible for administering this part will coordinate with various organizations to develop and implement effective strategies. Federal agencies are expected to prevent vertical transmission of HIV and coordinate with organizations to increase intervention programs. Congress expects the primary agency to prioritize HIV/AIDS in foreign assistance and undertake a comprehensive effort to combat the diseases, including providing primary prevention, education, testing, and counseling. The President is authorized to appropriate $600,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs in developing countries. At least 65 percent of the funds are designated for these purposes. Priority should be given to programs supporting and educating orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, including AIDS orphans and prevention strategies for vertical transmission. Assistance may be provided through various organizations, including private, for-profit, religious, educational, and research facilities. Funds authorized for administrative expenses under this Act shall not exceed 7 percent of the total funds appropriated. The funds remain available until expended."
