    "content": "The tax laws prohibit Section 501(c)(3) organizations from engaging in any political campaign activities. Violating this rule can result in loss of tax-exempt status, taxation on political expenditures, and potential penalties for the organization's managers. The IRS may assess taxes due immediately or seek injunctive relief for flagrant violations. The prohibition on campaign intervention for Section 501(c)(3) organizations was introduced by Senator Lyndon Johnson in 1954 to prevent political expenditures. The legislative history of the provision lacks further discussion, but it is believed that Johnson proposed it as a response to an organization supporting an opponent or as an alternative to denying tax-exempt status to organizations engaging in substantial lobbying. The Internal Revenue Code prohibits Section 501(c)(3) organizations from participating in political campaigns. Treasury regulations define a candidate as someone running for public office, and activities like publishing statements in support or opposition are prohibited. The statute and regulations provide limited details on the prohibition. Section 501(c)(3) organizations are prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates, distributing campaign literature, or making contributions to political campaigns. However, they can engage in political activities unrelated to elections, such as lobbying for legislation or supporting appointments to nonelective offices. Certain election-related activities are allowed as long as they do not show a preference for any candidate. The determination of campaign intervention depends on the specific circumstances of each case. Section 501(c)(3) organizations must avoid bias in voter guides and similar materials, as per IRS guidelines. Biases can be subtle, like not including all candidates equally or rating them based on nonpartisan criteria. The determination of bias depends on the specific facts of each case. A voter guide may show bias by only covering issues important to the organization, rather than a range of public interest topics. IRS guidelines suggest candidate-neutral guides have clear, unbiased questions, identical questions for all candidates, unedited candidate responses, and questions placed near answers. Candidates should have a reasonable time to respond. The IRS guidelines allow Section 501(c)(3) organizations to distribute voter guides as long as they are unbiased, nonpartisan, and not timed to an election or broadly distributed. Organizations can include voting records and positions on issues in their publications, conduct public forums for candidates, and provide candidates with a reasonable amount of time to respond to questions. According to IRS guidelines, organizations can conduct unbiased and nonpartisan public forums for candidates. Factors indicating impartiality include inviting all qualified candidates, questions from a nonpartisan panel, broad topics, equal opportunity for candidates, and a neutral moderator. A Section 501(c)(3) organization can invite candidates to speak at events as long as they provide equal opportunities and do not show preference for any candidate. Section 501(c)(3) organizations can invite candidates to speak in a non-candidate capacity, as long as no campaign intervention occurs. This includes maintaining a nonpartisan atmosphere, avoiding references to the upcoming election, and clearly indicating the non-candidate capacity of the individual. Organizations can also conduct nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. According to the IRS, Section 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without indicating a preference for any candidate or party. Key factors that indicate issue advocacy communication does not cross the line into campaign activity include equal representation of candidates, limited activity to urging individuals to register and vote, and providing services without regard to political preference. The line between issue advocacy and campaign activity can be difficult to discern. Key factors indicating issue advocacy communication avoids campaign intervention include not identifying candidates for public office, refraining from expressing approval/disapproval of candidates, not mentioning voting or elections, addressing issues not distinguishing candidates, being part of an ongoing series unrelated to elections, and timing related to non-electoral events. Section 501(c)(3) organizations may sell or rent goods, services, and facilities to political campaigns, including mailing lists and advertising. Factors indicating unbiased activity include ongoing business, availability to the public, customary rates, and equal access to all candidates. Campaign intervention can occur if a website links to content showing bias for or against a candidate. The IRS will consider various factors to determine if a website linking to biased content is considered campaign intervention. Members of 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in campaign activity in their private capacity, but the organization cannot support or pay for any political statements made by individuals associated with it. The IRS developed the Political Activity Compliance Initiative to address concerns about campaign intervention by Section 501(c)(3) organizations. The initiative involved educational outreach and expedited reviews of possible violations during the 2004, 2006, and 2008 election cycles. It was not used in the 2010 and 2012 cycles. The IRS conducted the Political Activity Compliance Initiative to address campaign intervention by Section 501(c)(3) organizations. In 69 cases, the IRS issued advisories for campaign activity but did not penalize due to mitigating factors. Five organizations lost tax-exempt status, two faced proposed revocations, 23 cases had no substantiated campaign activity, and six had non-political tax violations. Five cases remained open as of 2007. In response to reports questioning political motivation, the IRS Commissioner asked TIGTA to investigate the 2004 initiative. TIGTA's 2005 report found the IRS used appropriate procedures. The 2006 initiative examined 100 cases, with 60 remaining open in 2007. The IRS issued advisories in 26 closed cases and found no political intervention in 14 cases. 269 instances of Section 501(c)(3) groups making direct contributions to political candidates were identified. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations from using general treasury funds to make contributions in connection with federal elections. While FECA does not prohibit unincorporated Section 501(c)(3) organizations from making such contributions, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) prohibits all Section 501(c)(3) organizations from making direct contributions to political candidates. In Citizens United v. FEC, the Supreme Court invalidated FECA's prohibitions on corporations and labor unions using their general treasury funds for independent expenditures in elections. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision invalidated FECA's prohibitions on corporations and labor unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures in elections. This decision was based on the First Amendment, deeming the prohibitions as a \"ban on speech.\" Section 501(c)(3) organizations are generally not allowed to engage in activities regulated by FECA, so the impact of the Citizens United decision on them is minimal. The activities considered electioneering under the IRC and FECA may not always align, potentially leading to different treatment of issue advocacy communications. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress, H.R. 127, aims to repeal the campaign activity prohibition in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. This would not affect communication under FECA but may require compliance with FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications meeting certain monetary thresholds. The legislation clarifies that it does not impact any provisions in FECA."
