    "title": "SB 682",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 71621 of the Government Code allows trial courts to enter into contracts for services typically performed by court employees if cost savings can be demonstrated. The proposed contract must show actual overall cost savings, including additional costs such as salaries, benefits, space, equipment, and materials. In comparing costs for contracted services, indirect overhead costs of the trial court should only be included if they are directly related to the function in question. Continuing trial court costs associated with the contracted function, such as inspection and supervision, must be included in the contractor's costs. Proposals to contract out work must meet specific criteria: contractor wages must be industry-level, not significantly lower than trial court pay rates, no displacement of trial court employees, and savings must be substantial enough to withstand cost fluctuations. The contracting agreement must justify savings, be awarded through competitive bidding, include staff qualifications, minimize economic risk, be with a firm, and not outweigh the public's interest in direct court functions. The contract must comply with the Judicial Branch Contracting Manual and any additional requirements. Trial courts or the Judicial Council can set stricter rules for contracting court services. Contracting is allowed for new court functions mandated by the Legislature or between trial courts or government entities for services performed by their employees. The services contracted for must be highly specialized or technical and cannot be performed by trial court employees. Service agreements include maintenance of office equipment or computers but not operation for other purposes. (5) Contracts are needed when trial court employees cannot achieve legislative, administrative, or legal goals due to conflicts of interest or the need for unbiased findings. This includes obtaining expert witnesses. (6) Contracts may be necessary for emergencies to protect public health, welfare, or safety. (7) Contractors can conduct training courses if qualified trial court employee instructors are not available, with permanent positions filled through the court's hiring process. (8) The contractor will provide equipment, materials, facilities, or support services that could not feasibly be provided by the trial court in the location where the services are to be performed. This paragraph shall not apply to services contracted in order to open closed courthouses if those services were performed by trial court employees before the closure or for the ongoing operation of new or reopened courthouses.\n(9) The services are of such an urgent, temporary, or occasional nature that the delay incumbent in their implementation through the process for hiring trial court employees would frustrate their very purpose. This paragraph shall not apply to the services of official court reporters, except individual official reporters pro tempore may be used by a trial court when the criteria of this paragraph are met. The contract is for personal services related to rehabilitation or habilitation programs, or programs through regional centers or the State Department of Developmental Services. It should not result in loss of employment, reduction in wages, benefits, or hours, or involuntary transfer for existing trial court employees. The contract for court interpreter services is governed by specific acts and agreements. Contracts for traffic assistance programs are also covered. The provisions of the act are severable to ensure validity."
