    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Law Enforcement Official Protection and Officer John C. Knight Memorial Act of 1999\". The Congress recognizes the threat firearms pose to law enforcement officers, with 92% of officers killed in the line of duty between 1988 and 1997 being victims of firearms. The use of lethality-enhancing devices like laser sights further increases the risk to officers. Armor piercing and armor piercing incendiary ammunition, designed for military use, are easily accessible for sale on the civilian market. This poses a serious threat to law enforcement officers and national security, as these types of ammunition can be used by violent offenders, terrorists, or others against critical infrastructure. Handguns are the most commonly used weapons in the murders of both law enforcement officers and civilians. Current law does not restrict the development of future generations of armor-piercing ammunition for use in handguns, posing a threat to law enforcement officers and civilians. SEC. 3. Treatment of certain military ammunition as armor piercing ammunition; use of performance standard. Section 921(a)(17) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include projectiles determined to be similar to armor-piercing ammunition designated by military or law enforcement authorities. Additionally, it addresses projectiles capable of penetrating the Executive Protection Exemplar. The Secretary will establish standards for testing projectiles against the Executive Protection Exemplar within a year of this provision. The standards will consider factors like firearm range and propellant types. The Executive Protection Exemplar is defined as the minimum level of protective material necessary for law enforcement safety. SEC. 4 amends the definition of firearm in the Internal Revenue Code to include laser sights and laser-sight equipped firearms. SEC. 5 regulates the manufacture, importation, and sale of projectiles capable of penetrating police body armor. Expansion of the definition of armor-piercing ammunition to include projectiles that can penetrate body armor in handguns. The Secretary will establish standards for testing projectiles against body armor within a year. The Secretary will establish standards for testing projectiles against body armor in handguns, in cooperation with the Attorney General of the United States. These standards will consider factors such as barrel length and powder type. The term \"Body Armor Exemplar\" refers to body armor meeting minimum protection standards for law enforcement officers."
