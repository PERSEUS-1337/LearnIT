    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 7.5 adds a new section to the Revenue and Taxation Code for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund. Individuals can designate a contribution on their tax return, which must exceed their tax liability and be in full dollar amounts. Once designated, it is irrevocable for that taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board will update the tax return form to include a section for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund contribution. The contribution can be one dollar or more and will support authorized diabetes research organizations. A deduction is allowed for contributions made. An \"authorized diabetes research organization\" for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund includes a university with a research program or a nonprofit organization engaged in research. Research activities involve developing techniques for the cure, screening, and treatment of type 1 diabetes. The Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund is established in the State Treasury to receive contributions from taxpayers. The Controller transfers designated amounts to the fund from the Personal Income Tax Fund. Moneys in the fund are allocated for research activities related to the cure, screening, and treatment of type 1 diabetes upon appropriation by the Legislature. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount needed for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund to appear on tax returns each year. They also estimate contributions to ensure they meet the minimum requirement. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund to appear on tax returns each year. If the estimated contributions fall below the minimum amount, the article becomes inoperative for that year and is repealed by December 1. The minimum contribution amount is set at $250,000 for the second calendar year after the fund's first appearance on tax returns. The Franchise Tax Board adjusts the minimum contribution amount for the Type 1 Diabetes Research Fund annually based on the California Consumer Price Index. The amount is calculated by multiplying the prior year's minimum contribution by the inflation factor adjustment."
