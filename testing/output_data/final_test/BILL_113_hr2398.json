    "content": "PROHIBITION ON ACTIONS THAT IMPEDE BORDER SECURITY ON CERTAIN FEDERAL LAND. The \"National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act\" prohibits the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture from impeding U.S. Customs and Border Protection activities within 100 miles of international land borders on Federal land. This includes search and rescue operations and preventing unlawful entries into the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is authorized immediate access to Federal land within the specified distance of international borders. The \"National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act\" allows the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture to conduct activities within 100 miles of the international land border to prevent unlawful entries into the United States, including construction of roads and barriers, vehicle patrols, and deployment of surveillance equipment. The waiver granted by the Secretary of Homeland Security in 2008 under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act applies to all Federal land within 100 miles of the international borders for Customs and Border Protection activities. The laws waived for Customs and Border Protection activities include the Wilderness Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Antiquities Act, Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, Fish and Wildlife Act. The laws waived for Customs and Border Protection activities include various acts such as the Wilderness Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, and others. The section also specifies that it does not restrict legal uses like grazing, hunting, mining, or recreational activities on land under the Secretary's jurisdiction. The Act does not affect State or private lands and does not grant authority over them. It also does not override treaties with Indian tribes."
