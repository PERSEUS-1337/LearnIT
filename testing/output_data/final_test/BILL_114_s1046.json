    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smart Building Acceleration Act\". Congress finds that the building sector uses over 40% of the nation's energy, new technologies are leading to energy-efficient \"smart\" buildings, analyzing private-sector smart buildings can promote adoption of these technologies, the Federal Government owns over 400,000 buildings, and can help accelerate the transition to smart building technologies. The Federal Government aims to evaluate emerging smart building technologies using existing programs and funding to showcase selected Federal smart buildings. The Act defines key terms such as \"program,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"smart building,\" which refers to buildings with flexible, automated energy systems. These buildings have extensive monitoring and communication capabilities, integrate energy control, and communicate with utilities. The Secretary will survey privately owned smart buildings nationwide, including commercial and nonprofit buildings. At least one building of various sizes and types will be selected for evaluation based on cost and benefits using Federal Energy Management Program guidelines. This evaluation will identify cost-effective advanced building technologies for increasing energy savings. The Secretary will survey privately owned smart buildings nationwide to identify cost-effective advanced building technologies for increasing energy savings, service performance to occupants, and reducing environmental impacts, as well as any other relevant information determined by the Secretary. The Federal Smart Building Program aims to identify cost-effective advanced building technologies for energy savings and environmental impact reduction. The Secretary will establish a program for smart buildings in key Federal agencies to demonstrate costs and benefits. Agencies include Department of Defense, Energy, Veterans Affairs, and General Services Administration. Existing procurement mechanisms will be leveraged, and evaluation will be based on Federal Energy Management Program guidelines. The Secretary will identify cost-effective advanced building technologies that increase energy savings, improve service performance, and reduce environmental impacts in selected buildings. Additional information deemed appropriate will also be included. SEC. 6. LEVERAGING EXISTING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Energy will develop a smart building accelerator under the Better Building Challenge to speed up the transition to smart buildings. Research and development will focus on overcoming barriers and reducing costs for advanced building technologies. The smart building accelerator under the Better Building Challenge aims to accelerate the adoption of smart building technologies by focusing on data management, business models, building characterization, consumer and utility protections, continuous management, and other areas of research and development as determined appropriate by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will submit a report to the Senate and House committees 18 months after the Act's enactment, detailing the survey and evaluation of private sector and Federal smart buildings, along with recommendations to accelerate the transition to smart buildings."
