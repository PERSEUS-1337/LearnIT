Rafael Correa, a three-time elected president, strained relations with the United States due to his populist and anti-imperialist stance. Ecuador's President Correa's anti-imperialist stance strained relations with the United States, leading to the expulsion of the U.S. ambassador in 2011. Despite restoring diplomatic relations in 2012, tensions persisted. A devastating earthquake in 2016 caused significant damage and displacement, exacerbating political tensions due to declining oil revenues. President Correa's \"Citizens' Revolution\" was aligned with 21st-century socialism, similar to leaders in Venezuela and Bolivia. In 2016, Ecuador's economy contracted by 1.6% due to declining oil revenues, leading to political tensions. President Correa faced low approval ratings, similar to other leftist leaders in South America. Len\u00edn Moreno won the 2017 presidential elections and diverged from Correa's policies, calling for a national referendum in 2018 to limit presidential power and protect indigenous areas. President Moreno won the referendum with over 60% voter approval, facing economic challenges and relying on his supporters in the divided AP governing party. Correa convinced a third of AP members to form a new party, while Moreno maintains a popular approval rating of nearly 70%. Ecuador has a history of democracy marked by instability since independence in 1830. Since independence in 1830, Ecuador's political culture has been defined by regionalism and personalism, leading to frequent cycles of instability. After a return to democracy in 1979, political party splits, corruption, and bureaucratic ineptitude became prevalent. In 2007, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, was elected, ending a decade of political and economic instability. Correa built a broad coalition of support, including indigenous groups, the poor, trade unions, and environmentalists. Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, was elected in 2007, rallying the nation to support a referendum to rewrite Ecuador's constitution. The new constitution increased the power of the executive and allowed the president to run for two consecutive terms. Correa was elected president in 2008, with his party winning the most seats in the National Assembly. Ecuador's economy benefitted from oil price increases starting in 2006. The Correa government in Ecuador benefitted from oil price increases, using petroleum exports to invest in infrastructure and economic development. Public expenditures were increased, including cash transfer programs for the poor, leading to a significant decline in poverty rates. Despite his popularity, President Correa was seen as defensive and authoritarian by some observers. President Correa's economic growth allowed for redistributive policies benefiting lower-income groups. His Citizens' Revolution focused on economic justice and Andean pride, criticizing traditional Ecuadorian politics. In 2010, a police uprising was seen as an attempted coup by Correa, who centralized power and targeted opponents. In 2011, he won a lawsuit against El Universo newspaper for a critical column. President Correa's government faced international criticism for politicizing the justice system and harassing critics. Despite this, he won a second term in 2013 with 57% of the vote, securing a strong congressional majority. His popularity was unprecedented in Ecuador since the late 1970s. In mid-2013, President Correa issued Decree 16 allowing the government to disband civil society organizations for various reasons. The Media Oversight Commission fined a newspaper and required a cartoonist to amend his drawing in 2014. Ecuador's press freedom ranking dropped in 2015, leading to opposition forming against President Correa. Opposition to President Correa grew in 2015 due to various issues, including a national strike by the major labor union confederation against new labor laws and pension changes. Other protestors, including right-leaning opponents and indigenous groups, joined in. Human Rights Watch criticized the government's use of force against nonviolent protesters. President Correa's push for indefinite reelection faced opposition in the National Assembly dominated by his party. In 2015, President Correa faced opposition for pushing for indefinite reelection, despite strong public support for a national referendum on the issue. Despite criticism, the National Assembly approved constitutional changes allowing for indefinite reelection, with Correa announcing he would not benefit from the change. In the 2017 elections, Len\u00edn Moreno, a former vice president under Rafael Correa, ran for president representing the AP party. He campaigned on continuing Correa's leftist policies but also emphasized the need for a better balance between public and private interests. Moreno polled in first place during the pre-electoral stage and came close to winning the first round in February 2017. He is seen as more affable and easygoing than Correa. Len\u00edn Moreno, known for his affable nature and advocacy for disability issues, won the 2017 elections with 40% of the vote. His vice president, Jorge Glas, was unpopular and embroiled in a corruption scandal. Moreno reassured the public that he would not step down due to health reasons. In 2016, Moreno promised transparency in managing Petroecuador, where Glas previously worked. He narrowly won the presidency on April 2, 2017, with 51.2% of the vote, defeating Lasso. Lasso, a former banker, campaigned for change after a decade of AP party rule. Moreno and Glas began their term on May 24, 2017. Ecuador also held legislative elections in February 2017, with over 3,900 candidates vying for seats in the 137-member body. The dominant AP party lost seats in the National Assembly due to low oil prices and a contracting economy. The Moreno Administration faces a more fractured National Assembly with widening fissures within the party, exacerbated by the impeachment of Vice President Glas for corruption. Former President Correa campaigned against a public referendum declared by President Moreno, viewing it as an attack on his legacy. Former President Correa split the AP party by inducing 28 legislators to join a new party called Citizens Revolution, causing the AP to lose its legislative majority. President Moreno now needs to negotiate with multiple parties to pass legislation, despite the February referendum results being approved by voters. Ecuador's economy heavily relies on export commodities like bananas, cacao, coffee, and sugar, leading to economic instability due to volatile price swings. The discovery of oil in 1967 transformed the economy, and dollarization in 2000 helped curb inflation. Despite a decline in economic growth in 2009, the economy rebounded in 2010 and grew steadily until 2014, attributed to a public investment boom fueled by high oil prices and Chinese lending. Ecuador's economy suffered a downturn in 2015 and 2016 due to falling oil earnings and a failed attempt to boost the economy by extracting oil from Yasun\u00ed National Park. The country's GDP contracted by 1.6% in 2016, worsened by a costly earthquake in April 2016 requiring $3 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian aid. Ecuador faced a $3 billion burden for reconstruction and humanitarian aid after a costly earthquake in April 2016. The U.S. provided $3 million in assistance, while a U.N. appeal aimed to raise $73 million, with only one-fifth received by July 2016. The government increased taxes and cut expenditures, eventually seeking assistance from the IMF, which approved a $364 million request. In July 2016, the IMF approved a $364 million financial support request for Ecuador under its Rapid Financing Instrument. Ecuador, facing limited access to global financial markets due to a 2008 default, sought assistance from China and the World Bank. Chinese banks provided nearly $11 billion in financing from 2005 to 2014, with an additional $7.5 billion requested in 2015. China agreed to the request, disbursing funds including nearly $1 billion in May and June 2015. Ecuador also returned to the international capital market in June 2014 with a $2 billion issuance. Ecuador returned to the international capital market in June 2014 with a $2 billion bond issue, followed by smaller bond issues in 2015. President Moreno discovered that Ecuador owes China almost 500 barrels of crude oil, equivalent to three years of oil production. Analysts question Ecuador's ability to meet debt obligations due to low oil prices and a strong U.S. dollar. Ecuador withdrew from regional free trade agreement negotiations in 2006. The United States signed bilateral FTAs with Peru and Colombia, while Ecuador did not show interest in an FTA. Venezuela joined Mercosur in 2012, prompting Bolivia and Ecuador to seek full membership. Ecuador embraced a trade agreement with the EU in 2017. The EIU forecasted a growth in Ecuador's economy in 2018. Relations between Ecuador and the U.S. were tense during Correa's presidency. During Correa's presidency, Ecuador's relations with the U.S. government were strained. Correa expelled U.S. State Department representatives and imposed restrictions on USAID, leading to its closure in Ecuador. He also expelled the World Bank's representative and defaulted on $3.2 billion in sovereign debt. Correa aligned Ecuador with nontraditional allies like China and Iran, causing concern in Washington. He criticized U.S. policies as imperialistic and a threat to Ecuador's sovereignty. President Correa of Ecuador cooperated closely with the United States on counternarcotics efforts and combating crime but was a vocal critic of Plan Colombia, a program supported by the U.S. He shut down U.S. counterdrug operations at the Manta air force base in 2009 and joined the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA) as an alternative to U.S.-led trade partnerships. In 2012, Ecuador provided asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. President Moreno indicated in 2018 that housing Julian Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London was no longer convenient. It remains unclear what action he may take to expel Assange. President Correa also considered an asylum request from Edward Snowden in 2013. Throughout Correa's tenure, violations of constitutional freedoms in Ecuador were criticized by State Department spokespersons, including lawsuits against the press, dismantling of civil society organizations, and forced closures like the Pachamama Foundation in 2013. Forced closures in Ecuador under the Correa Administration included the Pachamama Foundation and Fundamedios, the last watchdog media organization in the country. Fundamedios faced criticism for not blocking social media posts critical of the government. Despite announcing its closure in 2015, the government later suspended the decision due to international backlash. Ecuador is highlighted in the State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report as a source, transit, and destination country for sex trafficking and forced labor. Vulnerable populations are particularly at risk. The State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report highlights Ecuador as a Tier 2 country, not fully compliant with trafficking standards but making efforts to improve. Key recommendations include funding programs for trafficking victims, implementing a national anti-trafficking plan, and improving investigations and prosecutions. Foreign assistance for Ecuador in FY2013 exceeded $18 million, with $13 million in USAID development assistance. The Correa Administration's restrictions limited programs conducted by the State Department and USAID in Ecuador. In FY2015, U.S. assistance programs in Ecuador were restricted, leading to a drop in foreign aid allocations below $1 million. The Obama Administration requested $2 million in development assistance for Ecuador in FY2016, primarily to support civil society groups. In FY2017, $1.6 million was appropriated for similar activities, but no funding was requested in the Trump Administration's FY2018 budget. The Peace Corps provided $5.1 million in FY2017 to support volunteers in Ecuador. In FY2016, Ecuador received earthquake response assistance from the State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Ecuador requested temporary protected status for citizens affected by the disaster in the U.S., but the request was declined. U.S.-Ecuadorian relations have remained stable, with a focus on trade. A commercial dispute involves a lawsuit against Chevron. Ecuador's major exports include petroleum, bananas, cut flowers, and shrimp. In 1993, 30,000 Amazon residents in Ecuador filed a lawsuit against Chevron, claiming injuries from toxic waste. The legal case lasted 22 years, resulting in an $18 billion judgment against Chevron, later reduced to $9.5 billion. Chevron alleged fraud and bribery in the Ecuadorian court's decision and pursued international arbitration. The Amazonian plaintiffs targeted Chevron's assets in other countries, such as Canada. Ecuador has attracted little foreign direct investment due to corruption, judicial system weaknesses, and inconsistent laws. Former President Correa threatened to withdraw the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, which was later voted out by the legislature. Despite efforts to attract investment in sectors like mining, corruption remains a problem, with Ecuador ranking 120 out of 176 countries for corruption perception. Ecuador's corruption perception index score was 31 out of 100 in 2016. The country was previously a beneficiary of the Andean Trade Preferences Act but lost these preferences in 2013. Ecuador considered granting asylum to Edward Snowden during the renewal period for the trade preferences. Ecuador benefited from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, with $291 million of exports qualifying for GSP treatment in 2014. However, the GSP was not renewed in December 2017. The future of Ecuador's relationship with the United States under President Moreno's leadership remains uncertain after his victory in the 2018 referendum. President Moreno may face challenges in implementing policy changes due to constraints within his party, the need to gain support from a movement led by Correa, a fragmented National Assembly, and the reliance on ad hoc coalitions."
