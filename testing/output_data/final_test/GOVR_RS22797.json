    "content": "Increased seafood consumption is recommended for a healthier diet, but it comes with risks from microbes and toxins. Data limitations make it challenging to quantify the public health burden over time. In 2007, the CDC reported 1,097 outbreaks causing 21,244 illnesses, with seafood being the cause of 24.2% of outbreaks and 318 illnesses. Seafood is responsible for a disproportionate number of outbreaks compared to beef and poultry consumption. Most seafood-related outbreaks in 2007 were caused by naturally occurring toxins like ciguatera and scombroid poisoning. Other common issues include norovirus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus in raw shellfish, and pathogens like Clostridium botulinum in processed seafood products. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has highlighted risks associated with consuming seafood, including high levels of chemical and heavy metal pollutants like mercury, lead, PCBs, and pesticides. Concerns about contamination of seafood from the Gulf of Mexico post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill have also been raised. Nearly half of worldwide seafood consumption comes from food sources. The FDA issued an import alert for contaminated aquacultured seafood from China due to the presence of unapproved antimicrobial agents. Eleven Chinese firms have been exempted from the alert as of September 30, 2010. Increased imports of fish and shellfish from various Asian countries, including China, have complicated efforts to ensure consumer safety. By 2008, imports accounted for 83% of U.S. per-capita seafood consumption. The FDA is responsible for the safety of all domestic and imported foods, including seafood, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Meat and poultry products are inspected by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. All FDA-regulated foods must be safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. The FDA regulates food safety, setting maximum levels of toxic substances in foods and requiring adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices. Seafood is further regulated under HACCP, which involves analyzing safety hazards and implementing control measures. Domestic and foreign food facilities must comply with these regulations to ensure consumer safety. Importers of foreign seafood must verify compliance with HACCP rules. Not all firms need a plan if the product is low risk. FDA inspects seafood establishments annually, with 3,415 inspected in 2007, 3,265 in 2008, and 3,013 in 2009. FDA can refuse entry to any food import if it appears unsafe. The FDA has the authority to refuse entry to any food import that appears to be adulterated, misbranded, or in violation of the law. They rely on bonding, prior notifications by importers, and document reviews at ports for oversight. In FY2007, FDA processed 868,000 entries of imported seafood and conducted 14,000 physical examinations. Foreign seafood processors must comply with HACCP rules, and U.S. importers must ensure compliance. FDA conducts inspections of importers and foreign processors to check for compliance. The FDA conducts inspections of importers and foreign processors of seafood, focusing on major exporters to the United States and developing countries. They are exploring the use of third parties to certify compliance with HACCP regulations. The FDA is considering using third parties for onsite audits of seafood programs, including aquacultured shrimp imports. The National Marine Fisheries Service administers a voluntary seafood inspection program that goes beyond FDA requirements. The National Marine Fisheries Service offers seafood inspection services, including on-site inspections, quality checks, and laboratory testing, for a fee. These services provide official grading and labeling marks to make products more appealing to buyers, with exporters being frequent users due to foreign buyer requirements. In 2009, the program inspected 1.6 billion pounds of seafood, accounting for 34% of total consumption in the US. In January 2008, the Government Accountability Office recommended NOAA and FDA to collaborate on food safety oversight. In October 2009, they signed a memorandum of understanding to share resources and information for seafood inspections. GAO reported in February 2009 that U.S. agencies responsible for detecting seafood fraud do not effectively collaborate. The GAO observed that CBP and NMFS conduct activities to detect seafood fraud, while FDA focuses on food safety. However, fraud can lead to safety issues, such as mislabeled fish causing illnesses. Recommendations were made to improve fraud detection, including adding provisions to FDA seafood regulations. FDA cooperates with states and foreign countries in a National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The FDA collaborates with shellfish-producing states and foreign countries in the National Shellfish Sanitation Program to ensure the safe production of molluscan shellfish for human consumption. Regulations are enforced through the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference to trace products to safe harvest waters. New requirements for post-harvest processing of Gulf of Mexico oysters were announced to reduce illnesses from Vibro vulnificus bacteria. Vibro vulnificus is a pathogenic bacteria found in marine environments, causing severe illnesses when individuals consume contaminated raw or undercooked oysters. In healthy people, it can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, while immunocompromised individuals face life-threatening symptoms. Despite efforts to reduce illnesses, severe cases still occur annually with a high mortality rate. Collaboration between the FDA and ISSC aims to educate and refrigerate oysters post-harvest, but the goal of reducing severe illnesses and deaths by 60% has not been achieved. The FDA announced changes to its policy on raw shellfish during the 2009 ISSC meeting, requiring post-harvest processing technologies like freezing and irradiation. However, as of October 2010, no action had been taken. Gulf seafood industry representatives expressed concerns about the costly implementation of these requirements, estimating that oyster prices could double or triple. FDA stated that 40% of Gulf oysters are harvested during warm months and half are consumed raw. The Gulf Coast oyster industry subjects 15% of oysters to PHP methods, costing three to four cents per oyster. Restaurant owners argue that PHP affects texture and flavor, but FDA claims consumers can't tell the difference. Bills like the Gulf Oyster Protection Act of 2009 aim to prohibit FDA's PHP requirement. The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform explosion led to the release of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the closure of oil-affected federal waters for fishing by NOAA. The closure of oil-affected federal waters for fishing in the Gulf of Mexico was implemented to prevent contaminated seafood from entering markets. Portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida state waters were included in the closure, covering 88,522 square miles of federal waters. Despite re-openings, concerns about seafood safety persist due to the volume of oil and dispersants used during the spill response. Crude oil and petroleum products contain PAHs that can bio-accumulate in marine organisms, making seafood unfit for consumption. Tainted seafood is considered adulterated by the FDA. Dispersants have a lower potential to bio-accumulate in fish and do not affect the bio-accumulation potential of oil contaminants. Some scientists oppose the use of dispersants like Corexit due to concerns about their impact on marine organisms. They believe that dispersants can increase the concentration of hydrocarbons in the water column, making oil more toxic to organisms. The use of dispersants may allow dispersed oil to be more easily taken up by organisms, potentially harming sensitive water column or benthic populations. The report recommends funding toxicity studies to understand the effects of dispersed oil on organisms. FDA, NOAA, and coastal states have a protocol for reopening fishing areas after ensuring they are free of oil. Seafood samples must pass sensory and chemical tests to detect harmful oil residues. The FDA and NOAA conduct sensory and chemical tests on seafood samples to detect oil and dispersants. Samples must pass both tests before an area can be reopened to fishing. Results have shown PAH levels well below the levels of concern, indicating no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors in federal waters reopened through October 22, 2010. Analyses have found no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors in seafood samples. NOAA and FDA sampling have not found contamination, and fish harvested from unaffected areas are considered safe to eat. Funding has been allocated for a strategic marketing plan and seafood safety program in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. BP has also agreed to provide funds for seafood testing. In the 104th Congress, seafood safety proposals aimed to align fish inspection with meat and poultry standards. USDA's FSIS inspects livestock and poultry before and after slaughter, while FDA oversees seafood safety. Jurisdictional differences have hindered previous bills from passing. Seafood safety gained attention in the 110th Congress due to reports of contaminated foods from foreign sources. Congressional hearings and media reports in 2007 and 2008 highlighted the role of foreign producers in meeting U.S. demand for fish and shellfish. FDA legislation (P.L. 110-85) in 2007 included a provision for developing a traceability system for catfish and seafood products, both domestic and imported. The report completed on November 20, 2008, focuses on identifying the processing plant of origin for catfish and seafood products, assessing risks associated with contaminants and banned substances. Congress enacted a farm bill in June 2008 designating catfish as an \"amenable species\" subject to mandatory inspection under the FMIA. This provision applies to companies processing catfish for food and directs USDA to consider the conditions under which catfish is raised and transported for processing. The report focuses on identifying the processing plant of origin for catfish and seafood products, assessing risks associated with contaminants and banned substances. Congress enacted a farm bill designating catfish as an \"amenable species\" subject to mandatory inspection under the FMIA. The inspection provision was urged by the U.S. catfish industry due to competitive pressure from foreign producers, particularly in Asia. The intent is for catfish to be subject to continuous inspection, with imported catfish inspection programs needing to be equivalent under USDA regulations before being imported into the U.S. The Secretary has authority to mandate inspection for other seafood species if deemed appropriate, but has not used this authority yet. FSIS did not meet a December 2009 deadline for implementing final regulations. The agency did not meet the December 2009 deadline for implementing final regulations for the catfish inspection program. Proposed regulations have not been published as of October 2010. FSIS estimated the need for funding and staff to implement the program. At least 22 processing plants in the southern United States would need to be inspected, and 15 foreign countries would need to meet FSIS standards before exporting catfish to the U.S. Additionally, a voluntary grading program for catfish is required under the farm bill. In the 111th Congress, food safety bills such as H.R. 2749 and S. 510 were introduced to increase inspections and tighten record-keeping for FDA-regulated foods, including seafood. Representative Dingell introduced H.R. 2749, a revised version of H.R. 759, while Senator Richard Durbin introduced S. 510. S. 510 passed in the Senate on November 30, 2010. Both H.R. 2749 and S. 510 aim to enhance food safety by increasing inspections, tightening record-keeping, and mandating product recalls. They propose requirements such as facility registration, improved record-keeping, FDA recall authority, safety certification for imports, and food safety plans with preventive controls. The Senate bill includes provisions for seafood safety improvements and updates to guidelines within 180 days. Interagency agreements aim to improve seafood safety by coordinating inspections, standardizing data, and conducting joint training. Section 114 requires a report before regulations on post-harvest processing of oysters are issued. Section 306 involves sending inspectors to assess imported seafood production in the United States. The oyster industry, through the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, may have inspectors sent by the Secretary of Commerce to assess practices of seafood exporters. Reports from these inspections would be shared with the country or exporter and the Secretary of HHS. Another bill, H.R. 875, proposes creating a new Food Safety Administration within HHS separate from the FDA, transferring all current food safety functions from the FDA. The DeLauro bill proposes transferring all current food safety functions, personnel, and assets from the FDA to a new agency. It would also move personnel and assets related to the NMFS seafood inspection program to the new agency. Several bills focusing on seafood safety have been introduced, including measures by Senator Vitter to refuse seafood imports that do not meet U.S. standards. The bill aims to enforce U.S. standards for seafood imports by requiring inspections of foreign facilities, establishing state inspection programs, and increasing laboratory capacity for seafood analysis. Representative Weiner's bill calls for enhanced cooperation between Commerce and HHS, more certified labs for seafood testing, and funding of $15 million annually from FY2010 to FY2014 for these activities."
