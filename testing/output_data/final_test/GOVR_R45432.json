    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program providing medical services to low-income populations, including children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly. States have flexibility in designing their Medicaid programs within federal guidelines, leading to variability across states. Waiver authorities allow states to operate their programs outside federal rules. Enrollees receive benefits through fee-for-service or managed care. Since the 1990s, Medicaid enrollees have increasingly been covered by managed care, with about 81% enrolled in some form of managed care as of July 2016. States traditionally used fee-for-service (FFS) for Medicaid, but now most have both FFS and managed care enrollees. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with federal funding being an open-ended entitlement. The federal government provides open-ended Medicaid funding to states based on a percentage of each dollar spent, determined by the FMAP rate. States incur costs by paying service providers and performing administrative activities. Additionally, states may make supplemental payments to providers. States may provide supplemental payments to Medicaid providers in addition to regular payments for services. Payment rates vary by state and must be sufficient to ensure access to care for Medicaid enrollees. Low payment rates have led to concerns about provider participation, with many physicians not accepting Medicaid patients due to these rates. In 2015, CMS implemented a regulation to address low Medicaid payment rates affecting patient access to care. In 2018, a proposed rule aimed to give states more flexibility in meeting access monitoring requirements, especially for those using managed care. Supplemental payments to Medicaid providers are separate from regular payments and not tied to specific services rendered. Supplemental payments in a lump sum are provided to Medicaid providers for various reasons, such as quality initiatives and supporting certain types of facilities. States receive federal reimbursement for these payments based on their FMAP. All states make supplemental payments under FFS to different providers like hospitals, nursing facilities, physicians, and mental health facilities. DSH payments are required supplemental payments to hospitals treating low-income patients, but states may also make other non-DSH FFS supplemental payments. In addition to DSH payments, states may also provide non-DSH FFS supplemental payments to certain institutional providers, subject to upper payment limits. States typically fund these supplemental payments through various sources like intergovernmental transfers, provider taxes, or certified public expenditures. These payments make up a significant portion of total Medicaid spending, with states reporting $40.6 billion in total Medicaid FFS supplemental payment expenditures in FY2017. Supplemental payment expenditures, including federal and state funds, accounted for 7.2% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. DSH supplemental payment expenditures totaled $16.0 billion, while non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures were $24.6 billion. States also make supplemental payments through managed care and Section 1115 waivers, including pass-through payments. Pass-through payments are made by states to MCOs, who are then expected to pass these payments to providers as directed by the state. These payments are not tied to services provided to Medicaid enrollees. CMS may grant states Medicaid Section 1115 waiver authority to make supplemental payments not allowed under Medicaid rules. Data on these payments are limited, with state data only showing aggregate expenditures by provider type, not at the individual provider level. Recommendations have been made for CMS to collect and publish provider-level data to ensure appropriate spending for Medicaid purposes. The report discusses supplemental Medicaid payments to providers, including FFS payments, managed care pass-through payments, and Medicaid waiver supplemental payments. States make supplemental payments under FFS, with different regulations for DSH and non-DSH payments. Federal statute requires DSH payments to hospitals and mental health facilities treating large populations. The provision aims to recognize the financial challenges faced by hospitals treating low-income patients through Medicaid DSH payments. These payments are capped and each state receives an annual allotment for DSH funding. States have flexibility in defining DSH hospitals and calculating payments. In FY2017, federal DSH allotments totaled $12.0 billion. In FY2017, states had significant flexibility in designating DSH hospitals and making DSH payments. States vary in the proportion and types of hospitals receiving DSH funds, with some targeting a few hospitals and others providing payments to all eligible hospitals. States also make DSH payments to mental health facilities, with federal limits on payments to IMDs. States must submit annual reports and independent audits for Medicaid DSH payments. While states are required to make Medicaid DSH payments, there is no federal mandate for non-DSH supplemental payments. In FY2017, states had flexibility in designating DSH hospitals and making DSH payments. Most states make non-DSH supplemental payments to hospitals, nursing homes, ICF/IIDs, physicians, and nonhospital clinics. Unlike DSH payments, non-DSH supplemental payments are not tied to a specific purpose, giving states discretion in disbursing them to providers. States use non-DSH FFS supplemental payments to offset low Medicaid payments for services. In FY2017, states had flexibility in designating DSH hospitals and making DSH payments. Most states make non-DSH supplemental payments to hospitals, nursing homes, ICF/IIDs, physicians, and nonhospital clinics to support safety-net providers. Federal regulations specify UPLs for certain institutional providers, limiting Medicaid payments to what Medicare would pay for the same services. UPLs are aggregate limits for each class of providers, excluding DSH payments. Institutions subject to UPL requirements include hospitals and nursing facilities. In FY2017, states had flexibility in designating DSH hospitals and making DSH payments. Most states make non-DSH supplemental payments to various healthcare providers to support safety-net providers. UPLs are aggregate limits for each class of providers, excluding DSH payments, and include hospitals, nursing facilities, ICF/IIDs, and nonhospital clinics. Data on Medicaid non-DSH supplemental payments are limited, with CMS-64 data being the only publicly available federal administrative data for these expenditures. Since 2013, states have been required to submit additional information annually on non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures for hospitals and nursing facilities to ensure compliance with UPL requirements. States also need to submit data for ICF/IIDs and physician services for states making supplemental payments to physicians. Individual hospitals may receive non-DSH supplemental payments significantly greater than their Medicaid costs, raising concerns about the lack of data collection at the provider level by CMS. In FY2017, states reported $40.6 billion in total Medicaid FFS DSH and non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures, accounting for 7.2% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. Total DSH supplemental payment expenditures were $16.0 billion, while total non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures were $24.6 billion. In FY2017, total Medicaid DSH and non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures were $24.6 billion, accounting for 4.3% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. These payments include various services such as hospitals, nursing facilities, mental health facilities, and physician services. The distribution of these payments varied widely across all states, ranging from 0.4% in North Dakota to 19.9% in Alabama. In FY2017, Medicaid supplemental payment expenditures varied widely across states, with North Dakota at 0.4% and Alabama at 19.9%. New Hampshire's expenditures were mostly for DSH payments, while Wyoming's were primarily non-DSH payments. Nationally, hospitals received over 80% of the $40.6 billion in total Medicaid supplemental payments in FY2017. Nursing facilities received 8% and mental health facilities also received a portion of these payments. In FY2017, hospitals received over 80% of the $40.6 billion in total Medicaid supplemental payments, while nursing facilities received 8% and mental health facilities received 7% in the form of DSH payments. Physicians and surgeons received 2% of total Medicaid supplemental payments, and ICF/IIDs and other practitioners received less than 0.5%. The distribution of payments varies by provider type, with Medicaid DSH payments making up 52% of total Medicaid FFS medical assistance expenditures to mental health facilities. Total Medicaid DSH and non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures comprised nearly half (48%) of total Medicaid FFS medical assistance expenditures to inpatient hospitals. In FY2017, hospitals received the majority of total Medicaid supplemental payments, with nursing facilities and mental health facilities also receiving a share. Physicians and surgeons received a small portion of the payments. The distribution of payments varies by provider type and state, with Medicaid DSH and non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures making up a significant portion of total FFS Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. Inpatient hospitals received the largest share of both DSH and non-DSH supplemental payment expenditures. The ratio of supplemental payments to Medicaid FFS medical assistance expenditures varies by state, ranging from 1% in Alaska to 97% in Vermont. States transitioning Medicaid enrollees from FFS to managed care may face funding losses as FFS payments decrease, affecting their ability to make supplemental payments to providers. Pass-through payments under managed care serve a similar function to FFS supplemental payments. Pass-through payments in Medicaid managed care are similar to FFS supplemental payments and are used to support safety-net providers. Recent regulatory activity by CMS has phased down states' use of pass-through payments, including a limit on their use in a 2016 managed care regulation. The regulation required states to phase out pass-through payments to physicians, nursing facilities, and hospitals over a 5 to 10-year period starting in July 2017. CMS clarified in a final rule that states cannot increase existing or implement new pass-through payments, aiming to maintain current levels. The final rule established aggregate limits on pass-through payments to physicians, nursing facilities, and hospitals, based on amounts in managed care contracts and rate certifications as of July 5, 2016. Pass-through payments to hospitals were limited to a certain percentage of a \"base amount\" over a 10-year period or the total aggregate dollar amount identified by the state. Transition periods were provided for states to integrate existing pass-through payments to MCOs. The final rule established limits on pass-through payments to healthcare providers, with examples of permissible payment structures including value-based purchasing models and quality incentive payments. States can direct existing pass-through payments to MCOs during the transition period if certain requirements are met, such as achieving goals in the managed care quality strategy. One state is directing managed care plans to make quality incentive payments to hospitals to reduce avoidable readmissions for Medicaid enrollees. After July 1, 2022, Medicaid payments to providers must be integrated into value-based purchasing models, delivery system reform, or performance improvement efforts. CMS proposed a rule in 2018 to offer flexibilities, allowing states to make new pass-through payments under certain circumstances during the transition to managed care. States can make pass-through payments to hospitals, nursing facilities, or physicians if they had been making FFS supplemental payments previously. CMS estimated that several states were making significant pass-through payments annually to these providers. No national data is available on the exact amounts of pass-through payments. States can receive Section 1115 waiver authority to make supplemental payments to providers, including hospitals. Data on these payments are limited, but MACPAC estimated that hospitals received $15 billion in supplemental payments in FY2017. These payments are made through uncompensated care pools and DSRIP programs. Uncompensated care pools provide funding to healthcare providers, mainly hospitals, to cover the costs of care for uninsured patients or when Medicaid payments are insufficient. Seven states have waiver authority for these pools: California, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Texas. Under the George W. Bush Administration, Section 1115 waivers were first awarded in states like California, Florida, and Massachusetts. During the Obama Administration, CMS raised concerns about transparency and overreliance on supplemental payments in these financing arrangements. Under the Trump Administration, CMS renewed waivers with uncompensated care pools in states like Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas. Since 2017, CMS has approved uncompensated care pools in Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas, as well as DSRIP programs in various states. DSRIP payments are not tied to services provided but are aimed at supporting public hospitals and maintaining supplemental payments during the transition from FFS to managed care. California was the first state to receive approval for a DSRIP in 2010. CMS has approved DSRIP programs in several states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. These programs focus on implementing payment and delivery system reforms to improve care and lower costs, with a connection between DSRIP payments and improved health outcomes established through special terms and conditions in states' waivers. In June 2017, approved federal and state funding for DSRIP programs in various states totaled $48.6 billion. Providers receive payments for meeting milestones, initially tied to reporting and process implementation, then transitioning to outcomes-based goals like improving care and reducing costs. Examples include California integrating physical and behavioral health and New Jersey focusing on improving care for chronic conditions. CMS emphasizes that DSRIP programs are time-limited, with renewals approved for Texas and Massachusetts in 2017. In 2017, CMS approved renewals of Texas's and Massachusetts's DSRIP programs, with phasedowns to zero or limited funding in the last year of the demonstration. States would need sustainable funding sources to continue DSRIP activities."
