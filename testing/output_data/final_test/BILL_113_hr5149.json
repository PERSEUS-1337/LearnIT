The Act \"Smart Water Management Conservation and Efficiency Act of 2014\" establishes a smart water management pilot program for eligible entities like utilities, municipalities, water districts, and authorities providing water services. The Secretary of Energy will oversee the pilot program. The smart water management pilot program aims to award grants to eligible entities to demonstrate innovative technology solutions that increase energy and water efficiency in water systems, improve water quality, and support the implementation of advanced automated systems for real-time data monitoring. The Secretary will award competitive grants to 3-5 eligible entities for pilot projects focusing on energy and cost savings, innovative technology, next-generation sensors, software, analytics, and cost-effectiveness in improving water systems. The pilot project focuses on energy efficiency savings, water savings or reuse, and infrastructure costs. The technology should be deployable in various regions and scalable. The project should be completed within 5 years. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under the pilot program. The application for the pilot project must include a project description, technology details, anticipated results, budget, lead organization, partners, and number of users. The Secretary will select grant recipients based on project details, technology, anticipated results, budget, lead organization, partners, number of users, and any other necessary information. Evaluations will be conducted annually to assess project progress and impact. The Secretary will provide technical assistance upon request by grant recipients. The Secretary will also make evaluations and best practices available to the public, and submit a report to Congress on the results of each evaluation. The Secretary will allocate at least $7,500,000 for this section and prioritize funding for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office activities."
