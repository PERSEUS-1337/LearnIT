    "content": "Congress has focused on the 2002 attack near Timika and the human rights situation of the indigenous people in Papua. There is concern about a military buildup in the region and the potential for increased violence due to a separatist movement. U.S. relations with Indonesia improved in 2005, leading to decisions to resume military training and sales to Indonesia. Papuan issues are often overshadowed by broader U.S. policy towards Indonesia. The U.S. is considering waiving FMF restrictions for Indonesia due to national security concerns, shifting focus from past human rights issues in Papua. There is a shift towards closer ties with Indonesia, raising concerns about conveying continued U.S. concerns about human rights in the region. The U.S. is shifting focus towards closer ties with Indonesia, considering waiving FMF restrictions for national security reasons. Despite this shift, America remains concerned about human rights issues in the region, particularly in Papua. Ambassador Marie Hutala emphasized the importance of Indonesian progress on democracy, human rights, and justice. The Department of State's Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Indonesia highlights ongoing human rights abuses, including violence by security forces in Aceh and Papua. The Indonesian government has been arbitrarily detaining civilians and separatist movement members in Aceh and Papua. Foreign press is restricted from conflict areas in Aceh, Papua, Sulawesi, and Maluku. Progress has been made in strengthening democracy, with the establishment of a Papuan Peoples Council. There are hopes for improved human rights with further development of democracy and civil society. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Eric G. John highlighted human rights abuses in Papua and the lack of full implementation of the 2001 Special Autonomy Law. President Yudhoyono vowed to peacefully resolve the conflict in Papua and fully implement Special Autonomy. In August 2002, two Americans and an Indonesian were killed in an ambush near Timika, Papua. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear, with suspicions of Indonesian military involvement. Some believe elements of the Indonesian military may have been involved in the 2002 attack near Timika, Papua, possibly to discredit the Free Papua Movement. Anthonius Wamang, a suspected OPM commander, was arrested and accused of collaborating with the military. Concerns exist about the reliability of his interrogation testimony. Anthonius Wamang's testimony may be coerced to favor the military, as he admitted to carrying out an attack with Indonesian soldiers. There are suspicions of collaboration between Indonesian soldiers and Papuans against Freeport, with Wamang's group possibly involved in the killing of teachers. It is uncertain if Indonesia will extradite Wamang to the US, as confusion arose in 2005 over US legislation on Papua. Wamang and his group surrendered believing they would be taken to the US by the FBI, not into Indonesian custody. Indonesian reports on proposed Congressional legislation led to fears in Indonesia that the US was advocating for Papua's independence. The Indonesian House of Representatives warned against US Congress legislation on Papua, citing concerns due to Indonesia's colonial past and East Timor's history. The DPR sought clarification on US policy on Papua, to which the US Embassy reaffirmed support for Indonesia's territorial integrity. Approximately 40 U.S. Members of Congress sent a letter to the United Nations calling for support for a vote in Papua on independence. Thirty Five Members of Congress also sent a letter to Indonesian President Yudhoyono urging him to lift travel restrictions for international journalists and human rights advocates in Papua. Vice President Jusuf Kalla criticized the Congress members for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. Papuans are Melanesian people with a rich culture dating back thousands of years. The people of Papua have a culture dating back 40,000 years, different from the rest of Indonesia. The Dutch claimed Papua in 1828 and it remained a Dutch colonial possession. Unlike Indonesia, Papua did not become part of Indonesia at independence in 1949 due to ethnic and cultural differences. Indonesia began pressuring Dutch West Papua in 1961, leading to US pressure on the Dutch in 1962. In 1962, the United States pressured the Dutch to transfer control of West Papua to the United Nations. Indonesia assumed control in 1963 under the New York Agreement. The Act of Free Choice in 1969, where 1,025 officials voted to join Indonesia, was not seen as representative of Papuans' will. The UN failed to provide a fair opportunity for self-determination in West Papua. The Free Papua Movement (OPM) emerged as Western colonial policy ended, leading to Indonesian control in Papua. Human rights groups estimate 100,000 Papuans died under Indonesian rule. Declassified documents show US support for Indonesia's takeover, despite Papuans' opposition to Indonesian rule. The conflict in Papua stems from its natural wealth, dominated by resource extraction industries. Despite its riches, Papua remains one of Indonesia's poorest provinces. The Special Autonomy Law of 2001 mandates a percentage of royalties to go to the province, aiming to address this disparity. The United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices of 2004 describes Indonesia's human rights situation as poor, with security forces committing abuses in Aceh and Papua. President Yudhoyono calls for a political settlement in Papua within the framework of special autonomy, while the OPM continues to push for independence. The OPM is advocating for independence in Papua, while the Indonesian government has not fully implemented autonomy measures and plans to divide the province. Funds meant for Special Autonomy have reportedly been used for military operations. A report by the University of Sydney highlights concerns about the treatment of Papuans by the Indonesian military, posing threats to the indigenous people's survival in Papua. The report highlights the culture of impunity in Indonesia, with military operations causing thousands of deaths in Papua. Eyewitnesses report military involvement in arson, theft, rape, and torture. Indonesian military denies the findings, stating no militias in Papua. Australian Senator expresses concern over the situation in West Papua. The Genocide in West Papua report reveals evidence of repression by the Indonesian government, with Human Rights Watch describing the military's actions as using disproportionate force against civilians. Arbitrary detention, torture, disappearances, and arson are widespread in the region. The influx of non-Melanesian Indonesians has also been noted, contributing to tensions in the area. The 2004 report by the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale University Law School suggests that the Indonesian government may have committed genocide against the West Papuans. An international dimension to the conflict emerged in 2006 when a group of 43 Papuans sought political asylum in Australia. In 2006, 43 Papuans fled to Australia in an outrigger canoe seeking political asylum. The American Freeport-McMoRan Company operates a large gold and copper mine in Papua, providing significant wealth to Indonesia but with reportedly less positive impact locally. Freeport paid Indonesia over $1 billion in taxes, royalties, and dividends in 2005. Freeport has spent $200 million on a Community Development Fund since 1996 for its mine operations in Papua. The mine's waste has caused environmental damage, leading to accusations of environmental degradation and lack of wealth sharing with locals. Despite criticism, Freeport has taken steps to address the negative impacts. Freeport has a commitment to promoting sustainable development and has spent $72.7 million on environmental management and social development in 2004 to minimize negative impacts. They do not use cyanide or mercury in their processes in Papua and have developed local infrastructure. Twenty-five percent of employees are Papuans, and they have an apprentice program to increase this percentage. Business Week has praised Freeport's human rights audit, and Speaker of the House of Representatives Agung Laksono supports their continued operation. Agung Laksono supported Freeport's operation despite calls to revoke its license due to environmental damage. Freeport had financial ties with the Indonesian military, making payments to military and police officers. The company spent millions on military infrastructure and made direct payments to military commanders. These actions have been reported in the past. The Indonesian government is investigating allegations of illegal payments made by Freeport to the military. President Yudhoyono opposes independence for Papua but is open to some autonomy. The State Ministry plans to inspect Freeport's environmental management. The Indonesian government views the conflict in Papua as an internal affair and rejects international involvement. President Yudhoyono aims to resolve the issue peacefully through dialogue, while TNI Commander suspects an international conspiracy. President Yudhoyono's call for further investigation into the death of human rights activist Munir Thalib, who was poisoned on a Garuda Flight, reveals a motive to prevent Munir from criticizing the military and government's role in human rights abuses. The trial found Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto guilty of poisoning Munir, leading to a connection with former Deputy Chief of State Intelligence Muchdi Purwopranjono. Yudhoyono's actions signal a stance on human rights in Indonesia, following a period of government openness that led to autonomy for Papua. In 2001, laws were passed to grant Special Autonomy for Papua, allowing the province to keep more of its locally generated wealth. However, this autonomy was not fully implemented, and in 2003, President Megawati proposed dividing Papua into three provinces, which was seen as undermining Papuan unity. Subsequent plans in 2005 to further divide the province were met with resistance, with the Constitutional Court eventually allowing the division into two provinces. The Constitutional Court allowed the division of Papua into two provinces, Papua and West Irian Jaya Provinces, with the approval of the Papuan People's Council. Despite the Special Autonomy Law, the Indonesian government accepted plans to divide the province into five separate provinces by 2009, contradicting the president's commitment to peacefully resolve the conflict. The Papuan People's Council was to be consulted on major decisions, but plans to divide the province progressed before its establishment. Since coming under Indonesian rule, Papua has seen some development in its economy and infrastructure. The Papuan People's Council (MRP) was established in 2005, but its election process has faced opposition from Papuan groups. Critics, including Willy Mandowen and Tom Beanal, argue that the MRP is not representative of the Papuan people as pro-Indonesian leaders were chosen without open elections. The election process for the Papuan People's Council was not open to the public and was limited to select groups chosen by the government, excluding the Catholic Church. Officials of the Council Secretariat were appointed by the governor of Papua. Rodd McGibbon's analysis highlights Papua's control under the \"New Order\" regime, unilateral autonomy measures during the reform period, and Indonesia's failure to fulfill promises made under the special autonomy law. The special autonomy law in Indonesia, originating from Jakarta, has led to unilateral actions by the center, causing tensions within the state. Autonomy arrangements without involving separatist leaders and civil society may not be sustainable. Indonesia plans to deploy additional troops to Papua, with conflicting reports on the actual numbers. Some officials claim it is a troop rotation, not an increase in overall troop levels. A new division is being established in Papua with plans to deploy additional troops. The ideal number of troops for Papua is nine battalions or one division. Troops will be recruited from non-Melanesian parts of Indonesia. The arrival of troops in Papua is causing concern among Papuans. There are concerns about the establishment of East Timor-style militias and illegal logging activities by the military in Papua. Discussions in Indonesia are focusing on a more traditional defense role for the military. The military is shifting towards a defense-focused role, with increased deployments to Papua due to rising threats. The dispute with Malaysia over Ambalat and the need to establish presence in border areas are cited as reasons. Past conflicts with pro-Papuan independence groups have led to violent incidents. The Papuan flag was a topic of discussion between Indonesian President Habibie and the Forum for Reconciliation of Irian Jaya Society in 1998. A Papuan Peoples Congress in 2000 led to the formation of the Papuan Presidium Council, advocating for independence peacefully. The council's former Chairman, Theys Eluay, was killed in 2001, leading to the conviction of seven Indonesian soldiers in 2003. The Papuan Traditional Council and more extreme groups like the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) also exist, with an estimated 620 poorly armed guerillas. The OPM has 620 poorly armed guerillas with an assortment of weapons. The Liberation Army of Free Papua is their military wing. Some OPM groups have covert relationships with Indonesian military units. Papuan groups oppose Indonesian control over Papua due to their different identity. Many Papuans seek autonomy or independence from Indonesia. In 2005, the Papuan People's Civil Rights Coalition protested the UN's decision to transfer control of Papua to Indonesia. ELSHAM's John coordinates the Institute for Human Rights Study and Advocacy in Jayapura. The Government in Jakarta allows the military to dominate Papua, denying rights to the people and benefiting military officers through deals with mining and logging companies. The OPM seeks independence and immediate goals such as withdrawing Indonesian forces, reviewing the \"Act of Free Choice,\" releasing political prisoners, limiting transmigrants, and dismantling militia networks. Other groups also advocate for Papuan rights, with protests against the UN's decision to transfer control to Indonesia in 2005. The Rights Coalition protested the U.N.'s decision to transfer administrative control to Indonesia and rejected the Act of Free Choice. Flag raising in defiance led to clashes with Indonesian authorities in Jayapura in May 2005. Police banned flying the Papuan Morning Star flag despite Special Autonomy Law allowing it. The Institute for Human Rights Study criticized U.S. military ties with Indonesia. 10,000 Papuans protested in Jayapura in August 2005 for a review of the Special Autonomy Law. A pro-independence rally in Papua New Guinea coincided with the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in October 2005. Activists called on the Pacific Islands Forum to address Papua's case and allow Papuans as observers, but they were denied entry. Senator Leahy mentioned the FBI investigation into the 2002 attack and the human rights situation in Papua. Legislation H.R. 3057 did not include language on Papua, causing concern in Indonesia. Language in H.R. 2601 also raised issues in Indonesia. The proposed legislation in the Senate raised concern in Indonesia due to its focus on human rights violations by the TNI in Papua. While the language was not included in the final agreement, the Secretary of State was directed to submit a report on Papua as required by the Senate provision. This information is from H.R. 3057, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006. Efforts to revisit the Act of Free Choice in Papua are seen as a challenge to Indonesia's sovereignty. Some argue that US policy towards Papua should consider Indonesia's democracy and partnership in counterterrorism. Others emphasize the need to address human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. H.R. 3057, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2006, allows funds for Indonesia under certain conditions related to human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. The Armed Forces in Indonesia are cooperating with civilian and international authorities to address human rights violations, including in East Timor. The government is also implementing reforms to enhance civilian control of the military. The Secretary of State may waive certain conditions if it is in the national security interests of the United States. A report on Indonesian cooperation must be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days. The Indonesian government's efforts to address human rights violations, including in East Timor, are being monitored. The Secretary of State may waive conditions for national security interests. A report on Indonesian cooperation must be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days. The Secretary of State must submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations within 90 days, detailing the number of Indonesian troops in West Papua, armed separatists, progress towards a political settlement, humanitarian and human rights conditions, and the involvement of Indonesian military in reconstruction efforts in Aceh. The conference agreement does not include a provision proposed by the Senate regarding a 'West Papua Report' requiring the Secretary of State to submit a report regarding Indonesian troops, humanitarian and human rights conditions in the Papua region of Indonesia. The conferees direct the Secretary of State to submit the report within 90 days of enactment of the Act. The Senate provision in H.R. 2601 (Foreign Relations Authorization, FY2006-FY2007) requires the Secretary of State to submit a report on developments in and policy toward Indonesia within 90 days of enactment. Congress recognizes Indonesia's progress in democratization and decentralization, expresses condolences for the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and hopes for successful recovery efforts. The Government of Indonesia is commended for allowing international access to Aceh after the tsunami. Concerns are raised about human rights violations by Indonesian security forces, emphasizing the need for reform and civilian oversight. The Government of Indonesia is criticized for failing to hold soldiers and police accountable for human rights abuses, including torture, rape, and extrajudicial killings. There are calls for investigation into the poisoning of a human rights activist and cooperation with the FBI in investigating an attack in Papua. In 2002, an attack near Timika, Papua killed three people, including two Americans, and injured 12 others. Papua, a resource-rich province with predominantly Melanesian indigenous inhabitants, was formerly a Dutch colony. Indonesia claimed Papua as part of its territory since the late 1940s, but it remained under Dutch control until 1962 when it was transferred to Indonesia through the New York Agreement. In 1963, Indonesia recognized the eligibility of Papuans for self-determination. In 1969, an 'Act of Free Choice' was conducted, resulting in Papuan elders voting to join Indonesia. Since then, Papuans have faced human rights abuses, resource exploitation, and environmental degradation, with estimates of over 100,000 Papuans killed. The United States supports Indonesia's territorial integrity, but Indonesia's historical use of force has fueled independence sentiments among Papuans. Despite a Special Autonomy Law passed in 2001 to grant more autonomy to Papua, it has not been effectively implemented, leading to further conflicts within the province. Indonesia has sent additional troops to Papua, displacing civilians and causing mistrust towards the central government. Human rights abuses, including murder, torture, and arbitrary detention, have been reported in the region. The Secretary of State must report to Congress on the implementation of special autonomy for Papua and Aceh, including revenue allocations, access for international press and NGOs, local civil society involvement, Indonesian security forces conduct, and US efforts to promote human rights. Additionally, a report analyzing the 1969 Act of Free Choice must be submitted within 180 days."
