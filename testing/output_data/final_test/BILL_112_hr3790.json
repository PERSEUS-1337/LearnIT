    "content": "The \"Improving Cancer Treatment Education Act of 2012\" includes provisions for Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services and research on cancer symptom management improvement under the NIH. The Congress finds that cancer patients experience side effects and complications from treatment, impacting their health and quality of life. Timely symptom management and education can help reduce these effects. Studies show that personalized educational interventions for cancer pain management by registered nurses are effective for patients in outpatient and home-based settings. After attending a family caregiver cancer education program, caregivers reported feeling well-informed and confident in their caregiving role. Patients benefit from educational sessions with oncology nurses before treatment to manage side effects and improve well-being. The lack of coverage for patient treatment education by Medicare and other payers results in inadequate education for patients and caregivers before treatment initiation. The Oncology Nursing Society recommends one-on-one educational sessions for cancer patients before treatment to minimize adverse events and maximize well-being. Inadequate Medicare payments and lack of investment in symptom management research contribute to poor patient education and management of cancer symptoms. Patients with cancer often do not have their symptoms managed appropriately. They deserve access to comprehensive care, including treatment education. Different types of cancer care may not always include education on symptom management. Comprehensive cancer care should address services for nausea and vomiting. The Institute of Medicine reports emphasize the importance of managing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, and pain in cancer care to improve quality of life. Patients need relief from distressing symptoms, anxiety, and depression, as well as access to information about therapies and potential side effects. Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education and expanded cancer symptom management research can improve care and quality of life for older individuals with cancer. Medicare will now cover comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services under the Social Security Act to improve care for older individuals with cancer. Medicare now covers comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, which include a one-hour session delivered by a nurse to educate patients and caregivers about treatment, potential symptoms, side-effects, and adverse events. The comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services cover potential symptoms, side-effects, and adverse events, provide guidance on minimizing side effects, and offer information on treatment responsibilities and addressing symptoms. The information is delivered in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The text discusses the establishment of standards for cancer patient treatment education services, including updated information on cancer treatment for individuals undergoing modified therapy. The Secretary will consult with relevant organizations in setting these standards. Payment provisions under Section 1833(a)(1) of the Act are also amended. The text amends payment rates for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, aligning them with diabetes outpatient self-management training services. Coverage under Section 1862(a)(1) of the Act is also expanded to include comprehensive cancer patient treatment. The text expands coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services and aligns payment rates with diabetes outpatient self-management training services. It does not impact payment for other services and applies to services furnished after the enactment of the Act. TITLE II--RESEARCH ON CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT\n\nSEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that many cancer survivors experience side effects and symptoms from their disease and treatment, impacting their health and quality of life. Addressing these effects is crucial in reducing the burden of cancer. Despite advancements in cancer research, efforts to manage symptoms have not kept pace, and the National Institutes of Health should continue supporting research in symptom management. The National Institutes of Health should support research in symptom management and the role of nurses in providing interventions for cancer survivors. NIH research on improving cancer symptom management. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand programs for cancer symptom management and nursing interventions. Collaboration with various institutes is encouraged for research coordination."
