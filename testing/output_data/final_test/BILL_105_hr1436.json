    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public Schools Renewal and Improvement Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that many elementary and secondary public schools in the United States need additional resources for immediate assistance and reform to provide a basic and safe education for students. A third of all schools, serving 14 million students, require extensive repair and renovation. Recent reforms have shown that with adequate resources and expertise, under-achieving schools can be dramatically improved to create high-performance schools. Public schools are facing challenges in educating children for the 21st century, with the need for more teachers to meet expected enrollments. Almost 7 out of 10 Americans support increased Federal assistance for public schools. The purpose of this Act is to assist local communities in improving their public schools by overcoming adverse conditions, revitalizing schools to achieve higher academic standards, and ensuring quality education for all students. Federal investment in public schools has shown to improve test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollments. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 5 outlines the elements of the renewal and improvement plan.

A consortium must submit a plan with specified elements to receive assistance under this section, including addressing adverse conditions in schools such as low student performance and overcrowding. The plan for the public schools renewal effort must address adverse conditions in schools, including physical plant issues, teacher shortages, and safety concerns. The plan should be developed by a local schools consortium after extensive public discussion and include assurances on how resources will be used to meet these challenges. The consortium must use resources to implement reforms, provide professional development for school staff, increase parental involvement, focus on academic improvement, and address the responsibilities of all stakeholders in the public school system. The agency will prioritize public schools needing assistance in improving overcrowding, physical problems, health and safety concerns, readiness for technology, and teacher training. Funds must supplement, not replace, other non-Federal funds, and the state must ensure a minimum fiscal effort per student for free public education. The local schools consortium must ensure that their combined fiscal effort is at least 90 percent of previous expenditures and address critical issues for school renewal. SEC. 6.
