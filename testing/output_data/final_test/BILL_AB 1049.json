    "title": "AB 1049",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 7612 of the Family Code in California is amended to state that a presumption under Section 7611 can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence. If conflicting presumptions arise, the one based on weightier policy and logic controls. In an appropriate action, a court may find that more than two persons with a claim to parentage are parents if recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child. The court considers factors like harm of removing the child from a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child\u2019s needs. A finding of detriment does not require a finding of unfitness. The presumption under Section 7611 is rebutted by a judgment establishing parentage by another person unless the court orders otherwise. Within two years of a voluntary declaration of paternity, a presumed parent can petition to set it aside. The court considers the validity of the declaration, the best interests of the child, and the nature of the relationship with the child. If there is a conflict between the presumption of parentage and the voluntary declaration, policy and logic prevail. A voluntary declaration of paternity may be invalid if the child already had a presumed parent or if the man signing the declaration is a sperm donor. The offer or refusal to sign the declaration can be considered in legal parentage proceedings. Amendments are made to the Family Code regarding surrogacy, donor facilitators, and assisted reproduction agreements. Amendments to the Family Code include definitions for terms related to surrogacy and assisted reproduction agreements, such as \"intended parent\" and \"surrogacy or donor facilitator.\" The Family Code prohibits advertising for assisted reproduction agreements or oocyte donation, charging fees for related services, and defines a surrogate as a woman who carries a child for another through medically assisted reproduction. There are two types of surrogates: traditional surrogates who gestate embryos using their own gametes and gestational surrogates who carry embryos created using the intended father's sperm or a donor's sperm. A gestational carrier is a woman who agrees to carry an embryo that is not genetically related to her. A donor provides her oocytes for use by another person. Nonattorney surrogacy facilitators must direct clients to deposit funds into a bonded escrow depository or a trust account maintained by an attorney. Client funds for surrogacy or donor facilitation must be held in a trust account maintained by an attorney or an escrow company. Nonattorney facilitators cannot have a financial interest in the escrow company holding client funds. Funds can only be disbursed according to the agreements in place and do not apply to funds paid directly to medical professionals."
