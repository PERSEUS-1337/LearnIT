    "content": "This report summarizes federal financial assistance provided to Gulf Coast states in response to hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Congress appropriated funds for recovery, rebuilding, and mitigation efforts to reduce future storm impacts. The report summarizes federal financial assistance provided to the Gulf Coast states in response to hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Congress remains interested in how the money has been spent, the resources provided, and ensuring funds reach intended recipients for oversight and evaluation of response and recovery operations. This financial information helps frame congressional debates on federal assistance for future disasters. The report summarizes federal financial assistance provided to Gulf Coast states in response to hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. The 2005 hurricane season was record-breaking with 13 hurricanes, including three category 5 storms. Most damage was in Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. Hurricane Katrina started as a tropical depression on August 23, 2005, and caused significant damage. Hurricane Katrina became a category 5 hurricane before making landfall in southern Florida on August 25, 2005. It then moved to the eastern Gulf of Mexico, strengthening significantly. On August 29, 2005, the hurricane made landfall in southern Plaquemines Parish, LA, affecting a broad area from Alabama to southeast Louisiana. Initially a category 4 storm, it was later downgraded to a category 3, remaining one of the strongest storms to hit the U.S. Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast with winds reaching 125 mph. Over 1.2 million people evacuated, but 1,800 died and 300,000 homes were destroyed. Economic losses were estimated at $125-150 billion. Hurricane Rita also hit the Gulf Coast, adding to recovery costs. Hurricane Rita, a category 3 storm, caused widespread property damage to the Gulf Coast with minimal deaths or injuries reported. Rainfalls of 5 to 15 inches were recorded in Louisiana, Mississippi, and eastern Texas. Hurricane Wilma made landfall in Florida as a category 3 hurricane, resulting in five deaths and significant property damage. In 2008, the Gulf Coast was hit by storms causing billions of dollars in damage. Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region in 2008. Gustav made landfall as a category 2 storm, causing flooding and tornadoes in Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. Ike made landfall near Galveston, Texas, with devastating storm surge and widespread damage in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, resulting in 20 fatalities. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region in 2008, resulting in 20 fatalities in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Additionally, Ike was responsible for 28 deaths and over $1 billion in property damage in the Ohio Valley. Funding data and assistance narratives for the Gulf Coast after the 2005 and 2008 hurricane seasons are provided in the following sections. Some data were excluded from Section I due to ambiguity or covering non-Gulf Coast disasters. Section II presents funding by federal agency, derived from various sources including agency websites and governmental reports. It includes funding information by federal entity and authorities authorizing the activities provided. The funding data provided in this report should be considered as an approximation, not definitive, due to the absence of comprehensive federal information on disaster assistance. Various fiscal years and sources were used to obtain the data on federal and nonfederal assistance. Many federal entities provide disaster relief aid through various programs, not specifically designated as \"disaster assistance\" programs. Data on federal and nonfederal assistance are not systematically collected, making funding information approximate. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, states outside the Gulf Coast received federal aid to handle the influx of residents. Appropriations language often designates funds to federal entities for a range of disasters without specifying amounts for each incident. Determining funding amounts for individual disasters is challenging without specific legislative text. Tracking funding at the agency level can be complex due to appropriations made to budget accounts. Transparency in reporting funding levels for disaster relief varies among federal entities. For example, FEMA is required to submit monthly status reports on the Disaster Relief Fund, used to fund recovery projects. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is FEMA's account for disaster assistance, used to fund recovery projects and future emergencies. Reports on the DRF must detail obligations, allocations, and expenditures for specific hurricanes. Other federal funding for disasters lacks state-by-state data. Appropriations may be subject to changes post-enactment, not always reflected in reports. Funding changes post-2013 may not be captured in updated versions. The funding information in this report should be interpreted as illustrative rather than definitive. Table 1 presents data on appropriations enacted after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike from FY2005 to FY2009. Funding for disaster relief is often appropriated for multiple incidents, so the table may include data on appropriations for non-Gulf Coast incidents. Some appropriations for a range of disasters were excluded to avoid inflating the amount of funding directed to the Gulf Coast for hurricane relief. At least 10 appropriations bills have been enacted since FY2005. Since FY2005, 10 appropriations bills have been enacted to address Gulf Coast hurricane relief, totaling roughly $121.7 billion in federal assistance. This includes emergency supplemental appropriations acts, a reconciliation act, and a continuing appropriations resolution. Various federal departments, agencies, and programs provided aid after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike. Regular appropriations not specifically designated for Gulf Coast assistance are not included in the total. After Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike, Gulf Coast states received approximately $121.7 billion in federal assistance through various programs. The aid was provided by different federal entities and is detailed in Section II, including obligations, allocations, and expenditures. The data may differ from emergency funds appropriated by Congress due to reallocations, deobligations, and funds from non-terminating accounts. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allocated over $1.0 billion for disaster relief following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. This funding included disaster payments to producers and land rehabilitation programs. An additional $112 million was paid in farm disaster benefits to Gulf States farmers. The USDA allocated funds for disaster relief after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, including payments to producers and land rehabilitation programs. The Farm Service Agency administers disaster payments and supports farmers, ranchers, and agricultural partners. Total budget authority for hurricane-related cleanup efforts was $39 million. Following the 2005 hurricanes, the USDA created new programs to provide producer benefits for various crops and livestock affected by natural disasters. These programs included the Hurricane Indemnity Program (HIP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Feed Indemnity Program (FIP), Aquaculture Grant Program (AGP), and Tree Indemnity Program (TIP). Total outlays for hurricane relief in the Gulf States amounted to $132 million under P.L. 109-234. In 2008, payments totaling $285 million were provided to qualifying producers in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas for natural disaster losses, including hurricane damage. These payments were authorized under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. FSA administered land rehabilitation disaster programs for 2005 hurricanes, with Congress providing $82 million for EFCRP and $84.7 million for ECP. Over $70 million was obligated for ECP, and unobligated funds were reprogrammed in 2009 for current disasters. In 2009, USDA announced $71 million in ECP funding for repairing farmland damaged by natural disasters, including hurricanes in 2008. Texas received the largest allocation ($11 million) for hurricane restoration efforts. The Food and Nutrition Service administers programs crucial in hurricane relief, such as SNAP and child nutrition programs. Disaster FSP benefits provided approximately $1 billion in support due to Hurricanes. Disaster FSP benefits provided around $1 billion in support for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, Gustav, and Ike. Assistance from FSP (now SNAP) and child nutrition programs did not require additional appropriations as benefits are considered entitlements. NRCS assists landowners with conserving natural resources and conducts post-disaster cleanup projects in collaboration with FEMA and other agencies. NRCS administers the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program to assist with postdisaster cleanup and restoration projects, including measures to prevent erosion and runoff. After the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes, NRCS also managed the disposal of animal carcasses. Approximately $300 million was allocated for disaster relief from these hurricanes as of November 29, 2012. State EWP data for these hurricanes is provided in Table 5. The Forest Service administers programs for protecting and managing natural resources in the National Forest System. The Forest Service provides financial and technical assistance through its State and Private Forestry program to nonfederal landowners for restoring forests damaged by disasters like hurricanes. Funding for these efforts is often integrated into ongoing programs and cannot always be distinguished from regular appropriations for protecting and managing forest lands. The Forest Service provides financial and technical assistance to nonfederal landowners for restoring forests after disasters like hurricanes. Funding for response and recovery efforts after natural disasters is categorized by the FS. Response tasks are coordinated during emergencies or disasters, with the FS spending millions on response efforts for hurricanes in various regions. The Forest Service provides financial and technical assistance to nonfederal landowners for restoring forests after disasters like hurricanes. Funding for recovery efforts after natural disasters is categorized by the FS, with various programs used to assist states following hurricanes. Funding amounts by state for hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 are provided. The Rural Housing Service also provides loan and grant assistance for housing. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) administers loan and grant programs for housing and community facilities. After hurricanes, RHS provided housing relief through payment moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, loan forgiveness, and rental assistance. Total budget authority for RHS programs for the 2005 hurricanes was $128 million. The Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 allocated $38 million for Rural Housing Service activities in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Rural Utilities Service provided assistance for rebuilding water and waste disposal systems in disaster areas, including grants and increased technical assistance. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) suspended preauthorized debit payments for water and waste disposal loan guarantees for six months with lender approval. The federal government can provide disaster relief to the fishing industry in cases of commercial fishery failure, which occurs due to fish population declines or disruptions. The Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act outline the authority and requirements for fishery disaster assistance, typically initiated by the governor of a state or fishing community. Since 2005, Congress has appropriated almost $260 million for hurricane disaster relief to the Gulf of Mexico fishing industry. Funding is distributed as grants to states or regional marine fisheries commissions by NOAA. Assistance includes support for fishermen, businesses, oyster bed and fishery habitat restoration, research, marketing, gear studies, and seafood testing. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was established to provide assistance to communities facing economic distress. Funding was allocated for hurricane disaster relief in the Gulf of Mexico fishing industry, including habitat restoration, research, and seafood testing. Additionally, funds were provided for NOAA to address damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) funds for disaster recovery in areas declared under the Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Funds can cover up to 100% of project costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a73149(c)(2). The EDA has the authority to increase the federal share of disaster recovery project costs to 100%. EAA grants are competitively awarded for public facilities, services, business development, and job creation. Regions applying for EAA disaster assistance must show a clear link to disaster recovery efforts. EAA grants can cover 100% of project costs if approved by the Secretary of Commerce. The EAA regulations require areas seeking assistance to have a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) in place to address economic distress and support job creation. EDA allocated $24.2 million for hurricane recovery in 2005, and Congress approved $400 million in EAA disaster funding for hurricanes in 2008. The EAA regulations require areas to have a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy in place for assistance. Congress approved $400 million in EAA disaster funding in 2008, with $63.8 million allocated to 33 recipients in five states. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans, builds, and maintains water resources facilities for flood and coastal emergencies. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers receives direct appropriations for water resources work related to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. Of the $15.6 billion appropriated, over $11.2 billion has been obligated for hurricane response efforts, including funding for military personnel accounts used for pay, allowances, and housing allowances for DOD personnel and National Guard members. The Operations and Maintenance (O&M) accounts fund training, operation costs, maintenance, supplies, and other expenses for hurricane response efforts by the National Guard in Alabama, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Data on other O&M funds by state were not available. For hurricane response efforts, $2.85 billion was appropriated, with $2.5 billion used for shipbuilding and repair costs, including infrastructure improvements at damaged shipyards. Budget details for procurement in Alabama, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi are provided in Table 10. The Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) accounts fund modernization efforts through research, technology development, and prototype creation. Hurricane response funds were used for equipment replacement and facility repairs. MILCON accounts support construction of military facilities. Family Housing Construction accounts cover housing construction costs, while Family Housing O&M accounts fund expenses like debt payment and insurance premiums. For hurricane response efforts, $1.4 billion was allocated for planning, design, and construction of military facilities damaged by hurricanes. $918 million was for military operations and training facilities, and $460 million for family housing construction. Budget authority for construction was allocated to specific states, with $1.2 billion for five states and $167 million for planning and design activities. The Defense Working Capital Fund, National Defense Sealift Fund, and commissary fund have been used for hurricane response efforts to rebuild damaged commissaries and cover transportation costs. The Defense Health Program funds medical care for Armed Forces members and their families, primarily used for displaced beneficiaries seeking care from private-sector providers. Following the Gulf Coast hurricanes, funding was provided through public laws to support elementary and secondary schools affected by Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. This included creating new programs and allocating funds for immediate aid and temporary impact aid for displaced students. Following the Gulf Coast hurricanes, Congress allocated funding to support elementary and secondary schools affected by the hurricanes. This included additional funding for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, Temporary Impact Aid for Displaced Students, Hurricane Educator Assistance program, and support for local educational agencies with increased enrollment of homeless students. Additional funding was also provided for the Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative to improve education in affected areas. The Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative received funding through P.L. 111-117 to enhance education in areas impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav. Two programs under this initiative were Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations and Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students, with $750 million allocated for the former. The latter program provided federal funding to schools enrolling displaced students from the hurricanes.

The program is no longer authorized, with additional funding provided in FY2009 and FY2010 for education-related disaster relief. In response to hurricanes in 2005 and 2008, Congress allocated funding to states including Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. The federal Head Start program provides early childhood development services to low-income children, promoting school readiness through educational, health, and other services. In December 2005, $90 million in supplemental Head Start funds were appropriated. In December 2005, Congress allocated $90 million in supplemental Head Start funds for serving displaced children and renovating facilities affected by Gulf Coast hurricanes. The Department of Health and Human Services awarded $74 million to Head Start programs in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, with $16 million reverting to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Social Services Block Grant provides states with flexible funds for various social services activities. In December 2005, Congress appropriated $550 million in supplemental SSBG funds for expenses related to Gulf Coast hurricanes. Funds were distributed based on FEMA registrants and poverty levels in each state. The appropriations expanded services to include health and mental health services. In September 2008, Congress allocated $600 million for major disaster expenses. In 2008, Congress allocated $600 million for major disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. ACF distributed funds based on FEMA registrants and state populations. The appropriation expanded services to include health and mental health services, as well as repair and construction of facilities. In 2008, Congress allocated $600 million for major disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with funds distributed based on FEMA registrants and state populations. The bulk of the $1.150 billion supplemental appropriations for the SSBG went to Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. States had not spent all their funds within the standard two-year period, leading Congress to extend the spending deadline for both supplements. Data from ACF shows that states had spent about $521 million (95%) of the 2005 $550 million supplemental and $522 million (87%) of the 2008 $600 million supplemental before the extended deadlines. States spent $522 million (87%) of the 2008 $600 million supplemental SSBG funds before the extended deadline of September 30, 2011. Most of the funds were used for various services, including education, counseling, and health-related services. The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for coordinating Emergency Support Function 8 under the National Response Framework. The Stafford Act authorizes reimbursements to HHS for emergency response activities, including deployment of medical assets, disease surveillance, food and water safety, and workforce assistance. The President can provide crisis counseling services in disaster-affected areas. CCP offers mental health services in declared disasters, jointly administered by FEMA, SAMHSA, and HHS. In response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress authorized up to $2.1 billion for full federal funding of state match under Medicaid and CHIP programs, uncompensated care, and healthcare access restoration in Gulf Coast states. Funding also aimed to stabilize primary care workforce in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Outlay amounts are detailed in Table 14. In response to the 2005 hurricanes, Congress allocated $4 million for communications equipment for community health centers and $8 million for mosquito abatement. Additional funding from existing HHS accounts was provided for hurricane relief, including $2 million for individual assistance in Texas and $12 million in grants to minority-serving organizations. SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants also provided funds for mental health and substance abuse services. Amounts for these grants are detailed in Table 15. The federal government funded health care costs post-Hurricane Katrina through various programs. HHS invoked waivers to ensure continued federal health care services for affected providers and facilities. These waivers allowed for temporary facilities, volunteer providers, and care for ineligible individuals, preventing the loss of federal revenues. States were also allowed to reprogram federal grant funds to aid disaster-affected areas. The Secretary of HHS can use a no-year fund for public health emergencies, but it has not had a balance since the 1990s. The Stafford Act allows the President to issue disaster declarations for incidents overwhelming state and local governments. FEMA's main mission is to reduce loss of life and property during disasters. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property during disasters by providing assistance through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) authorized under the Stafford Act. This includes aid programs such as the Public Assistance Program (PA) and the Individual and Household Program (IHP). FEMA Administrator is required to provide a monthly report on DRF funding summaries. The DRF report provides funding information by state for hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Mission assignments are directives from FEMA to other federal agencies for specific disaster operations. Funding for mission assignments is paid out of the DRF. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, allocates funds to states, Puerto Rico, and eligible communities for housing, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development activities. 70% of annual CDBG appropriations go to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% is allocated elsewhere. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program allocates funds to states, Puerto Rico, and eligible communities for housing, neighborhood revitalization, and economic development activities. 70% of funds go to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% is allocated to non-entitlement communities. Eligible activities must meet national objectives benefiting low or moderate-income persons, preventing slums or blight, or addressing health or welfare threats. States or entitlement communities must spend at least 70% of their CDBG allocation on eligible activities for low- and moderate-income persons over a three-year period. Using CDBG regular appropriation, Congress has allocated additional supplemental CDBG funds in response to presidentially declared disasters. HUD has the authority to waive or modify program regulations for disaster recovery activities. Funds cover unmet needs not addressed by other disaster programs. Grantees must submit required documentation for funding. In response to presidentially declared disasters, Congress allocated additional CDBG funds for disaster recovery activities. Grantees must submit a disaster recovery plan for HUD approval to receive funding. Six states received a total of $23.971 billion in CDBG disaster relief assistance for hurricane response, with Louisiana and Mississippi receiving the majority of the funds. Louisiana received 75% of the allocation for Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005, while Texas received 71% for Hurricane Ike recovery. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program provides rent subsidies for low-income families after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Congress allocated over $555 million to HUD for rental assistance, with $390 million for temporary vouchers for previously assisted families. HUD provided temporary rental assistance vouchers to families previously assisted by HUD programs and displaced by the 2005 hurricanes. The Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) was established by HUD, funded by FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, to assist all remaining households displaced by the hurricanes. Additionally, after Hurricane Ike, DHAP-Ike was created for families affected by that storm. Congress allocated $85 million for ongoing Section 8 rental assistance vouchers for displaced families, with an additional $80 million later appropriated for new vouchers. After Hurricane Ike, DHAP-Ike was created to assist affected families. Congress allocated $85 million for ongoing Section 8 rental assistance vouchers for displaced families, with an additional $80 million later appropriated for new vouchers in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The funding for rental assistance was allocated based on where displaced families were living, not by state allocations to local public housing authorities. The Louisiana Recovery Corporation's \"Road Home\" program received $73 million in emergency CDBG funding from Congress for permanent supportive housing units. $50 million was allocated for homeless assistance through the Shelter Plus Care program, and $23 million through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. Low-rent public housing, owned by local PHAs, particularly in New Orleans, was severely affected. After Hurricane Katrina, public housing developments in New Orleans suffered severe damage. Congress allocated $15 million for repairs to Louisiana's public housing through HUD's capital fund. An additional $7 million was designated for enhanced oversight by the HUD Inspector General. The Department of Justice represents the federal government in legal matters and provides counsel in federal cases. The Department of Justice received $287.5 million in supplemental appropriations for hurricane-related expenses and grants to Gulf Coast states. Funding breakdown among Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas is provided. The Violence Against Women Act authorized appropriations for General Legal Activities and U.S. Attorneys accounts for FY2006-2009. The Legal Activities account received funding for FY2006-2009, including subaccounts for General Legal Activities and U.S. Attorneys.

The USMS, established in 1789, provides protection for the federal judicial process, including judges, attorneys, witnesses, and jurors. It is the primary agency for fugitive investigations and operates task forces with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The United States Marshals Service (USMS) collaborates with federal, state, and international law enforcement agencies to locate and apprehend fugitives. They execute federal arrest warrants, manage and sell assets seized from federal crimes, and transport federal detainees through the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS). The US Marshals Service is responsible for administering the federal witness security program and has received appropriations for operational recovery from hurricane-related damage. The FBI, founded in 1908, has a headquarters in Washington, DC, 56 field offices in major US cities, and 380 resident agencies nationwide. It also has over 60 international offices. The FBI is the primary federal investigative agency for defending against foreign threats, enforcing federal laws, and providing leadership to law enforcement agencies. It focuses on protecting the US from internal and external threats. The FBI's priorities include protecting the US from terrorist attacks, foreign intelligence operations, cyber-based attacks, and high-technology crimes. They also combat public corruption, protect civil rights, investigate criminal organizations, white-collar crime, and violent crime. The FBI collects national crime data and operates law enforcement information sharing systems like CODIS and N-Dex. The FBI has received $45 million in supplemental appropriations for various programs such as N-Dex, NGI, NICS, and NCIC. Congress provided this funding for operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region. Additionally, the DEA was authorized $1.716 billion for FY2006 to FY2009 under the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005.

Subtitle A of Title XI of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-162) authorized funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) account for FY2006 to FY2009. The ATF enforces federal criminal law related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. The ATF, part of the Department of Justice, investigates and reduces crime involving firearms, explosives, arson, bombings, and illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. Congress has appropriated $20 million in supplemental appropriations for the ATF since 2005. Additionally, $20 million was provided for the ATF's salaries and expenses account to support operational recovery from hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region. The Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 authorized funding for the Federal Prison System account, with the Bureau of Prisons established in 1930 to house federal inmates. The BOP's mission is to protect society by confining offenders in safe and secure facilities, providing work and self-improvement opportunities. Congress has also provided supplemental appropriations for the BOP since 2005. The Department of Defense provided $11 million for the BOP's buildings and facilities account to repair hurricane-related damage in the Gulf Coast region. Congress allocated funding for OJP's State and Local Law Enforcement assistance account to award to states affected by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. The OJP received funding from Congress for the Byrne Discretionary Grant program, which was later eliminated in FY2011 due to an earmark ban. The OJP manages the National Institute of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) oversees various agencies such as the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), and Office of Victims of Crime (OVC).

Congress mandated OJP to distribute $50 million from the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 based on each state's 2005 violent crime levels. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) oversees federal job training programs and grants for workforce development. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) authorizes various job training initiatives administered by ETA. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) oversees federal job training programs and grants for workforce development, including Job Corps and other national programs. ETA provides funding assistance for disaster relief activities through the Dislocated Worker program, specifically National Dislocated Worker Grants (DWG) for workers affected by economic dislocations. DWGs are awarded to states and local Workforce Development Boards to provide employment and training assistance to eligible individuals. The Dislocated Worker program, funded by the Department of Labor, provides job search assistance, training, and direct employment for individuals affected by economic dislocations. The majority of funding is allocated to states for training and services, with the remainder reserved for a National Reserve account. The Pandemic Influenza Act of 2006 allocated $125 million in appropriations to ETA for National Emergency Grants related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005. States like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas received a total of $148.6 million in funding, exceeding the initial appropriation. ETA does not differentiate awards by funding source in the projects. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2006 provided $16 million in appropriations to ETA for Hurricane Katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season. The funds were designated for the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of Job Corps centers. Job Corps is a residential job training program for low-income individuals aged 16 to 24, offering educational and career services. The Job Corps program aims to help individuals obtain a high school diploma or GED, along with career technical training. Job Corps centers operate nationwide, with funding used for repairing centers damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The Department of Transportation plays a key role in coordinating transportation support during natural disasters. The Department of Transportation (DOT) had a role in providing transportation support during natural disasters, including evacuation aid and shipping critical supplies. However, during hurricanes Gustav and Ike, DOT transferred these responsibilities to FEMA. DOT's response included the Federal Highway Administration Emergency Relief Program (ER) and assistance from other administrations like the Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Transit Administration. Funding for DOT's Gulf Coast hurricane response could be considered either DOT or FEMA funding. Total allocations to Gulf of Mexico states are detailed in Table 24. The Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program (ER) provides funds for repairing roads damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. ER funding allocations for hurricanes totaled almost $3.2 billion, with over $2.8 billion obligated. Funding for hurricane relief includes funds from various sources. The Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program (ER) provides funds for repairing roads damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Funding for hurricane relief includes funds from the program's annual $100 million authorization and additional sums from supplemental appropriations acts. ER funds can only be used for roads and bridges on the federal-aid highway system. FEMA may reimburse repair and reconstruction costs for other damaged roads. FAA has approved $110.5 million for repair and improvements to hurricane-damaged airport and air traffic control infrastructure, with funds appropriated under the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act of 2006. The U.S. Troop Readiness Veterans' Care Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 allocated $35 million for transit relief to Gulf Coast states. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs providing benefits to veterans, including medical care through the Veterans Health Administration. Hurricane Katrina caused damage to the VA Medical Center in New Orleans. The VA Medical Center in New Orleans was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Additional funds were appropriated for hurricane-related expenses, including $198.3 million for medical services and $26.9 million for general operating expenses. $367.5 million was allocated for major construction, with $292.5 million for a new facility in Biloxi, MS, and $75 million for planning and design of a new VA Medical Center in New Orleans. The total amount for the Biloxi VA Medical Center was $310 million, with $17.5 million from regular appropriations. The VA Medical Center in New Orleans received additional funds for hurricane-related expenses, including $198.3 million for medical services and $26.9 million for general operating expenses. $367.5 million was allocated for major construction, with $292.5 million for a new facility in Biloxi, MS, and $75 million for planning and design of a new VA Medical Center in New Orleans. $585.9 million was appropriated for major construction by the VA, with $550 million for replacing the New Orleans Medical Center. In FY2015 $39.5 million and in FY2016 $50 million were respectively reprogrammed from the working reserve for the New Orleans Medical Center. The total estimated cost of replacing the VA Medical Center in New Orleans is approximately $1.09 billion. The new VA Medical Center in New Orleans, with a total estimated cost of $1.09 billion, was officially opened on November 18, 2016. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports facilities in Washington, DC, and Gulfport, MS, providing housing and medical care for around 1,600 needy veterans. The Gulfport, MS facility of the Armed Forces Retirement Home was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Funding was allocated for planning, design, and construction of a new facility in Gulfport. Residents were transferred to the Washington, DC facility after the storm. Additional funds were provided for construction and renovation at both facilities. The National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) received $10 million in Emergency Supplemental Funds from P.L. 109-234 to support program operations in the Gulf Region, including staff payroll, member travel, and equipment costs. $1.3 million went to the National Service Trust for educational awards, while $8.7 million supported program activities. The National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) received $10 million in Emergency Supplemental Funds from P.L. 109-234 to support program operations in the Gulf Region. $8.7 million was used to support program operations and combined with the program's FY2007 appropriation to direct members to the Gulf Region for recovery efforts. This funding enabled 1,063 members to serve 810,000 hours on 341 relief and recovery projects in partnership with various organizations and universities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works on implementing federal statutes regulating air and water quality, managing hazardous wastes, and cleaning up environmental contamination. FEMA may call on EPA for assistance in response to hazardous materials releases during disasters. EPA collaborates with various organizations and universities in the Gulf Region for relief and recovery projects. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) is governed by federal laws such as the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). These laws authorize federal emergency response to oil spills and hazardous substance releases, establish liability and compensation frameworks, and provide a plan for response to environmental disasters. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) authorizes federal emergency response to hazardous substance releases. The President's response authorities are delegated to the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard. EPA also has emergency response roles for water infrastructure protection and statutory powers under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA plays a crucial role in disaster response, particularly in inland and coastal incidents. They lead federal agency efforts to address threats to human health and the environment, focusing on drinking water and wastewater facilities, and post-disaster cleanup. They also provide support to other federal agencies and state/local governments in various response roles. The EPA supports disaster response efforts by waiving environmental requirements for motor vehicle fuel under the Clean Air Act. This includes activities such as retrieving and disposing of orphan oil tanks, collecting hazardous waste, and managing liquid waste. The Army Corps of Engineers also plays a role in disaster debris removal and cleanup of water infrastructure facilities. The EPA and Corps of Engineers assisted in assessing damages and restoring services after hurricanes by cleaning engines, testing electrical systems, checking for toxic chemicals, restoring water pressure, activating disinfection units, and managing contaminated debris. EPA also helped with nonhazardous debris management. EPA was eligible for FEMA reimbursement for costs incurred during the response efforts. During response efforts to hurricanes, EPA received funding primarily through FEMA mission assignments and interagency agreements. A total of $505 million was received, with $497 million expended. Additionally, $21 million was received through emergency supplemental appropriations for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program. The EPA received $15 million in additional funding from P.L. 109-234 for assessing and containing underground storage tanks in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The funding was allocated to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi for environmental monitoring and assessment, with no allocation to Florida or Texas. The distribution of funds was determined jointly by EPA and the affected states. The EPA received $15 million in additional funding from P.L. 109-234 for assessing and containing underground storage tanks in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The funding was allocated to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi for environmental monitoring and assessment. The majority of the $6 million emergency appropriations provided within the EPA Environmental Programs and Management appropriations account was used for disaster support in Louisiana and Mississippi, with some funding also allocated to Alabama and Florida. EPA provided $1.4 million of the supplemental funding to its Office of Research and Development and Office of Air and Radiation for continued disaster and emergency response support. No funding allocation was reported for Texas. The EPA received additional funding for disaster response support after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This funding was used for air monitoring and analysis in affected states, as well as grants for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Public utilities are eligible for assistance following a presidentially declared emergency. Following a presidentially declared emergency, public drinking water and wastewater utilities are eligible for FEMA grant assistance to repair damaged facilities. States must provide 20% matching funds to receive federal funds, which are used to issue low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects. EPA allocates annual appropriations for capitalization grants based on needs surveys. The cumulative total allotment to the Gulf States from Clean Water SRF and Drinking Water SRF annual appropriations was $1.20 billion and $1.16 billion respectively. The portion of these funds used for hurricane-affected infrastructure projects is unknown. Congress appropriated $18 million in emergency judiciary funding for disaster relief after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The emergency judiciary funding of $18 million was allocated to reimburse per diem, travel expenses, furniture, equipment, and security in temporary locations for judges, court staff, and federal public defenders affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Florida. Additionally, the Small Business Administration's Disaster Assistance Program provides low-interest loans for disaster recovery. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides three categories of loans for disaster recovery: home loans, business loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs). Home loans help homeowners and renters repair or replace disaster-related damages, with limits of $200,000 for real estate and $40,000 for personal property. Business loans assist business owners with property repairs or replacements, with a limit of $2 million. EIDLs offer assistance to small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations that have suffered economic injury from a disaster. Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) provide assistance to small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations affected by disasters, with a limit of $2 million. The number of approved disaster loan applications and the amount of approved loans by state are listed in tables. P.L. 110-28 provided cost-share reductions for disaster assistance in Gulf Coast states affected by hurricanes. P.L. 110-28 granted waivers for state and local cost-shares for disaster assistance programs under the Stafford Act, including Essential Assistance, Repair, Restoration, Debris Removal, and Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households. The waiver also applied to the Other Needs Assistance Program under Section 408, which had never been waived before. The Federal share was set at 75%, with the possibility of a 90% federal, 10% state and local ratio under specified circumstances. The Federal share of assistance for Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita under the Stafford Act is 100% for Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Texas. This applies to disaster assistance requested before the enactment of the Act, with limitations on projects requiring a \"request for public assistance form.\" The cost-share waivers were provided for five states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama had already qualified for a decreased state cost-share through FEMA's formula. Congress included Florida and Texas to avoid separating related damages. Waivers were granted in recognition of the help provided by Florida and Texas to Mississippi and Louisiana. The \"Limitation\" in the legislation ensured that projects receiving the waiver had already submitted a \"request for public assistance form.\" The legislation provided cost-share waivers for projects identified prior to enactment, ensuring they were related to the event. Requests for public assistance submitted before the bill's enactment had no cost-share, while those submitted after had a 90% federal, 10% state and local cost-share. This aimed to give more generous cost-share to pre-selected projects rather than new ones. Congress has adjusted state cost-shares in the past for FEMA programs. The federal government provides significant assistance for disasters through various programs, including cost-share adjustments and supplemental appropriations. This report focuses on the assistance provided for the 2005 and 2008 Gulf Coast hurricanes, but the government also offers yearly disaster aid through regular and supplemental appropriations. Congress has provided approximately $42 billion in annual appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund from FY2007 to FY2016. There has been an increase in the number of major disaster declarations in recent years, with an average of 35.8 per year from 1953 to 2016, 45.8 per year in the 1990s, 57.1 per year from 2000 to 2009, and 58.7 per year from 2010 to 2016. This trend suggests that expenditures on disaster assistance may continue to rise. The report highlights the need for further research on federal disaster assistance, especially for disasters in other regions of the United States. More accurate data on the amounts and types of assistance provided by the federal government would better inform congressional oversight and debates on disaster relief. Potential policy methods to address funding gaps include requiring regular disaster assistance reports from federal entities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should compile regular reports detailing federal spending for emergencies and disasters, with standardized expenditure data across agencies. Reports should include state-specific and disaster-specific information to target mitigation projects. Federal agencies should flag funds used for disaster relief taken from regular budgets, and reports should contain cost share and detailed state expenditure information. Improved data reporting is necessary to address concerns about the increasing number of declarations and associated costs. The potential debate on limiting the number of disaster declarations and assistance provided is framed by concerns over costs and the rise in disasters. Proponents argue that the increase in assistance is justified due to factors like inclement weather and population growth. Providing aid to disaster-affected areas is seen as essential, but there are calls for improved data reporting and policy measures to address the issue. Some argue that limiting the number of disaster declarations and federal assistance is necessary to control costs and address the rise in disasters. Policy mechanisms such as redefining major disasters in the Stafford Act or changing the per capita formula for assistance eligibility are suggested to decrease the number of declarations issued. The Stafford Act has broadened presidential declaration authority due to the vague definition of a major disaster. One suggestion to reduce the number of declarations is to increase the per capita amount used by FEMA for recommendations. The current per capita amount is $1.43, which could be raised to limit the incidents eligible for federal assistance. The DHS Inspector General recommended increasing the per capita amount used by FEMA to reduce the number of incidents eligible for federal assistance. Adjusting the per capita amount annually for inflation was also suggested. FEMA had been using a $1 per capita damage amount since 1986, and only started adjusting for inflation in 1999. If inflation adjustments had been made from 1986 to 1999, 36% fewer disasters would have qualified for a presidential declaration. In 1999, FEMA began publicly announcing factors considered for disaster declarations, including the per capita amount. This information was previously kept within the executive branch. FEMA could have gradually increased the per capita amount, but this process did not start until more than a dozen years later. Congressional discussions led to the inclusion of a new Section 320 in the Stafford Act. The Government Accountability Office recommended FEMA to develop more specific criteria for disaster declaration and consider using a state's Total Taxable Resources as a measure of funding capacity. The Total Taxable Resources (TTR) provides a more comprehensive measure of state funding capacity, including business income, undistributed corporate profits, and payments to out-of-state stock owners. It is used to target federal aid and adjust disaster declaration thresholds for a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to respond to disasters. The GAO stated that TTR could be used alongside other criteria for disaster declaration, potentially improving accuracy and reducing federal costs. Some suggest using an expert panel to review gubernatorial requests for disaster declarations, comprised of individuals with specialized knowledge in relevant areas. The use of an expert panel to review gubernatorial requests for disaster declarations could potentially improve accuracy and reduce federal costs. Some argue that this method may slow down the declaration process and infringe on the President's authority, while others believe it could provide more objective decision-making. Creating incentives to dissuade states from requesting assistance is another potential method to reduce the number of declarations and costs of federal disaster assistance. One method to reduce federal disaster assistance costs is to convert some or all assistance into low-interest recovery loans, providing states with the option to handle incidents without federal aid. Potential changes to the Stafford Act, such as repealing Section 320, could limit the number of declarations issued each year and establish thresholds for state qualification. Section 404 of the Stafford Act allows the President to contribute up to 75% of mitigation costs to reduce future damage. Amending this section could tie mitigation assistance to state codes, with compliant states eligible for 75% federal cost share and non-compliant states eligible for 50%. This change could incentivize state mitigation efforts and potentially reduce the need for federal assistance. The amendment could take effect in three years, giving states time to comply. Other amendments could limit the number of disaster declarations issued each year. Amendments to the Stafford Act could potentially limit the number of declarations issued or the amount of federal assistance provided to states. Changes could include requiring congressional approval for cost-share adjustments, making federal assistance contingent on state-level programs, and discontinuing snow removal assistance without congressional direction. These amendments could take effect immediately or in three years, allowing states time to comply. The amendment to the Stafford Act could potentially limit federal assistance to states, with discussions on reducing state cost-shares in disaster programs. Currently, state and local governments cover 25% of disaster costs, with no limit on the number of people helped or federal funds expended on repairs. The federal government currently covers 75% of disaster costs with no limit on the amount of funds expended. There are discussions on potentially increasing the state share above 25% or converting some assistance to loans for disaster recovery. The federal government covers 75% of disaster costs with discussions on increasing the state share or providing loans for recovery. Congress debates the federal role in disaster relief, questioning the level of assistance and funding distribution. The efficiency of financial assistance provided for Gulf Coast storms is questioned, along with the allocation process to federal entities. Concerns about fraud, abuse, and duplication of services in disaster relief efforts are raised. The assistance was partly funded through supplemental appropriations, prompting discussions on the best approach for future funding distribution. The report discusses the efficiency of financial assistance for Gulf Coast storms and the allocation process to federal entities. Authors contributed sections on whether to use multiple supplemental appropriations or a single one for funding."
