The Congress acknowledges the groundbreaking achievements of the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII (WASP), who were the first women to fly American military aircraft and played a crucial role in defending America's freedom. Despite facing cultural and gender bias, the WASP paved the way for the integration of women pilots into the Armed Services. During WWII, General Hap Arnold approved a women's pilot training program to address the shortage of male combat pilots. In August 1943, women aviators were officially named \"WASP\" (Women Airforce Service Pilots), with over 25,000 American women applying for training. During WWII, more than 25,000 American women applied for training as part of the women's pilot program. Only 1,830 were accepted and 1,074 successfully completed the 21 to 27 weeks of Army Air Force flight training. The first class of 29 women pilots reported to Houston, Texas Municipal Airport on November 16, 1942, before moving to Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas due to facility limitations. Eventually, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) were stationed at 120 Army air bases across America, flying over 60,000,000 miles for their country. During WWII, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) flew over 60,000,000 miles for their country in various aircraft and assignments, excluding combat. Their tasks included test piloting, instructor piloting, towing targets, ferrying personnel and cargo, and flying drones. In October 1943, 25 WASP were trained to fly the B-26 Martin Marauder to prove its safety to male pilots. During the existence of the WASP, 38 women lost their lives serving their country, their bodies sent home in poorly crafted pine boxes. Burial was at the expense of their families or classmates, no gold stars allowed in their parents' windows, and no American flags on their coffins. In 1944, General Arnold's request to militarize the WASP was denied. In a speech to the last graduating class in 1944, General Arnold praised their abilities to fly alongside male pilots. The Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) were disbanded in 1944 without honors or benefits. Their military records were sealed and classified, only declassified in the 1980s, making their contributions to WWII largely unknown to historians and scholars. In 1977, 33 years after the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) were disbanded, Congress granted them veteran status. However, they were not invited to the signing ceremony at the White House, and it took 7 more years for their medals to be delivered. In the late 1970s, women were finally allowed to attend military pilot training in the US Armed Forces. Thousands of women aviators flew support aircraft. In 1993, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) were referenced during congressional hearings, leading to women being able to fly military fighter, bomber, and attack aircraft in combat. United States servicewomen combat pilots have flown fighter aircraft in recent conflicts due to the pioneering steps taken by the WASP. The WASP have a close-knit community and have assisted in educating America on their history through \"Wings Across America\". The Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) have been honored with exhibits at various museums across the United States, including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, the Women in Military Service to America Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, and the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Ohio. They have also been recognized at the National WASP WWII Museum in Texas, the 8th Air Force Museum in Georgia, and the Lone Star Flight Museum in Texas. The Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas; the American Airpower Museum in Farmingdale, New York; the Pima Air Museum in Tucson, Arizona; the Seattle Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington; the March Air Museum in March Reserve Air Base, California; and the Texas State History Museum in Austin, Texas are some of the museums that honor the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). The Congressional Gold Medal is mentioned in Section 2. The President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the award of a single gold medal to honor the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) for their pioneering military service. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the gold medal, and it will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution after the award ceremony. The gold medal honoring the Women Airforce Service Pilots will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress recommends that the medal be displayed at other locations associated with the WASP as well. SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\nThe Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal at a price covering costs.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\nMedals struck under this Act are considered national medals.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\nAn amount not exceeding $30,000 is authorized for the medal cost. Proceeds from bronze medal sales will go to the Mint Public Enterprise Fund."
