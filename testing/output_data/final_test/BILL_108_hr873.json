    "content": "The Act titled \"Eating Disorders Awareness, Prevention, and Education Act of 2003\" is established. Congress finds that 5-10 million women and girls, along with 1 million men and boys, suffer from various eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss, with serious health consequences such as heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and a high mortality rate. Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by excessive food consumption followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors like self-induced vomiting, laxative misuse, fasting, or excessive exercise. It affects 1.1 to 4.2 percent of American women and is linked to cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental issues. Binge Eating Disorder involves frequent episodes of uncontrolled overeating and affects 2 to 5 percent of Americans in a 6-month period. Eating disorders are prevalent among Americans, with associated health risks like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. These disorders often start in adolescence and are linked to psychological issues such as depression and substance abuse. A significant percentage of young girls desire to be thinner, and fear of being fat is common among children. Progression from dieting to eating disorders is not uncommon, with potentially fatal consequences. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, can lead to death from starvation or medical complications. These disorders can hinder a student's education and are more common in females. Prevention efforts are crucial for students' health and academic success. The Act aims to improve awareness, identification, and support for students with eating disorders to ensure they receive a quality education and have a bright future. It also focuses on innovative assistance for the identification, training, and educational awareness of eating disorders. Section 5131(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include programs for improving the identification of students with eating disorders, increasing awareness among parents and students, and training educators on prevention and assistance methods. The Secretary of Education will collaborate with Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health to develop public service announcements for raising awareness and preventing eating disorders. The National Center for Education Statistics and the National Center for Health Statistics will conduct a study on the impact of eating disorders on educational advancement. The study will determine the prevalence of eating disorders among students, evaluate their effects on school attendance and cognitive skills, review existing educational programs on eating disorders, and make recommendations for actions by Congress and the Department of Education. The study will assess the prevalence of eating disorders among students, their impact on education, and review existing prevention programs."
