Congress finds that the Medicare program has a history of supporting residency training in ambulatory sites, such as physician offices, nursing homes, and community health centers. Training in these settings is crucial for residents' medical education, especially for those in primary care specialties. Starting in 1987, hospitals were allowed to count time spent in non-hospital settings for resident physicians. In 1989, HCFA defined \"all or substantially all\" of costs as resident salaries and benefits. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included payments for IME costs if hospitals paid residents' stipends and benefits. Effective January 1, 1999, CMS reinforced ambulatory training for resident physicians. On January 1, 1999, CMS changed its definition of \"all or substantially all\" to include teaching physicians' salaries for graduate medical education. Despite recognizing volunteer supervisory physicians, CMS intermediaries are now denying time spent by residents in non-hospital settings, reducing payments for training in those settings.
