    "content": "The Act titled \"Zero Chlorine Discharge Act\" aims to eliminate the discharge of toxic persistent and bioaccumulative substances. Congress finds that substances that persist or bioaccumulate in the environment can reach high concentrations in the tissues of species, including humans, causing various harmful effects such as reproductive failure, birth defects, developmental impairment, hormonal disruption, behavioral disorders, immune suppression, and cancer even at low doses. Regulatory approaches allowing limited production and discharge of these toxic substances can have detrimental effects. Persistent and bioaccumulative toxic substances can accumulate in the environment and food chain, causing harm to humans and other species. The most effective method to prevent further contamination is to phase out the production and use of these substances, replacing them with safer alternatives. Organochlorines from pulp and paper production, particularly those discharged from the use of chlorine, are of significant concern. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement addresses these issues. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement aims to prohibit the discharge of toxic substances and virtually eliminate persistent toxic substances. The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality supports the concept of virtual elimination and zero discharge to achieve this goal. Zero discharge of organochlorine compounds and byproducts is emphasized. Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include zero discharge of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, and metabolites. Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include zero discharge of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, and metabolites. SEC. 321 addresses the discharge of these substances. Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include zero discharge of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, and metabolites from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities. Effective 5 years after enactment, facilities must achieve zero discharge into navigable waters of these compounds resulting from chlorine or chlorinated oxidizing agents use in the manufacturing process. Permits issued under section 402 must comply with this requirement. The amendment to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates zero discharge of organochlorine compounds from pulp and paper manufacturing facilities using chlorine. Permits issued before or after enactment must comply. The Administrator will evaluate alternatives to organochlorines and publish a report on transitioning to chlorine-free technology in the industry. The Administrator will provide technical support for using alternatives to organochlorine compounds in pulp and paper production. A report on nonpoint sources and industrial discharges of organochlorine compounds will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The report on nonpoint sources and industrial discharges of organochlorine compounds must be submitted to Congress within 18 months, containing listings of types of sources, quantities discharged nationally, and recommendations for achieving zero discharge. The Administrator will convene an advisory panel consisting of 15 members to develop recommendations for achieving a zero discharge policy for organochlorine pollution sources. Panel members will include experts in public health, occupational health, technology change, toxics use reduction, and ecology, as well as affected citizens, and technical and policy experts from industry, labor, and public interest groups. The advisory panel will conduct public hearings and gather public and expert comments to assist the Administrator in implementing a zero discharge policy for organochlorine pollution sources. Zero discharge is defined as no output or release, including nonpoint source output, into water."
