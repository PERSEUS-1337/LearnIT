The General Services Administration's 2006 feasibility report did not analyze the feasibility of locating a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center at the current Court location. Congress believes the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims should have suitable office space without causing disruption or cost to other Federal entities. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the feasibility of leasing additional space for the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and using the entire building as a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center.

The Administrator of General Services must submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the feasibility of relocating Federal tenants to office space that offers similar or preferable cost, convenience, and usable square footage.

Federal tenants will have an opportunity to comment on the report before it is submitted. Before submitting the report to congressional committees, the Administrator must allow Federal tenants to comment on a draft of the report."
