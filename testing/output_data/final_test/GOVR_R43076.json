    "content": "The 2014 farm bill, known as The Agricultural Act of 2014, established agricultural and food policy for the next five years. It covers various areas such as farm commodity support, crop insurance, conservation, food assistance, trade, rural development, research, and bioenergy. This bill provides an opportunity for Congress, the Administration, and interest groups to reexamine and address agriculture and food issues comprehensively. The 2014 farm bill reshaped farm commodity support, expanded crop insurance coverage, consolidated conservation programs, reauthorized nutrition assistance, and extended USDA discretionary program funding through FY2018. Provisions from the previous farm bill expired in 2012 but were extended for a year. The 112th Congress started work on a new bill but didn't finish, leading to new bills in the 113th Congress. House and Senate Agriculture Committees marked up bills in May 2013, with a conference agreement reached in January 2014 and signed into law. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79) was approved by both chambers in January 2014 and signed into law on February 7, 2014. The Senate Agriculture Committee reported its version of the 2013 omnibus farm bill in May 2013, with floor action concluding on June 10, 2013. Various amendments were adopted and rejected during the Senate debate, with attempts to modify the sugar program, limit SNAP spending, eliminate crop insurance subsidies for tobacco, and require labeling of genetically engineered foods all being defeated. The House Agriculture Committee completed markup of H.R. 1947, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, and approved the revised measure. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further revisions. Floor action on the House bill took place in June 2013, with numerous amendments adopted, but the amended bill was defeated. A revised bill, H.R. 2642, was approved by the House in July 2013. The House passed H.R. 2642 by a 216-208 vote on July 11, which was later substituted with S. 954 by the Senate. H.R. 3102 was passed on September 19, and a resolution combined the texts of H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3102 into one bill for reconciliation with the Senate. The Agricultural Act of 2014 was approved by both chambers and signed into law on February 7, 2014. The report provides an overview of the budgetary impact and major provisions of the 2014 farm bill, comparing it to previous legislation. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) revised the budgetary impact of the prior farm bill, reducing projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion over 10 years. This is less than the House-passed or Senate-passed proposals, which would have saved more. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) reduced spending by $16.6 billion over 10 years. The House and Senate proposals could have saved more, but sequestration had already been factored into the baseline. Some titles received more funding while others provided offsets for deficit reduction. Farm commodity subsidies, nutrition, and conservation titles contributed to budgetary savings, while crop insurance, research, bioenergy, and other areas received additional funding. The 2014 farm bill reduced spending by $16.6 billion over 10 years. The final bill is projected to spend $956 billion over the next decade, with $756 billion for nutrition assistance and $200 billion for agriculture. Crop insurance, conservation, and farm commodity programs are allocated $90 billion, $58 billion, and $44 billion respectively. Other areas like trade, horticulture, research, and bioenergy also receive funding. Figure 1 illustrates the budgetary impacts of changes to each title in the bill. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) restructured farm support by eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. Direct payments, based on historical production, were discontinued due to lack of political support. $47 billion in savings from eliminating current programs was used to revise farm programs, add permanent disaster assistance, and enhance crop insurance. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) restructured farm support by eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. It provides farm programs for covered crops, excluding cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy. The bill continues authority for marketing assistance loans and suspends permanent price support authority until 2018. It borrows from 2008 farm bill programs while enhancing price or revenue protection for producers. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) restructured farm support by eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. It provides farm programs for covered crops, excluding cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy. The bill continues authority for marketing assistance loans and suspends permanent price support authority until 2018. Producers may choose between two programs linked to a decline in price or revenue, including the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program with higher reference prices for better protection in market downturns. The Senate farm bill proposed lower fixed reference prices for rice and peanuts, and significantly lower levels for other crops based on a market-based reference price calculation.

It provides farm programs for covered crops, excluding cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy. The bill continues authority for marketing assistance loans and suspends permanent price support authority until 2018. Producers may choose between two programs linked to a decline in price or revenue, including the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program with higher reference prices for better protection in market downturns. The House bill proposed payments based on 85% of planted acreage to align with producer risk, but critics feared production distortions and trade disputes. The bill retains the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program, which covers a portion of a farmer's out-of-pocket loss when crop revenues decline. ARC payments are made on 85% of base acres, triggering when crop revenue drops below 86%. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) restructured farm support by eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. It provides farm programs for covered crops, excluding cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy. Farmers can select coverage at either the county or individual farm level. The bill also establishes five disaster programs for weather-induced losses and retroactively reauthorizes four programs covering livestock and tree assistance. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) restructured farm support by eliminating direct payments, the CCP program, and the ACRE program. It provides farm programs for covered crops, excluding cotton, which has a new crop insurance policy. The crop disaster program from the 2008 farm bill was not reauthorized, but elements of it are folded into the new ARC by allowing producers to protect against farm-level revenue losses. Additional coverage levels are authorized under the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program (NAP), and farm commodity programs have payment caps and eligibility requirements based on adjusted gross income. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) sets payment caps for farm income at $750,000 and nonfarm income at $500,000 per person. It also establishes a $125,000 limit for PLC, ARC, marketing loan gains, and loan deficiency payments. The bill applies the $125,000 limit to all covered commodities except peanuts, with a separate limit for peanuts. Additionally, the bill instructs USDA to define \"significant contribution of active personal management\" for eligibility. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) changes the AGI limit to $900,000, eliminates the dairy product price support program, MILC program, and export subsidies, and introduces a new dairy program for payments based on national margin. The bill does not cap total farm program spending and differs from the Senate and House bills in terms of actively personal management requirements. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) introduces a new dairy program for payments based on national margin, with premiums charged for coverage at higher margins. The final law removes a provision for a separate program to reduce milk production incentives when margins are low. Additionally, USDA must adhere to standard rulemaking procedures and assess market impacts during the rulemaking process. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) introduces a new dairy program based on national margin with premiums for higher coverage. Federal milk marketing orders remain unchanged. The bill includes provisions for alternative milk pricing formulas and analysis of end-product pricing effects. The sugar program remains unchanged. The Conservation title reduces and consolidates conservation programs, cutting funding by nearly $4 billion over 10 years. The 2014 farm bill reduces funding for conservation programs by close to $4 billion over 10 years. Larger programs like CRP, EQIP, and CSP are reauthorized, with CRP's acreage enrollment cap decreasing from 32 million acres to 24 million by FY2018. CRP now includes grassland acres, similar to the repealed GRP. EQIP is reauthorized with a 5% funding carve-out for wildlife habitat practices. The 2014 farm bill reduces funding for conservation programs by close to $4 billion over 10 years. EQIP funding is reduced by almost $500 million over 10 years, with a 5% carve-out for wildlife habitat practices. CSP is reauthorized at a reduced enrollment level of 10 million acres annually. P.L. 113-79 creates two new conservation programs - ACEP and RCPP, consolidating existing programs like WRP, FPP, and GRP into ACEP. The new farm bill establishes two types of easements: wetland reserve easements and agricultural land easements to protect and restore wetlands and prevent non-agricultural uses on productive farm or grasslands. Several existing programs are repealed and consolidated into the new RCPP, which will leverage federal funding through partnership agreements for regional conservation efforts. The Senate-passed bill includes the federally funded portion of crop insurance premiums as a potential program benefit that producers could lose. The 2014 farm bill includes conservation compliance requirements for producers on highly erodible land or wetlands, impacting crop insurance premiums. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes international food aid programs and amends current food aid laws. The 2014 farm bill reauthorizes international food aid programs and amends current food aid laws to increase funding allocation to eligible organizations, allow for more flexibility in fund usage, improve food aid quality, and prevent disruption of local markets. Annual reports to Congress are required to track fund allocation and usage by eligible organizations. The 2014 farm bill repeals specified dollar amounts for nonemergency food aid and allocates 20-30% of funds for nonemergency food aid programs, with a minimum of $350 million annually. It also establishes a new local and regional purchase program, increases funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation Export Credit Guarantee program, and raises authorized appropriations for local and regional procurement to $80 million annually for FY2014 through FY2018. The 2014 farm bill increases funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation Export Credit Guarantee program to address differences with Brazil over compliance with the WTO cotton case. The final law grants flexibility to the Secretary of Agriculture to make changes to the program. Additionally, it reauthorizes funding for the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program through FY2018.

The bill requires the reorganization of USDA's international trade functions, including the establishment of an Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. The 2014 farm bill reauthorizes SNAP and related programs for five years, with estimated spending reductions of $8.0 billion over 10 years. Farm bill conferees faced significant differences in SNAP provisions between the Senate and House-passed bills. The 2014 farm bill reauthorizes SNAP and related programs for five years, with estimated spending reductions of $8.0 billion over 10 years. Differences in the SNAP provisions in the Senate- and House-passed bills resulted in varying spending reductions, with the Senate's Nutrition title reducing spending by approximately $4 billion and the House's Nutrition title reducing spending by approximately $39 billion. The enacted 2014 farm bill largely retains the provisions in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and other nutrition program authorizing statutes, with some changes estimated to impact spending on the nutrition programs. The budgetary impact of the Nutrition title in P.L. 113-79 is mainly due to changes in SNAP eligibility and benefit calculation rules, excluding two House SNAP provisions that would have made significant reductions in SNAP spending. One major issue is the amendment in how LIHEAP payments are factored into SNAP benefits calculation. Both the Senate and House had proposed this change, with the House version expected to have a greater impact. The final agreement in P.L. 113-79 includes changes to SNAP benefit calculation rules, affecting participants in approximately 17 states. It also modifies the disqualification policy for ex-offenders receiving SNAP benefits. Additionally, the agreement includes provisions for the SNAP Employment and Training program, including pilot project authority and funding for work programs.

The Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act authorizes USDA agricultural credit and rural development programs. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) makes small policy changes to USDA's credit programs, allowing alternative legal entities to qualify for farm loans, increasing maximum down-payment loan sizes, removing term limits on guaranteed operating loans, increasing conservation loan guarantees, prioritizing loans for beginning farmers, and facilitating loans for highly fractionated land in Indian reservations. The Senate bill aimed to update and modernize the ConAct's statutory language. The Senate bill proposed updating and modernizing the ConAct's statutory language and reorganizing programs into separate subtitles. The final law did not reorganize the ConAct. The Farm Credit Act included a provision to improve disclosure of compensation packages for senior officers. The Senate-passed 2013 farm bill suggested restructuring the ConAct for rural development programs. The proposed reorganization of the ConAct in the 2014 farm bill was not enacted, but it did consolidate two rural business programs into one platform with annual appropriations of $65 million through FY2018. The bill also increased mandatory spending authorization for Value-Added Agricultural Product Grants to $63 million and retained $40 million in annual discretionary appropriations. Additionally, the bill provided $150 million in mandatory spending for rural development loans and grants, and allocated $3 million annually in mandatory spending and $40 million for the Microentrepreneur Assistance Program.

It addresses the management of the National Forest System by designating treatment areas for deteriorating forest health. P.L. 113-79 includes provisions to modify the public notice, comment, and appeals process for land and resource management plans. USDA renewable energy programs incentivize research, development, and adoption of renewable energy projects, with a focus on promoting U.S. biofuels production, particularly cornstarch-based ethanol. The 2008 farm bill aimed to shift U.S. biofuels policy towards non-corn feedstocks, especially cellulosic biofuels, through programs like the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels and the Biorefinery Assistance Program. The 2014 farm bill extends renewable energy provisions from the 2008 farm bill, including programs like BCAP and REAP. Major farm bill energy programs expired in FY2013 and lacked baseline funding going forward.

Title XI reduces crop insurance subsidies and noninsured crop disaster assistance for the first four years of planting on native sod acreage in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Title II requires compliance with wetland conservation and highly erodible land conservation requirements for crop insurance premium subsidies. The Senate bill included a provision to reduce premium subsidies for high-income farmers, but it was not included in P.L. 113-79. In the 2012 farm bill, an amendment was adopted to reduce crop insurance premium subsidies for producers with average adjusted gross income over $750,000. The Senate Agriculture Committee-reported version of S. 954 did not include the provision, but an amendment to S. 954 requiring the subsidy reduction was adopted on the Senate floor in June 2013 by a vote of 59-33.
