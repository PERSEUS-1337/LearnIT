    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Counter-Narcotics Policy Review Act\". The Congress acknowledges the serious problem of narcotics consumption in the United States, especially among the youth, and the ongoing challenges in international narcotics trafficking. It emphasizes the need for long-term international cooperation to address this issue and criticizes the flawed annual certification process for international narcotics control efforts. The flawed annual certification process for international narcotics control efforts lacks long-term goals, comprehensive review of all contributing countries, and fails to consider diverse circumstances that can influence decisions, leading to unpredictability and lack of credibility. The annual certification process under section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is not effectively addressing the issue. The High Level Commission on International Narcotics Control is established to review the annual certification process for international narcotics control. The Commission will assess the process's effectiveness in curtailing drug trafficking, enhancing international cooperation, and reducing drug use in the United States. The High Level Commission on International Narcotics Control consists of 12 members, including the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Attorney General, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Director of Central Intelligence. Additionally, two Members of Congress are appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Commission consists of members appointed by leaders of the House and Senate, with vacancies filled in the same manner. The Chairperson is the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy until a Chairperson is elected by the Commission members.

The chairperson of the Commission has the authority to conduct research, surveys, and other necessary services to carry out its duties. SEC. 8. REPORTS.

A final report containing required information will be submitted within 1 year. The Commission will provide updated information and recommendations to combat international narcotics trafficking, improve cooperation among countries, and enhance the transparency of the annual certification process.
