    "content": "The \"Foreign Investment Transparency and Security Act of 2006\" is also known as the \"Homeland Security Act of 2002\" which limits foreign control of investments in critical US infrastructure. The \"Foreign Investment Transparency and Security Act of 2006\" defines terms like 'foreign government controlled entity' and 'general business corporation'. It also imposes limitations on foreign investments. Foreign government controlled entities can only acquire critical infrastructure in the US through a foreign-owned general business corporation meeting specific requirements. These include having a majority of US citizens on the board of directors, a US citizen chief security officer, and maintaining all related records in the US. The text chunk states that nothing in the subtitle should limit the authority of the President or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, must issue final regulations within 6 months of the enactment of this subtitle. Section 242 will be effective 6 months after enactment, with foreign government-controlled entities having 180 days to comply if they own critical infrastructure. Subtitle E of the bill focuses on limiting foreign control of investments in certain critical infrastructure in the United States. It includes sections defining terms, setting limitations on foreign investments, requiring regulations, and specifying the effective date. Additionally, the bill addresses maritime security concerns, emphasizing the need to improve container scanning processes and aiming to scan 100% of inbound maritime containers. The bill also mentions the potential benefits of adopting the maritime container inspection system used in Hong Kong. The bill addresses maritime security concerns by requiring a report on the implementation of a scanning system for 100% of inbound maritime containers within 90 days. The term 'container' is defined according to the International Convention for Safe Containers."
