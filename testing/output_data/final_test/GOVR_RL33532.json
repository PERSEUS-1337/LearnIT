    "content": "On September 14, 2012, the President reported to Congress that a security force was deployed to Libya in response to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi. The force was sent to support the security of U.S. personnel in Libya and an additional security force was also sent to Yemen. The President stated that these forces were equipped for combat but their purpose was solely to protect American citizens and property. The forces will remain in Libya and Yemen until the security situation improves. On June 15, 2012, President reported to Congress about U.S. Armed Forces deployments for counterterrorism operations, including approximately 90,000 troops in Afghanistan. U.S. combat-equipped forces were also deployed globally to enhance CT capabilities, with direct action taken in Somalia against al-Qa'ida members. The President reported efforts to eliminate terrorist threats posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and mentioned additional measures against al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and associated forces to protect U.S. citizens and interests. Military operations included the deployment of U.S. combat-equipped military personnel to Uganda as advisors. The deployment of approximately 90 U.S. military personnel to Uganda as advisors to regional forces working to apprehend Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders, with elements sent to forward locations in South Sudan, Congo, and CAR. These forces will only engage in self-defense. Additionally, the U.S. has around 817 military personnel in Kosovo and is prepared for maritime interception operations against international terrorists. The President's efforts aim to stop the movement, arming, and financing of international terrorist groups and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by sea. War powers are divided between Congress and the President, with the President having the power to repel attacks and lead the Armed Forces. Concerns have been raised about the erosion of congressional authority in deciding when the US should be involved in wars or use the Armed Forces. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) was passed by Congress in 1973 to limit the President's powers to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities without a declaration of war, specific authorization, or national emergency. It requires the President to consult with Congress before deploying forces and report any such actions to Congress. The War Powers Resolution (WPR) was passed in 1973 to limit the President's powers to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities without authorization. Congress must authorize the use of forces within 60 to 90 days or the forces must be withdrawn. Every President since 1973 has viewed the resolution as an unconstitutional infringement on the President's authority. The War Powers Resolution limits the President's authority to introduce U.S. forces into hostilities without authorization. Congressional approval depends on the type of U.N. action and is governed by the Constitution, the U.N. Participation Act, and the War Powers Resolution. The President can negotiate special agreements with the Security Council for armed actions under the U.N. Charter, subject to Congress's approval. Some Members seek military agreements under Article 43 of the U.N. Charter, questioning if congressional approval is needed for each specific situation. Section 7 of the U.N. Participation Act allows up to 1,000 personnel for noncombatant roles in U.N. peacekeeping missions. The U.S. has provided personnel for U.N. missions without controversy over congressional authorization. Controversy over congressional authorization for peacekeeping actions has arisen when forces are deployed in larger numbers or as possible combatants. In the 103rd Congress, Members sought control over future peacekeeping actions through legislation requiring the President to consult with Congress before using funds for U.N. peacekeeping or peace enforcement operations. Additionally, a report on multinational peacekeeping was required to be submitted for congressional approval. In the 103rd Congress, there was controversy over congressional authorization for peacekeeping actions, leading to new requirements for consultation with Congress on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. This included notifying Appropriations Committees in advance of U.N. Security Council votes and monthly consultations on peacekeeping operation status. In the 103rd Congress, new requirements were established for U.S. assistance to U.N. peacekeeping operations, including 15 days' advance notice and quarterly reports. The issue of war powers and congressional authorization for U.S. involvement in U.N. actions was raised during military operations in Yugoslavia. The U.S. involvement in Bosnia has raised questions about the War Powers Resolution and NATO's role in military actions. The North Atlantic Treaty implies a role for Congress in the event of war, while the War Powers Resolution requires specific authorization for introducing U.S. forces into hostilities. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 770 urging nations to facilitate humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo. The Senate and House passed resolutions supporting action but not authorizing the use of U.S. military forces. In late 1995, President Clinton sent over 20,000 American combat troops to Bosnia as part of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Congress considered various bills and resolutions but could not reach a consensus. President Clinton later agreed to provide up to 8,500 ground troops for a NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia. In March 1998, the House defeated a resolution directing the President to take action under the War Powers Resolution. The President's deployment of U.S. military forces in Bosnia and Kosovo without congressional authorization sparked controversy over presidential authority and the purpose of U.S. military involvement in the region. The President's deployment of U.S. military forces in Kosovo led to a debate over presidential authority and the War Powers Resolution. President Clinton notified Congress of air strikes against Yugoslavia in response to violence against ethnic Albanians. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 21 authorizing military operations in cooperation with NATO against Yugoslavia. The House passed H.R. 1569 prohibiting ground troop deployment without specific authorization. On April 28, 1999, the House defeated a resolution declaring war on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Representative Tom Campbell and 17 other Members of the House filed a lawsuit seeking authorization from Congress before continuing military action against Yugoslavia. On May 4, 1999, the Senate tabled a joint resolution authorizing military action against Yugoslavia. The House, on May 6, 1999, defeated an amendment to prohibit the use of U.S. ground forces in Yugoslavia. Congress cleared an emergency appropriations bill for funding the U.S. Kosovo operation on May 20, 1999. In FY1999, billions in funding were provided for the U.S. Kosovo operation. On May 25, 1999, a lawsuit was filed against President Clinton for violating the War Powers Resolution by not withdrawing U.S. forces from Kosovo after 60 days. The President did not seek a 30-day extension and claimed the Resolution was constitutionally defective. The lawsuit was dismissed on June 8, 1999. The court ruled that Representative Campbell lacked legal standing to sue President Clinton for conducting military activities in Yugoslavia without Congress authorization. Campbell appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which affirmed the District Court's decision. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, but they refused to hear the case on October 2, 2000. The Supreme Court refused to hear Representative Campbell's appeal on October 2, 2000, letting stand the U.S. Court of Appeals decision. The Senate defeated an amendment to terminate funding for U.S. troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, without congressional authorization. During October 1994, Iraq sent additional divisions to southern Iraq near Kuwait's border. In response, President Clinton deployed 30,000 more U.S. forces and combat planes to the Gulf area to defend Kuwait and enforce U.N. resolutions. Congress was in recess until late November and did not discuss authorization. By October 15, Iraq had redeployed its forces, leading to the withdrawal of 7,000 U.S. troops before Christmas. The use of U.S. forces in Iraq after Desert Storm raised war powers issues due to repression of Kurdish and Shiite groups. UN resolutions condemned the repression and called for destruction of weapons. A \"no-fly\" zone was established in the south. The United States and coalition partners attacked missile bases in southern Iraq on January 13, 1993, deploying a battalion task force to Kuwait to show commitment to Kuwait's independence. Iraq was given an ultimatum to remove newly deployed missiles in the no-fly zone. President George H. W. Bush reported military actions against Iraq on January 13, 17, and 18, with President Clinton affirming the policy towards Iraq set by the former Bush administration on January 21, 1993. On various dates in 1993, U.S. aircraft fired at Iraqi targets in response to radar or anti-aircraft fire. President Clinton reported that the northern no-fly zone deterred Iraq from military action, but Iraq continued to shell marsh villages in the south. Iraq's actions violated U.N. Security Council Resolution 688, leading the U.S. to maintain sanctions until Iraq complied with all relevant resolutions. The United States maintained sanctions to achieve compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The use of U.S. force in Iraq after Desert Storm was authorized by Congress through P.L. 102-1 and Resolution 678. Senator Dole clarified that the President did not need specific authorization for the use of force. Section 1095 of P.L. 102-190 expressed Congress's support for these actions. Congress supported the use of necessary means to achieve Security Council Resolution 687 goals and protect Iraq's Kurdish minority. President Clinton reported a Tomahawk missile strike on Iraqi Intelligence Service in Baghdad for planning an assassination attempt on former President Bush. President Clinton reported to Congress on U.S. military actions in Iraq in response to attacks by Iraqi forces in Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil. Actions included extending the no-fly zone and cruise missile attacks. Presidents Bush and Clinton did not cite the War Powers Resolution in their reports, submitting them \"consistent with\" P.L. 102-1. President Clinton and President George W. Bush authorized U.S. military actions in Iraq, including bombings of Iraqi sites in response to Iraqi aggression and threats to U.S. aircraft enforcing the \"no-fly zones.\" These actions were reported to Congress under P.L. 102-1, rather than the War Powers Resolution. President Bush authorized additional bombings of Iraqi sites from 2001 to March 2003 under P.L. 102-1. Congress provided future military action authorization through P.L. 107-243 in October 2002. President Bush directed combat operations against Iraq on March 19, 2003, to enforce disarmament. Periodic reports on Iraq's situation have been made consistent with P.L. 107-243 since May 1, 2003. The situation in Iraq is in line with reports to Congress under P.L. 107-243. In Haiti, an agreement for President Aristide's restoration was not complied with, leading to the restoration of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council. Council voted to restore sanctions against Haiti after President Clinton submitted a report confirming U.S. ships enforcing a U.N. embargo. Some Members of Congress criticized the lack of consultation and authorization. Senator Dole proposed an amendment requiring congressional approval for deployments in Haitian waters and airspace. Section 8147 of P.L. 103-139 stated that funds should not be used for military operations in Haiti without prior congressional authorization. On May 6, 1994, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 917 to tighten the embargo on Haiti. President Clinton announced steps to increase pressure on Haiti's military leaders, including assisting the Dominican Republic in sealing its border, detaining ships violating sanctions, banning commercial air traffic, and imposing sanctions on financial transactions. Despite worsening conditions in Haiti, President Clinton did not rule out the use of force, leading to debates in Congress about the need for authorization. Authorization was granted by the U.N. Security Council for a multinational force to facilitate the departure of Haiti's military leadership. The Senate debated whether this constituted authorization for the deployment of U.S. forces in Haiti, with President Clinton stating he welcomed Congress' support but did not believe it was constitutionally required. On September 15, 1994, President Clinton announced the deployment of the military. President Clinton ordered military reserve and aircraft carriers into the region to remove military dictators from power in Haiti. A negotiating team was sent to Haiti, and the military leaders agreed to step down by October 15. President Clinton announced that military leaders in Haiti agreed to step down by October 15 and troops from a 15,000-member international coalition would be introduced starting September 19. The agreement was made due to the credible threat of a multinational force. U.S. forces entered Haiti on September 19, 1994, as part of the mission to restore democratic government. President Clinton reported the deployment of 1,500 troops to Haiti, with plans to increase the number. U.S. forces engaged in hostilities on September 24, and on October 3, the House Foreign Affairs Committee authorized the forces in Haiti until March 1, 1995. The House passed a resolution stating that the President should have sought congressional approval for the mission. President Clinton deployed 1,500 troops to Haiti without congressional approval. Congress passed a resolution requiring monthly reports on Haiti and supported a prompt withdrawal of U.S. forces. U.N. peacekeeping forces took over missions from U.S. military forces in March 1995. By September 1995, there were 2,400 U.S. military personnel in Haiti as part of the U.N. Mission in Haiti. President Clinton deployed 1,500 troops to Haiti without congressional approval. U.N. peacekeeping forces took over missions from U.S. military forces in March 1995. By September 1995, there were 2,400 U.S. military personnel in Haiti as part of the U.N. Mission. In December 1997, President Clinton planned to keep 500 military personnel in Haiti, mainly engineering and medical units, with a combat element for protection. In March 2004, additional combat-equipped personnel were sent to support U.N. Security Council Resolution 1529. In Somalia, U.S. military forces participated in a U.N. operation to protect humanitarian assistance, which became controversial due to increasing fighting and casualties. President Clinton announced the withdrawal of all U.S. forces by March 31, 1994, with most leaving by that date. The remaining 58 Marines, who stayed to protect U.S. diplomats, were withdrawn on September 15, 1994. Congress debated authorizing U.S. action in Somalia, with the Senate passing S.J.Res. 45 on February 4, 1993, to allow the President to use U.S. Armed Forces under U.N. Security Council Resolution 794. The House amended and passed S.J.Res. 45 on May 25, 1993, authorizing U.S. forces to remain in Somalia for one year. The Senate adopted an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill on September 9, 1993, urging the President to seek congressional authorization for the continued deployment of U.S. forces in Somalia by November 15, 1993. On October 15, 1993, the Senate adopted an amendment cutting off funds for U.S. military operations in Somalia after March 31, 1994, unless further spending authority was obtained from Congress. The amendment required U.S. forces to remain under the command of U.S. commanders and approved military operations for the protection of American personnel and bases, as well as providing support for relief aid efforts. On November 9, 1993, the House directed the President to remove forces from Somalia by March 31, 1994. The Defense Appropriations Act for FY1995 prohibited continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia after September 30, 1994. The U.N. mission in Somalia ended on March 31, 1995, and U.S. forces completed their assistance to United Nations forces evacuating Somalia on March 3, 1995. The President directed U.S. military forces to assist an international effort authorized by the United Nations to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Libya. The strikes were part of a multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 and were limited in nature, duration, and scope to enforce the terms of the resolution. The President supports an international coalition enforcing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 in Libya, focusing on protecting civilians and establishing a no-fly zone. U.S. military efforts are limited and aimed at setting conditions for European and Arab partners to carry out the resolution without deploying ground forces. The United States is conducting a limited mission in Libya to protect civilians and prevent a humanitarian disaster. US forces have targeted Qadhafi regime's capabilities used to attack civilians. The goal is to transition operations to coalition, regional, or international organizations as necessary to achieve the objectives of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973. The actions are in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. On April 1, 2011, the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued a memorandum opinion on the President's authority to use military force in Libya. The OLC concluded that the President's use of force was constitutional and in the national interest, and that prior congressional approval was not required for the limited operations. The full text of the opinion can be found on the OLC webpage. The Office of Legal Counsel opinion of April 1, 2011, on Military Force in Libya references previous OLC opinions and Supreme Court cases to analyze presidential authority to use U.S. Armed Forces overseas. Some of the previous OLC opinions cited include \"Authorization for Continuing Hostilities in Kosovo,\" \"Proposed Bosnia Deployment,\" \"Deployment of United States Armed Forces into Haiti,\" \"Authority to use United States Military Forces in Somalia,\" and \"Presidential Power to Use the Armed Forces Abroad Without Statutory Authorization.\" The Office of Legal Counsel analyzed the President's authority to direct military force in Libya based on national interests and the extent of military operations, concluding that the President had the authority to act as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that President Obama had the constitutional authority to order military force in Libya to preserve regional stability and support the UNSC's credibility. They determined that the operations in Libya did not constitute a 'war' requiring congressional approval, allowing the President to direct limited military actions without prior authorization. President Obama informed Congress of these actions on the 60th day of initiating military support for a \"no-fly zone\" over Libya. President Obama initiated U.S. military support for a \"no-fly zone\" over Libya to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. The U.S. transferred responsibility to NATO and provided non-kinetic support, aircraft assistance, and precision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles. President Obama expressed support for the NATO-led coalition's efforts in Libya, emphasizing the importance of U.S. support for protecting civilians from the Qaddafi regime. He endorsed a bipartisan resolution in Congress to confirm U.S. commitment to the mission and unity in supporting Libyan aspirations for political reform and self-government. On June 3, 2011, the House debated resolutions regarding the War Powers Resolution and the presence of US Armed Forces in Libya. H.Con.Res. 51 was defeated, calling for the removal of forces within 15 days. H.Res. 292 passed, stating the President should not deploy troops in Libya except for rescue missions. H.Res. 292 requires a report on Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector, detailing U.S. security interests and objectives in Libya since March 19, 2011. It also states that Congress has the authority to withhold funding for unauthorized use of the U.S. Armed Forces in Libya. The Obama Administration submitted a 32-page report on U.S. actions in Libya, including a legal analysis. The Obama Administration submitted a 32-page report on U.S. actions in Libya, including a legal analysis stating the President's authority to direct limited military operations in Libya without congressional authorization. The Obama Administration's report on U.S. actions in Libya emphasized that the military operations are authorized by a UN Security Council Resolution to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone, with U.S. forces in a supporting role and not engaged in sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire. Congressional support for the President's actions in Libya was also discussed in the report. The Obama Administration's report on U.S. actions in Libya highlighted strong support for a bipartisan resolution by Senators McCain, Kerry, Lieberman, and others. The House of Representatives rejected resolutions authorizing the use of U.S. Armed Forces in Libya. President Bush George W. Bush submitted 39 reports to Congress as a result of the War Powers Resolution, while President Barack Obama submitted 11 reports.

The War Powers Resolution requires consultation with Congress before introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities, but there has been little consultation in recent instances. The War Powers Resolution requires consultation with Congress before deploying troops, but there is ambiguity over when consultation is necessary and what it entails. The executive branch's interpretation of consultation has differed from that of some Members of Congress. The War Powers Resolution requires consultation with Congress before deploying troops, with ambiguity over when and how consultation should occur. Congress faces challenges in determining who represents them for consultation and whether to invoke Section 4(a)(1) to limit troop actions without authorization. Critics propose a consultation group, but Congress has not acted on this. If Congress approves a President's action, applying the Resolution may be beneficial. The War Powers Resolution allows Congress to legitimize or terminate a President's action, providing a way to limit troop actions without authorization. There are debates on whether to apply the Resolution to strengthen congressional support or give the President more flexibility. The effectiveness of the Resolution in moderating the President's response to crisis situations is also questioned. Some suggest changes to the War Powers Resolution, such as returning to the original Senate-passed version or replacing the automatic troop withdrawal requirement. Others propose repealing the Resolution altogether. Several Members have suggested establishing a consultative group to meet with the President when military action is being considered.

During the 106th Congress, efforts were made to force the President to seek congressional authority for military operations in Kosovo, leading to votes in the House and Senate. Representative Tom Campbell and others sued the President in Federal Court to clarify congressional-executive authority, but the case was dismissed due to lack of standing. The United States Supreme Court upheld the Appeals Court decision. In the first session of the 107th Congress, S.J.Res. 23 was passed on September 14, 2001, following the events of 9/11.

The President's authority to use force under P.L. 107-243 is not limited to existing Security Council resolutions on Iraq but includes future resolutions. It extends beyond disarmament to address all concerns in the resolutions and does not require a link to 9/11. The authority can be used to defend against the ongoing threat from Iraq. President Bush used the authority granted in P.L. 107-243 to launch a military attack against Iraq on March 19, 2003. This authority is also being used for ongoing military operations in Iraq."
