    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elder Fall Prevention Act of 2002\". Key findings are also included. The Congress finds that falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among people over 65, with 60% of fall-related deaths occurring among persons 75 and older. Additionally, 25% of elderly persons who sustain a hip fracture die within 1 year, and hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly have been increasing. The costs to Medicare and Medicaid programs from falls by elderly persons are expected to exceed $32 billion in 2020. The Federal Government should allocate more resources to research on fall prevention and treatment. A national approach involving various organizations and individuals is needed to reduce elder falls and improve patient safety. The Act aims to develop public education strategies to reduce elder falls, expand services, and evaluate the impact of falls on Medicare and Medicaid costs. The Administration on Aging will oversee a national education campaign to reduce elder falls and provide grants for state-level coalitions to carry out local education campaigns. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct research to improve identification of elders at high risk of falls, data collection for fall risk factors, effective strategies to reduce falls, interventions to prevent falls, diagnosis and treatment of fall victims, and assess fall risk in different settings. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct research on barriers to adopting interventions for preventing elder falls, evaluate community programs for preventing falls in assisted living and nursing homes, and oversee research activities related to elder fall prevention in various settings through different agencies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to organizations for professional education in elder fall prevention. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.
