    "content": "The Act titled \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially after the Cold War. The United Nations has recognized the danger of weapons of mass destruction and has taken steps to prevent their spread. Several nations, aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons use. The breakup of the Soviet Union has heightened the threat of nuclear proliferation. In 1992, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan committed to joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapon states. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program with assistance from western countries. North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refusal of IAEA inspections could undermine efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons programs and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States is concerned about security interests and current policy. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in various regions to prevent conflicts and arms races. The effectiveness of the IAEA in safeguarding nuclear materials may be hindered by constraints. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should be expanded in membership and extended indefinitely to strengthen international nuclear non-proliferation efforts. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the IAEA, aiming to enhance controls over nuclear transfers. The US seeks to halt nuclear weapons spread, reverse proliferation, and prevent nuclear weapon use globally through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to end nuclear proliferation by encouraging Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to ratify treaties, remove nuclear weapons, and implement safeguards on nuclear facilities. Additionally, an agreement with Russia is sought to deactivate and retire deployed weapons. The United States aims to deactivate and retire nuclear weapons under the START I and START II treaties, verify their elimination through data exchanges and inspections, and place fissile material under controls. Additionally, preparations are made for the ratification of the START II treaty by exchanging information with Russia on nuclear weapons stockpiles and facilities. The United States Senate approved the START I Treaty with conditions including ratifying the START II treaty, reducing nuclear arsenals, and ending production of new nuclear warheads. The United States Senate approved the START I Treaty with conditions to significantly reduce nuclear arsenals through a stage-by-stage process. Immediate agreement with Russia to halt fissile material production for weapons, end production by 1995, control existing stockpiles, and place nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. Strengthen IAEA safeguards for better verification of nonproliferation commitments. The United States Senate approved the START I Treaty with conditions to reduce nuclear arsenals. Measures include halting fissile material production, strengthening IAEA safeguards, and supporting nonproliferation agreements. The United States Senate approved the START I Treaty with conditions to reduce nuclear arsenals, including halting fissile material production, strengthening IAEA safeguards, and supporting nonproliferation agreements such as the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and adopting a policy of \"no first use\" of nuclear weapons. Additionally, a verifiable bilateral agreement with Russia to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons is sought. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons and extend the zero option to all nuclear weapon states. Additionally, it mentions signing protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirements for implementing the policy. The President must report to Congress on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the United States, Russia, and other countries. Reports must be submitted annually in unclassified form, with a classified appendix if needed. The President is required to report to Congress on actions taken and planned to comply with Condition 8 of the Senate resolution regarding the \"Nuclear Stockpile Weapons Arrangement\" in the START I treaty. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"fissile materials\" (highly enriched uranium and plutonium), \"highly enriched uranium\" (uranium enriched to 20% or more in U-235), \"IAEA\" (International Atomic Energy Agency), \"IAEA safeguards\" (safeguards in an agreement with the IAEA), \"no first use\" policy (commitment not to initiate nuclear weapon use), \"non-nuclear weapon state\" (country not possessing nuclear weapons), and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\" (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons). The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to nuclear weapons treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, START I treaty, and START II treaty."
