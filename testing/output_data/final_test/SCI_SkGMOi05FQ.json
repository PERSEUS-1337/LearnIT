    "content": "In recent years, advancements in generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown great success in tasks like image generation and style transfer. Word embeddings like word2vec and GLoVe are widely used in Natural Language Processing for neural network models. This work introduces a method for text generation using Skip-Thought sentence embeddings combined with GANs, achieving comparable results to using word embeddings. Various efforts have been made in natural language text generation, including tasks like sentiment analysis. This work proposes an approach for text generation using Generative Adversarial Networks with Skip-Thought vectors, achieving state-of-the-art results in tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. GANs are neural networks that train a generator to produce high-quality samples by competing against an adversarial discriminative model. This method utilizes sentence embedding vectors produced by SkipThought, enabling the GAN to generate differentiable values for discrete text generation. The GAN with sentence embedding vectors from SkipThought achieves state-of-the-art results in natural language generation tasks. Deep neural network architectures, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms have also shown success in language modeling. Supervised learning with deep neural networks in encoder-decoder models is the current standard for NLP problems. Stacked denoising autoencoders and combinatory categorical autoencoders have been used for domain adaptation and sentiment classification. The Skip-Thought Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) utilizes sentence embedding vectors to achieve top results in natural language generation tasks. Various GAN models, including gradient policy-based sequence generation frameworks and actor-critic conditional GANs, are used for text generation. Different architectures like RNNs, variational auto-encoders, and leaky discriminators have also shown promising outcomes in language modeling. The Skip-Thought model utilizes sentence embedding vectors for natural language generation tasks. It employs an encoder-decoder framework with an unsupervised approach to train a generic, distributed sentence encoder. The model uses RNNs with GRU activations for encoding and decoding, similar to neural machine translation. The model for neural machine translation involves an encoder-decoder framework with bias matrices for gate computations. Two decoders work in parallel for adjacent sentences. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use two networks in a zero-sum game to mimic data distribution and generate artificial samples. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a Generator and a Discriminator, competing in a zero-sum game to mimic the real data distribution. The objective is for the generator to produce data similar to the real distribution, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data. The Nash equilibrium is reached when both networks play optimally, leading to the convergence of the GAN model. The STGAN model utilizes a deep convolutional generative adversarial network for its operations. The STGAN model uses a deep convolutional generative adversarial network, with the generator network updated twice for each discriminator network update to prevent fast convergence. The Skip-Thought encoder encodes sentences with length less than 30 words using 2400 GRU units to produce 4800-dimensional combine-skip vectors. The decoder uses greedy decoding to reconstruct sentences conditioned on a sentence vector by sampling from predicted distributions. Unknown tokens are not included in the vocabulary. The training process of a GAN is challenging, with techniques like batch normalization, feature matching, and minibatch discrimination used to stabilize it. Mode dropping can occur in Skip-Thought GAN, which is addressed by modeling the distance between samples in a batch. The experiments in this work focus on improving Skip-Thought GAN performance on text generation by using f-measures. GANs can be conditioned on data attributes to generate samples, with both the generator and discriminator in this experiment conditioned on Skip-Thought encoded vectors. The encoder converts sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into vectors used as real samples for the discriminator. The text discusses the evaluation of model performance using BLEU metrics on a dataset of simple English sentences. It also mentions mode collapse in sentence generation using different architectures and distance measures. The text discusses overcoming mode collapse in sentence generation by using different architectures and distance measures, such as gradient penalty regularizer and Wasserstein distance."
