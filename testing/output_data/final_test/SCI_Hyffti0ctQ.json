    "content": "In this paper, an efficient framework is proposed to accelerate convolutional neural networks using pruning and hints. Pruning reduces model size by removing channels, while hints transfer knowledge from teacher to student model. The combination of pruning and hints is shown to be complementary, benefiting each other by maintaining feature representations and improving transferability between networks. The approach iteratively performs pruning and hints stages to further enhance performance. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used in computer vision tasks such as classification, object detection, and pose estimation. However, the large model size and computation complexity of CNN models hinder their practical use. To address this issue, research has focused on accelerating models without sacrificing performance. Pruning and knowledge distillation are two popular methods for model acceleration. Pruning aims to remove less important parameters to reduce model size, while knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student model. Pruning aims to remove less important parameters from a model while maintaining performance. Knowledge distillation transfers high-level representations from a teacher model to a student model. BID31 uses the teacher model's feature map for distillation. The student model performs better when initialized to produce similar features as the teacher model. This approach helps the pruned model output similar features to the original model and provides a good initialization for the student model. The PWH Framework combines pruning and hints to provide a better initialization for the student model. Hints help reconstruct parameters and alleviate performance degradation caused by pruning. The framework is the first to combine these techniques and can be applied to various vision tasks. Experiments show that hints aid in reconstructing parameters for pruned models. The framework combines pruning and hints to improve student model initialization. It is the first to combine these techniques and can be applied to various tasks. Experiments show the effectiveness of the framework on different datasets. In this paper, the authors explore various methods for accelerating neural networks, including converting float parameters to fixed-point parameters, group convolution, and pruning. They focus on channel-wise pruning methods, such as LASSO regression, to reduce computational complexity. In BID26, scale parameters in Batch Normalization layers are used to evaluate channel importance. BID28 uses taylor formula to prune low contribution channels. Despite the effectiveness of pruning methods, it decreases with more pruned channels. Knowledge distillation (KD) BID15 defines soft targets for student networks. Fitnets BID31 introduce hints for whole feature map mimic learning. BID37 propose atloss to mimic ensemble outputs using student networks. Li et al. BID24 demonstrate mimic learning based on region. In this section, the authors describe their method for improving small networks' performance for object detection. They introduce hints, pruning methods, and a reconstructing operation in their framework. By combining these techniques, they propose the PWH Framework. The pruning method used is based on a combinatorial optimization problem, where the cost function, training samples, and parameters of the original and pruning networks are considered. The authors introduce hints, pruning methods, and a reconstructing operation in their framework to improve small networks' performance for object detection. The pruning method involves minimizing the number of nonzero parameters in W based on its outputs h i. Using taylor expansion provides an approximate formula for the objective function. Hints offer extra supervision for the student network, combined with task loss, to enhance performance. Different hints methods are suitable for various tasks and network architectures. In their framework to enhance small networks' performance for object detection, the authors introduce hints, pruning methods, and a reconstructing operation. Different hints methods like L2 hints, normalization hints, and adaption hints are used to provide extra supervision for the student network. Adaption hints emphasize the importance of an adaption layer between student and teacher networks to promote hints learning. The authors introduce hints, pruning methods, and a reconstructing operation to enhance small networks' performance for object detection. Adaption hints emphasize the importance of an adaption layer between student and teacher networks. The optimization problem involves a high-dimension matrix X, which is randomly sampled from datasets. A switch is used to select better weights between final, original, and reconstructed weights of hints layer. The authors propose the PWH Framework, which involves pruning, reconstructing, and hints learning steps to enhance small networks' performance for object detection. The framework iteratively reduces model size, reconstructs hint layer parameters, and conducts hints learning using pruned and original models. The student model becomes the teacher model for the next iteration, with another hints step implemented at the end. The student model in the current iteration is a better candidate for the teacher model in the next hints step due to similar feature maps and parameters before and after pruning. The final hints step, like a finetune step in pruning methods, selects the original model from the first iteration as the teacher model, improving the performance of the compressed model. The PWH Framework proposes that the pruned model serves as a good initialization for the student model in the hints step, as the feature map similarity between the pruned and original models enhances transferability. Additionally, hints aid in reconstructing parameters during pruning, preventing performance degradation when a large number of channels are pruned. The reconstruct step in the PWH Framework aims to improve the similarity between the feature maps of the original and pruned networks by focusing on hints layer reconstruction. This helps maintain the main structure of the pruned model and enhances transferability between models. The PWH Framework focuses on reconstructing the hints layer to improve similarity between original and pruned networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and COCO show its superiority for classification and pose estimation tasks. Implementation details and comparisons with pruning and hint methods are discussed, with networks trained using PyTorch. Pruning-only involves iterative pruning and finetuning, while hints-only uses a compressed random initialized student model compared to the teacher model. The PWH Framework, which combines hints and pruning, outperforms pruning-only and hints-only methods on various datasets and tasks. It can be implemented across different tasks and network architectures, allowing for adjustable pruning ratios to achieve different acceleration ratios. Ablation studies were conducted on CIFAR-10 using VGG16BN to further analyze the framework. In the ablation study on CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG16BN, experiments were conducted to analyze the importance of iterative operation in the PWH Framework. The study focused on the selection of teacher model in hints step and the effects of reconstructing step. The relationship between network performance and the number of pruned channels using different methods was also examined iteratively. The study focused on the importance of iterative operation in the PWH Framework, showing that iterative operation can significantly improve model performance. An experiment analyzing the relationship between the performance of pruned models and the number of pruned channels revealed that a large number of pruned channels leads to rapid performance degradation. This suggests that doing pruning and hints only once may not be an effective approach, as the pruned model may not output similar features to the original model. Therefore, using the original model at the beginning of training as the teacher model could be a better choice in the PWH Framework. In the experiment comparing teacher models in the PWH Framework, pruning 256 channels in each iteration was analyzed. Results showed that using the pruned model in previous iterations outperformed using the original model initially, due to differences in feature maps as iterations increased. The experiment focused on comparing the effectiveness of using the pruned model in previous iterations to increase similarity between student and teacher models. The reconstructing step was proposed to refine the pruned model's features further. Results showed that incorporating the reconstructing step improved the performance of the framework. The experiment focused on analyzing the properties of the PWH Framework by conducting experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG16 as the original model. The results confirmed that pruning and hints are complementary. The experiments compared the reconstructing feature map error between pruned and randomly initialized models, showing that the reconstructing step can increase the similarity of feature maps between models. In experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG16, the transferability between pruned and original models was demonstrated. The student model, initialized with pruned model weights, showed improved learning with hints. Comparing pruning-only with pruning and hints, the latter showed effectiveness without a reconstructing step. Iterative pruning and hints operations were implemented for fair comparison. The PWH Framework combines pruning and hints methods for model acceleration. It shows comparable performance with pruning-only method initially, but outperforms it with more iterations. The small model's structure is at risk during pruning due to lack of redundant neurons, but hints help reconstruct parameters in the pruned model. This framework is the first to combine these two acceleration methods. The PWH Framework combines pruning and hints methods for model acceleration, showing their complementary nature. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and COCO datasets demonstrate its superiority. Implementation details and a proof of concept are provided in the supplementary material. In the experiment, 4 NVIDIA Titan X GPUs are used with VGG-16 BID33 network on CIFAR-10 dataset. Data augmentation includes random cropping and mean subtraction. A batch size of 128 and learning rate of 1e-3 are utilized for 20 epochs. L2 hints method with loss weight 10 is applied. ResNet18 is compressed using PWH Framework during finetune stage. During the pose estimation experiment on the COCO dataset, ResNet18 with FPN is used as the original model. Data augmentation strategies include random cropping, rotation, and scaling. A weight decay of 1e-5 and learning rate of 5e-5 are applied, with a batch size of 96. 500 images are sampled for reconstructing hints layer weights using the least square method. In the reconstructing step, 500 images are sampled to reconstruct parameters in the hints layer using the least square method. The objective function is described in equation 7, where Y is the feature map of the original model, X is the input of the hints layer, and W is the parameter of the hints layer. Many hints methods use normalized L2 loss as hints loss (equation 8), which can be challenging to optimize. The upper bound of normalized L2 loss is shown to be related to L2 loss, indicating that as L2 loss decreases, the upper bound of L2 loss will also decrease. The curr_chunk discusses expressing y as a function of y0 and e using Taylor expansion, where E[\u00b7] denotes expectation and I is the identity matrix. The assumption is made for convenience that K =."
