    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Landslide Loss Reduction Act\". Congress acknowledges that landslides, including sink holes, ground fissures, and subsidence, vary in type, severity, and frequency across the United States due to terrain, geology, seismicity, and climate. These natural disasters cause approximately $3 billion in damages annually and result in an estimated 25 to 50 deaths each year. A notable event was the 2014 landslide near Oso, Washington, which claimed 43 lives, destroyed 42 homes, and caused significant damage to infrastructure and property. There is a lack of collective landslide inventory and agreed-upon methodology for creating one in the United States. Developing analysis methods for landslide hazard is crucial for technical assistance to various entities and governments. The National Landslide Hazards Reduction Program is established. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a national program to identify and reduce landslide hazards through various activities. This includes developing a national research strategy, maintaining a hazard assessment system, and conducting working groups with State Geological Surveys to prioritize and assess landslide hazards. The national program aims to reduce landslide hazards by developing a hazard inventory database, evaluating landslide impacts, and providing guidelines for planners and decision-makers. The national program aims to reduce losses from landslides by developing curricula and training modules for officials and emergency managers. An Interagency Coordinating Committee on Landslides is established to be chaired by the Director of the United States Geological Survey. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Landslides, chaired by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, includes representatives from FEMA, NSF, NIST, OSTP, NWS, and OMB. The Committee meets at least 3 times a year to oversee the program's planning, management, and coordination, and develop a strategic plan within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Landslides, chaired by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, develops a strategic plan and detailed management plan for the program. They also create a coordinated interagency budget and submit an annual report to Congress detailing budget allocations and activities. The Director of the United States Geological Survey has established an Advisory Committee on Landslides with at least 11 members, including representatives from State geologists and research institutions qualified to provide advice on landslides. The Advisory Committee on Landslides consists of members qualified to advise on landslide hazards reduction from various disciplines, industry standards organizations, and emergency management agencies. The Committee may submit recommendations to the relevant authorities. The Secretary of the Interior administers grants for cooperative landslide hazard mapping and assessment programs through the United States Geological Survey. The Secretary of the Interior administers grants for cooperative landslide hazard mapping and assessment programs through the United States Geological Survey, prioritizing projects based on consultations with State Geological Surveys and matching fund assurances. The Secretary of the Interior administers grants for cooperative landslide hazard mapping and assessment programs through the United States Geological Survey, prioritizing projects based on consultations with State Geological Surveys and matching fund assurances. Additionally, the Secretary, in partnership with the National Science Foundation, provides grants to support research on landslides by institutions of higher education, State and local governments, and nongovernmental entities. Funding of $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter is authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to appropriate $10,400,000 annually for grants related to landslide hazard mapping and assessment programs. Annual reports to Congress must include a list of activities and results of the grants awarded."
