The subsidized employment program allows for funds to be used to subsidize wages for eligible recipients, ensuring that the total federal funds used do not exceed 50 percent of the recipient's wages. Eligible recipients include those receiving assistance under State programs or noncustodial parents of minor children receiving assistance. The subsidized job program provides wage subsidies for unemployed individuals with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty line.

Results of the evaluation will be publicly disclosed on the Secretary's website. The Secretary will publish evaluation results on the Department of Health and Human Services website for public access.

The Secretary will allocate 15 percent of reserved funds to support career pathway programs as defined in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. States must spend funds provided in the fiscal year or the following year. The amendment made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2016."
