    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2016\" ensures access to emergency medical services. Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow emergency medical services professionals to administer controlled substances in schedule II-V to ultimate users receiving emergency medical services. The Attorney General will register emergency medical services agencies that meet the necessary requirements. The Attorney General can register emergency medical services agencies under state laws and may deny registration if it goes against requirements or public interest. Agencies have the option of a single registration in each state instead of multiple ones. Emergency medical services agencies can administer controlled substances without separate registration if they are hospital-based. Professionals can administer controlled substances outside the presence of a medical director if authorized by state law. Emergency medical services agencies can administer controlled substances under specific conditions, including standing orders issued by medical directors or verbal orders from authorized medical professionals in certain situations like mass casualty incidents. Emergency medical services agencies can deliver and store controlled substances under specific conditions, including notifying the Attorney General before delivering to unregistered locations. Emergency medical services agencies can deliver controlled substances at designated locations or in emergency services vehicles, without it being considered distribution. Restocking of emergency medical services vehicles is also allowed. Emergency medical services agencies can restock their vehicles with controlled substances from hospitals after emergency responses, without needing to comply with section 308 requirements. The agency's location must keep a record of the receipt, and the hospital must document the delivery to the agency. A registered emergency medical services agency must maintain records of controlled substances received, administered, or disposed of, including deliveries between agency locations. The designated location must notify the registered location within 72 hours of receiving controlled substances. A registered emergency medical services agency, under the supervision of a medical director, must ensure that all emergency medical services professionals administering controlled substances comply with requirements. Recordkeeping for controlled substances received, administered, or disposed of must be maintained at each registered location. The Attorney General's regulations require compliance with physical security requirements for storing controlled substances at agency locations. Standing orders must be recorded at registered agency locations. The regulations also specify the types of locations designated for controlled substance delivery. The regulations specify the storage and delivery requirements for controlled substances, including emergency medical service vehicles. Hospitals and locations must be able to deliver substances to each other in case of shortages, public health emergencies, or mass casualty events. The regulations specify storage and delivery requirements for controlled substances in emergency medical service vehicles. The subsection clarifies that the Attorney General's authority to prevent diversion of controlled substances is not limited, and states have the authority to regulate emergency medical services. Definitions include 'designated location,' 'emergency medical services,' and 'emergency medical services agency.' The term 'emergency medical services agency' refers to an organization that provides emergency medical services, authorized by the state to administer controlled substances to the public on an emergency basis, whether governmental, nongovernmental, private, or volunteer-based, and offering services by ground, air, or other means. The term 'emergency medical services professional' refers to a licensed health care provider credentialed by a medical director to provide emergency medical services. An 'emergency medical services vehicle' is a vehicle used by an agency for emergency medical care and transport. The term 'hospital-based' refers to an agency owned or operated by a hospital. A 'medical director' is a physician registered under subsection (f) providing medical oversight for an emergency medical services agency. 'Medical oversight' involves supervising the provision of medical care by an emergency medical services agency. A 'medical professional' includes emergency physicians and other medical professionals. A registered location is where an emergency medical services agency receives controlled substances. A registered emergency medical services agency is either registered under this subsection or is hospital-based. The term 'specific State authority' refers to a governmental agency or other authority that develops clinical protocols for emergency medical services within its jurisdiction. 'Standing order' is a written medical protocol determined by a medical director. The term 'verbal order' refers to an oral directive given to emergency medical services professionals to administer controlled substances to individuals in need of emergency medical services outside the physical presence of the authorizing medical director. The House of Representatives passed the document on November 14, 2016, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
