    "content": "A variety of revenue and spending provisions were set to expire at the end of 2012, including the \"Bush-era tax cuts,\" emergency unemployment benefits, Social Security payroll tax reduction, and other tax extenders. If allowed to expire, budget deficits would have gradually fallen to sustainable levels by 2014-2022. However, the extension of certain revenue policies and postponement of spending reductions by ATRA may lead to unsustainable deficits in the coming years. Prior to the enactment of ATRA, the budget deficit was estimated to fall by $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013. However, Congress changed policies by increasing spending and decreasing revenue, leading to an increase in the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) measures budget changes relative to the current law baseline. ATRA is estimated to increase the budget deficit by $330 billion in FY2013 and nearly $4 trillion over the FY2013-FY2022 period. Compared to a \"current policy\" baseline, ATRA modestly reduced the deficit by raising taxes. ATRA raised taxes relative to policies in place at the end of 2012, addressing expiring revenue provisions like the \"Bush-era tax cuts\" and spending policies including emergency unemployment benefits and Medicare physician payments. It increased the budget deficit by $330 billion in FY2013 and nearly $4 trillion over FY2013-FY2022, but modestly reduced the deficit compared to a \"current policy\" baseline. ATRA addressed the Bush-era tax cuts, estate and gift tax, and AMT resulting in a $207 billion reduction in tax revenue in FY2013. It also extended expiring tax provisions resulting in a $74 billion reduction in tax revenue in FY2013. The tax cuts were initially enacted in 2001 and 2003, reducing income tax liabilities from 2002 to 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended Bush-era tax cuts for 2011 and 2012, lowering income taxes in various ways. The Act reduced marginal tax rates, tax rates on capital gains and dividends, limitations for personal exemptions and itemized deductions, and expanded tax credits. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made permanent changes to these provisions, extending reduced tax rates and modifying certain tax incentives. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) permanently extended reduced tax rates on ordinary income and capital gains for taxpayers below $400,000 ($450,000 for married couples). For those above these thresholds, the marginal tax rate on ordinary income increased to 39.6% and on long-term capital gains and dividends to 20%. ATRA also reinstated PEP and Pease for taxpayers with AGI above $250,000 ($300,000 for married couples) and extended tax changes to various credits and incentives. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the permanent extension of the modified 2001 and 2003 income tax cuts will reduce revenues by $65 billion in FY2013 and $1.53 trillion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. EGTRRA phased out the estate tax over a 10-year period, with the Tax Relief Act of 2010 temporarily reinstating it through 2012 at a lower rate and higher exemption amount. The estate tax rules were extended by ATRA, with a top tax rate of 40% on estates over $5 million. The extension is estimated to reduce revenues by $334 million in FY2013 and $369 billion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was created to ensure higher-income taxpayers pay some tax even if they can claim tax preferences. Taxpayers add back certain deductions to their income to calculate the AMT tax base, then subtract a basic exemption amount. A two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% is applied to the AMT tax base to determine tax owed. For more information on estate tax and AMT, refer to CRS reports. The AMT tax base is subject to a two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% to determine tax liability. Prior to H.R. 8, key parts of the AMT were not indexed for inflation, leading to more taxpayers being subject to the AMT over time. ATRA permanently adjusts the AMT exemption amount for inflation and allows nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset AMT liability. The permanent indexing of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for inflation and allowing certain personal nonrefundable tax credits to offset AMT liability will reduce revenues by $139 billion in FY2013 and $1.816 trillion over FY2013 to FY2022. The expiring provisions extended by ATRA include provisions from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended through 2017 and other tax extenders extended through 2013. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) made modifications to Bush-era tax cuts and enacted new tax provisions, including expanding the child tax credit refundability and reducing the marriage penalty of the EITC. It also increased the EITC for families with three or more children and introduced the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for higher education. These changes were extended through 2017 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, and further extended through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA). The temporary extension of these provisions is estimated to reduce revenues by $3 billion in FY2013 and $134 billion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. In FY2013 to FY2022, temporary tax provisions expired in 2011 and 2012. The Senate Finance Committee approved a package in 2012 to extend over 50 tax provisions through 2013. These provisions targeted R&D, investment incentives, foreign-source income tax treatment, and energy sources. Most were previously extended in 2010. Many provisions from the package were ultimately extended for 2012. The temporary tax provisions included in S. 3521 were extended for 2012 and 2013 by ATRA, reducing revenues by $74 billion in FY2013 and $76 billion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. The revenue losses are attributed to individual income tax extenders, business tax extenders, and energy tax extenders. ATRA also included spending provisions. ATRA, signed by [author name scrubbed], included spending provisions such as postponing automatic spending reductions, extending unemployment benefits, preventing Medicare payment rate reductions, and extending the 2008 farm bill. CBO estimated these provisions would increase the deficit by $35 billion in FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 had scheduled spending cuts to begin on January 2, 2013, aiming to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period through spending cuts. However, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach an agreement, triggering automatic spending reductions starting on January 2, 2013. This included a sequester with $109 billion in across-the-board spending cuts for FY2013, split evenly between defense and non-defense spending. Similar spending reductions were scheduled for each year between FY2014 and FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period through spending cuts. With the passage of ATRA, FY2013 spending reductions were reduced by $24 billion, equally divided between defense and non-defense, and postponed for two months. The modified spending reductions are now scheduled to take effect on March 1, 2013, unless changes are made as a result of subsequent legislation. ATRA also contained provisions for spending reductions and revenue increases to offset the changes related to the postponement and reduction of the BCA's automatic spending cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allowed for the transfer of retirement accounts to designated Roth accounts, impacting revenue within and outside the 10-year budget window. This change increases government revenue in the short term but decreases it in the long term. For more details on the Budget Control Act's effects on the budget deficit, refer to CRS Report R42506. For information on individual retirement accounts, see CRS Report RL30255 and CRS Report RL34397. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides basic income support for unemployed workers through state-funded benefits. Once UC benefits are exhausted, additional benefits may be available through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) and Extended Benefit (EB) programs, depending on eligibility and economic conditions. States fund the regular UC benefit and the state share of EB payments, while the federal government funds program administration and the federal share of EB payments. The EB program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by the states under permanent law (P.L. 91-373). The EUC08 program, funded by the federal government, provides additional weeks of unemployment benefits to workers who have exhausted regular UC benefits. The program's authorization has been amended multiple times, with the latest amendment in H.R. 8. The EUC08 benefit structure is set to expire at the end of 2013, with CBO estimating a $30 billion increase in the deficit for 2013. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 averted reductions in payment rates to physicians under the Medicare program through December 31, 2012. The Sustainable Growth Rate system was established to maintain Medicare physician spending levels close to a sustainable target level. The temporary provisions in EUC08 and EB are estimated to increase the deficit by $30 billion in calendar year 2013. Medicare physician spending levels aimed to align with sustainable targets based on GDP per capita growth and healthcare efficiency. Initially, expenditures stayed within targets, but in 2000 and 2001, fee schedule updates exceeded expectations. From 2002 onwards, actual spending surpassed targets, leading to temporary legislative overrides to prevent payment reductions under the SGR calculation. Section 601 of ATRA overrides SGR changes, keeping Medicare physician payments at current levels through December 31, 2013. This provision will increase the budget deficit by $11 billion in FY2013 and $25 billion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. ATRA includes additional health care provisions that extend expiring provisions or modify existing payments to providers under the Medicare program. The ATRA includes provisions that extend Medicare physician payments at current levels through December 31, 2013, resulting in a budget deficit increase of $11 billion in FY2013 and $25 billion over the FY2013 to FY2022 period. Other health provisions in Title VI would increase the budget deficit by $2 billion in FY2013 and decrease it by $23 billion over time. The ATRA extends the 2008 farm bill for one additional year, with additional funding needed for the Milk Income Loss Contract program. Some programs from the 2008 farm bill did not receive new funding under ATRA. The 2008 farm bill was extended for one year with additional funding for certain programs, including conservation, disaster assistance, research, and farmer programs. The extension preserved the budget baseline for writing a new farm bill in 2013. Congress temporarily reduced the employee and self-employed shares of the Social Security payroll tax by two percentage points in December 2010 to stimulate the economy. The reduction was extended through the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011. The payroll tax rate reduction was extended through the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 but reverted back to the original rates in 2013. The employee share of Social Security payroll taxes is now 6.2% on the first $113,700 of wages. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to increase access to health care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is projected to increase access to health insurance coverage, with most provisions effective in 2014. The law includes financial penalties for individuals and employers who do not comply, as well as revenue provisions to fund expanded coverage. One-third of the revenues will come from taxes and fees on insurers, plan administrators, and employers, while nearly half will be derived from taxes on high-income taxpayers starting in 2013. These taxes, including a Medicare payroll tax and a tax on unearned income, are expected to raise $18 billion in revenue in 2013. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes additional payroll taxes on high-income workers to finance Medicare Hospital Insurance. A 0.9% tax is imposed on wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. This tax only applies to income above these thresholds, increasing the payroll tax from 1.45% to 2.35% for high earners. The revenues generated will be credited to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Additionally, ACA imposes a tax on net investment income for households above specified income thresholds. The law imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for taxable years after December 31, 2012, based on MAGI exceeding $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for single filers. ATRA did not change ACA taxes on higher-income filers. Congress may reconsider provisions extended in ATRA before they expire, including automatic spending reductions from the Budget Control Act of 2011. At the end of 2013, unemployment provisions, the farm bill, the \"doc fix,\" and tax extenders are set to expire. Congress will also address appropriations and the debt limit in early 2013. A funding gap may occur after March 27, 2013, if further appropriations are not provided, leading to a government shutdown. Shutdowns in the past have resulted in furloughs and reduced government activities. The debt limit for the federal government needs to be increased in early 2013 to meet existing obligations. Treasury Secretary Geithner warned that the current limit would be reached on December 31, 2012, and certain measures can be taken to extend it for two more months. Negotiations in 2011 led to the passage of the BCA, which included a debt limit increase and deficit reduction provisions. Some in Congress want a similar agreement for the next increase. The current debt limit of $16.394 trillion needs to be increased to meet existing obligations. Treasury may need to sell debt due to seasonal fluctuations even if the annual federal debt subject to limit does not increase. Budget analysts are concerned about future levels of federal debt and the need to reduce deficits. For more information on the debt limit and potential consequences, refer to CRS Report R41633 and CRS Report RL31967. Some economists warn that reducing the deficit now could harm the economic recovery. Uncertainty over the \"fiscal cliff\" led to reduced spending by individuals, businesses, and governments. While the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) addressed some tax and spending issues, it did not ensure fiscal sustainability. The effects of policies like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are diminishing, and full employment may not be reached until FY2018. ATRA is expected to boost short-term economic growth. While ATRA is expected to boost short-term economic growth, ongoing large budget deficits could dampen long-term economic growth. Unresolved policy issues affecting the federal budget include increases in mandatory spending due to rising healthcare costs and an aging population. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in spending other than Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Achieving budget sustainability would necessitate less spending, increased revenue collections, faster economic growth, or a combination of these measures. High debt levels resulting from increases in revenue collections, faster economic growth, or a combination of these factors can strain budgets with high interest payments. This could limit the government's flexibility in meeting obligations or responding to citizens' needs."
