    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Coal Power Initiative Act of 2001\". Congress acknowledges the importance of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to power the growing economy. Coal, the most abundant fossil energy resource in the US, currently generates over half of the country's electricity and can supply the nation for 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in emissions control technology for coal-based electricity generation have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years, despite a nearly tripled use of coal. Continued research towards near-zero emissions is crucial for environmental improvement in coal-based generation. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a program on research, development, and application of clean coal technologies to achieve cost and performance-based goals. The Secretary will establish measurable cost and performance-based goals for energy programs based on scientific knowledge and environmental impacts. Consultation with various stakeholders will be conducted to set these goals. The Secretary will issue draft measurable cost and performance-based goals for energy programs in the Federal Register for public comment. Final goals will be transmitted to Congress and published after considering public feedback. The final measurable cost and performance-based goals for energy programs will be updated biennially. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes $200 million annually from 2002 to 2011 for research. Additionally, $172 million for 2002, $179 million for 2003, and $186 million for 2004 are allocated for other coal and related technologies programs. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes annual funding for research on innovative technologies for demonstration, transportation fuels and chemicals, solid fuels and feedstocks, advanced fuels research, and advanced research. No funds can be used after September 30, 2002, without the Secretary transmitting a required report to Congress. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes annual funding for research on innovative technologies for demonstration, transportation fuels, and chemicals, solid fuels, and feedstocks, advanced fuels research, and advanced research. The detailed plan should include how proposals will be solicited and evaluated, technical milestones, recoupment of Federal funding for successful projects, and measures to avoid problems identified in General Accounting Office reports on the Clean Coal Technology Program. The Clean Coal Power Initiative authorizes annual funding for research on innovative technologies for demonstration, transportation fuels, and chemicals, solid fuels, and feedstocks. The plan should detail how proposals will be solicited and evaluated, technical milestones for each technology, and how programs will complement each other. Subsection (c) does not apply to programs started before September 30, 2001. SEC. 6. PROJECT CRITERIA. The Secretary will not fund coal research that does not significantly improve efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness. At least 80% of funds for the Clean Coal Power Initiative must be used for carbon sequestration or coal-based gasification projects. Technical milestones will be set by the Secretary. The Secretary will set technical milestones for coal gasification projects to achieve specific emissions levels by 2020, including sulfur dioxide removal, NOx emissions limits, mercury removal, and thermal efficiency targets. For other projects, emissions milestones will also be established by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish technical milestones for coal gasification projects to achieve emissions targets by 2020, including sulfur dioxide, NOx, mercury removal, and thermal efficiency goals. Recipients of funding must demonstrate financial viability without additional federal support. The Secretary will establish technical milestones for coal gasification projects to achieve emissions targets by 2020. Recipients of additional Federal funding must provide sufficient information for efficient use of funds and demonstrate a market for the technology. The Federal share of the cost for coal or related technology projects shall not exceed 50 percent."
