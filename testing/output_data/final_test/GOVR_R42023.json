    "content": "The report discusses the U.S. wind turbine manufacturing industry, employment trends, federal policy efforts, and future challenges. The American Wind Energy Association reported significant growth in employment in the industry, with jobs ranging from $30,000 to $90,000. Despite a period of growth, fewer wind turbines were installed in 2011 compared to previous years. The U.S. wind turbine manufacturing industry is dominated by foreign manufacturers like Vestas, Gamesa, and Siemens, with Japanese, Indian, South Korean, and Chinese companies also entering the market. Federal interest in the industry aims to increase clean energy technology, promote advanced manufacturing, and diversify energy sources. The U.S. wind turbine industry benefits from government incentives, such as the production tax credit (PTC) and state renewable portfolio standards. These policies support the development of a domestic wind energy manufacturing base. The U.S. wind energy manufacturing base is supported by power adoption and government incentives. Many international wind turbine manufacturers have opened facilities in the U.S. since 2005, leading to a significant increase in manufacturing facilities by 2011. These facilities produce various wind-related components for industrial use, including blades, towers, and nacelles. The U.S. wind energy manufacturing base has seen growth with international manufacturers setting up facilities in the country. Export of wind turbines from the U.S. reached $250 million in 2011. However, the future of the industry without government support is uncertain due to higher costs compared to other power sources. The future of wind turbine manufacturing in the U.S. looks promising as technological advancements may make wind cost-competitive with coal and gas for electricity generation. Wind turbine manufacturing is a significant contributor to U.S. heavy manufacturing, with over 38,000 turbines installed by the end of 2011. Procurement of wind turbines makes up a large portion of expenses for wind energy developers. Offshore wind power potential is not covered in the report, with no projects installed in the U.S. yet due to challenges with permitting, financing, and infrastructure availability. The U.S. faces challenges with permitting, financing, and infrastructure for offshore wind projects. Cape Wind is the only commercial project with a lease. In 2011, there were 15 proposed projects and a transmission line. The DOE awarded $28 billion in grants to seven projects in 2012. Small wind turbine manufacturing is growing globally, with over 330 manufacturers. AWEA does not cover turbines with capacities of 100 kW or less. The development of U.S. commercial wind turbine manufacturing can be traced back to the 1970s in response to oil crises. California was an early adopter of wind energy policies, creating a market for American suppliers like Enertech, U.S. Windpower, and Zond. Other manufacturers included Westinghouse and Boeing. In 1986, 60 U.S. firms produced turbines. In the mid-1980s, the California wind energy market experienced a collapse due to a drop in oil prices and reduced government tax credits. This led to many wind turbine manufacturers going bankrupt as the industry adjusted to a smaller market. Annual installed wind power capacity in the United States slowed from 1987 to 2000, with the U.S. wind fleet exceeding 1,000 megawatts for the first time in 1986. In the 1990s, wind power market grew overseas with government incentives supporting manufacturers in Europe. This led to the establishment of wind turbine manufacturers in countries like Denmark, Spain, and Germany. The U.S. saw a significant increase in wind power capacity from 9,000 MW in 2005 to over 46,000 MW in 2011, becoming second to China in installed capacity. The United States ranked second to China in cumulative and new installed wind power capacity in 2011, accounting for over 45% of global capacity. Despite being an attractive investment location for wind turbine manufacturers, the future outlook is uncertain due to factors like the fate of the PTC, low-cost natural gas, and manufacturing overcapacity. Major customers for wind turbine manufacturers are large independent power producers and utilities, with a small share of the market going to universities and military bases. Commercial utility-scale onshore wind turbines are installed at wind farms, with over 975 wind farms in the United States. Texas leads in wind energy output, with California also hosting large wind farms. Some U.S. wind farms are owned by overseas companies like E.ON Climate and Renewables. In 2011, 10 wind turbine manufacturers dominated the global market, with Vestas, Goldwind, and GE being the top three. These manufacturers are headquartered in Europe, the United States, India, and China, with some focusing exclusively on wind turbines while others are part of larger diversified companies. Many operate manufacturing facilities worldwide, including in the United States, Europe, and China. Chinese companies have also entered the market, primarily selling in China. China has become a major player in the wind turbine manufacturing industry, with over 270 producers capable of producing complete systems. Some Chinese firms are looking to expand into overseas markets, but concerns about quality may limit foreign sales. South Korean companies, such as Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries, are also investing in wind turbine production. South Korean firms like Daewoo, Hanjin, and STX are involved in wind turbine technology development. Korean manufacturers like Doosan and Hyosung are important suppliers of wind turbine components. In the United States, nearly two dozen manufacturers installed 3,500 new turbines in 2011, generating 6,800 MW of new capacity. Since the inception of utility-scale wind energy production, over 40,000 turbines have been installed in the US. In 2011, U.S. electric generators installed over 40,000 turbines with 52,000 MW capacity. GE led in new wind turbine installations, but its market share declined. Wind turbines convert wind energy to electricity, with blades ranging from 34 to 55 meters and towers 80-100 meters tall. Industrial manufacturers supplied components for over 5,700 turbines in 2009, including 17,000 blades, 3.2 million bolts, 36,000 miles of rebar, and 1.7 million cubic yards of concrete. The major components of a wind turbine include the rotor (blade, blade extender, hub, pitch drive system), nacelle (housing controller, gearbox, generator, bearings, shafts, electronic components), tower (support system), and other components like transformers and circuit breakers. Subcomponents make up the rest of the turbine. The tower accounts for over 26% of the total cost, rotor blades 22%, and other components make up the remaining costs. The tower, rotor blades, gearbox, and other components make up the major costs of a wind turbine. Wind turbines have increased in size over the years, with most land-based ones falling in the 1.5 MW to 3 MW range. European and U.S. manufacturers have invested in improving turbine technology, leading to more efficient blades and longer turbine life. New manufacturers, especially from China, are not yet competitive due to technology limitations and quality control issues. Wind turbines are primarily made of steel, aluminum, and other materials like concrete, copper, and fiberglass. OEMs design and assemble turbines, bringing together around 8,000 precision parts. Suppliers contribute components like steel plates for towers and turbine blades. Wind turbines are made of various materials like steel, aluminum, concrete, copper, and fiberglass. OEMs design and assemble turbines with around 8,000 precision parts. Suppliers provide components such as steel plates for towers and turbine blades. The global supply chain involves multiple companies producing different parts like towers, blades, and control systems. Tier 1 suppliers make large components while Tier 2 suppliers produce subassemblies. A wind turbine is a significant investment. Wind turbines are a significant investment, with transaction prices ranging from $900/kW to $1,400/kW. Assemblers use different sourcing strategies, with some producing major components internally and others outsourcing. Various companies make specialized parts like clutches, bearings, fasteners, sensors, and gears for the wind industry. Wind turbine suppliers require high levels of expertise and specialization similar to the aerospace industry. Manufacturers establish quality relationships with suppliers to prevent expensive repairs. Turbines are designed to withstand extreme conditions for up to 20 years. Product quality is crucial for wind farm operators to maintain revenue. The American Wind Energy Association reported a significant increase in wind turbine manufacturing facilities in the United States by the end of 2011. Since 2005, the wind industry in the United States has seen a significant increase in manufacturing facilities for wind turbines and components. The number of tower plants, blade facilities, and nacelle assembly facilities have all grown substantially. Total investment in these facilities has exceeded $1.5 billion. Wind turbine manufacturers have opened new production facilities in the US due to greater demand, cost savings in transportation, and concerns about currency fluctuations. Despite increased domestic production capacity, wind turbine assemblers still source parts globally. Towers and blades were among the first products manufactured in the US due to their size, cost, and transport challenges. Manufacturers in the United States find it easier and less costly to fabricate wind turbine components near their installation point. Many tower manufacturers in the US are American companies, while foreign manufacturers like Gamesa and Vestas also have facilities in the country. In 2012, major tower producers like Otter Tail Corporation and DMI Industries scaled back production. Blade suppliers have increased their US manufacturing capacity, with companies like LM Wind Power producing blades at US facilities. European and American companies have established manufacturing facilities for wind turbine components in the United States, including blade manufacturers like TPI Composites and Molded Fiberglass. After the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, European OEMs like Gamesa, Nordex, Siemens, and Vestas invested heavily in nacelle assembly plants in the US. GE has nacelle assembly facilities established before 2005, while Asian manufacturers have been slower in establishing a presence in the US market. Mitsubishi and Suzlon have delayed or reduced their nacelle manufacturing presence in the US. Foreign-based wind turbine assemblers are investing in domestic manufacturing of components like gearboxes and bearings, critical for turbine operation. Bearings are produced by companies like FAG and Timken. In the wind industry, manufacturers like FAG and Timken produce gearboxes, while Winergy (now part of Siemens) established U.S. production capacity in Illinois in 2009. Other companies also have wind-related production facilities in the United States, but falling natural gas prices and uncertainty over the PTC have impacted manufacturers' interest in expanding. In 2011, 16 new turbine and component manufacturing facilities opened in the U.S., compared to 13 in 2010. In 2012, some wind manufacturers delayed new factory plans or expansions, leading to workforce reductions. Tower, blade, and nacelle assembly plants are concentrated in central U.S. states like Texas, Iowa, and Colorado, near favorable wind power sites. Incentives like tax abatements and low-interest loans attract wind turbine assemblers to states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio. In 2011, wind turbine manufacturing sector supported 30,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, with majority of workers in finance, consulting, engineering, and project development. Manufacturing jobs remained flat over the past three years despite a decline in total wind energy employment. In 2011, wind turbine manufacturing sector supported 30,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide. AWEA projects potential growth to 80,000 jobs with stable policies in place. Imports of wind-powered generating sets, including fully assembled wind turbines and components like blades and hubs, grew significantly from $482.5 million in 2005 to a peak of $2.5 billion in 2008. However, imports dropped to $1.2 billion in 2010 before rising slightly in 2011. The decline in U.S. imports of wind-powered generating sets was attributed to various factors, including changes in global business strategies and manufacturing decisions. The recent decline in U.S. imports of wind-powered generating sets is due to fewer wind turbine installations, decreasing prices, and the opening of new production facilities in the United States. The majority of imported wind-powered generating sets come from Europe, with Denmark being the leading source in 2011. South Korean wind turbine manufacturers like Samsung, Hyosung, and Unison aim to become leading exporters to the U.S. market and other global markets. China, despite being home to many wind energy manufacturers, exported only a small number of wind turbines in 2011. Chinese wind turbine manufacturers, including Goldwind, Sinovel, United Power, and Mingyang, are looking to expand their foreign sales. Between 2008 and 2011, 11 Chinese OEMs exported 194 wind turbines, with the United States accounting for 59% of installations. European turbine assemblers like Vestas are considering opening plants in China to supply the Chinese market. Concerns about the quality of Chinese-made turbines have slowed adoption, but this may change as Chinese products improve and more foreign manufacturers establish operations in China. China's efforts to promote wind turbine manufacturing have caused tensions in the bilateral relationship. In September 2010, China's green technology policies were deemed violations of WTO obligations. Following a U.S. complaint, China agreed to end a program of wind power equipment grants requiring the use of domestic parts. Additionally, the U.S. wind tower industry filed anti-dumping petitions against Chinese and Vietnamese makers, alleging harm to U.S. producers. The U.S. wind tower industry filed anti-dumping petitions against Chinese and Vietnamese makers, alleging harm to U.S. producers. In May 2012, DOC ruled that Chinese exporters of utility scale wind towers are being unfairly subsidized and announced preliminary CVD rates. Final determinations are scheduled for early 2013, which may impact tower imports from China to the United States. U.S. imports of wind-related equipment followed a similar pattern, with increases from 2005 to 2008, a drop in 2009 and 2010, and a rise in 2011. In 2011, China, Mexico, Vietnam, and South Korea were main sources of imported wind turbine components. U.S. content in wind turbines has increased to nearly 70%, with parts manufactured domestically doubling from 35% in 2005-2006 to 67% in 2011. Public statements by major wind turbine assemblers support the use of U.S.-made components. The U.S.-made wind turbines now have a larger share of domestic content, with major assemblers reporting percentages of 65-80%. The 2011 Wind Technologies Market Report highlights the increasing use of domestically sourced equipment in wind power projects. The future growth of the U.S. wind turbine industry depends on both domestic and foreign markets. In 2010, the Obama Administration set a goal to increase renewable energy exports like wind turbines. U.S. exports of wind-powered generating sets were $255 million in 2011, up from $3.6 million in 2005. U.S. producers may look to foreign markets due to market uncertainty and overcapacity domestically. The Western Hemisphere, especially Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, could offer export opportunities for U.S.-based wind turbine equipment manufacturers. Brazil is the largest market in Latin America for wind power, providing export opportunities for U.S. producers. Wind turbine assemblers like GE and Gamesa are localizing production in Brazil. Other growing markets in Central and South America include Honduras, Uruguay, and Chile. U.S. manufacturers face challenges such as import tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and domestic industry subsidies in overseas markets like China. Tariff rates in major markets are higher than in the U.S., with Brazil at 14%, China at 8%, India at 7.5%, and the EU at 2.7%. The U.S. faces challenges in exporting renewable energy products due to subsidies and non-tariff barriers in overseas markets like China. Government programs, such as direct loans from the Export-Import Bank, support exports of wind turbines. The wind power industry globally relies on government incentives like tax credits and feed-in tariffs, with larger incentives in foreign countries compared to the U.S. Many countries, especially in Europe, are reducing subsidies for renewables like wind power. Feed-in tariffs have been key in promoting wind energy growth in Europe, but some countries are now cutting back on these incentives due to fiscal challenges. For example, Spain announced a 35% reduction in wind subsidies from 2011 to 2013. This has led to a more critical evaluation of renewable energy policies in some European countries. Some global wind turbine manufacturers, like Vestas and Gamesa, have downsized operations to stay competitive. China's Renewable Energy Law, effective since 2006, has driven growth in the domestic market with policies like a feed-in tariff for wind power generation. In the US, federal policies like the production tax credit (PTC)/Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Section 1603 Treasury Cash Grant Program have supported the development of a domestically based wind power sector. The PTC, Section 1603 Treasury Cash Grant Program, and Section 1705 Loan Guarantee Program have supported the U.S. wind power industry. The industry advocates for a national renewable electricity standard for stability and investment. The PTC, established in 1992, has driven recent industry growth but is not a permanent part of the tax code. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been a key incentive for the U.S. wind industry, driving growth when extended but causing slowdowns when lapsed. The PTC has been extended multiple times, leading to positive industry responses and increased wind power capacity. The annual cost of the PTC is around $1 billion. Most recently, Congress provided a one-year extension of the PTC for wind through December 31, 2013. The PTC for wind was extended through December 31, 2013, providing a 2.2 cents per kWh tax benefit over 10 years. Wind farms must start construction by the end of 2013 to qualify. Developers can opt for a 30% investment tax credit instead. AWEA advocates for a six-year phase-out of the PTC, while the Governors' Wind Energy Coalition calls for a multi-year extension of at least four years. The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, known as Section 48C, provided a 30% credit for investments in clean energy manufacturing facilities in the US. 183 projects, including wind, solar, and electric vehicle batteries, were funded before reaching the $2.3 billion cap in 2010. The Obama Administration requested an additional $5 billion for the program. The Security in Energy and Manufacturing Act of 2011 proposed an extension of the tax credit, giving priority to facilities manufacturing goods in the US. The MTC program awarded $364 million in tax credits to 52 wind manufacturing projects in the US. Beneficiaries included manufacturers of wind turbines, blades, towers, and gears. Tax benefits for wind projects included accelerated tax depreciation and bonus depreciation, with the latter allowing for writing off more than 50% of capital costs. The 2010 Tax Act increased first-year bonus depreciation to 100% for new qualified property. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the wind energy tax credit to 2013. The Section 1603 Treasury cash grant program allowed developers to receive a cash payment instead of tax credits for wind projects. Construction had to begin by December 31, 2011, and projects had to be in service by December 31, 2012. The grants were credited with keeping the wind industry healthy during the 2008 and 2009 recession. The Section 1705 loan program, part of the ARRA, provided loan guarantees for renewable energy projects, including wind. It funded 26 projects, with $1.7 billion going to wind projects like Caithness Shepherds Flat. Other wind projects included Kahuku Wind Power, Granite Reliable, and Record Hill Wind. The program did not fund wind turbine manufacturers. State renewable portfolio standards have supported the growth of the U.S. wind energy industry. The U.S. wind energy industry has grown with the help of state renewable portfolio standards, with mandatory programs in 29 states and the District of Columbia. The industry has pushed for a national standard to boost investor confidence, but no such measure has been passed by Congress yet. The expansion of the U.S. wind power manufacturing base will rely on government policy decisions, as production costs appear competitive with other countries. Transporting bulky turbine components over long distances poses a challenge to import competition. The expansion of wind energy manufacturing in the United States faces obstacles such as policy-induced boom-and-bust cycles, transmission challenges, and potential changes in the industry structure. Transmission issues could hinder wind farm creation or expansion, and Congress should assess their seriousness in supporting wind generation efforts. The wind manufacturing industry is undergoing significant change with a large number of companies competing. Mergers and failures are expected to lead to consolidation as the sector matures. Competition from new Asian entrants in the wind turbine sector may increase in the future, but their technological abilities and financial resources to become significant players in the U.S. market remain uncertain."
