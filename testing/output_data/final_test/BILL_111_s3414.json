    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dietary Supplement Full Implementation and Enforcement Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges the significant use and expenditure on dietary supplements by Americans, emphasizing the importance of implementing and enforcing laws for their safety and education. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) was passed to ensure consumer access to supplements while promoting scientific research on their benefits. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) promotes scientific research on the benefits and risks of dietary supplements, requires truthful and substantiated claims on supplement labels, and enforces regulatory safeguards to protect consumer health. DSHEA requires compliance with GMP requirements for dietary supplements and mandates notification to the FDA before marketing supplements with new ingredients. FDA regulations on GMP for supplements were enforced in 2008. The Food and Drug Administration requires notification for new dietary supplement ingredients to ensure safety. Over 70% of notifications have faced objections. The FDA uses DSHEA to remove risky supplements from the market. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Act of 2002 mandates safety measures for facilities handling food. In 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, requiring prompt reporting of serious adverse events associated with dietary supplements to the FDA for safety monitoring. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) created the Office of Dietary Supplements to expand research and consumer information about dietary supplements. While the FDA has made some efforts to enforce DSHEA, more guidance is needed for both the public and the industry. The Food and Drug Administration requires more guidance on regulating new dietary ingredients under DSHEA. Adequate resources are needed to enforce DSHEA and other laws governing dietary supplements, with over $14,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2009. The Food and Drug Administration stated that full implementation of DSHEA and other laws regulating dietary supplements would require between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 per year. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Food and Drug Administration should increase efforts to fully implement and enforce DSHEA by providing cost estimates and conducting inspections of dietary supplement facilities to ensure compliance with regulations. The Food and Drug Administration should enforce DSHEA regulations, protect the public from unsafe dietary supplements, and prioritize cases of law violations. They should also implement recommendations from a 2009 report to improve oversight and consumer understanding. The Food and Drug Administration should require dietary supplement manufacturers to update registration information annually, issue guidance on new dietary ingredients, and coordinate with consumer outreach groups. The Food and Drug Administration should require dietary supplement manufacturers to update registration information annually, issue guidance on new dietary ingredients, and coordinate with consumer outreach groups. Additionally, they should notify the Drug Enforcement Administration if a new dietary ingredient notification is inadequate to establish safety due to the potential presence of anabolic steroids. Manufacturers, packers, retailers, and distributors of dietary supplements should comply with DSHEA and cooperate with the FDA for enforcement of laws and regulations. They should also report any violations to the FDA. Authorization of appropriations and allocation of resources. Authorization of appropriations for the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and allocation of funds for implementation and enforcement. $30,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2011 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2012-2014. $20,000,000 from FDA funds for fiscal year 2010 to enforce related provisions. Authorization for the Office of Dietary Supplements. The Office of Dietary Supplements is authorized to receive $40,000,000 for research and development of consumer information on dietary supplements for fiscal year 2010, and necessary funds for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. SEC. 5. ANNUAL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT ON THE REGULATION OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The report includes details on funding and personnel dedicated to dietary supplement regulation and adverse event reporting systems within the Food and Drug Administration. The annual report to Congress includes details on funding and personnel dedicated to enforcement of dietary supplement labeling and claims, review and enforcement of good manufacturing practice requirements, and compliance inspections by the Food and Drug Administration in the prior fiscal year. The Food and Drug Administration issues warning letters for non-compliance with requirements, reviews new dietary ingredient notifications, objects to marketing of supplements, and enforces actions for failure to file notifications. The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services took enforcement actions related to dietary supplements in the prior fiscal year, including requesting substantiation of claims, identifying false or misleading claims, and conducting research and consumer education activities. The Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institutes of Health conducted research and consumer education activities in the prior fiscal year. Recommendations for improving the regulation of dietary supplements and any other relevant information determined appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Commissioner of Food and Drugs were also included. SEC. 6. NEW DIETARY INGREDIENTS. Guidelines for introducing new dietary ingredients under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are amended to clarify when a dietary supplement ingredient is new, requirements for providing information to the Secretary, evidence needed for safety, and methods for establishing ingredient identity. If a new dietary ingredient notification is deemed inadequate to establish the safety of a dietary supplement due to potential presence of anabolic steroids, the Secretary will notify the Drug Enforcement Administration, providing product and marketer details. The Secretary will notify the Drug Enforcement Administration about any dietary supplements containing anabolic steroids or analogues, as defined by the Controlled Substances Act."
