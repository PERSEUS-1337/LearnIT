    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation Act of 1994\". The Congress found that the village of Anaktuvuk Pass is surrounded by national park and wilderness lands, and is the only village within a National Park System unit in Alaska. The residents rely on snow machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer for access to subsistence resources. In 1983, linear easements were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for all-terrain vehicle access across certain national park lands, but proved inadequate for accessing subsistence resources and caused environmental impact. Discussions in 1985 led to an agreement in 1992, amended in 1993 and 1994, between the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass to address concerns over ATV use on park and wilderness land. An agreement was reached in 1992, amended in 1993 and 1994, involving the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, pending Congress ratification. The agreement reached in 1992, involving various parties, is pending Congress ratification. The terms, conditions, procedures, covenants, reservations, and provisions of the Agreement executed in 1992 are ratified and confirmed by Congress, outlining the obligations of the United States, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass. Lands acquired by the United States under this Agreement will be administered accordingly. The Agreement executed in 1992 is ratified by Congress, with lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Maps depict lands subject to conveyances, access rights, and easements, with legal descriptions to be prepared. Legal descriptions of lands will be prepared and available in specified offices, with Map No. 185/80,039 controlling in case of discrepancies. SEC. 4. NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM WILDERNESS. The Gates of the Arctic Wilderness in Alaska is amended to approximately 7,034,832 acres, with the addition of 56,825 acres and the rescission of 73,993 acres. The lands are depicted on a map titled \"Wilderness Actions, Proposed Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve\". SEC. 5. CONFORMANCE WITH OTHER LAW. The lands conveyed under the Agreement are subject to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and valid existing rights. The Agreement does not affect the rights of individuals, except as specified, including subsistence uses under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act."
