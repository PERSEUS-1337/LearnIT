The Act \"Thrift Charter Conversion Tax Act of 1995\" repeals Section 593 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and makes amendments to various other sections of the Code, including sections 291, 585, 595, 596, and 860E. The Act \"Thrift Charter Conversion Tax Act of 1995\" repeals Section 593 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and makes amendments to various other sections of the Code. The amendments made by the \"Thrift Charter Conversion Tax Act of 1995\" apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995. Changes in computing reserves for bad debts are treated as a method of accounting change with the consent of the Secretary. The adjustments required under section 481(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are determined by applicable excess reserves and taken into account ratably over a 6-taxable year period starting after December 31, 1995. Applicable excess reserves refer to the excess balance of reserves described in section 593(c)(1) of the Code. The balance of reserves under section 593(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code as of the taxpayer's last taxable year before January 1, 1996, is compared to the balance before January 1, 1988. Special rules apply to banks transitioning from thrifts to small banks after December 31, 1995. The balance considered under subparagraph (A)(ii) must be at least the balance of the reserve as of the last taxable year before January 1, 1996, if additions had been determined under section 585(b)(2)(A) of the Code. The opening balance of the bad debts reserve at the beginning of the first taxable year is the balance from subparagraph (A)(ii) after adjustments. The preceding sentence does not apply to paragraphs (4), (5), and (6). If a taxpayer meets the residential loan requirement, no adjustment will be made for that taxable year under paragraph (1), and that year will not be considered for determining adjustments in other taxable years under paragraph (1). The residential loan requirement states that a taxpayer must meet certain criteria regarding the principal amount of residential loans made during a taxable year or the two preceding years to avoid adjustments under paragraph (1). The residential loan requirement determines if a taxpayer meets the criteria for residential loans made in the past six taxable years before January 1, 1996. The residential loan requirement applies to loans made in the past six taxable years before January 1, 1996. An election can be made for the first taxable year after December 31, 1995, and will apply to all succeeding years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. Inflation adjustment of the base amount is required for taxable years after 1996. The cost-of-living adjustment for calendar year 1995 is multiplied by the determined amount for taxpayers in controlled groups. Transitional rules apply for taxpayers not classified as large banks under section 585(c)(2) of the Code. For taxable years starting after December 31, 1995, adjustments to bad debt reserves are limited to the excess over the previous year's reserve balance. The balance for elective cut-off method purposes is reduced by the amount taken into account under subparagraph (B). For taxable years starting after December 31, 1995, adjustments to bad debt reserves are limited to the excess over the previous year's reserve balance. The balance for elective cut-off method purposes is reduced by the amount taken into account under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection. No amount shall be included in gross income by reason of such reduction. Continued application of section 593(e) applies to taxpayers under paragraph (1) of this subsection, with the reserve amount considered being the balance taken into account under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection. The balance of excess reserves and amounts considered under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) shall be treated as section 381(c) items. Regulations will be prescribed for the application of these rules in mergers and reorganizations. SEC. 3. DEDUCTION FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. The deduction under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code for a taxable year includes the amount paid as a special assessment under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
