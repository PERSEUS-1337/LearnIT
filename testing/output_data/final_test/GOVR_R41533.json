    "content": "The nation's schools' effectiveness is a concern at all government levels, with a focus on providing quality public education to all students. Federal education policies have historically emphasized inputs like teacher development and class-size reduction, but there is a growing interest in policies that prioritize student outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 reflects this shift towards focusing on student achievement. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) expanded the federal government's role in supporting standards-based instruction and test-based accountability. The 112th Congress may reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and address issues such as consistency in state standards, consequences for failing to meet academic targets, and incorporating outcomes-based accountability in teacher evaluations. The report discusses the federal government's evolving role in supporting state and local accountability for elementary and secondary education, focusing on the changes made during reauthorization. It examines the accountability requirements in the NCLB and the authority of the Secretary of Education to make changes to the ESEA. The report discusses changes to the ESEA that may reauthorize parts of it and focuses on NCLB implementation issues and the evolving federal role in education. Federal education policy has historically aimed at equity, serving disadvantaged students to close the achievement gap. Other policies like IDEA and Title IX also prioritize equity in education. The federal government has focused on providing equity in education, pushing states and LEAs to offer equal opportunities for all students. The role of the federal government shifted in the early 1990s towards standards and assessments, in addition to equity. The report examines this evolution starting with the standards-based reform movement and the reauthorization of the ESEA in 1994. Education reform in the 1980s included top-down initiatives imposed on schools. The 1980s education reform was characterized by \"top-down\" initiatives imposed on schools from the state level, including increased graduation requirements, longer school days, and higher teaching standards. This wave of reform had little positive impact on student achievement. In response, a second wave of reform focused on empowerment, variation, and \"bottom-up\" decision making to improve educational success at the school level. This included greater school autonomy, increased competition, and a shift towards individual school improvement. In the 1980s, education reform shifted towards greater school autonomy, increased competition, and a greater role for parents in decision-making. A third approach in some states combined top-down and bottom-up strategies for system-wide reform guided by educational goals and standards at each level of governance. This reform was aimed at addressing needs and problems at all levels of the education system simultaneously. In the 1980s, education reform focused on increased state activity in education, driven by the introduction of education-related bills, higher state aid, and the establishment of task forces. This surge in state involvement was influenced by improved policymaking capacities, growing state tax bases, and the impact of A Nation At Risk report. A pivotal moment occurred in 1989 when President George H. W. Bush and state governors, including Bill Clinton, endorsed National Education Goals at the first national education summit conference, marking a shift in federal involvement in standards-based reform. The National Education Goals were established to provide a framework for restructuring federal involvement in education. Policymakers set six goals and emphasized the importance of measuring progress towards these goals. This led to the creation of standards for student knowledge and performance, as well as assessments to measure student progress. The National Education Goals Panel was formed to monitor progress at the national and state levels. This initiative culminated in the enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act in 1994, representing a structured federal role in education reform. The Goals 2000 legislation codified eight National Education Goals to be achieved by 2000, including starting all children ready to learn, increasing high school graduation rates, providing professional development for teachers, and ensuring schools are free of drugs and violence. The Goals 2000 legislation established eight National Education Goals, including ensuring all adults are literate, schools are free of drugs and violence, and promoting parental involvement in education. Three types of education standards were addressed - curriculum content, student performance, and Opportunity-to-Learn standards. Title II authorized the creation of NEGP and NESIC to oversee the standards effort, with NEGP reporting on progress towards the goals and assisting in creating a national consensus on needed reforms. Title III authorized a grant program to support state standards-based reform. Title III authorized a grant program to support state standards-based reform by financing the development of state reform plans addressing teaching, learning, assessments, parental and community support, and education management. It required state plans to include processes for developing content and performance standards, state assessments, aligning curricula with standards, and providing teachers with information about the standards. The program also included two waiver authorities allowing the Secretary to waive regulations for states or LEAs undertaking reform activities. Under the Ed-Flex waiver authority, up to six states could waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements for major education programs. Goals 2000 legislation sparked controversy over the federal role in education, focusing on central functions of state and local educational systems. Debate centered on whether the legislation aimed to centralize federal efforts. The reauthorization of the ESEA in 1994 through the Improving America's Schools Act (IASA) continued the federal focus on standards-based reform by inserting provisions related to standards and assessments in Title I-A. Title I-A authorizes federal grants to LEAs to provide educational services to low-achieving children in schools with concentrations of students from low-income families. The IASA aimed to raise instructional standards and academic expectations for participating students. IASA aimed to raise instructional standards and academic expectations for participating students in Title I programs by tying instruction to state-selected content and performance standards. Title I tests and evaluations were made more meaningful and less time consuming by using state-developed or state-adopted assessments aligned with the standards to determine program effectiveness. Schools and LEAs were assessed based on \"adequate yearly progress\" towards meeting the standards, with results used to implement program improvement requirements and provide rewards or corrective actions. States were required to develop or adopt content and performance standards, as well as aligned assessments, to receive Title I-A funds. Under IASA, states were required to adopt standards and assessments in reading and mathematics at three grade levels. States had to develop or adopt curriculum content standards to receive Title I-A funds. Under IASA, states had to develop or adopt curriculum content standards, academic achievement standards, and assessments tied to the standards. Performance standards had to establish three levels for all students\u2014advanced, proficient, and partially proficient. Assessment systems had to include all students in the assessed grades who had attended schools in the LEA for at least one year. Limited English proficient students were to be assessed in the language most likely to yield accurate information. Adaptations and accommodations were required for students with diverse learning needs, including LEP students and students with disabilities. The assessment system under IASA had to produce results disaggregated by various student demographics and be included in annual school profiles. The Secretary had limited authority in enforcing standards and assessment requirements, with states not required to link to national standards or submit their standards to the U.S. Department of Education. ED was prohibited from disapproving a state plan based on specific standards or assessments, and could not mandate, direct, or control a state's education system. Under IASA, states had until the 2000-2001 school year to develop or adopt content and performance standards for reading and mathematics, with aligned assessments required by that time. The full system of standards and assessments was mandated to be in place by the 2000-2001 school year, with state standards from Title III of Goals 2000 considered to meet Title I-A standards requirements. Under Title III of Goals 2000, states were required to meet Title I-A standards under IASA. By March 2000, all but two states had adopted content standards, but only about half had approved performance standards. IASA did not initiate federal efforts to hold states and LEAs accountable for student performance under Title I-A, as requirements for reporting academic progress have been in place since the ESEA was enacted in 1965. Subsequent evaluations found that LEAs were not effectively implementing testing systems. The IASA addressed concerns about Title I programs, including low academic challenge, perpetuating low expectations for disadvantaged students, lack of integration with regular instructional programs, and ineffective student testing. The accountability requirements in Title I-A aimed to improve academic standards and assessments. The IASA expanded on the accountability requirements of the NCLB, including the implementation of standards and assessments in reading, mathematics, and science at multiple grade levels. The IASA expanded on the accountability requirements of the NCLB, including the implementation of standards and assessments in reading, mathematics, and science at multiple grade levels. Academic achievement standards must include three levels of performance: partially proficient (basic), proficient, and advanced, with assessments aligned to state standards. State accountability systems must be uniform for all public schools, incorporating rewards and sanctions based on student performance. LEP students should be assessed in the language most likely to yield accurate information on their academic abilities. The ESEA requires students in the US to be assessed in English after attending school for three or more consecutive years. Reasonable accommodations are provided for students with disabilities. The Secretary's authority to enforce standards and assessments is limited, and states cannot be mandated to submit their standards for approval. The ESEA does not require states to submit their content or achievement standards for approval by the federal government to receive funds. State plans cannot be disapproved based on specific standards or assessment items. AYP requirements under NCLB identify schools with inadequate performance for support and intervention. The NCLB requires schools failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years to face consequences such as transferring to another school or receiving supplemental educational services. AYP is determined based on student academic achievement in state reading and math assessments. The NCLB requires schools to meet AYP standards based on student academic achievement in state assessments, with a focus on proficiency levels, student participation rates, and graduation rates. AYP calculations must be disaggregated for various demographic groups like economically disadvantaged students, LEP students, students with disabilities, and different racial and ethnic groups. The NCLB requirements have led to the reporting of data by student subgroups, revealing achievement gaps between minority students and white students, LEP students and non-LEP students, students with and without disabilities, and economically disadvantaged students. This has spurred attention at state and local levels to address the academic needs of underserved students, aligning with the primary goal of ESEA. Changes to ESEA have ensured that all students are held to the same academically challenging standards. The ESEA requires states to set annual measurable objectives for reading and math assessments, ensuring all students meet proficient levels by a set timeline. The ESEA requires states to set annual measurable objectives for reading and math assessments to ensure all students reach proficiency by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. This was in response to pre-NCLB AYP requirements that showed little improvement in student performance over time. NCLB increased federal involvement in student assessment and learning, emphasizing equity in education policy. Federal requirements pressure states to have one set of expectations for all students and publicly report results for historically disadvantaged groups. The NCLB requires states to identify schools that fail to meet AYP standards for program improvement and take further actions. States are encouraged to establish accountability systems affecting all public schools, but Title I-A statute only requires performance-based measures for schools receiving Title I-A funds. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years are subject to increasingly severe accountability measures and must develop improvement plans with LEA assistance. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years must use 10% of their funding for professional development and offer public school choice to students. Transportation must be provided for transfers, with priority given to low-achieving children from low-income families. Lack of capacity cannot be used as a reason to deny transfer requests. If a school fails to make AYP for two consecutive years, it must allocate 10% of its funding for professional development and offer public school choice to students. Students from low-income families must be given the option to transfer to an eligible public school within the same LEA. Additionally, these students may also receive supplemental educational services like tutoring outside of regular school hours. Supplemental educational services can be provided by non-profit or for-profit entities, or the LEA if deemed unavailable by the SEA. Approved providers are listed by the SEA for parents to choose from. LEAs may use up to 20% of Title I-A grants for transportation related to public school choice and supplemental educational services. Schools failing to make AYP for two years must be identified for corrective action, which includes providing technical assistance, public school choice, and supplemental educational services. If a school fails to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for three years, the Local Education Agency (LEA) must plan for restructuring, which may involve replacing staff, implementing a new curriculum, or changing the school's governance structure. This could include reopening the school as a charter school, replacing staff, or contracting with an education management organization. If a school fails to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for three years, the Local Education Agency (LEA) must plan for restructuring, which may involve replacing staff, implementing a new curriculum, or changing the school's governance structure. This could include reopening the school as a charter school, replacing staff, or contracting with an education management organization. Sanctions may be delayed for up to one year if AYP is met or due to unforeseen circumstances. Schools making AYP for two consecutive years are no longer subject to improvement sanctions. In 2008, a pilot program was announced for states to propose alternative performance-based accountability policies with differentiated consequences. The pilot program announced in 2008 allowed states to propose accountability policies with differentiated consequences for schools failing to make Adequate Yearly Progress. States could categorize schools for improvement, focusing resources and consequences on those with the lowest performance levels. Common characteristics included prioritizing schools for substantial consequences and improvement resources, adjusting consequences based on improvement categories, and narrowing actions to focus on low-performing pupil groups. As the deadline for all students to be proficient in reading and math approaches, more schools are expected to fail to make Adequate Yearly Progress. This could strain states and LEAs in helping these schools. Similar procedures apply to LEAs that receive Title I-A grants and fail to meet AYP requirements. States may choose to focus on Title I-A schools within each LEA for accountability and corrective actions. LEAs receiving Title I-A grants must take corrective actions if they fail to meet state AYP standards for two consecutive years. SEAs provide technical assistance based on research and notify parents of the LEA's status. If an LEA fails for a fourth year, SEAs must implement corrective actions such as reducing funds, changing curriculum, or replacing staff. States participating in ESEA Title I-A must establish an Academic Achievement Awards Program to recognize schools and LEAs that have closed academic achievement gaps or exceeded AYP requirements for consecutive years. Awards may also be given to teachers and principals in these schools. States participating in ESEA Title I-A must establish an Academic Achievement Awards Program to recognize schools and LEAs that have closed academic achievement gaps or exceeded AYP requirements for consecutive years. Financial awards may be given to teachers or principals in these schools. Up to 5% of Title I-A funding can be reserved for Academic Achievement Awards. In the 2008-2009 school year, a significant percentage of public schools and LEAs nationwide failed to make AYP. In the 2008-2009 school year, a significant percentage of public schools and LEAs nationwide failed to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Ten states had over 50% of their public schools fail to make AYP, while 38 states had at least 10% of their LEAs fail to make AYP. The percentage of public schools failing to make AYP varied widely among states, from 5% for Texas to 76.6% for Florida. Additionally, there was variation in the percentage of LEAs making AYP, with some states reporting very low failure rates and others, like West Virginia, having 94.5% of LEAs fail to meet AYP standards. During the 2009-2010 school year, over half of states had at least 20% of Title I-A schools in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. About 28% of Title I-A schools nationwide were identified for improvement, with percentages varying widely by state. Participation rates for public school choice and SES options also varied significantly among states. For example, in the 2008-2009 school year, 2.7% of eligible students opted for public school choice, with rates ranging from less than 0.1% to nearly 80% across states. During the 2009-2010 school year, participation rates for public school choice and SES options varied significantly among states, ranging from less than 1% to over 97%. The Secretary of Education has the authority to alter ESEA requirements through regulatory and waiver authority. Since the reauthorization of the ESEA in 2002, the Secretary has used regulatory authority to make substantive changes to program requirements, including expanding federal regulation and allowing flexibility through waivers. New regulations under Section 9401 of ESEA Title I-A in October 2008 expanded requirements for high school graduation rates, AYP determinations, school choice, and supplemental educational services. Waivers were granted for growth models of AYP and differentiated consequences for schools not meeting AYP. In 2009, 351 waivers were issued, with over half granted to LEAs and schools for Title I-A fund treatment. The Secretary has the authority to grant waivers for Title I-A funds under the ARRA, with a trend towards Administration initiatives influencing accountability requirements. This could lead to changes in accountability requirements regardless of ESEA reauthorization, especially as many schools are already failing to make AYP. The Secretary has the authority to grant waivers for Title I-A funds under the ARRA, with a trend towards Administration initiatives influencing accountability requirements. This could lead to changes in accountability requirements regardless of ESEA reauthorization, especially as many schools are already failing to make AYP. Federal involvement in public K-12 education is more extensive now, but the federal contribution to public K-12 education revenues is relatively small. Congress may decide whether to continue this active involvement in the ESEA reauthorization. In considering the ESEA reauthorization, Congress may choose to expand federal involvement in K-12 education through increased assessment or other requirements, or limit federal involvement. A hybrid approach could involve federal requirements on student outcomes with fewer restrictions on grant fund usage. The role of common standards and assessments in reauthorization is uncertain, with a potential tradeoff. The report discusses issues related to the implementation of NCLB and potential considerations for ESEA reauthorization. Policy issues include data comparability, state accountability systems, consequences for schools not meeting AYP, instructional focus, and teacher evaluation. NCLB's accountability requirements marked significant federal involvement in school performance. The NCLB led to federal involvement in school accountability, resulting in over 50 different state accountability systems. This diversity makes it challenging to compare student performance across states and assess the overall impact of the NCLB. The NCLB has led to federal involvement in school accountability, resulting in diverse state accountability systems. It is difficult to determine the direct impact of NCLB on student achievement due to various state initiatives and programs. Questions arise about the effectiveness of state accountability systems in ensuring academic success for students. The United States does not have a national test for student knowledge, but states receiving Title I-A funds must participate in the NAEP. State accountability systems often label more students as proficient than NAEP results indicate. A study found that no state's reading standards matched NAEP proficiency levels, with only Massachusetts and South Carolina aligning in math proficiency. Researchers have developed a method for mapping each state's proficiency standards in reading and math onto the NAEP scale to compare performance standards. States with higher standards had fewer students scoring proficiently, indicating differences in evaluation criteria across states. Researchers found that \"proficient\" does not have the same meaning across states, as some states had much lower performance standards compared to others. States have the flexibility to choose easier performance standards to ensure all students are proficient in reading and math by 2013-2014. This diversity in accountability systems has raised concerns. The National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers are leading a movement to develop common standards for reading and math in grades K-12, known as the common core standards. Adoption of these standards is optional, with 43 states and the District of Columbia currently on board. 44 states and DC are also working on common assessments for the 2014-2015 school year. The Obama Administration supports the movement towards common standards and assessments, incentivizing states to adopt them through Race to the Top grants. This has led to more states agreeing to adopt the standards. The Obama Administration incentivized states to adopt common standards and assessments through Race to the Top grants. Despite efforts to support the development of common assessments, the end result will not yield a single set of national standards or assessments in reading and mathematics. States adopting the common core standards can still add their own additional standards, resulting in a unique set of state standards with common elements. The Race to the Top grants incentivized states to adopt common standards and assessments, but there will not be a single set of national standards. States can add their own standards to the common core, resulting in unique state standards with common elements. Common assessments may vary between states in terms of proficiency levels. The common core standards movement and assessments movement do not propose a common curriculum, leaving teaching methods and assessment preparation up to state and local decisions. However, if enough states implement the common core standards, there may be a de facto national curriculum. Issues remain unresolved, such as responsibility for maintaining and updating the standards and funding. Responsibility for maintaining and updating common core standards and assessments, along with funding, are key unresolved issues. If included in the ESEA, there may be a federal role in this process, potentially increasing the number of states implementing the standards and assessments. Congress could choose to increase state and local flexibility regarding consequences for schools and LEAs failing to meet AYP. Another option is to not include common standards or assessments in a revised ESEA, leaving these movements at the grassroots level. Analysts have noted a lack of distinction in NCLB between minor and significant failures to meet performance thresholds. Several analysts suggest a more nuanced grading scale for schools failing to make AYP under NCLB, with grades ranging from A to F. The current automatic consequences apply to all schools, regardless of the extent of their failure to meet performance thresholds. Studies have shown that public schools with a wider variety of demographic groups are less likely to meet AYP standards. Without specific requirements for achievement gains by each student group, disadvantaged students may not receive the necessary attention. As more schools fail to make AYP, funds for school choice and SES programs may not be sufficient to help all eligible students. Availability of school choice options was examined in two studies during the 2004-2005 school year. During the 2004-2005 school year, studies found that many LEAs failed to offer school choice options as required. Challenges included a lack of non-identified schools for transfers, limited space, and difficulties in arranging inter-district transfers. Compliance with choice requirements was hindered by the need for physical space and adherence to class size requirements in non-identified schools. With more schools identified for improvement since then, it has become increasingly difficult for LEAs to meet public school choice provisions. It is challenging for LEAs to comply with public school choice requirements in Title I-A, especially with the increasing number of schools subject to accountability consequences. States and LEAs may struggle to provide assistance to schools failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. Differentiated consequences and focused assistance on lowest-performing schools are suggested. While performance-based rewards are authorized, the current focus is on sanctions under the NCLB. The Obama Administration's blueprint for reauthorization focuses on incentivizing improved performance through rewards rather than performance-based sanctions. Congress may shift towards positive incentives to achieve compliance with ESEA requirements. Setting demanding goals for all students to reach proficiency levels could drive improvement efforts, even if not fully met. However, critics argue that aiming for all students to reach proficiency levels within a specific timeframe may be unrealistic. It is likely that many states, schools, and LEAs will not meet the NCLB's 2014 AYP goal unless state standards are lowered or statistical techniques are used. Assessment data could be used to set new goals based on achievable growth levels. Congress could use empirically developed thresholds for student performance or benchmark progress against effective schools or LEAs when reauthorizing the ESEA. The NCLB performance-based accountability system has led to increased focus on the proficiency of all students, including disadvantaged, disabled, and LEP students. Schools are held accountable for the achievement of these underserved groups through disaggregated assessment results. However, schools are not held accountable for students at all levels of achievement. The NCLB accountability system focuses on proficiency in reading and math, but does not set targets for other achievement levels. Schools are not rewarded for moving students from below basic to basic or from proficient to advanced levels. This may lead to resources being directed towards students nearing proficiency rather than distributed equally. The current performance-based accountability system may need to be adjusted to focus on rewarding gains in student achievement, including growth above proficiency levels. Some states are already exploring accountability systems that measure student growth rather than just end-of-year assessments. The current Administration is interested in assessing student growth rather than static achievement, but details on new measures are lacking. If Congress expands the use of growth models, assessment requirements must be considered, such as assessing students more than once per year or aligning assessments across grade levels. Flexibility in growth models may require a review procedure to ensure accountability. Congress may need to implement a review procedure to ensure states have appropriate assessments for growth models. Student assessments under NCLB have led to a focus on state content standards and teaching to those standards. While assessments can help teachers focus instruction and receive feedback, there is a concern that \"teaching to the test\" may narrow the curriculum. Teachers may narrow the curriculum by reallocating time towards tested subjects like reading and math, leading to a focus on specific skills measured in assessments. This can result in a lack of emphasis on non-tested subjects and higher-order skills within tested subjects. The curriculum may be narrowed by focusing on tested subjects like reading and math, leading to a lack of emphasis on non-tested subjects and higher-order skills. Score inflation on high-stakes assessments, such as state tests, may occur if teachers solely teach to the test, potentially skewing results. Several studies have shown discrepancies in student achievement levels and gains between state assessments and low-stakes assessments like NAEP, indicating possible score inflation. Using a low-stakes audit assessment to verify gains on state assessments can help identify true achievement gains and prevent score inflation. This corroboration can assist policymakers in distinguishing effective policies from those that lead to inflated scores. The NCLB accountability system's assessment requirements may drive curriculum decisions at state and local levels. There are arguments for expanding the requirements to include subjects like writing, history, civics, and the arts to incentivize broader school curricula. However, it is uncertain if scores from new assessments would be included in the NCLB system, as seen with science assessments not counting towards AYP determinations. The current assessments under the NCLB accountability system may not adequately measure higher-order thinking skills. There are arguments for redesigning assessments to include more skills like extended constructed response and performance-based assessments. Some suggest using multiple measures to assess student learning effectively. Using student assessments in performance-based accountability systems allows for measuring academic targets, identifying areas of excellence and need, and evaluating the impact of instructional changes. However, this approach has limitations, such as relying on end-of-year assessment scores in reading and math for accountability. The appropriate interpretation of end-of-year assessment scores in reading and mathematics is crucial for informing accountability systems. Understanding the limitations of educational assessments, such as validity, reliability, and fairness, is essential for teachers, administrators, and policymakers. Validity, in particular, is key to evaluating educational assessments as it pertains to the interpretation of assessment results. Validity is crucial in interpreting assessment scores, determining if an interpretation is appropriate and meaningful. For example, state assessment results reflect students' knowledge and skills relative to academic standards. A valid inference could be that students from one school demonstrated more proficiency than students from another. However, less valid inferences, such as differences in curriculum or teacher quality, may not hold true. The validity of an inference from state assessments is tied to the test's purpose, not teacher evaluation. Reliability measures the consistency of assessment results, reflecting the accuracy of a student's true score. A higher reliability indicates a closer approximation to the true score. Fairness in assessment refers to equal treatment for all students, avoiding bias or unequal test preparation opportunities. For example, using complex vocabulary can disadvantage LEP students in a reading test. Some schools provide more test preparation, while others may not. The results of state assessments are crucial for the NCLB performance-based accountability system, with consequences for schools and LEAs based on these results. It is important to ensure the validity, reliability, and fairness of assessments to draw accurate conclusions about student achievement. If assessments lack reliability or fairness, schools and LEAs may face severe consequences even if a subgroup of students does not meet AYP. The NCLB aims to improve educational outcomes by focusing on the quality of classroom instruction. Despite this goal, schools and LEAs may face consequences based on invalid assessment scores, leading to ineffective targeting of reform efforts. This can result in some schools needing to implement reforms unjustly, while others may not be identified for improvement. The NCLB emphasizes the importance of highly qualified teachers for student success, aiming for equitable distribution across classrooms and schools to prevent disadvantaged students from being taught by inexperienced or unqualified teachers. This requirement has become a minimum standard for entry into the teaching profession. The NCLB sets a minimum standard for entry into the teaching profession, emphasizing the importance of highly qualified teachers. Recent federal interest has shifted towards measuring teacher effectiveness based on student achievement, as seen in the RTTT program. The RTTT program incentivized the use of student data to measure teacher effectiveness, with value-added modeling being a method used to isolate a teacher's impact on student achievement. This approach aims to create a fair accountability system that holds teachers accountable for effective teaching while considering factors outside their control. The shift from input-based to output-based teacher accountability has been led by the Administration, with VAM gaining attention in education research and policy. Congress may address teacher quality requirements during ESEA reauthorization, potentially maintaining, replacing, or supplementing current standards. Additionally, there may be a revisit of the equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers. The equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers is crucial to prevent disparities in teaching quality for poor and minority children. Congress may need to consider defining an \"effective teacher\" and revising teacher quality standards during ESEA reauthorization. The federal government's role in incentivizing states to improve teacher quality may also be addressed. The federal government incentivizes states to develop teacher evaluation systems through programs like the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and Race to the Top (RTTT). These programs require evaluations to inform rewards, recruitment, and retention of teachers, including high-stakes decisions like granting tenure and removing ineffective teachers. Some districts use Value-Added Models (VAM) for these decisions, but there are concerns about its effectiveness. Some caution against using Value-Added Models (VAM) for high-stakes decisions like tenure, certification, and removal of teachers due to concerns about the precision of measuring teacher effectiveness. Congress may need to reconsider the weight given to teacher effectiveness in an accountability system."
