USER FEES REGARDING INSPECTIONS OF IMPORTED FOOD SAFETY. Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the Secretary and the Commissioner will assess and collect fees on imported food to cover the costs of inspecting food in compliance with section 4. The fees will defray the increased costs of resources needed for inspecting imported food compared to fiscal year 2007, including additional staff positions in the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. The fee for imported food is based on the number of line items and cannot exceed $20 per line item. The fee is a personal debt to the United States and accrues when the food is imported. Total fee revenues collected in a fiscal year are determined by the amount appropriated. Adjustments may be made for inflation. Coordination with other federal agencies may be sought for fee collection. Adjustments may be made for inflation in the total fee revenues collected for imported food, based on the Consumer Price Index or basic pay changes. The Secretary and the Commissioner adjust annual fees to ensure total revenues collected equal the amount applicable for the fiscal year. They may grant fee waivers or reductions under certain circumstances. The Secretary and the Commissioner adjust fees annually to match the required amount for the fiscal year, with the possibility of fee waivers or reductions under specific conditions. Fees under subsection (a) cannot be assessed after fiscal year 2008 unless the appropriated amount for salaries and expenses meets certain criteria. The Secretary and the Commissioner may assess and collect fees for funding inspections of imported items, excluding fees collected for this purpose. Fees can be assessed at any time in a fiscal year without modifying the rate, even if not initially assessed. Fees collected are credited and available for the fiscal year. Fees collected under subsection (a) are credited to Department of Agriculture and FDA accounts for salaries and expenses, available without fiscal year limitation. Transfers between accounts are allowed for carrying out section 4. Fees authorized in subsection (a) are collected annually. Fees collected annually under subsection (a) are authorized for specific purposes and subject to appropriations determined by the Secretary and Commissioner. Any excess fees collected are credited to Department of Agriculture and FDA accounts as specified. The Food and Drug Administration collects fees as authorized, which are subtracted from future collections if not paid on time. Unpaid fees are treated as a claim of the US Government. The section does not require a reduction in full-time positions for non-inspection related activities in the Departments of Agriculture or Health and Human Services. The term \"adjustment factor\" for a fiscal year is defined as the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for April of the preceding fiscal year divided by the Index for April 2007. SEC. 6.
