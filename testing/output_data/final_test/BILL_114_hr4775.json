    "content": "The Act titled \"Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016\" aims to facilitate state implementation of existing ozone standards. The Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016 requires each State Governor to designate areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable with respect to the 2015 ozone standards by October 26, 2024. The Administrator must finalize these designations by October 26, 2025, including any modifications. Each State must submit a plan for the 2015 ozone standards by October 26, 2026. The standards do not apply to preconstruction permits if the application is deemed complete before the final designation of the area. The Administrator or the State, local, or tribal permitting authority must publish a public notice before 60 days after the final designation of the area under subsection (a)(2). This section does not eliminate the obligation to install best available control technology or limit the authority of permitting authorities to impose stricter regulations. The tribal permitting authority can enforce stricter emissions requirements than national air quality standards under state, local, or tribal laws. The text chunk discusses facilitating state implementation of national ambient air quality standards. The text chunk amends the timeline for reviewing national ambient air quality standards, extending the cycle to 10 years for all criteria air pollutants. It also specifies that the review of ozone criteria and standards should not be completed before October 26, 2025. The text chunk proposes revisions to the Clean Air Act regarding the consideration of technological feasibility and adverse effects on public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy in establishing and revising national ambient air quality standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to require consideration of adverse effects on public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy when establishing or revising national ambient air quality standards. Additionally, regulations must be issued in a timely manner. The Administrator must publish regulations and guidance concurrently with new air quality standards to assist States, permitting authorities, and permit applicants. Failure to do so means the standard does not apply to preconstruction permit applications until the necessary information is provided. The Administrator must publish regulations and guidance concurrently with new air quality standards to assist States, permitting authorities, and permit applicants. This ensures that preconstruction permit applicants must still comply with best available control technology and lowest achievable emission rate technology requirements. The subsection clarifies that States, local, or tribal permitting authorities can impose stricter emissions requirements than national standards. Definitions for 'best available control technology' and 'lowest achievable emission rate' are provided, along with the meaning of a preconstruction permit. The Clean Air Act allows for stricter emissions requirements by States, local, or tribal permitting authorities. Contingency measures are not required for Extreme Ozone Nonattainment Areas. Amendments to Plan Submissions include adding \"economic feasibility\" after \"technological achievability\". Amendments to the Clean Air Act include adding \"economic feasibility\" after \"technological achievability\" in various subsections. Amendments to the Clean Air Act include revisions for milestones in particulate matter nonattainment areas and exceptional events. Additionally, a report on emissions from outside the United States is required within 24 months of the Act's enactment. Within 24 months of the Act's enactment, the Administrator, in consultation with States, must submit a report to Congress on the impact of foreign sources of air pollution on air quality standards and the EPA's procedures for handling petitions under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator, in consultation with States and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will conduct a study on ozone formation, including the contribution of man-made and naturally occurring pollutants. The study aims to identify effective control strategies. The Administrator will conduct a study on ozone formation, including pollutants in urban and rural areas, wildfires, and wintertime ozone formation. The study will be peer-reviewed and a report submitted to Congress. Regulations and guidance will be based on the study's findings. The Administrator will incorporate the study results, including peer review findings, into Federal rules and guidance for implementing the 2015 ozone standards. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the terms \"Administrator\" referring to the head of the EPA, \"best available control technology\" defined in the Clean Air Act, \"highly influential scientific assessment\" as per OMB guidelines, and \"lowest achievable emission rate\" also defined in the Clean Air Act. The term \"national ambient air quality standard\" refers to a standard set under the Clean Air Act. A \"preconstruction permit\" is required for building or modifying a stationary source, issued by the EPA or a permitting authority. The term \"2015 ozone standards\" pertains to national air quality standards. The term \"standards\" refers to the national ambient air quality standards for ozone set in 2015. No additional funds are authorized for this Act and its amendments. The requirements will be funded using existing authorized amounts."
