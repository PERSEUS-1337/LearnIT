    "content": "The Title I-A program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the main federal funding source for K-12 education. States must meet requirements for student achievement assessment and accountability. Standards and assessments were mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act and Improving America's Schools Act. The No Child Left Behind Act and Improving America's Schools Act mandated standards and assessments for reading and mathematics at three grade levels: 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12. States had to develop academic content standards and assessments tied to them by the 2000-2001 school year. The NCLB expanded on this by requiring assessments for grades 3 through 8 and one high school grade in reading and math by 2005-2006. States also had to assess students in three grade bands: 3-5, 6-8, and 10-12. The NCLB mandated assessments in three grade bands for science by 2007-2008. The Grants for State Assessments program helps cover assessment costs, while the Grants for Enhanced Assessment Instruments program aims to improve assessment quality. The report explores the growth of state assessment expenditures since the NCLB adoption and the unclear impact of federal grant programs on assessment costs under Title I-A. This information is provided to Congress for the reauthorization of the ESEA and discussions on assessment provisions. The report examines state assessment systems under the NCLB, emphasizing the importance of valid assessments for federal policy effectiveness. Decisions in designing assessment systems impact NCLB accountability and schools. Policymakers can explore implications of changing state assessment requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the current assessment requirements of the NCLB, the assessment industry's response, factors influencing assessment costs, and data on the cost of assessment systems. It also outlines state assessment requirements and regulations for students with disabilities. The curr_chunk discusses assessment requirements for all students and alternate requirements for students with disabilities. Each state must administer high-quality academic assessments in math, reading, and science to determine if schools are making adequate yearly progress. State assessments must align with academic standards and provide information on student achievement. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of high-quality academic assessments aligned with state standards in math, reading, and science for grades 3 through 8 and high school. It also highlights the need for multiple measures of student achievement, accommodations for students with disabilities, and inclusion of limited English proficiency students. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for assessments aligned with state standards in math, reading, and science for grades 3 through 8 and high school. It includes accommodations for students with disabilities and limited English proficient students, individual student reports for parents and teachers, disaggregation of results by various demographics, and alignment with professional testing standards. The curr_chunk highlights the requirements for assessments to be aligned with state standards, measure academic achievement objectively, and provide itemized score analyses for parents and educators. States must also develop alternate assessments for students with disabilities to ensure their participation in state assessment systems. States must develop alternate assessments for students with disabilities to ensure their participation in state assessment systems. There are five options for assessing students with disabilities for state accountability purposes, with restrictions on how scores from certain assessments may be counted in AYP calculations. States have varying success in meeting NCLB assessment requirements, with 11 states lacking approval for their assessment systems. As of January 2009, 39 states have full approval for reading and math assessments, while 12 states are pending approval, mainly due to issues with alternate assessments for students with disabilities. 10 states have full approval for science assessments. The NCLB brought about a significant increase in demand for new assessments. The NCLB led to a surge in demand for new assessments, prompting the assessment industry to produce more products. States required reliable and valid assessments for their accountability systems, leading to changes in the types and number of assessments needed. The assessment industry comprises private companies specializing in various types of assessments, including professional certifications and educational assessments for students. The NCLB increased demand for educational assessments in elementary and secondary schools, shifting from catalog sales to state-required assessments. The NCLB legislation required states to align assessments with state standards, shifting from norm-referenced to criterion-referenced assessments. This led to increased demand for customized assessments in elementary and secondary education. The NCLB legislation mandated new criterion-referenced assessments aligned with state standards, leading to a surge in demand for customized assessments. This resulted in competition among assessment vendors for state contracts worth millions of dollars, with five major vendors dominating the market. Smaller vendors and niche companies also compete for state contracts. Congress required the GAO to study the aggregate costs of these assessments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on the costs of new state assessments between FY2002 and FY2008. The estimated costs ranged from $1.9 billion to $5.3 billion, depending on the assessment design chosen by states. The low estimate assumed only multiple-choice items, the mid-level estimate included a combination of multiple-choice and limited open-ended items, and the high estimate included a combination of multiple-choice and open-ended items requiring human scoring. Since the passage of the NCLB, nationwide estimates of expenditures on state assessments have varied. For the school year 2005-2006, assessment expenditures for NCLB-required state assessments were estimated between $500 million and $750 million. A more recent estimate places nationwide expenditures at approximately $900 million per year. The assessment industry and states faced challenges in implementing the NCLB requirements, with one observer noting the significant impact on the testing industry. The assessment industry is facing difficulties in increasing staff capacity to handle the workload, with a reported shortage of measurement experts. There is a limited number of psychometricians available, leading to competition among industries for these experts. The assessment industry struggles to meet the demand created by the NCLB, leading to errors and delays in scoring assessments. States penalize vendors for mistakes and delays, facing challenges in implementing new assessment requirements. States must vet proposals from vendors through a rigorous process. The process of vetting assessment proposals for the NCLB is challenging for states due to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified staff. States struggle with managing assessment contracts, facing delays and errors from vendors. The states face challenges in managing assessment contracts due to difficulties in recruiting qualified staff. The assessment industry operates as an oligopoly with little regulation, making it hard for states to cancel or modify contracts. Insufficient research exists on factors influencing assessment costs required by the NCLB, leading to the presentation of a framework focusing on assessment development, scoring, policy choices, and implementation practices. The text discusses the costs associated with state assessment systems and presents a cost structure for various assessment components. It aims to help states understand the tradeoffs involved in creating an assessment system and balancing their assessment budget. The cost structure for state assessment systems involves balancing the budget by allocating different proportions to components like development, production, and reporting. Development is the most expensive component, ranging from 18% to 25% of total cost, while reporting is the least expensive at 2% to 5%. Other components have proportional costs ranging from 12% to 20%. States have control over some design elements, such as development, to manage costs. Assessment development is a key element that influences costs in state assessment systems. Test developers create assessment items based on academic standards, field-test them for reliability and validity, and remove problematic items. Committees may review remaining items for bias. The state administers assessments for accountability purposes and releases some items to the public annually to build credibility. The cost of assessment development depends on the number and types of assessments needed, with a minimum of 17 assessments required by states to meet NCLB requirements. These assessments include reading, mathematics, and science assessments for various grade levels. State assessments for accountability purposes include reading, mathematics, and science assessments for different grade levels. The most common types of assessments used are multiple choice and constructed response items. The cost of developing assessments ranges from $255,000 to $1.7 million, with states reporting an increase in multiple choice items and a decrease in constructed response items since 2002. The cost of developing state assessments ranges from $255,000 to $1.7 million, excluding ongoing costs for new item development. Automated scoring is used for multiple choice items, while human scoring is used for constructed response items. Human scoring is slower and requires extensive training. Automated scoring is efficient for multiple choice assessments, while human scoring is slower and requires extensive training and oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability. Double scoring is sometimes used to assess scorer reliability. Automated scoring is commonly used for multiple choice assessments to meet NCLB requirements, providing speed and ease for states. Scoring incentives for states to use multiple choice assessments under NCLB regulations due to time pressure for reporting results quickly and accurately. Some states prefer late spring assessments to reflect student achievement after a year of instruction. Cost considerations lead states to choose multiple choice items over constructed response items in state assessments. In North Carolina and Virginia, assessments mainly use multiple choice items, costing less than $1 per assessment. Massachusetts uses a mix of multiple choice and constructed response items, costing around $7 per assessment. States may prioritize speed, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness over the benefits of constructed response items that require human scoring due to time constraints in scoring assessments. Federal and state policies influence state assessment requirements. State and federal policies impact assessment requirements, with the number of assessments and variations influencing costs. States may require multiple versions of assessments for security purposes, with costs varying significantly between states. For example, Massachusetts used 24 versions costing $200,000 each, while Texas used one version costing $60,000. Policies also differ on releasing assessment items to the public. State policies on releasing assessment items to the public vary, with 54% of states doing so. Texas, Massachusetts, Maine, and Ohio release the entire assessment, while New Jersey and Michigan release only a portion. Some states, like North Carolina, release items to teachers but not the public. States face different replacement rates for assessment items based on the number released annually. States releasing the entire assessment must redevelop it yearly, while those releasing only a portion have fewer items to replace. Even states not releasing items to the public replace some for test security purposes. State policies on releasing assessment items to the public vary, with some states releasing items each year for test security. The number of items released has direct consequences on development costs. Participation in state consortia, like the NECAP program, can lead to cost savings. Maine recently joined NECAP and reported saving $1 million annually on assessments. The cost factors of state assessment systems are influenced by various factors. States struggle to report spending on assessment systems required by the NCLB due to limited data availability and challenges in accounting for expenses. Assessment vendors play a key role in developing, administering, and scoring assessments, but their duties may extend beyond assessment-related tasks required by the NCLB. States struggle to report spending on assessment systems required by the NCLB due to limited data availability and challenges in accounting for expenses. Assessment vendors play a key role in developing, administering, and scoring assessments, but their duties may extend beyond assessment-related tasks required by the NCLB, including employing state- and local-level assessment directors or coordinators. These staff members may have overlapping duties and may not be specifically hired to direct or coordinate assessments. The accounting difficulties in reporting state expenditures on assessment activities required by the NCLB result in highly variable reports. Two recent investigations into states' costs associated with NCLB assessment requirements are discussed, highlighting factors contributing to the reported variability. Congress mandated a study on the cost of developing assessments in grades 3 through 8, focusing on reading and mathematics assessments but not including science or alternate assessments for students with disabilities. The ED surveyed state assessment directors to report the cost of their state assessment program for the 2006-2007 school year. Twenty-seven states reported costs for developing or modifying reading and math assessments to comply with NCLB, but the reports likely underestimate the true expenditures. The ED surveyed state assessment directors to report the cost of their state assessment program for the 2006-2007 school year. Three states reported developing or modifying six assessments; six states reported developing or modifying eight assessments; and 18 states reported developing or modifying 12 assessments. The average state-reported aggregate cost was approximately $14.0 million, with a median cost of $9.6 million. Costs ranged from $1.3 million to $51.2 million, showing high variability not related to the number of assessments or state population. In the 2006-2007 school year, states reported varying costs for developing or modifying assessments. Vermont and Arizona both changed 12 assessments, while West Virginia spent over 10 times more than Illinois despite developing fewer assessments. Thirty-nine states reported per-pupil costs for reading and math assessments, with costs ranging from $1.3 million to $51.2 million. The average state-reported per-pupil cost for administering assessments was $29, with a median cost of $25. Costs varied greatly, ranging from $3 in North Carolina to $99 in Delaware. Larger states had higher total costs, with the top four states spending $38.7 million compared to $2.9 million for the bottom six states. The average per-pupil cost for administering assessments varied among states, with larger states generally reporting higher costs. Despite this, larger states benefited from economies of scale, leading to lower per-pupil costs. GAO conducted a performance audit from August 2008 to September 2009 to examine state expenditures on assessments required by the ESEA since 2002, factors influencing assessment decisions, and challenges faced by states in ensuring assessment quality. The GAO conducted a mixed-methods research approach to examine state assessment expenditures related to the NCLB. Forty-eight states reported increased annual assessment expenditures since the NCLB enactment. Over half of the states cited increased expenditures due to various reasons. State assessment expenditures increased due to NCLB requirements, with over half of states citing additional assessments as the primary reason. Increased vendor costs were also a significant factor. In 2007-2008, states spent significantly more on assessment vendors than on state assessment staff. General state assessments received the highest proportion of state assessment expenditures. In 2007-2008, state assessment expenditures increased due to NCLB requirements, with over half of states citing additional assessments as the primary reason. General state assessments received the highest proportion of state assessment expenditures. Test development was reported as the most expensive assessment activity in 23 states, scoring in 12 states, and administration in eight states. High test development costs were attributed to the need to replace released assessment items each year. States vary in the proportion of items they release, with some releasing up to 100% annually. States reported increased assessment expenditures due to NCLB requirements, with alternate assessments for students with disabilities contributing significantly. The cost of alternate assessments was much higher than general state assessments. States primarily used multiple choice items to control costs. Some states used multiple choice items for reading and math assessments to save costs and meet tight deadlines under NCLB. The variability in state assessment expenditures was not fully explained in previous reports. The analysis aimed to determine if state assessment expenditure variability is influenced by state population. Data limitations included difficulties in collecting expenditure data and varying accuracy in completing surveys by state officials. The data analysis revealed limitations in survey completion by state officials and the inability to link responses to individual states. Forty-nine out of 51 states responded to the survey, with some providing incomplete data. To address the lack of state names or populations in the data, a proxy variable for \"state size\" based on the number of students taking assessments was created. This variable was used to explore the impact of state population on funding for NCLB assessments. The analysis focused on the relationship between federal and state funding for NCLB assessments, as well as the impact of state size on assessment expenditures. On average, federal formula funding covers 43% of states' total assessment costs. Smaller states tend to rely more on federal funding for assessments. The relationship between state size and funding for NCLB assessments varies, with smaller states receiving more federal funding but contributing less from state government funds. Expenditures on staff and assessment vendors increase with state size. States spend significantly more on assessment vendors than on state-level staff. Hiring more staff may not necessarily reduce vendor costs. Population size influences assessment spending trends across states. The population size of a state contributes to the cost of state assessment systems, but other factors also play a significant role. Factors such as assessment development, scoring, policy choices, and implementation practices impact the cost. Congress will need to decide on funding support for state assessments and how to promote efficiency in the future. The passage discusses the changing assessment practices and industry post-NCLB, highlighting the lack of current research on assessment costs. It raises questions about federal funding for state assessments under the ESEA reauthorization and suggests developing policies to promote quality and efficiency. The federal government could develop policies to promote quality and efficiency in state assessment systems, but there is a risk of reducing assessment quality if efficiencies are prioritized without considering consequences. Efficiencies may involve tradeoffs in assessment types, numbers, and timelines, as well as balancing state independence with promoting state consortia for economies of scale. Educators have expressed dissatisfaction with state assessment quality and reliance on multiple-choice items, suggesting an increase in performance-based assessments. One alternative to improve state assessment systems is to increase the use of performance-based assessments. These assessments are authentic tasks that evaluate a student's knowledge and skills through tasks like science experiments, essays, research projects, or real-world math problems. A study found that transitioning to a high-quality assessment (HQA) system, which includes more performance-based items, would cost about three times more than traditional multiple-choice assessments. However, implementing cost reduction strategies could make the HQA system more affordable than traditional assessments. The HQA system was projected to be less expensive than traditional assessments by using cost reduction strategies applicable to various assessment systems. Most state assessment systems rely on automated scoring for multiple choice items and human scoring for constructed response items, which is a costly and time-consuming process. Assessment vendors are typically responsible for the human scoring of constructed response items, making it one of the most expensive activities in state assessment systems. One cost-saving strategy in state assessment systems is distributed scoring, where scorers work from home accessing assessments online. This approach can result in an 11% reduction in scoring costs for constructed response items. Another option is using teachers to score assessments, which can also help reduce costs. Using teachers to score assessments can help reduce scoring costs. Teachers can evaluate various assessment types and scoring could be part of their duties or a paid professional development activity. However, procedures must be in place to ensure objective scoring due to teachers' stake in the NCLB accountability system. Using teachers to score assessments can help reduce scoring costs, but there are concerns about objectivity due to their vested interest in student performance. Alternative options like AI scoring are being explored, although current costs are prohibitive. Speculation suggests that AI scoring costs may decrease in the future, potentially serving as a cost-saving strategy. The timeline for reporting assessment results under NCLB is driven by regulations requiring parental notification of public school choice options. LEAs must notify parents of options for schools in need of improvement at least 14 days before the school year starts to allow parents time to make a choice. To ensure timely notification of public school choice options for schools in need of improvement, assessment results must be available at least 14 days before the school year starts. If assessments shift to more constructed response items, there may be a need for increased human scoring, potentially requiring a longer scoring window. This could result in assessments being administered earlier in the year or reporting results after the start of the next school year, impacting the accuracy of measuring grade-level academic content and performance standards. Under NCLB, states had flexibility to create their own academic standards and assessments, leading to over 50 unique assessment systems. Limited interest in developing common assessments across states resulted in varied assessment types, scoring procedures, and administration timing. State consortia have become more popular for developing and administering assessments to meet NCLB requirements. A study showed that participating in a 10-state consortium could reduce per pupil assessment costs by 24%, 20-state consortium by 27%, and 30-state consortium by 30%. Larger consortia lead to more savings according to cost models. The majority of savings in state consortia are realized in a 10-state consortium. The Race to the Top Assessment Program promotes the use of consortia, with two main winners being PARCC (26 states) and SBAC (31 states), involving a total of 45 states. The Race to the Top Assessment Program involves 45 states participating in PARCC and SBAC consortia to develop assessments for college- and career-ready standards in math and English. The program aims to assess all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities. It is uncertain how these assessments will impact state accountability measures under Title I of the NCLB. The future support for participating state consortia is unclear as the RTTT Assessment Program is a one-time competition. Decisions on state assessments for Title I requirements may be determined by Congress during the next ESEA reauthorization. Online delivery of state assessments could lower costs by about 12% compared to paper-and-pencil tests, but additional equipment costs were not included in this estimate. Some states have already transitioned to online delivery, and others may follow suit. The study did not include the cost of purchasing equipment for online testing, which can vary depending on the number of available computers. Schools need to have the necessary equipment for large-scale online assessments, highlighting the technology gap between schools. Ongoing support may be needed for equipment purchases to maintain online delivery systems for state assessments. Some concerns with online delivery of state assessments include potential technological problems leading to delays or lost results. Glitches have already occurred in Virginia, requiring students to retake tests, raising validity concerns. States may need to ensure schools have infrastructure and policies to address such issues. NCLB authorized programs to assist states in meeting new assessment requirements. The NCLB authorized two programs for state assessments funding: Grants for State Assessments and Grants for Enhanced Assessment Instruments. $490 million was authorized for FY2002, with additional funds for the following years. Grants for State Assessments program distributes funds by formula grants up to a \"trigger amount,\" with the remaining funds distributed competitively. The NCLB authorizes grants to states for developing state assessments and standards, including voluntary partnerships with other states. States must administer assessments to ensure schools are held accountable. Funding is contingent on meeting minimum annual amounts, known as \"trigger amounts,\" defined in legislation. The NCLB authorizes grants to states for developing state assessments and standards, contingent on meeting minimum annual \"trigger amounts.\" Funding allocation includes reservations for outlying areas and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as allocations based on the number of children and youth aged 5-17 years in each state. States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico receive funding for state assessments through the Grants for State Assessments program. State appropriations for FY2002-FY2011 are shown in Table A-1."
