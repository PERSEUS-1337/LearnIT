    "content": "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a process that captures manmade CO2 at its source, purifies it, and stores it underground to reduce emissions. This technology has gained congressional support and is being used in the oil and gas industry to inject and store CO2 underground. The oil and gas industry in the United States injects nearly 50 million metric tons of CO2 underground each year for enhanced oil recovery. Electricity generation produces about 2.1 billion metric tons of CO2 annually, making it a prime target for large-scale CCS. Fuel combustion is responsible for 94% of U.S. CO2 emissions, with electricity generation being the largest contributor. Large industrial facilities like cement-manufacturing and ethanol production are also potential candidates for CO2 capture and storage. Large industrial facilities like cement-manufacturing, ethanol, or hydrogen production plants that produce large quantities of CO2 are good candidates for CO2 capture and storage. This report provides a summary of CCS, its working mechanism, support from Members of Congress, challenges to implementation, and deployment in the United States. It focuses solely on CCS and not other carbon sequestration activities. The first step in CCS is to capture CO2. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) process involves capturing CO2 from industrial facilities or power plants using post-combustion, pre-combustion, or oxy-fuel combustion capture methods. Current commercial systems can achieve 85%-95% capture efficiency, but the capture phase accounts for 80% of the total CCS costs. Various technologies, including absorption using chemical solvents, can be used to extract CO2 from flue gas. The post-combustion capture process involves separating CO2 from fuel using proven technologies like steam reforming. This process uses oxygen for combustion, producing a CO2 stream that can be compressed, transported, and stored. The U.S. DOE's flagship CCS project, FutureGen, aims to demonstrate this technology. The U.S. Department of Energy's flagship CCS project, FutureGen, plans to retrofit a power unit with an oxy-fuel combustion unit. CO2 is commonly transported in pipelines in the U.S., mainly to oil and gas fields for EOR. Ships can be used for long-distance or overseas CO2 transport, but currently, it is done on a small scale due to limited demand. Rail cars and trucks can also transport CO2, but this mode may not be cost-effective. Costs for transporting CO2 via rail cars, trucks, pipelines, or ships vary depending on factors like construction, operation, and distance. Pipeline transport costs are determined by quantity and distance, onshore or offshore location, route congestion, and terrain. Shipping costs are unknown for large-scale CO2 transport systems, but may be lower than pipelines for distances over 1,000 kilometers and transporting less than a few million metric tons of CO2 per year. Regional CO2 pipeline networks exist in the U.S. for enhanced oil recovery. Developing a more expansive network for CCS in the United States could pose regulatory and economic challenges related to pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO2, and pipeline safety. Three main types of geological formations considered for carbon sequestration are depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. CO2 is injected in a supercritical state below ground into porous rock formations to prevent migration. Injecting CO2 into deep geological formations for long-term storage and monitoring utilizes existing technologies primarily used by the oil and gas industry. Other underground injection applications like natural gas storage and oil-field brine disposal offer valuable experience for CO2 sequestration. The storage capacity in geological formations is vast, but site suitability depends on factors like proximity to CO2 sources and reservoir qualities. Carbon dioxide can be injected into oil and gas reservoirs for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), with the United States leading in this technology. Most CO2 used for EOR comes from natural formations, but using industrial emissions has cost benefits. EOR projects are mainly onshore, with potential for offshore applications. Most CO2 projects for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are onshore, primarily in west Texas. Depleted or abandoned oil and gas fields, especially in the United States, are ideal for CO2 storage due to their structural integrity, existing infrastructure, and geological studies. Some features that may be advantageous for CO2 storage could also pose disadvantages. Wells penetrating from the surface to the reservoir could potentially release CO2 if not properly sealed. Overpressuring the reservoir during injection could fracture the caprock, allowing CO2 to escape. Shallow oil and gas fields may not be suitable for CO2 storage, as CO2 could easily escape to the surface. Proximity to industrial CO2 sources and pipeline construction costs are factors in determining the feasibility of EOR operations. The United States injects 50 MtCO2 underground annually for EOR, representing 2% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel electricity generation. The volume of CO2 for CCS is much larger. EOR may increase in the future, but would only be a small fraction of total CO2 sequestration. The In Salah Project in Algeria was the first large-scale CO2 storage effort in a natural gas reservoir. The In Salah Project in Algeria stored CO2 in a natural gas reservoir by separating it from the produced gas and reinjecting it into the formation. Approximately 17 MtCO2 were planned to be captured and stored over the project's lifetime. The Weyburn Project in Canada uses CO2 for EOR, injecting up to 5,000 tCO2 per day and expecting 20 MtCO2 to remain in the formation. Deep saline reservoirs can also store CO2. Deep saline reservoirs, found onshore and offshore, are often part of oil and gas reservoirs. They are used for CO2 sequestration due to their widespread availability in the United States and large storage capacity. However, estimates of storage capacity vary greatly, requiring case-by-case determination. The DOE Regional Sequestration Partnership Program is exploring the potential of deep saline reservoirs for large-scale CO2 storage in the United States. These reservoirs are widespread and easily accessible to stationary CO2 sources. The program is conducting simulations and injection projects to assess their suitability for carbon capture and storage. Injection demonstration projects are being conducted to investigate the suitability of deep saline reservoirs for large-scale CO2 storage. These experiments aim to assess the potential for CO2 leakage, detect movement underground, and identify leaks through cap rocks. Displacing brine in the reservoirs could pose a risk of leakage into underground drinking water sources. Injecting large volumes of fluid may also trigger earthquakes, especially if injected into undetected faults. Evaluating potential storage sites before injection can help mitigate these risks. The issue of induced seismicity has been linked to the injection and disposal of produced waters from oil and gas fields. Public opposition may arise to activities on the surface, such as land clearing and building of new roads, as well as to the concept of disposing CO2 underground near residences and communities. Public opposition to CO2 injection has led to project cancellations in Europe. The Sleipner Project in the North Sea is a commercial-scale operation for sequestering CO2 in a deep saline reservoir. It has been operating since 1996, injecting and storing approximately 2,800 tCO2 per day. The CO2 is separated from natural gas production, compressed, and injected 800 meters below the seabed into a sandstone reservoir. Monitoring shows no leaks, and simulations suggest the CO2 will dissolve into saline water. Another similar project, the Snohvit Project, started in the Barents Sea in 2008. The Gorgon Project in Australia plans to inject 9,000 tCO2 per day into deep saline formations for storage, starting in 2015. U.S. coal resources that are not mineable can still trap gases like methane, which can be extracted as coal-bed methane. Carbon dioxide can displace methane in coal seams, which can then be recovered for revenue. Factors to consider for unmineable coal seam injection projects include depth, permeability, coal bed geometry, lateral continuity, and vertical isolation. Once CO2 is injected, it will likely remain unless the seam is depressurized or mined. Proximity of unmineable coal seams to electricity-generating facilities in the US can reduce transportation costs for CO2. Carbon dioxide can displace methane in coal seams for revenue. Factors for unmineable coal seam injection projects include depth, permeability, geometry, continuity, and isolation. Storing CO2 in coal seams has uncertainties compared to other storage types. Unmineable coal seams have the smallest capacity for CO2 storage globally. US coal seams have less capacity than oil and gas fields for CO2 storage. The United States has potential capacity for storing CO2 in geologic basins near large point sources like power plants. The DOE Regional Sequestration Partnership Program estimates storage capacity in different types of reservoirs, as shown in the Carbon Sequestration Atlas. No commercial CO2 injection projects in coal beds are currently active in the US. The Carbon Sequestration Atlas was compiled from estimates of geological storage capacity by seven regional partnerships. These partnerships identified unique reservoirs like unmineable coal seams and organic-rich shales for CO2 storage. The Carbon Sequestration Atlas compiled estimates of geological storage capacity by regional partnerships, identifying unique reservoirs like unmineable coal seams and organic-rich shales for CO2 storage in the Columbia River Plateau. The table shows varying sequestration potential in different reservoirs, with oil and gas fields having more constrained estimates due to decades of industry data. The 2012 Carbon Sequestration Atlas assessed oil and gas reservoirs at the field level and deep saline formations at the basin level. The estimates show the potential to store over 1,100 to 9,000 years of CO2 emissions from electricity generation in the United States. These projections depend on current emission rates and assume full utilization of storage capacity. The DOE Sequestration Atlas is regularly updated to assess U.S. reservoir capacity for CO2 storage. The USGS developed a methodology for assessing national potential for geologic storage of carbon dioxide, with revisions made in response to feedback. In 2013, the USGS released its assessment of geologic CO2 storage resources in the United States. The USGS conducted a geology-based examination of sedimentary basins in the United States and state waters, estimating 3,000 billion metric tons of CO2 storage capacity. This estimate is 25% higher than the DOE's lower estimate and 15% of the upper estimate from the DOE study. The USGS methodology differed from the DOE's regional CCS sequestration partnerships approach. The USGS study estimated 3,000 billion metric tons of CO2 storage capacity in sedimentary basins in the United States and state waters. The Coastal Plain region accounted for two-thirds of the total storage capacity, with 1,800 billion metric tons along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Alaska had the next largest capacity with 270 million metric tons, mostly along the North Slope. The oceans store a significant amount of carbon, acting as a net sink for approximately 1.7 billion metric tons of CO2 per year. Without this ocean sink, atmospheric CO2 concentration would increase more rapidly. The oceans could potentially store over 90% of carbon released by human activities, but this process takes thousands of years. However, the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 may decrease in the future, leading to increased ocean acidity. The surface waters of the ocean are becoming more acidic due to increased CO2 concentration. Injecting CO2 directly into the deep ocean can sequester it until it mixes with surface waters. The fate of the CO2 depends on depth of injection and seawater temperature. CO2 injected at depths shallower than 500 meters would be released as a gas, while below 500 meters it can exist as a liquid in the ocean. Deep ocean storage of CO2 involves injecting it below 500 meters where it can dissolve or form a pool at depths exceeding 3,000 meters. Some suggest immobilizing CO2 in ocean sediments to potentially sequester it for thousands of years. However, environmental impacts and research scalability are key factors in determining the feasibility of large-scale ocean CO2 storage. Deep ocean storage of CO2 is still in the research stage, with unknown effects of scaling up from small experiments to injecting large amounts of CO2. This process would change ocean chemistry, particularly lowering pH and increasing acidity, potentially harming ocean organisms. The actual impacts of deep sea CO2 sequestration are largely unknown due to limited knowledge of deep ocean ecosystems. Environmental concerns led to the cancellation of a planned experiment in 2002 to test ocean sequestration feasibility. Deep ocean sequestration involves injecting CO2 into deep ocean waters, different from injecting CO2 beneath the seabed. Projects in Hawaii and Norway faced opposition from environmental groups in 2002. Deep ocean storage of CO2 is still in the research stage, with potential environmental impacts. Sequestering CO2 on the U.S. continental shelf eliminates the need for landowner negotiations but requires offshore infrastructure. Another option is converting CO2 to solid carbonates through mineral carbonation, which can be accelerated by reacting CO2 with minerals like olivine or serpentine. Mineral carbonation involves preparing reactant minerals, reacting CO2 with them, and storing carbonate products. It is effective in sequestering carbon in stable minerals, but requires large volumes of silicate oxide minerals. Large-scale mineral carbonation processes need significant mining operations to provide enough reactant minerals. Mineral carbonation for CO2 sequestration requires large mining operations to obtain reactant minerals. Solid material production ranges from 2.6 to 4.7 metric tons per tCO2 sequestered. Research is ongoing on using major flood basalts as geological reservoirs for CO2 storage, where CO2 is injected directly into basalt formations to form solid carbonates in situ. Large formations of flood basalts globally have characteristics favorable for storing CO2, with the potential to convert the gas into stable minerals underground. DOE partnerships are exploring using Columbia River Plateau flood basalts for CO2 storage. The goal of CCS is to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial facilities by 80%-90% to mitigate climate warming. The deployment of CCS throughout the economy is crucial for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigating climate warming. The primary challenge lies in the additional cost of installing CCS on CO2-emitting facilities, especially in an environment of low natural gas prices. Improving CO2 capture technology efficiency can lead to significant cost savings, but challenges remain in the transport and storage components of CCS. Ideally, storage reservoirs should be located close to sources to avoid the need for extensive pipeline infrastructure. However, some regions may lack adequate reservoir capacity, requiring further infrastructure development for widespread CCS implementation. Identifying and validating sequestration sites for CO2 storage may require constructing pipelines from sources to reservoirs. Questions regarding pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, and pipeline safety need to be resolved. Congress may need to address federal jurisdictional authority over CO2 pipelines and potential additional legislation for a growing network crossing state lines. Large-scale injection experiments are beginning in the United States to test reservoir performance for CO2 storage. Large-scale injection tests in the United States are crucial for future CO2 storage regulations and site approval. Issues like liability, ownership, and public acceptance need to be addressed before commercial deployment of CCS. Some states are already implementing geological sequestration regulations, requiring federal negotiations. Public acceptance of CCS projects on private land may pose a challenge, but local injection tests could provide valuable insights. The public acceptance of CCS infrastructure, including pipelines, injection wells, and reservoirs, remains uncertain despite the results of CO2 injection tests. The higher cost of electricity from CCS plants is a concern, and various CRS reports cover different aspects of CCS technology and implementation. CRS reports on the carbon cycle, capturing CO2 from coal-fired power plants, community acceptance of carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure, and pipelines for CO2 control are available."
