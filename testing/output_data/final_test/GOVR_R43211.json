It has been maintained by agricultural runoff and was once a prolific sport fishery with diverse wildlife. The Sea is an important wetland area along the Pacific Flyway for migratory birds. The Salton Sea has deteriorated due to decreasing water flows and increasing salinity, leading to disease and mortality of fish and birds. Scientists predict fatal saline levels by 2018, which could impact migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway. Exposed lake beds may lead to air pollution and human health issues. Since 2003, interest in the ecological health of the Salton Sea has increased due to the Quantification Settlement Agreement (QSA) signed by water districts in California. The agreement aims to reduce Colorado River water consumption, leading to less water flowing into the Salton Sea and accelerating its decline. Participating water districts agreed to contribute $163 million towards mitigation and restoration efforts. The water districts agreed to provide 200,000 AFY of Colorado River water to the Salton Sea until December 31, 2017. Congressional concern for restoring the Salton Sea is driven by its value as habitat for endangered species, a reservoir for agricultural drainage waters, a center for recreation, and a large wetland ecosystem. Efforts to address restoration and concerns over air pollution from exposed sea beds have been reflected in laws passed by Congress. Some argue against restoring the Salton Sea, citing its natural history of shrinking and reforming water bodies. They suggest using restoration funds for other wetlands like the Bay-Delta. The Salton Sea in southern California is the largest inland water body in the state, with a history of supporting various water bodies. Some argue against restoring it, suggesting funds be used for other wetlands like the Bay-Delta. The value of restoring the Salton Sea lies in its ecological significance and potential for economic development through tourism, recreation, and energy. In 1901, the Colorado River was diverted to irrigate fields in the Salton Basin, forming the Salton Sea. Water flowed for 18 months before being redirected to the Gulf of California. The Sea has no outlets and has increased in salinity over time. The construction of Hoover Dam and the All American Canal in 1928 allowed water to be transferred directly to the Imperial Valley for irrigation. President Coolidge executed Public Water Reserve Orders 90 and 114 in 1924 and 1928, designating lands around the Salton Sea as a repository for agricultural water drainage. The ecosystem of the Sea is influenced by water level, salt concentration, and evaporation rate. 75% of water flowing into the Sea is from agricultural runoff in California's Imperial and Coachella valleys, with the remaining 25% from rain and other surface inflows. The Sea's salinity level is currently around 52 parts per thousand, 50% higher than ocean water. The Salton Sea has a salinity level of approximately 52 parts per thousand, making it hypersaline. This high salinity, combined with extreme eutrophication, has led to fish kills in the Sea. In the 1950s, the Sea was similar in salinity to the Pacific Ocean, prompting the transfer of saltwater fish species. However, changes to the Sea, such as flooding, wildlife die-offs, and health threats, have led to a decline in recreation and development around the Sea. The current salinity levels are too high to support the previous diversity of fish. The Salton Sea's current salinity levels are too high to support diverse fish species. The most common fish now is the tilapia, introduced in 1964. The endangered desert pupfish is the only native species left. Deteriorating water quality has harmed invertebrates like pileworms and barnacles. Future predictions suggest all fish may disappear by 2023. The ecosystem provides various habitats for wildlife. The Salton Sea is a crucial stopover for birds on the Pacific Flyway, supporting over 400 bird species, including some endangered ones. The total bird population can reach up to 500,000 per month, with many relying on fish for food. Concerns arise due to the mortality of bird and fish species, especially those listed as endangered, like the Yuma clapper rail. The Salton Sea Authority, established in 1993 by the State of California, aims to conserve endangered species in the area, including the desert pupfish. Other endangered species like the peregrine falcon and bald eagle are also occasionally spotted at the Sea. The Authority's objectives include maintaining the Sea as an agricultural drainage reservoir, restoring wildlife habitats, promoting recreational use, and supporting economic activities. The Salton Sea Authority, established in 1993, aims to conserve endangered species in the area and promote recreational use and economic development. Farmlands in the Imperial and Coachella valleys historically used Colorado River water, with the Salton Sea receiving a portion as agricultural runoff. However, the Quantification Settlement Agreement (QSA) now diverts some of this water to urban districts, reducing the amount reaching the Salton Sea. The QSA will reduce agricultural inflows to the Salton Sea by 30% by 2018. The Bureau of Reclamation predicts that future inflows will be around 727,000 to 835,000 AFY between 2018 and 2077. The Salton Sea Authority estimates water flow to stabilize at 800,000 AFY post-2018 with the QSA. Multiple provisions in the QSA aim to mitigate environmental effects on the Salton Sea, including direct transport of 200,000 AFY of Colorado River water and $133 million for environmental mitigation. The QSA, effective until January 1, 2018, involves IID, CVWD, and SDCWA providing $133 million for environmental mitigation related to water transfers. IID is also required to deposit an additional $30 million into a restoration fund. The State of California will cover additional mitigation and restoration costs. Legislation established a Salton Sea Restoration Fund overseen by the Department of Fish and Game for environmental and engineering projects. The California Secretary for Resources, in consultation with the Salton Sea Authority, was to present a preferred restoration plan to the state legislature by December 31, 2006, emphasizing the state and national interest in restoring the Salton Sea and developing a long-term conservation plan for species in the area. The development and implementation of a restoration plan for the Salton Sea is dependent on state funding and not mandated by the QSA. There is debate over the extent of the state's responsibility for restoration efforts. The recent state court ruling established that the QSA requires the state to fund environmental mitigation for the Salton Sea. IID and CVWD argue that actual restoration was never a state commitment. The Environmental Impact Assessment determined that 200,000 AFY of Colorado River water annually transferred to the Salton Sea for 15 years, along with other mitigation measures, would be sufficient. The Salton Sea restoration efforts include managed marsh for rail birds, roost sites for brown pelicans, monitoring programs for listed species, and a study on selenium impacts. IID, CVWD, and SDCWA are responsible for up to $133 million in environmental mitigation costs, with the state covering additional expenses. $30 million is allocated to the Salton Sea Restoration Fund. High salinity levels pose a significant threat, with predictions of fatal levels for aquatic wildlife by 2018-2028. Some argue that increasing salinity levels in the Salton Sea, attributed to human activities like water transfers and agriculture, have led to a decline in its ability to support aquatic wildlife. High salinity levels beyond 40 ppt can result in fish reproductive issues, suppressed immune systems, and stress. Salinity levels of 60 ppt and above are too saline to sustain tilapia, a main food source for birds in the area. Other water quality issues such as toxic chemicals and low oxygen levels are also linked to diminishing water flows, with toxic levels of selenium and DDE found in the Sea. Toxic levels of DDE and selenium have been detected in the Sea, causing reproductive problems in fish and birds. These substances have adverse health effects on humans as well. Agricultural areas are believed to be the main source of water inflows leading to the toxic levels. Mortalities of fish and birds in the 1990s were associated with toxins, with significant losses in populations such as white pelicans and endangered brown pelicans. Water quality issues raise concerns for endangered species dependent on the Salton Sea ecosystem. The loss of fish populations in the Salton Sea could impact piscivorous birds by the early 2020s, potentially affecting endangered species like the Yuma clapper rail. Some invertebrates and desert pupfish may survive at higher salinity levels. Nonnative fish species could still be found in areas of lower salinity around the Salton Sea. Changes in salinity levels may alter the species composition of birds relying on fish and invertebrates for foraging. Air pollution may become a concern as the Salton Sea shrinks, exposing lake bed areas to heat and wind. Dust from the dry beds could contain harmful substances like pesticides and selenium, leading to respiratory problems for people in surrounding counties. This contaminated air could be a contributing factor to the higher rates of respiratory issues in the Coachella and Imperial counties near the Salton Sea. The Salton Sea's shrinking size may lead to air pollution issues, with dust from dry lake beds containing harmful substances. The Pacific Institute estimates that water transfers will increase dust in the air, potentially costing billions to mitigate. A 2012 incident, dubbed the \"Big Stink,\" brought attention to the strong odor of hydrogen sulfide released from the Sea. The \"Big Stink\" incident at the Salton Sea raised concerns about the poor condition of the ecosystem due to hydrogen sulfide emissions. Scientists had previously warned about increasing salinity making the sea uninhabitable for fish and wildlife. Various entities have proposed restoration plans since then. Efforts to restore the Salton Sea began after concerns were raised about its poor ecosystem condition. Federal, state, and private entities have proposed plans to control salinity levels, maintain water levels, and provide habitat for endangered species. Federal restoration efforts were initiated with the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992, followed by the Salton Sea Recovery Act of 1998 authorizing feasibility studies and economic analyses for restoration options. The secretary was authorized to conduct studies on wildlife and species' responses to the hydrology and toxicology of the Salton Sea. River reclamation activities for the New and Alamo Rivers were also authorized. Restoration projects have been carried out by the state-funded Salton Sea Authority in collaboration with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, focusing on reducing salinity through solar pools and salt evaporation technology. Plans include the construction of a causeway across the sea. The 2006 Salton Sea Authority Plan proposed splitting the sea into two pools, but concerns were raised about acquiring water from the Colorado River for salinity control. The Secretary of the Interior was restricted from considering options involving new water imports. California has funded restoration efforts, focusing on Saline Habitat Complexes for wildlife ecosystems. The state-funded restoration efforts for the Salton Sea include the construction of Saline Habitat Complexes (SHCs) with barriers to create saline pools. The salinity levels in these pools would be maintained using blended water or geothermal-powered desalinated Salton seawater. The preferred restoration plan was presented to the state legislature in 2007, which included SHCs, air quality management facilities, conveyance facilities, and a brine sink for salt discharge. The state's preferred restoration plan for the Salton Sea includes Saline Habitat Complexes (SHCs) with barriers to create saline pools, air quality management facilities, conveyance facilities, and a brine sink for salt discharge. The plan also features Early Start Habitat, areas for geothermal development, and connectivity waterways for desert pupfish. The estimated cost for the preferred alternative is $8.9 billion, with annual operations and maintenance costs of $142 million. Pilot studies are being conducted to measure the effectiveness of SHCs, with federal assistance, and a Salton Sea Species Conservation Habitat Project is underway to create up to 3,770 acres of SHCs for conserving fish and wildlife species. The project aims to create pools at the southern end of the Salton Sea to support fish and wildlife species. It is a \"proof of concept\" project to test if Saline Habitat Complexes can sustain wildlife. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is involved in assessing the project and providing necessary permits for construction. Funding and support are being sought for the project. The SSA is seeking funding and support for its 2006 plan to separate the Salton Sea into two lakes. Recent negotiations between IID and County of Imperial have endorsed the plan. State bill AB71 would require the California Natural Resources Agency to lead restoration efforts, including investigations into projects. The bill would also authorize the Salton Sea Authority to conduct a restoration and funding study. Federal actions for restoring the Salton Sea lack a comprehensive plan, with efforts mainly consisting of pilot projects and monitoring. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) conducted a study in 2007, providing five restoration alternatives with costs ranging from $3.5 billion to $14 billion. BOR did not specify a preferred alternative due to uncertainties, risks, and high costs. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and USGS conducted a pilot study on Salton Sea Habitat Complexes (SHCs) from 2006 to 2010 to assess their feasibility for restoration. The study found that SHCs could reduce risks and costs while restoring wildlife habitat and mitigating air quality impacts. However, high selenium levels in the pools raised concerns about potential toxicity to fish and wildlife. Overall, the study demonstrated that the SHP model is a promising restoration approach. The study on Salton Sea Habitat Complexes (SHCs) found that they are a viable alternative for restoring wetlands, but potential risks of selenium need to be considered. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorized pilot projects for the Salton Sea Ecosystem Restoration Program, including the Salton Sea Species Conservation Habitat Project plan. The Administration has requested $200,000 for a reconnaissance study of the plan. The Corps FY2014 budget request includes a $200,000 funding request for a reconnaissance study of the plan to restore the Salton Sea. Efforts have been made to explore renewable energy sources in the area, such as geothermal energy, solar power, and bio-algae, with an estimated capacity of up to 2,000 megawatts. IID is currently generating approximately 600 MW of geothermal energy in the Basin. IID has been developing a pilot study to use geothermal energy for desalination to create saline habitat pools. The Torres-Martinez Tribe is seeking funding to build a solar photovoltaic field for sustainable water delivery to the saline habitat ponds. If successful, renewable energy could replace Colorado River water for salinity control. SSA is in talks with SSAC to promote renewable energy development in the area. The SSAC aims to promote renewable energy development in the Basin to generate funds for restoration. They are considering creating an Infrastructure Finance District to fund restoration projects using proceeds from development. Some suggest producing bio-algae to fund restoration and improve the Salton Sea's environmental health. Clemson University researchers have developed a Controlled Eutrophication Process to grow algae in the Sea, which could improve water quality, increase fish production, and generate revenue. Progress towards restoring the Salton Sea has been slow due to the lack of a comprehensive plan and funding. Some argue against restoration, claiming the Sea will naturally shrink, while others believe its decline is artificial due to agricultural runoff. The increasing salinity and shrinkage of the Sea could harm the ecosystem, wildlife, and human health. The federal government's role in physical restoration is also questioned. The federal government's role in restoring the Salton Sea has been limited to proposing plans and conducting pilot studies. There are debates on whether Congress should take a more active role by authorizing restoration actions and providing funding, or if the responsibility should remain with the State of California. The decision on federal involvement is crucial as the Quantification Settlement Agreement (QSA) takes effect and local mitigation efforts end. Endangered species and health hazards from the Sea's evaporation are cited as reasons for federal action. Some argue for increased federal involvement in restoring the Salton Sea due to federal ownership of land and importance to listed species. However, others point out the lack of laws authorizing direct federal restoration actions. Some argue for increased federal involvement in restoring the Salton Sea due to federal ownership of land and importance to listed species. Federal laws could be applied to restoring parts of the ecosystem, but state efforts have been largely unfunded. Advocates suggest a combined state and federal effort for restoration, while others question the use of federal resources for an area with uncertain restoration prospects. Some argue for increased federal involvement in restoring the Salton Sea due to federal ownership of land and importance to listed species. They suggest that other wetland restoration efforts in California would be more cost-effective. Factors for Congress to consider include creating authorizing legislation, funding restoration efforts, addressing restoration under ESA, and maintaining the status quo of providing assistance to California. Congress might choose not to address restoration in the Salton Sea ecosystem. If Congress does not authorize or fund Salton Sea restoration, California would be responsible for restoration efforts. Despite mitigation efforts, habitat loss and salinity will persist. Various entities have proposed restoration plans, with estimated costs ranging from $3.5 billion to $14 billion. State and federal appropriations have not yet been allocated for implementation. Some private stakeholders have presented smaller-scale versions of state and federal plans for Salton Sea restoration, cutting costs by up to 75%. Most funding has been used for planning and monitoring rather than direct implementation. Short project lifespans may limit long-term environmental impacts. Congress could increase federal involvement by authorizing a comprehensive restoration plan with shared governance. The restoration plan for the Salton Sea could involve federal and state resources with shared governance. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is a model with federal and state cost-sharing. Other restoration initiatives like the Chesapeake Bay and Platte River involve federal and state collaboration. Congress could expand federal authorities to fund existing projects for Salton Sea restoration. The federal government plays a role in funding and authorizing restoration projects for the Salton Sea. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 allows the Secretary of the Army to review and approve pilot projects in the state plan, with cost-sharing between the state and federal government. $30 million is authorized for these projects, with a maximum of $5 million per project. Funding for these projects has not been authorized yet, but a reconnaissance study has been requested for FY2014. The federal government has requested $200,000 for a reconnaissance study on pilot projects for restoration in the Salton Sea. Funding from the Salton Sea Reclamation Act of 1998 has been used for implementing pilot projects and scientific research, with positive results reported. Programs under ESA could also be applied to habitat restoration and species recovery in the Salton Basin, which is a crucial migratory route for endangered species. The Salton Sea is a crucial migratory route for endangered species, but it is not designated as critical habitat for them. Nearby areas have critical habitat, like parts of the Imperial Valley for the desert pupfish. Measures are in place to protect desert pupfish habitats during water transfers authorized under the QSA. Possible funding sources for the restoration and maintenance of the Salton Sea and endangered species include appropriations from the ESA and the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF). CESCF grants can benefit listed species and help states prepare Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) to coordinate conservation efforts. Alternative funding mechanisms have been proposed by state, local, and private entities. Some alternative funding mechanisms have been proposed by state, local, and private entities, including the use of renewable energy development in the Basin through public-private partnerships (PPPs) to fund restoration projects. Multiple federal agencies like NOAA, Corps, BLM, USFS, and Fish and Wildlife Service have public-private programs to manage restoration efforts. Some federal agencies like BLM and FWS have programs that provide funding for projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The Salton Sea Basin has potential for renewable energy production, which could be integrated with PPPs to generate funds for restoration and improve the local economy. However, for PPPs to be successful, they must generate revenue with minimal risk to the private entity. Some barriers to renewable energy development in Salton Sea Basin include lack of access to transmission lines, water, and environmental concerns. Without restoration, the Sea will shrink in size and increase in salinity, impacting the ecosystem. Congress should consider the potential effects of not restoring the Salton Sea when weighing options for action. The Salton Sea ecosystem would struggle with high salinity levels, causing migratory birds to disappear. Despite this, the area could still support brine shrimp, flies, algae, and bacteria. However, over time, salinity and oxygen depletion could harm remaining organisms. By 2040, an additional 134 square miles of the seabed would be exposed, potentially impacting farmers with contaminated dust. Salinity levels are projected to reach 330 ppt by 2075, surpassing the saltiest parts of the Great Salt Lake and nearing the Dead Sea's salinity levels. The exposed seabed at the Salton Sea could impact farmers with contaminated dust, leading to adverse health effects and economic impacts. Business owners fear closure, which could increase unemployment and healthcare costs for the government. Some argue against restoration, stating that the natural transition of the Sea should not be interfered with. Some argue against restoring the Salton Sea, believing that its natural transition should not be disrupted. However, others emphasize the importance of understanding the ecosystem dynamics and potential impacts of a shrinking sea on the environment and economy. Collaboration between USGS, BOR, California Department of Water Resources, and Fish and Wildlife has led to the creation of a Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP) to establish a baseline understanding of key factors in the Salton Sea. The program aims to establish a baseline understanding of key factors in the Salton Sea ecosystem, fill data gaps, and implement monitoring activities for species and habitats. Changes in the ecosystem, such as decreasing area and increasing salinity, have already impacted fish, wildlife, and avian species. The ecosystem is expected to change dramatically with future water transfers, reducing water availability. The Salton Sea ecosystem is expected to change dramatically with future water transfers, leading to increased salinity levels that will make the sea inhabitable for most fish and wildlife species. Efforts to restore the ecosystem are supported by various groups, highlighting the Sea's importance as a habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife, especially with the decline of wetlands in California. Some argue that restoring the Salton Sea could benefit aquatic wildlife, support recreational activities, and aid in economic development. Critics believe the sea will naturally evaporate and return to a desert ecosystem, citing historical trends of water bodies drying up in the area. Concerns also exist about increasing salinity levels despite restoration efforts. Despite restoration attempts, Salton Sea water levels may rise due to reduced water inflows from transfers or diversions. Without fresh water from the Colorado River, some restoration plans may be infeasible. Critics question the high cost and scientific uncertainty of existing proposals, suggesting funds be directed to other wetland restoration efforts. Congress has authorized restoration plans and pilot projects for the Salton Sea ecosystem, but the pace of change poses challenges. Congress may consider increasing the federal role in restoring the Salton Sea ecosystem through funding existing authorities, authorizing federal participation in restoration plans, and creating a new comprehensive plan involving federal and non-federal stakeholders. Alternatively, Congress may choose to maintain the current level of federal involvement or not address restoration at all."
