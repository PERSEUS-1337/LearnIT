It allocated $60.065 billion for agencies under Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. President Obama signed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) on April 15, 2011, providing $61.202 billion for the same agencies. The report provides an overview of Congress' actions to allocate FY2011 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. It includes details on the FY2010 appropriations for these agencies as well. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $68.705 billion in new budget authority for these agencies, with $14.164 billion for the Department of Commerce. In FY2010, $68.835 billion was appropriated for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. For FY2011, a total of $66.109 billion was requested, with H.R. 1 proposing $60.065 billion. P.L. 112-10 ultimately provided $61.202 billion for these agencies.

The act allocated funds to various departments and agencies, including $7.581 billion for the Department of Commerce, $27.389 billion for the Department of Justice, $25.314 billion for the Science Agencies, and $917.9 million for related agencies. The amounts in the report only include new budget authority and do not account for any rescissions or de-obligated balances. Congress may have considered various issues as part of the Department of Commerce FY2011 appropriations process, including transferring funds to economic adjustment programs, increasing funding for the International Trade Administration, granting authority to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to use collected fees, and supporting increased funding for NOAA's satellite programs. Increase support for NOAA's satellite programs to ensure continuity of operations and coverage for weather forecasts and climate measurements. Congress may have considered funding levels for DOJ accounts, including limitations on funds for administrative costs related to Guant\u00e1namo detainees, proposed increase in funding for law enforcement along the Southwest border, oversight of FBI's transformation towards combating terrorism, and permanent funding for white collar crime positions. Issues facing Science Agencies in the FY2011 appropriations process include funding for white collar crime positions, FBI weapons capabilities, cybersecurity resources, Bureau of Prisons facility in Thomson, IL, grant programs for offenders, and the Weed and Seed Program funding proposal. Science Agencies in the FY2011 appropriations process may need to decide on funding increases for research at NSF, NIST, and DOE SC to align with President Obama's funding goal or the America COMPETES Act. Additionally, decisions on funding climate change and clean energy research, as well as NSF's work on nanotechnology, are also on the table. The FY2011 appropriations process may involve decisions on funding for research at NSF, NIST, and DOE SC to align with funding goals. Congress may consider additional funding for various agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the State Justice Institute, to address specific issues. The Department of Commerce was established in 1903 and has various responsibilities focused on promoting U.S. business, improving technological competitiveness, encouraging economic development, fostering environmental stewardship, and providing statistical information on the economy and population. Its agencies, like the International Trade Administration and Bureau of Industry and Security, work towards these missions. The Department of Commerce includes agencies like the Bureau of Industry and Security, Economic Development Administration, Minority Business Development Agency, and National Telecommunications and Information Administration, each with specific roles in promoting U.S. business, economic development, and providing statistical information. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) advises the President on communications policy, manages radio frequency spectrum use, and conducts telecommunications research.

The FY2011-requested amount for ITA was $534.3 million, with a planned collection of $9.4 million in fees. H.R. 1 proposed $441.6 million for ITA, 17.4% less than the Administration's request. The FY2011-enacted amount is $440.7 million, part of the Obama Administration's plan to stimulate the economy. The Obama Administration requested $78.5 million for a National Export Initiative to promote growth in the U.S. economy by increasing exports and creating jobs. The initiative aimed to make U.S. companies more competitive globally and create higher-wage jobs. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers export controls and anti-boycott statutes, as well as monitors the U.S. defense industrial base. President Bush invoked the International Economic Emergency Powers Act in August 2001 to continue export controls administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The FY2011 funding request for BIS was $113.1 million, with allocations for licensing, enforcement, and management. H.R. 1 proposed $100.3 million for BIS, the same as the FY2010 funding level.

The U.S. Constitution requires a population census every 10 years for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. The Census Bureau conducts a decennial census to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and distribute federal funds. The FY2011 request for the Census Bureau was $1.267 billion, with $280.4 million for salaries and expenses and $986.4 million for censuses and programs, a decrease from the FY2010-enacted amount. The FY2011 request for the Census Bureau was $1.267 billion, with $986.4 million for censuses and programs, including funds for the decennial census. The decrease in the FY2011 request reflected the completion of costly 2010 census operations. Major activities in FY2011 included releasing apportionment data, delivering redistricting data, providing new census data for federal funds distribution, and completing the coverage measurement program. The American Community Survey (ACS) also gathers extensive data as part of the decennial program. The American Community Survey (ACS) gathers extensive socioeconomic and housing information by sampling almost 250,000 housing units monthly. The FY2011 budget included $44.0 million to increase the ACS sample size to 3.5 million housing units for more reliable small-area estimates. The total budget for the Census Bureau in FY2011 was $1.150 billion, an 84.3% reduction from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides funding for the Census Bureau, with $258.5 million for salaries and expenses and $891.2 million for periodic censuses and programs. The total budget is less than the FY2011 request but higher than the FY2010 enacted amount. The ACS funding level is not specified in P.L. 112-10. The NTIA is responsible for advising on telecommunications policies, promoting access to services, funding research grants, and managing grant programs. It also plays a role in federal spectrum management, overseeing the transfer of radio frequencies from federal to commercial domains.

The Administration requested $21.8 million for Salaries and Expenses in FY2011, with a focus on improving spectrum efficiency and increasing availability for wireless broadband. The appropriations request also included plans to discontinue the PTFPC program. The Public Telecommunications and Facilities Planning and Construction (PTFPC) program funds grants for public broadcasting activities. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $20.0 million for PTFPC. H.R. 1 proposed $40.6 million for NTIA, a 1.6% increase from FY2010, but 10.7% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The USPTO examines and approves patents and trademarks, funded by user fees. The President's FY2011 budget proposed $2.322 billion in budget authority for the USPTO, with additional collections up to $100.0 million available for use by the Office. The budget also recommended past fee increases to remain in effect and a 15.0% surcharge on fees charged, with the generated fees designated for use by the USPTO. H.R. 1 passed by the House allocated $2.016 billion in budget authority to the USPTO, 13.2% below the Administration's request. The FY2011 appropriations legislation provides the USPTO with $2.090 billion in budget authority, which is 3.7% above the FY2010-enacted amount. The 0.2% rescission will not apply to the USPTO. The ability of the USPTO to use all fees collected during a fiscal year has been a topic of congressional interest. Critics argue that significant portions of fees collected by the USPTO are not returned due to appropriations process limitations, hindering efficient operation. NIST aims to enhance U.S. company competitiveness through technological support. NIST research supports the diffusion of government-developed technologies across the American economy, enhancing product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety. The FY2011 budget proposed a 7.3% increase in funding for NIST, with a focus on in-house R&D, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and the Technology Innovation Program. In FY2010, funding for the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) would have increased to $79.9 million, while the construction budget would have decreased to $124.8 million. Under H.R. 1, NIST would have received $697.1 million, 18.6% below the FY2010 figure. Funding for the MEP program would have remained the same as FY2010 at $124.7 million. The construction budget for NIST in FY2010 was $58.0 million, which was significantly lower than the President's request. The total funding for NIST after adjustments was $750.1 million, with support for the STRS account at $507.0 million. The MEP program received $128.4 million, while TIP was allocated $44.8 million. The construction budget decreased to $69.9 million. The construction budget for NIST decreased by 52.4% from FY2010 funding to $69.9 million, 44.0% below the Administration's proposal. Continued support for NIST extramural programs aimed at private sector commercialization has faced skepticism from some Members of Congress. This led to significant reductions in appropriations for NIST activities like the Advanced Technology Program and Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The Technology Innovation Program replaced the Advanced Technology Program and Manufacturing Extension Partnership at NIST. Funding for NIST laboratories has seen small increases, with plans to double funding for internal research over the next 10 years. The future of support for internal R&D at NIST and its impact on extramural programs like TIP and MEP remains uncertain.

This represented a proposed 5.9% increase from the previous year's appropriation. The FY2011 budget proposed a 5.9% increase in funding for agencies like BOP, FBI, DEA, and Legal Activities. However, there were notable funding reductions for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, Juvenile Justice, COPS, and the Weed and Seed program. H.R. 1 would have provided $27.123 billion for DOJ, a 3.4% decrease from FY2010 levels and 8.8% less than the Administration's request. Notable decreases would have been seen in grant accounts, with COPS facing a 25.7% cut. The FY2011 budget proposed a 5.9% increase in funding for agencies like BOP, FBI, DEA, and Legal Activities. However, there were notable funding reductions for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, Juvenile Justice, COPS, and the Weed and Seed program. The act provides $27.389 billion for DOJ for FY2011, which is 2.5% less than FY2010 levels and 7.9% less than the Administration's request. Reductions in funding were mainly due to cuts in DOJ's General Administration accounts, FBI, U.S. Marshals, and ATF construction, and grant programs. In FY2011, Congress increased funding for the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee, FBI, and Bureau of Prisons. The General Administration account funds salaries and expenses for DOJ agencies.

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and professionalize the prison service. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and professionalize the prison service. BOP's mission is to protect society by confining offenders in safe and secure facilities, providing work and self-improvement opportunities for inmates. BOP operates 115 correctional facilities and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRC) to assist inmates nearing release with employment counseling and other services. The Federal Prison System has two main accounts: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) for inmate care and facility operations, and Buildings and Facilities (B&F) for construction and maintenance. Congress sets a cap on revenue from Federal Prison Industries (FPI) for administrative expenses. The Administration requested $6.806 billion for the Federal Prison System in FY2011, with $6.534 billion for Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and $269.7 million for Buildings and Facilities (B&F). This was a 10.0% increase from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed $6.427 billion for the system, 3.9% more than FY2010 but 5.6% less than the Administration's request. The final FY2011 amount was $6.384 billion. The FY2011-enacted amount for the Federal Prison System is $6.384 billion, with $6.295 billion for Salaries and Expenses (S&E) and $99.2 million for Buildings and Facilities (B&F). The growing federal prison population and crowding remain a major concern for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), with inmate numbers increasing from 125,560 in FY2000 to 173,305 in FY2010. The Bureau of Prisons requested $66.9 million for the S&E account and $170.0 million for the B&F account to acquire, renovate, and operate a high-security prison in Thomson, IL. The facility in Thomson could add 1,600 high-security beds to the federal prison system and was considered for housing Guantanamo Bay detainees. Congress debated allowing BOP to acquire the Thomson prison despite potential restrictions on using FY2011 appropriations for Guantanamo detainees. P.L. 112-10 prohibits federal agencies from constructing or modifying facilities in the US. The provision in P.L. 112-10 prevents federal agencies from constructing or modifying facilities in the US for Guantanamo Bay detainees. While BOP could purchase the Thompson prison for federal inmates, they lack the resources as Congress did not allocate additional funding.

The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) received $417.7 million in FY2011, which is 0.2% less than the FY2010-enacted amount. This funding supports programs to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. OVW grant programs were funded at FY2010 levels under H.R. 1. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages various grant programs and requested $2.07 billion for FY2011, a 9.4% decrease from FY2010. Proposed cuts in State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance and Juvenile Justice Programs accounts were made, along with the elimination of the Weed and Seed account. H.R. 1 would have provided $1.481 billion for OJP, 35.1% less than FY2010. Congress ultimately provided $1.698 billion for OJP in FY2011. Congress provided $1.698 billion for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) in FY2011, which is 25.6% less than FY2010. Reductions in funding were seen in State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance, Juvenile Justice Programs, and the elimination of Weed and Seed. The Justice Assistance account, which supports various programs including missing and exploited children, received $224.3 million in the Administration's request, a 4.6% reduction from FY2010. In FY2011, Congress provided $234.5 million for the Justice Assistance account, a 0.2% reduction from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed a $10.0 million reduction, giving DOJ discretion on how to apply it across programs. The FY2011-enacted funding for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account was $1.479 billion, which was $56.3 million less than FY2010. Programs funded under this account include JAG, Drug Courts, and SCAAP. H.R. 1 proposed $953.5 million for this account, a 37.9% reduction from FY2010 and 28.4% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011-enacted funding for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account was $1.479 billion, which was $56.3 million less than FY2010. Congress provided $1.118 billion for FY2011, 27.2% less than FY2010 and 24.4% less than the Administration's request. H.R. 1 proposed a $581.3 million reduction, including zeroing-out funding for the Byrne Discretionary Grant program. The FY2011-enacted funding for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account was reduced by $56.3 million compared to FY2010. The bill proposed restrictions on funding levels and programs, including a 17.0% reduction for each grant program funded under the account in FY2010. Congress considered increasing funding for alternatives to incarceration and recidivism reduction programs. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports a rise in state prison populations from 2000 to 2008, with overcrowding in many states. Utilizing drug and mental health courts, as well as programs like RSAT and the Second Chance Act, could help reduce recidivism and alleviate prison crowding. The Administration requested $100.0 million for FY2011 to support these efforts. The Administration requested $100.0 million for FY2011 to support programs like RSAT, Second Chance Act, drug courts, and mental health courts aimed at reducing recidivism. Congress provided funding below the request, allocating $82.8 million for Second Chance Act, $24.9 million for RSAT, $37.3 million for drug courts, and $9.9 million for mental health courts. The Weed and Seed program helps communities prevent crimes by implementing local-level strategies. The Weed and Seed program, involving various organizations, aims to address community problems through \"weeding\" and \"seeding\" activities. Funding for FY2011 was not requested by the Administration, leading to Congress choosing not to fund the program. This decision was influenced by the Administration's request to end funding for Weed and Seed. The Administration did not request funding for Weed and Seed for FY2011, but proposed $40.0 million for a new Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program. Congress did not accept this proposal. The Juvenile Justice Programs account requested $289.8 million for FY2011, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The FY2011 appropriation for Juvenile Justice Programs was significantly lower than previous years, with a $148.2 million decrease from FY2010 and $14.4 million less than the Administration's request. H.R. 1 proposed a $191.1 million reduction, including zeroing-out funding for Part E\u2014Demonstration Project grants. Congress would have given DOJ discretion on how to apply the proposed reduction across programs. The FY2011 appropriation for Juvenile Justice Programs saw a significant decrease from FY2010. The bill restricted DOJ funding levels to FY2010 amounts and prohibited funding for programs not previously funded. The PSOB program provides benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. The Administration requests $77.3 million for PSOB for FY2011, an increase of $7.2 million compared with the FY2010-enacted amount. The COPS Office awards grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring, training, and new technologies. Some grant programs include Law Enforcement Technology, Methamphetamine Hot-spots Initiative, and DNA backlog reduction. The FY2011 requested funding for COPS was $690.0 million, $101.6 million less than FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed $588.5 million for COPS, 25.7% less than FY2010. Congress provided $494.9 million for COPS in FY2011, 37.5% less than FY2010. Grant programs funded under COPS include Law Enforcement Technology and Methamphetamine Hot-spots Initiative. The bill proposed reducing funding for the COPS program by 17.0% across all grant programs funded under the account in FY2010. DOJ would have discretion to apply the reduction proportionately, with no program funded at a level greater than FY2010. Earmarked portions for Law Enforcement Technology and Methamphetamine Hot-spots Initiative would not be funded. The Salaries and Expenses account for OVW, OJP, and COPS was funded for the first time in FY2009 to improve transparency and accountability in grant program management. The FY2011 requested funding was $279.4 million, a 31.0% increase from FY2010. However, the FY2011-enacted amount was $186.6 million, a 12.5% decrease from FY2010. The FY2011 funding request for the Science Agencies is 33.2% below the Administration's request, totaling $26.431 billion. This includes funding for the Office of Science and Technology Policy, NASA, and NSF. The requested amount is 3.0% higher than the FY2010 enacted amount, but lower than what would have been provided in H.R. 1. The Science Agencies would receive a total of $24.697 billion in proposed funding under H.R. 1, which is 3.7% less than the FY2010-enacted level and 6.6% less than the President's FY2011 request. This includes $6.6 million for the Office of Science and Technology Policy, $18.448 billion for NASA, and $6.86 billion for NSF. The FY2011-enacted appropriation is 1.3% less than FY2010 and 4.2% less than the Administration's request, but 2.5% more than what would have been provided in H.R. 1. The Office of Science and Technology Policy was established by Congress in 1976 to provide advice on scientific, engineering, and technological issues within the Executive Office of the President. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) provides advice to the President on scientific, engineering, and technological issues. The OSTP director manages the National Science and Technology Council and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. OSTP's FY2010 budget was $7.0 million, with an additional $3.0 million provided for the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The Administration requested $7.0 million for OSTP in FY2011, a slight decrease from FY2010. This funding would support four Senate-confirmed associate directors and align with the President's emphasis on the importance of science. The NSF also requested $3.0 million for STPI, with H.R. 1 proposing $6.5 million for OSTP, a 7.1% decrease from FY2010. FY2011-enacted appropriations provided $6.6 million for OSTP, a 5.9% decrease from FY2010. Funding for STPI remained unchanged. NASA was created in 1958 to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. The agency is managed from headquarters in Washington, DC, with nine major field centers around the country. The Administration requested $19.000 billion for NASA for FY2011, a 1.5% increase over the previous year. The final appropriation in P.L. 112-10 was $18.448 billion, slightly less than the House's proposed $18.123 billion. Funding for STPI falls below the appropriations-account level and is not identified in either legislation. Under the Vision for Space Exploration announced in 2004, NASA's goal was to return humans to the Moon by 2020. An independent review in 2009 found that the program would require an additional $3 billion per year. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed canceling the Moon program in favor of human exploration of Mars. Commercial crew launch services would provide access to the International Space Station in the near term. In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, new goals and priorities were established for NASA, including increased emphasis on long-term technology development. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed eliminating the Constellation program and instead investing in commercial crew and cargo transport services to low-Earth orbit. The FY2011 budget allocated funds for robotic precursor missions, technology R&D, and closeout costs for Constellation. The final appropriation for Exploration was $3.801 billion, with a significant portion designated for the multipurpose crew vehicle and heavy lift launch vehicle. The President's Science budget request included a notable increase for Earth Science. The FY2011 budget allocated funds for Earth Science, including $171 million for a replacement Orbital Carbon Observatory and $150 million for a global climate initiative. The budget also proposed increased funding for Planetary Science and Heliophysics. The final appropriation for Earth Science was $4.935 billion, with increases for Aeronautics and a new Space Technology program receiving $572.2 million. The Senate committee recommended funding for Aeronautics and Space Technology, with a lower amount allocated for Space Technology compared to the request. The final appropriation for Aeronautics was $534 million, while the FY2011 request for Space Operations saw a 20.9% decrease from FY2010. The budget for the Space Operations program in FY2011 saw a 20.9% decrease from FY2010. A budget amendment proposed transferring $100 million to address economic and workforce issues related to the retirement of the space shuttle. The space shuttle program received $989.1 million, down from $3.139 billion in FY2010, while the ISS funding increased by 20.0% to $2.780 billion. The Administration's budget aimed to extend ISS operations to at least 2020 and provide for greater utilization of existing facilities. The final appropriation for Space Operations was $5.498 billion. The President requested $3,111.4 billion for Cross-Agency Support, a 2.6% reduction from the FY2010 level. H.R. 1 would have provided $2.833 billion, a reduction of 11.3% from the FY2010 level. The final appropriation for Cross-Agency Support was $3.105 billion. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in the non-medical sciences and engineering. Congress established the Foundation as an independent federal agency in 1950. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research and STEM education programs. The NSF received $6.860 billion in funding, which is 4.5% more than the previous year's allocation. The President's FY2011 request aimed to double funding for the NSF and other science-related accounts. The Obama Administration aims to double funding for the NSF and other science-related accounts to expand human knowledge and create future jobs and industries. Some policymakers have concerns about funding in light of the federal fiscal condition. The FY2011 enacted funding sets a pace for doubling over approximately 15 years, slower than previous legislation. NSF organizes its budget into six major accounts. The National Science Foundation (NSF) organizes its budget into six major accounts, including Research and Related Activities (R&RA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), and Major Research Equipment & Facilities Construction (MREFC). The FY2011-enacted appropriations for R&RA amount to $5.564 billion, primarily supporting basic research with a focus on the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate. Most R&RA funds are awarded to U.S. colleges and universities through a merit-based, peer review system. The National Science Foundation (NSF) allocates funds to U.S. colleges and universities through a merit-based system. Congress addresses concerns about NSF's research activities by directing high-risk, high-reward basic research and focusing on specific fields like climate change. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research program was established to address geographic distribution issues. R&RA funds were requested in FY2011 for educational purposes. In FY2011, the NSF requested R&RA funds for educational programs like the Graduate Research Fellowship and various research activities. The funding level for EHR in FY2011 was $861.0 million, which was more than the previous year but less than the President's request. In FY2011, the NSF requested funds for various STEM education programs, including the Fellowship program, Discovery Research K-12, Mathematics and Science Partnership, Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, and Informal Science Education. The EHR portfolio aims to increase technological literacy, prepare future STEM professionals, and address achievement gaps in scientific fields. Questions remain about evaluating program effectiveness, funding levels, and coordination of federal STEM education efforts. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for NSF proposed consolidating MSI programs into a single Comprehensive Broadening Participation of Undergraduates (CBPU) in STEM program, with a funding request of $103.1 million. Some analysts argued for keeping MSI programs separate, as they serve different populations. MSI programs serve different populations with different needs, but keeping them separate may limit funds for HSIs. Congress rejected the Administration's proposal to consolidate NSF's MSI programs in FY2011. The MREFC funding for FY2011 is $117.1 million, which is 113.6% more than the $54.8 million in H.R. 1 and 29.1% less than the President's request of $165.2 million. NSF planned to allocate $20.0 million for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) in FY2011. NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) funding for FY2011 is $117.1 million, supporting projects like NEON, Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, Atacama Large Millimeter Array, Advanced Technology Star Telescope, and Ocean Observatories Initiative. Projects must have the potential to advance scientific understanding and technology. There is ongoing debate about the management and oversight of these major projects. The NSF is facing ongoing debate in the academic and scientific communities and Congress regarding the management and oversight of major MREFC projects and project prioritization. NSF emphasizes the need for flexibility in reconsidering facilities at different development stages and the ability to adapt to changes in interagency participation and funding. The FY2011 funding levels for AOAM, NSB, and OIG accounts remain the same as FY2010 levels, with a 0.2% rescission. The FY2011 funding levels for AOAM, NSB, and OIG are $299.4 million, $4.5 million, and $14.0 million, respectively, which are less than the Administration's request. The total requested amount for related agencies in FY2011 was $973.4 million, with a $38.6 million increase from FY2010. H.R. 1 would have funded these accounts at FY2010 levels, resulting in a 7.5% decrease from the FY2010-enacted amount. Congress ultimately provided $917.9 million for the related agencies in FY2011. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigates allegations of voter rights denial based on color, race, religion, or national origin. The requested funding for FY2011 was $9.4 million, the same as FY2010. Congress provided a total of $917.9 million for related agencies in FY2011.

Concerns were raised about its restructuring plan, including the creation of the National Contact Center. The EEOC transitioned to an in-house call center in response to congressional concerns. The EEOC transitioned to an in-house call center, with the FY2011 President's request being $18.0 million more than the FY2010-enacted level. The commission's FY2011-enacted appropriation is $366.6 million, 0.2% less than the FY2010 appropriation, reflecting anticipated workload growth due to the transition to an in-house call center. The EEOC's FY2011 President's request included funding for 188 new hires to address the increase in private sector charge backlog and focus on systemic discrimination cases. The systemic initiative aims to update the Commission's approach to cases with broad discriminatory effects. The EEOC federal sector hearings workload is expected to increase from 6,617 pending hearings in FY2009 to 7,398 in FY2011. The Commission is implementing three initiatives to support the federal sector program: a Three Track Case Processing System to help administrative law judges process cases, the expansion of the Hearings Electronic Case Processing System pilot, and testing HotDocs Software for more efficient case processing. The International Trade Commission (ITC) is a quasi-judicial agency advising on U.S. foreign economic policies. Its functions include administering trade laws, providing analysis to the President and Congress on tariffs and trade, and maintaining the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The FY2011 budget request is $87.0 million, a 6.2% increase from FY2010, driven by higher costs in salaries, benefits, and rent. The budget request is submitted to Congress by the President without revision. The Full-Year CR includes $81.9 million for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which provides grants for legal assistance to low-income individuals in civil cases. The LSC has been controversial since the 1970s and operates without authorizing legislation since 1980. Congress has debated funding adequacy and restrictions on LSC-funded activities. The FY2010 appropriation for LSC was $420.0 million.
