    "content": "Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes federal student aid programs based on student need, defined as the difference between cost of attendance and expected family contribution. EFC formulas in Part F of Title IV calculate the EFC for the upcoming award year using income and assets of the student's family. This report discusses how the EFC is determined and does not cover its application in awarding student aid. The report discusses how the EFC is calculated based on information from the FAFSA, including income, assets, and family characteristics. Dependent students must provide parental information, while married students must include spouse information. The FAFSA serves as the data collection tool for EFC calculation. The FAFSA collects information from students and their spouses for aid determination. Responses to certain questions may not impact federal aid. The online FAFSA streamlines the application process by using skip logic to only request necessary data. The FAFSA online application allows applicants to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to import tax data. The Central Processing System processes the FAFSA, calculates the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), verifies identity and eligibility, and checks for errors. The CPS generates a Student Aid Report (SAR) after processing the FAFSA data. The FAFSA data produces Student Aid Report (SAR) and Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs). The FAFSA becomes available on October 1 of the year prior to the award year and is completed using income and tax information from two years prior. The FAFSA application process was changed to use income and tax information from the \"prior-prior year\" to allow students to apply for aid earlier and align with the college application timeline. This shift may increase the likelihood of families being able to import tax information using the IRT-DRT tool. The FAFSA application process uses data to determine a student's dependency status and calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC calculation considers the financial resources of the student and, if applicable, the student's spouse or parents. Eligibility for a Simplified Needs Test (SNT) can reduce the factors considered in the EFC calculation. The EFC calculation for financial aid considers income, assets, and dependency status. Dependent students' EFC includes parents' financial resources, while independent students' EFC does not. Spouse's financial resources are considered for married students. Independent students must meet specific criteria to be considered as such. The criteria for students to be considered independent for financial aid purposes include being 24 years or older, an orphan, in foster care, a veteran, a graduate student, married, having legal dependents, or verified as homeless or at risk of homelessness. A student's financial independence does not automatically make them independent for federal student aid purposes. The criteria for an independent student include being 24 years or older, an orphan, in foster care, a veteran, a graduate student, married, having legal dependents, or verified as homeless or at risk of homelessness. The EFC formula treats independent students with and without dependents differently. The EFC formulas consider various data elements related to income and assets to determine a student's EFC. Some students may qualify for a simplified needs test (SNT) or an automatic zero EFC if they meet certain criteria, such as having an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $50,000. The SNT does not factor in assets when calculating the EFC, reducing the number of questions for eligible applicants completing the FAFSA online. The EFC formulas consider income and assets to determine a student's EFC. Some students may qualify for a simplified needs test (SNT) or an automatic zero EFC with an AGI of less than $50,000. Dependent students' parents must file a 1040A or 1040EZ tax form, while independent students must file a 1040A or 1040EZ, or a 1040 form for education tax credit. Students can qualify for a Simplified Needs Test (SNT) if they file a 1040 form only for education tax credit, are not required to file a tax return, have a dislocated worker status, or have received a qualified means-tested benefit in the prior 24 months. Dependent students are eligible if their parents are not required to file a tax return, while independent students are eligible if neither the student nor their spouse is required to file a tax return. In AY2018-2019, students eligible for the Simplified Needs Test (SNT) may also qualify for an automatic zero Expected Family Contribution (EFC), entitling them to maximum need-based federal student aid. This benefit is available to dependent students and independent students with dependents who are eligible for certain means-tested benefits. The automatic zero EFC is available for students eligible for the Simplified Needs Test (SNT) if their parents' AGI or the student and spouse's AGI is below $25,000. Other ways to qualify for a zero EFC include the SNT or full EFC formula, which consider income and assets. EFC is a portion of available income and assets after subtracting allowable protections. The EFC calculation involves determining total income and subtracting allowable protections. For dependent students, contributions are calculated based on student and parent financial resources. An intermediate calculation of \"adjusted available income\" is used for parents of dependent students and independent students with dependents. Contributions from income and assets are calculated separately for dependent students and independent students without dependents. The EFC calculation involves determining total income and subtracting allowable protections. Contributions from income and assets are calculated separately for dependent students and independent students. Parental contributions are divided by the number of students in college for dependent students with multiple children in college. Independent students from families with multiple college students have their contributions divided by the number of family members in college. Financial resources are considered the same for students and family members of each dependency status, with differences in how they are treated. The EFC formula for dependent students considers both student and parent financial resources. Parental income and student income are calculated separately, with the sum determining the applicant's EFC. Dependent students may qualify for a simplified needs test, where only the income component is considered. The EFC formula for dependent students considers both student and parent financial resources. Parental income and student income are calculated separately, with the sum determining the applicant's EFC. Applicants who qualify for the simplified needs test with parental income that qualifies them for the automatic zero are not subject to the assets component of the EFC formula. If the student's parents are married, the EFC formula considers the income and assets of both parents. If the student's parents are unmarried but living together, the EFC formula will consider the financial resources of both parents. If the student's parents are divorced or separated and living apart, the EFC formula only directly considers, and the FAFSA only requires, financial information of one parent. The EFC formula considers the financial information of the parent who provided the greater support for the 12-month period preceding the date of application. If neither criteria apply, the formula considers the parent who provided greater support in the most recent calendar year. If the parent has remarried, both the parent and stepparent's financial resources are considered. Child support received is considered untaxed income for the recipient parent. Money paid to or on behalf of a child from a noncustodial parent outside of a legal child support agreement is considered untaxed income for the student. Available income for parents of dependent students is calculated by subtracting total allowances from total income, including Income Protection Allowance (IPA), federal income taxes, payroll taxes, and state taxes. The IPA for a family of four with one college student in AY2018-2019 is $28,170. In AY 2018-2019, the allowance for parents of dependent students is based on total income and state of residence, ranging from 1% to 8%. Employment expense allowance (EEA) is an additional allowance for families with working parents. Available assets for parents are total assets minus the asset protection allowance (APA), with a 12% asset conversion rate for adjusted available income. Adjusted available income (AAI) for parents is calculated as 100% of parental available income plus 12% of parental available assets. AAI for parents of dependent students is assessed at progressive rates, with the parental contribution divided by the number of students enrolled in college. Higher assessment rates apply to the portion of AAI above the threshold, similar to the income tax system. For example, a parental unit with one student in college and an AAI of $22,000 in AY2018-2019 would have the first $16,400 assessed at 22%. The parental contribution to the EFC is calculated based on adjusted available income (AAI) and assets. AAI is assessed at progressive rates, with higher rates applying to income above certain thresholds. For example, a parental unit with an AAI of $22,000 would have portions assessed at 22%, 25%, and 29%. Additional income and assets have different effects on the EFC, with a $100 increase in income resulting in a $47 increase in the parental contribution. The EFC formula for a dependent student considers the parents' financial resources and the student's personal financial resources. Financial support from parents reported on the FAFSA is not considered in calculating a dependent student's income or assets. Dependent students' available income is total income minus allowances, including Income Protection Allowance (IPA) and allowances for federal and payroll taxes. The EFC formula for dependent students considers income and assets, including allowances for federal, payroll, state, and other taxes. The assessment rate for available income is 50%, with a 20% rate for total assets. Education savings accounts are treated as parental assets. The education savings account is considered a parental asset, leading to a more favorable treatment than if assessed as a dependent student's asset. The EFC calculation for dependent students includes contributions from income and assets, with parental contribution divided by the number of students expected to enroll. Independent students without dependents consider their own financial resources and, if applicable, their spouse's. Total income and assets for married students are calculated separately. The section describes the formula for independent students without dependents, including income allowances such as Income Protection Allowance and federal income taxes. Married students are considered a single unit for income and asset calculations. The allowance for federal income taxes, payroll taxes, state and other taxes, and employment expenses are determined based on the applicant's total income and state of residence. Independent students eligible for the Employment Expense Allowance (EEA) must be married and both spouses must have earnings from work. The contribution from income for independent students without dependents is 50% of available income. Available assets for independent students are total assets minus the Asset Protection Allowance (APA). The asset protection allowance (APA) for independent students is based on marital status and age. APA levels are the same as for parents of dependent students, with the age variable aligning with the student's age. The asset conversion rate for independent students without dependents is 20%, contributing to the EFC along with income. EFC is calculated as 50% of available income and 20% of available assets. If both the student and spouse are enrolled, each student's EFC is divided by two. The EFC calculation for independent students with dependents considers the financial resources of the student and spouse as a single unit. Income or assets of dependents are not included in the formula. Those who qualify for the simplified needs test and automatic zero EFC are exempt from the formula. Definitions for terms are provided in the report's Appendix A. In AY2018-2019, detailed definitions for terms related to available income and allowances against income are provided in Appendix A of the report. The allowances include Income Protection Allowance (IPA), Federal Income Taxes, Payroll Taxes, State and Other Taxes, and Employment Expense Allowance (EEA). IPA is based on household size and college students, while other allowances are determined by actual taxes paid and total income. Adjusted available income (AAI) for independent students is calculated based on total income exceeding allowances, available assets minus the asset protection allowance (APA), and a 7% asset conversion rate. AAI includes 100% of available income and 7% of available assets for the student and spouse, if applicable. Adjusted available income (AAI) is calculated for independent students based on total income exceeding allowances and available assets minus the asset protection allowance (APA). AAI is assessed at a progressive rate to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC is divided by the number of students in the family if more than one is enrolled in college. Higher assessment rates apply to the portion of AAI above the threshold, with different levels and corresponding contributions outlined in Table 3. Assets are assessed in two stages with a 7% conversion rate. The 7% asset conversion in the prior step means that additional dollars of income have a larger effect on the EFC than additional dollars of assets. For example, if available income increases by $100, the EFC will increase by $47, but if available assets increase by $100, the EFC will only increase by $3.29. In some cases, the EFC formulas may not accurately reflect a family's ability to contribute to educational expenses. The Higher Education Act allows financial aid administrators to use professional judgment to adjust the cost of attendance for special circumstances, such as high medical expenses or job loss. The family recently experienced a job loss or other significant income changes. When using professional judgment, the administrator can adjust input data to more accurately reflect the family's financial situation. In rare cases, a student may be classified as independent through a dependency override, but not solely based on self-sufficiency or parental refusal to provide information. Dependency overrides can be triggered by abandonment, abuse, or inability to locate parents. FAA must document evidence for audit purposes. Detailed definitions and formula factors for EFC are provided in Appendix A for AY2018-2019. Total income includes adjusted gross income and untaxed income. Total Income is calculated based on three factors: adjusted gross income (AGI), untaxed income, and excludable income. AGI is the sum of income considered for federal taxation, sourced from the prior year's tax return. Untaxed income includes certain forms of income excluded from federal taxation, such as child support, pension contributions, and IRA deductions. The curr_chunk discusses various types of income and benefits that are not included in the calculation of Total Income for financial aid purposes, such as deductions and payments to retirement plans, tax-exempt interest income, military and clergy allowances, veterans noneducation benefits, and other miscellaneous income sources. Excludable income for federal student aid purposes includes education tax credits and child support payments made by the student or parent. This income is subtracted from the total adjusted gross income and untaxed income. Excludable income for federal student aid purposes includes education tax credits, child support paid due to divorce or legal requirement, taxable earnings from need-based employment programs, student grant and scholarship aid, taxable combat pay, and earnings from cooperative education programs. Allowances against income offset total income to exempt some or all of it from contributing to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Income Protection Allowance (IPA) is one of the five allowances against income that exempt non-discretionary income from the EFC calculation. It is designed to exclude income for basic living expenses and varies by dependency status. The Income Protection Allowance (IPA) contributes to the applicant's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and is determined by dependency status, family size, and the number of students in college. IPA levels are set by statute and updated annually, with increases based on projected inflation levels. The most recent specified IPA levels were in AY2012-2013, with subsequent annual inflationary increases. Allowance Against Income #2 accounts for federal income taxes based on tax return information. The FAFSA allows applicants to estimate income taxes if tax returns have not been filed yet. Allowances for federal payroll taxes and state/other taxes are calculated based on earnings and total income, respectively. Each earner's payroll tax allowance is calculated separately. The Employment Expense Allowance (EEA) provides an additional allowance to households with earnings from work, varying based on dependency status. It is available to parents of dependent students, married independent students without dependents, and independent students with dependents. The EEA is not available to dependent students themselves or unmarried individuals. The Employment Expense Allowance (EEA) provides an additional allowance to households with earnings from work, varying based on dependency status. It is available to parents of dependent students, married independent students without dependents, and independent students with dependents. The maximum EEA is 35% of the earnings of the lower-earning adult or $4,000, whichever is less. Available income is the difference between total income and the sum of the five allowances against income. Total assets are considered when applicants do not qualify for the simplified needs test (SNT). Applicants who do qualify for the SNT do not have to provide asset information for federal student aid purposes. The report defines assets as cash on hand, investments, real estate, and business assets. Exemptions from asset calculations include home equity, retirement accounts, and family-owned businesses. The EFC formulas exclude certain assets from a family's total, such as small businesses with up to 100 employees owned by the family. Tangible items like cars and jewelry are not considered assets. Non-exempt businesses or farms are adjusted to be valued at less than 100% of their worth, with a progressive rate adjustment. Education savings accounts, like 529 accounts, are counted as assets in EFC calculations. Education savings accounts owned by dependent students are considered assets of the parents, resulting in a lower EFC. Disbursements from these accounts are not reported on the FAFSA. Accounts not owned by a student or parent are considered untaxed income. The Education Savings and Asset Protection Allowance provides an allowance against assets for EFC calculation. The Education Savings and Asset Protection Allowance (APA) provides a single allowance against assets for EFC calculation. The APA varies by age and marital status of the student or parent, increasing with age. APA levels are set by statute and updated annually by ED. Dependent students' assets are assessed from the \"first dollar\" except for education savings accounts. APA updates are published in the Federal Register alongside income allowances. The APA level for each age cohort is determined by the present value cost of an annuity providing supplemental income at age 65. Inflation is presumed to be 6 percent per year, with a rate of return of 8 percent for the annuity. Allowances are adjusted based on age, decreasing for those below age 40. The APA is calculated based on the difference between \"moderate family income\" and \"current average Social Security benefits,\" with a presumed inflation rate of 6 percent and a rate of return of 8 percent for the annuity. The APA can rise or fall from year to year based on changes in the difference between family incomes and Social Security benefits. Security benefits have increased faster than family incomes, reducing the difference between the two and resulting in a corresponding reduction in the APA. Available assets are the difference between an applicant's total assets and the asset protection allowance. The asset conversion rate determines the contribution from assets towards the EFC calculation. Adjusted Available Income (AAI) is an intermediate step in the process. Adjusted Available Income (AAI) is a calculation performed for parents of dependent students and independent students with dependents. It is the sum of available income and the product of available assets and the asset conversion rate. The assessment rate determines the portion of income or assets contributing to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The assessment rate is the portion of income or assets that contributes to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for students. Legislative history shows the evolution of determining financial need in federal student aid since the Higher Education Act in 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 established need-based aid programs under Title IV, now known as the Department of Education. These programs, collectively referred to as \"Title IV programs,\" included Educational Opportunity Grants for students with exceptional financial need. Granting institutions were responsible for determining student need and awarding grants, with the Commissioner of Education providing criteria for grant amounts. The 1972 amendments to the Higher Education Act established the term \"expected family contribution\" for need-based grants, without specifying a formula. The amendments required the Office of Education to publish an annual family contribution schedule based on factors like income and assets. The Education Amendments of 1980 established a revised need analysis system for Title IV programs, including Pell Grants. Interested parties could provide feedback on the schedule before its final publication. Congressional direction was increased, but decision-making authority still rested with the Department of Education. Various legislation later modified the need analysis provisions, creating separate systems for Pell Grants and other programs. The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 (P.L. 99-498) made significant changes to the need analysis system by establishing separate formulas for Pell Grants and other Title IV programs. Congress specified factors and treatment in statute, moving away from providing guidelines to the Department of Education. The 1986 amendments established separate formulas for Pell Grants and other Title IV programs, specifying factors and treatments in statute. Dependency statuses were categorized for students based on income and assets, with criteria for independence including age and tax dependency status. Both the Pell Formula and Part F Formula followed a similar process for determining student status. The Pell Formula and Part F Formula determine financial resources by calculating total income and assets, subtracting allowances, and assessing excess resources. They consider family size and college members, but differ in treatment of assets. The 1986 amendments introduced a simplified needs test for eligible applicants. The 1986 amendments introduced a simplified needs test for eligible applicants for the SNT, requiring less financial information and no asset details. The 1992 amendments merged need analysis systems to create a single EFC system for all Title IV programs, changing the factors considered in the formula. The 1992 amendments created the FAFSA as a standardized data collection tool for federal student aid, replacing multiple forms used by different entities. It specified that the application would be distributed and processed at no cost to students, and that data must be provided to states and institutions for free. The 1992 amendments established the FAFSA as a standardized tool for federal student aid, requiring student data to be provided to states and institutions at no cost. Changes were made to formulas to combine prior legislation, including adjustments to the Pell Formula and Part F Formula. Additionally, the law allows for the inclusion of nonfederal aid questions on the FAFSA to incentivize its use in aid decisions. The 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act made significant changes to the EFC formula, including eliminating home equity from consideration and the provision for establishing independence based on \"total self-sufficiency.\" Since then, the HEA has been reauthorized multiple times, with incremental changes to the EFC formula through laws like the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and the College Costs Reduction Act of 2008. These changes have not had systemic effects on the scale of prior reauthorizations. The post-1992 changes to the need analysis formulas have primarily focused on adjusting income protection allowances and qualifications for alternative formulas, resulting in lower EFCs for some students. Non-numeric changes include protocols for enrollment periods and expanded use of professional judgment for special circumstances."
