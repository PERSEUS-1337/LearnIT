The Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually on a competitive basis for eligible applicants. The total number of awards granted each academic year will increase from 22,500 in 2015-16 to 100,000 in 2018-19 and beyond. The Cal Grant A and B awards are granted annually on a competitive basis. The total number of awards will increase to 100,000 for the 2018-19 academic year and beyond. Fifty percent of the awards are available to all students meeting financial and academic requirements, with a March 2 deadline for baccalaureate degree granting institutions and a September 2 deadline for California community college students. The remaining fifty percent are reserved for California community college students, with a September 2 application deadline. The commission will distribute any remaining awards to eligible students based on financial need and academic merit, following criteria set by the commission. The commission will establish selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards, giving special consideration to disadvantaged students. Additional consideration will be given to students reestablishing their grade point averages and those who did not receive awards in previous articles. All eligible students can compete for awards under this article by meeting specific requirements outlined in the Education Code. To qualify for a competitive Cal Grant A award, applicants must meet certain criteria, including a minimum GPA of 2.4 on a 4.0 scale. To compete for a Cal Grant B award, applicants must meet requirements outlined in the Education Code, excluding specific GPA criteria. Instead, they can demonstrate a GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale or complete 16 units of coursework at a California community college with a 2.0 GPA.

The award can be transferred to a tuition-charging institution if all requirements are met, with reassessment of financial need by the commission. The commission may reassess the financial need of the award recipient and prescribe forms and procedures. Recipient's eligibility for benefits is based on grade level at transfer to a qualifying institution. Awards held in reserve count once towards authorized number."
