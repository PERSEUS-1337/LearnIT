    "content": "The \"Vote by Mail Act of 2006\" may be cited as the short title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, voting technology failures and procedural irregularities deprived some Americans of their right to vote. Faulty punch card ballots and equipment failures prevented accurate vote counts, leading to an estimated 1,500,000 uncounted votes in the 2000 election. Software errors and malfunctioning electronic systems also affected the 2004 election. In the 2004 election, software errors, malfunctioning electronic voting systems, and long lines at the polls caused inaccurate vote counts and prevented some people from voting. For example, voters at Kenyon College in Ohio waited up to 12 hours due to limited machines for 1,300 voters. Oregon's Vote by Mail system mails ballots to registered voters at least 2 weeks before election day. Voters mark and seal their ballots before returning them by mail or drop boxes for scanning and verification by election officials. Oregon's Vote by Mail system ensures ballot authenticity through signature verification on the ballot envelope. The system has low voter fraud rates due to security measures and penalties for misconduct. Vote by Mail contributes to higher voter turnout in Oregon compared to the national average. Oregon's Vote by Mail system has led to a record voter turnout, with 70.6% of voting-age-eligible population participating in the 2004 presidential election. This is higher than the national average of 58.4%. Registered voters in Oregon had a turnout of 86.48% in that election. Women, younger voters, and homemakers tend to vote more often using Vote by Mail. The system also reduces election costs by 30% by eliminating the need for transporting equipment to polling stations and hiring/training poll workers. Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves by providing ample time to research issues and study ballots before election day. Vote by Mail is accurate and results in more up-to-date voter rolls. It allows voters to visually verify their votes and has high preference among Oregon voters. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
