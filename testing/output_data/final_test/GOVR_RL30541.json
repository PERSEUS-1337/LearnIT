    "content": "U.S. assistance to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts has increased steadily since FY1995, with most funding supporting tracking, interdiction, and eradication of traffickers. The State Department's INL has been the primary agency involved, providing equipment and aid to the Colombian military and police. Additionally, funding has supported reforms to the judicial system and alternative development. The INL coordinates activities with other agencies like the DEA, USAID, and FBI in the narcotics crop eradication program in South America, particularly in Colombia. They work on improving law enforcement capabilities, criminal justice procedures, and justice system accessibility in Colombia. The DOD also provides funding and support for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, focusing on detecting and monitoring illicit narcotics operations. DOD supports efforts to detect and monitor illicit narcotics operations in Colombia by maintaining radar sites and conducting surveillance overflights. They helped establish a special Colombian Army counternarcotics battalion and sponsor a riverine CN program for the Colombian Navy and Marines. The U.S. military has provided support to the Colombian military and police through various means. The United States has provided substantial equipment and funded the construction of the Joint Intelligence Center in Colombia to support the military and police. Critics argue that the aid, intended for counternarcotics, can also be used for counterinsurgency efforts. Allegations of covert assistance for counternarcotics and counterinsurgency operations have been reported. The Clinton Administration denied providing counterinsurgency assistance in Colombia but acknowledged that some U.S. counternarcotics training could be applied to counterinsurgency operations. They expanded intelligence support to Colombian security forces in March 1999. The United States provided intelligence to Colombian security forces, specifically to a police-military Joint Task Force for counternarcotics operations. However, there was no system in place to ensure the information was used solely for counternarcotics purposes. (Source: General Accounting Office) The United States provides foreign assistance, goods, and services to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts. This includes funding from various U.S. government programs, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for joint operations. Additionally, some funds from the Department of Defense (DOD) are allocated for counternarcotics activities in Colombia. Funding for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia is allocated from various U.S. government programs, including sections 124, 1004, and 1033. In FY1999, $173.2 million was allocated for helicopters, upgrades, radar, and police assistance. State Department transferred non-DOD Plan Colombia funds to other agencies for programs in Colombia. AID funding in FY1999 included disaster relief and Economic Support Funds (ESF). AID pipeline funding from previous years was expended in FY1999. FY2000 and FY2001 AID funding is all ESF. The Clinton Administration proposed over $954 million in supplemental FY2000 funding and over $318 million for FY2001 spending to support the Colombian government's \"Plan Colombia.\" The proposal included the \"Push into Southern Colombia\" program to extend counternarcotics activities in the region where coca cultivation was rapidly expanding. The Southern Colombia program aimed to expand counternarcotics activities in the region by training new army battalions, purchasing helicopters for transportation, and providing funding for alternative economic opportunities. The total funding requested was $512 million in FY2000 and $88 million in FY2001, with $31 million allocated for AID to support peasants affected by the operations. The Push into Southern Colombia program aimed to expand counternarcotics efforts in the region through various assistance categories, including drug trafficking interdiction, improving eradication capabilities, economic development, boosting government capacity, and other economic and peace process assistance. This program was part of a planned six-year counternarcotics effort outlined by Gen Charles E. Wilhelm. The Colombian security forces are implementing a three-phase counternarcotics plan. The second phase focuses on Meta and Guaviare provinces, while the third phase will move to Santander and other provinces.

Six new limitations were placed on funding for Plan Colombia, and one restriction was placed on the use of other funds for the same purpose. The law imposed limitations on the use of helicopters procured with funding for aiding illegal self-defense groups. It also set personnel caps for U.S. military and civilian contractors supporting Plan Colombia, requiring Congress' approval through a joint resolution. Military personnel not directly supporting Plan Colombia were exempt from these caps. The funding cap for Department of Defense assistance under Plan Colombia was set at $45 million, with limitations on the types of support allowed. Aid was restricted to non-lethal assistance such as equipment and parts for aircraft and patrol boats. Section 3205 prohibits the State Department from issuing visas to individuals linked to FARC, ELN, or AUC. The President can waive this restriction for national interest. Section 3206 makes funding under Plan Colombia subject to population planning restrictions.

The State Department submitted a report to Congress on human rights certifications for Colombian assistance. The Colombian Armed Forces must meet six human rights criteria, including bringing personnel accused of gross violations to civilian courts and cooperating with civilian authorities in investigations and prosecutions. The Colombian government vigorously prosecuted leaders and members of paramilitary groups for gross violations of human rights. The Colombian Armed Forces also deployed a Judge Advocate General Corps to investigate misconduct. The President could waive compliance with these conditions if deemed in the national interest, after consulting with human rights groups. Subsequent reports on compliance with human rights conditions were expected regarding military and paramilitary members. The Clinton Administration waived five of the six human rights certification requirements in Colombia, after the State Department determined the criteria were met. The reports on compliance with human rights conditions were to cover investigations and prosecutions of attacks against human rights defenders, displaced civilians in Southern Colombia, and actions to promote a negotiated settlement of the conflict. The Clinton Administration waived five of the six human rights certification requirements in Colombia after the State Department determined the criteria were met. The Colombian government was actively taking steps to meet the remaining conditions, but more work needed to be done. The Administration submitted a 60-day report on September 11, 2000. The Clinton Administration submitted a 60-day report on September 11, 2000, and determined that a second certification was not required in January 2001.

The Bush Administration was still processing the report required in March 2001. The Bush Administration was processing the report required in March 2001 for the certification on Colombian Drug Strategy, which included conditions for funding related to coca and opium poppy production elimination by 2005. The President waived this requirement in August 2001 under Plan Colombia. The Colombian Government in Plan Colombia aims to eliminate 50 percent of drug crop cultivation within five years, which is seen as a significant, realistic, and obtainable target. Total elimination of coca and poppy production by 2005 would require more resources than currently planned. Certification of U.S. support for Colombia's efforts must align with human rights conditions and be necessary to resolve conflicts with guerrillas and paramilitaries. The conferees wanted a discussion on actions taken by the United States and the Colombian government to promote a negotiated settlement of the Colombian conflict, as part of follow-up reports on human rights conditions. Clinton Administration submitted a certification in mid-August 2000 regarding preparedness effects and the uses of equipment and materiel. The Secretary of Defense must certify to committees on matters related to support provisions for Colombia, ensuring no adverse effects on U.S. Armed Forces' preparedness. Equipment provided must be used by approved government officials for counter-drug activities only, with strict controls on transfer and usage. The recipient government must have systems in place to account for equipment and personnel. The Clinton Administration took action to ensure oversight and accountability for equipment and personnel provided to the recipient government.

Reports on private contractors supporting Plan Colombia were to be submitted monthly, identifying firms, American citizens abroad, and personnel in the region. The first report was submitted in January 2001, with subsequent reports prepared. Within 60 days of enactment, the President was required to submit a report to foreign affairs and appropriations committees on U.S. counternarcotics assistance for Colombia and neighboring countries. The report was to include key objectives, benchmarks, actions needed to advance objectives, U.S. role in Colombian counternarcotics efforts, relationship to global strategy, schedule for support, and operational plans for Forward Operating Locations. The Clinton Administration submitted a report on the effects of herbicides used in Colombia, stating that glyphosate and other ingredients are safe when used according to label instructions.

The Bush Administration is preparing the report. A report on the costs of supporting Plan Colombia must be submitted by specific deadlines. The costs of supporting Plan Colombia under Section 3204 (e) are being prepared for approval by the President. If specified caps on military personnel and contractors in Colombia are exceeded, a report must be submitted to Congress. This is in accordance with the provisions of the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act extends DOD authority for counternarcotics assistance to Colombia until FY2006. The cap on assistance remains at $20 million for both Peru and Colombia combined. Reporting requirements for counterdrug assistance were also established. The conferees set reporting requirements for counterdrug assistance in the FY2001 National Defense Authorization Act. These requirements included a report on FY2000 expenditures, a recommendation on expanding authority to other countries, and a report on the Section 1033 riverine program. The limitation on the number of armed forces personnel in Colombia was not included, except for specific circumstances. The \"Leahy Amendments\" restrict funding in foreign operations appropriations acts, prohibiting assistance to units of foreign security forces that have committed gross violations of human rights. This provision was included in the FY2001 Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Congress first attached the restriction to Department of Defense appropriations in FY1999 and extended it in FY2000 and FY2001 legislation. The Leahy Amendments in foreign operations appropriations acts prohibit funding for units of foreign security forces that have committed gross human rights violations. This provision was included in the FY2001 Foreign Operations appropriations bill and has been extended in previous legislation. The Leahy Amendment prohibits funding for foreign security forces involved in gross human rights violations. The Secretary of State must inform the foreign government if funds are withheld and assist in bringing responsible members of the security forces to justice.
