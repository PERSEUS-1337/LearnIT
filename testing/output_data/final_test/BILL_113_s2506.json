    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Correctly Recognizing Educational Achievements To Empower Graduates Act\" or the \"CREATE Graduates Act.\" It introduces a new section called \"CREATE Graduates\" in the Higher Education Act of 1965, with a stated purpose. The \"CREATE Graduates Act\" aims to award grants to States to increase postsecondary degree attainment by locating students eligible for an associate's degree, providing outreach to those close to earning a degree, and establishing partnerships between 2-year and 4-year institutions to facilitate transfer pathways. Grants are provided to support efforts at institutions of higher education in achieving these goals. The \"CREATE Graduates Act\" defines an institution of higher education and authorizes grants to States for activities supporting degree attainment. States can partner with nonprofits, with the State agency serving as the fiscal agent. Applications must be submitted outlining the proposed activities. The State, through the State higher education agency, must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant program, detailing capacity to administer the grant and meet program purposes. The State higher education agency must submit an application detailing capacity to administer the grant program and meet its purposes, including outreach to institutions of higher education, coordination with stakeholders, and the structure for administering activities and services. The State's longitudinal data system must have the capacity to ensure clean records, alignment of credit completion records, transfer flags, course and credit data, and postsecondary educational information. The State's longitudinal data system must include mechanisms to share data across institutions, systems, and states, and have the capacity to respond to data requests accurately and in a timely manner. Additionally, the State must have a plan to protect postsecondary educational information. The Secretary will award grants to States based on the quality of applications submitted, giving priority to States with strong plans to protect student privacy and develop administrative capacity. The Secretary will prioritize applications from States without existing statewide policies for retroactively awarding associate's degrees or with ongoing commitments to such initiatives. States receiving grants must use at least 80% of funds to award subgrants to higher education institutions for specified activities. The institution of higher education must identify a group of current and former students who have earned at least 60 postsecondary credit hours and have not received any postsecondary degree. The institution of higher education must identify current and former students who have not earned an associate's or bachelor's degree elsewhere. A degree audit is then performed to determine if the student is eligible for an associate's degree, eligible with completion of 12 or fewer credit hours, or not eligible for either. The institution of higher education must identify students for degree completion. Outreach is provided to students for degree attainment, including financial aid options. Application process for subgrant submission to the State includes a written commitment from the institution. The institution or system must provide a written commitment to carry out grant activities. States prioritize applications from higher education institutions with up-to-date degree audit software, opt-out policies for associate's degrees, and waivers for nonacademic barriers to graduation. The institution or system must provide written commitments to carry out grant activities, including waiving residency and recency requirements, providing tuition waivers or prior learning assessments, conducting degree audits for students after earning 45 credits, and reminding students of graduation deadlines. The institution must provide written commitments for grant activities, including waiving requirements, providing tuition waivers, conducting degree audits, and reminding students of graduation deadlines. States can use grant funds for administrative purposes and creating articulation agreements between 2-year and 4-year institutions. Special Conditions and Prohibitions for institutions receiving grants under this section include not charging students additional fees to participate in supported activities, not using funds for purposes outside the grant goals, and complying with FERPA requirements. The institution receiving a grant must ensure that any outside entity assisting with grant activities complies with FERPA requirements. States receiving grants must coordinate activities to minimize duplication. The State receiving a grant must submit an annual report to the Secretary on activities and services provided under the grant, including information on the number of students identified, removed, and degree audits performed. The State must report on the number of students eligible for an associate's degree, including those who can obtain it with 12 or fewer credits, those ineligible for the degree, and those who were awarded the degree. The State must report on various data points related to students eligible for an associate's degree, including those returning after outreach, average credit hours earned, students declining the degree, students not located, and reasons for non-returning students. The report must include details of any policy changes resulting from the program and degree audits. Information should be disaggregated by age, gender, race, disability status, and socioeconomic status. The Secretary has enforcement provisions to withhold funds after a hearing if necessary. The Secretary has enforcement provisions to withhold or recover funds from a State or institution of higher education that fails to comply with the requirements of the grant. Recovered funds are credited back to the appropriations account for future use. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years for the program under this section."
