    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Fund for Health Research Act\". Congress acknowledges the need for increased funding in health research, citing that a large portion of worthy projects are not funded, only a small percentage of healthcare spending is allocated to research compared to the defense industry, public opinion supports more federal resources for health research, and past research has significantly improved healthcare in the United States. Health research has led to advancements in protecting the blood supply from HIV, progress against cardiovascular diseases, and new strategies for detecting and treating cancers. It holds the promise of preventing injuries and diseases, reducing healthcare costs in the long term. Expanded medical research is crucial for controlling Medicare costs by delaying debilitating conditions like Alzheimer's. The deteriorating state of research facilities at the National Institutes of Health and universities requires urgent renovation and repair to maintain research quality. With declining discretionary spending, there is a need for a health research fund to sustain the Nation's commitment and increase funding for approved projects at the National Institutes of Health. Americans purchase health insurance and participate in the medicare program to protect against the high cost of illness and disability. Devoting 1 cent of every health insurance dollar to medical research for preventions, cures, and improved treatments makes sense. Establishment of Fund for medical research purposes.
