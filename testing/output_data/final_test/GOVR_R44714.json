Recent events, such as the death of Fidel Castro and concerns about changes in U.S. migration policy, have led to increased attention on migration issues. The Cuban Revolution in 1959 marked the end of normal immigration from Cuba to the United States. Since the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuban migration to the United States has been unique. Most Cubans entered the U.S. through special humanitarian provisions, like the parole provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act. They were considered refugees fleeing persecution. The Refugee Act of 1980 added provisions on refugee admissions and asylum to the INA. The INA parole provision was used during the Mariel Boatlift, bringing Cubans and Haitians to South Florida. The Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans in the U.S. for at least one year to adjust to lawful permanent resident status. The Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) allows Cuban nationals in the U.S. for at least one year to become lawful permanent residents without sponsorship. It applies to Cubans already present in the U.S. and is separate from policies regarding Cuban migrants trying to reach the U.S. The Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) allows Cuban nationals in the U.S. for at least one year to become lawful permanent residents without sponsorship. In FY2014, about 40,000 Cubans adjusted to LPR status under the CAA. The CAA reflects a belief that Cuban migrants are refugees under international law, and there have been legislative efforts to repeal it. The 1994 migration agreement between Cuba and the United States aimed to normalize migration by promoting safe and orderly migration. Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures, while the US agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants annually. Cuban migrants rescued at sea would not be allowed to enter the US but taken to safe-haven camps instead. The agreement is part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The 1995 migration agreement between Cuba and the United States continued the 1994 accord, focusing on the treatment of intercepted Cubans at sea. A \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy was established, where Cubans who reach U.S. shores are considered for immigration parole, while those intercepted at sea are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution. Recent increases in unauthorized immigration from Cuba to the United States are attributed to concerns that the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy allowing Cubans who reach U.S. shores to stay may change. Those permitted to stay are granted parole and can apply for LPR status under the CAA after one year. Since FY2013, there has been a notable increase in U.S. Coast Guard maritime interdictions, Border Patrol apprehensions, and unauthorized Cubans presenting themselves at U.S. ports of entry. The Coast Guard intercepts unauthorized migrants at sea before they reach the U.S., with the number of Cuban interdictions steadily rising since 2010. The number of maritime interdictions and Border Patrol apprehensions of Cubans has been consistently increasing since 2010. Between FY2013 and FY2016, maritime interdictions increased nearly fourfold, from 1,357 to 5,213. Border Patrol apprehensions of Cubans also rose more than threefold during the same period, from 624 to 1,930. These encounters mainly occur in U.S. coastal areas. The number of Cubans encountered at official U.S. ports of entry has been increasing annually since FY2009, with a significant rise between FY2014 and FY2016. Most inadmissible Cubans arrive at land ports of entry along the southwest border, and they can access pathways to permanent residence in the United States. Cuban asylum seekers can apply for asylum within the United States or at a U.S. port of entry, or be considered for refugee status abroad. Certain Cubans, including human rights activists and persecuted religious minorities, can apply for the U.S. refugee program while still in Cuba. Refugees can apply for LPR status after one year, and U.S. citizens and LPRs can petition for eligible family members in Cuba to become LPRs. Annual numbers of refugee admissions from Cuba to the United States have varied over the years. Annual refugee admissions from Cuba to the United States have fluctuated over the years, with numbers consistently below 5,000 since FY1996. Asylum grants to Cubans have been significantly lower, with fewer than 100 granted asylum each year between FY2002 and FY2014. The Refugee Act of 1980 established processes for refugee admission and asylum grants, along with federal assistance for refugee resettlement. The Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 defined \"Cuban and Haitian entrant\" for eligibility for federal assistance, including parolees from Cuba and Haiti without other immigration status. The law defined \"Cuban and Haitian entrant\" for federal assistance eligibility, including those with pending asylum applications and no final removal order. The President was directed to provide similar benefits as refugees, and the PRWORA of 1996 made them eligible for federal benefits like refugees. The Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba have not affected U.S. policy towards Cuban migrants. The Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) grants discretionary authority to adjust the status of eligible Cubans, with potential for future policy changes through executive or congressional action. Bills introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to repeal the CAA, which could eliminate the special adjustment of status pathway for Cubans. The Obama Administration's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba have not affected U.S. policy towards Cuban migrants. The Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) grants discretionary authority to adjust the status of eligible Cubans, with potential for future policy changes through executive or congressional action. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to eliminate special treatment for Cuban entrants in federal refugee resettlement assistance and other federal aid, but this would not directly impact Cubans' ability to enter the U.S. or adjust status under the CAA. Data on unauthorized Cuban migration to the U.S. is provided through figures on U.S. Coast Guard interdictions, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, and inadmissible Cubans encountered at U.S. ports of entry. The recent increases in unauthorized Cuban migration to the U.S. are attributed to concerns about potential changes in U.S. treatment of Cuban migrants. Various factors such as U.S. economic conditions and migration-related policies have contributed to annual fluctuations in migration numbers."
