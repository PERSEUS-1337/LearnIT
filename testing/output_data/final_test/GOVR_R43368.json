    "content": "The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires agencies to obtain full and open competition when awarding contracts. However, agencies can assign work to vendors without awarding a contract, such as through task or delivery orders under existing contracts like indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. These contracts allow the government to issue orders for supplies or services as needed within the contract's scope. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires agencies to ensure full and open competition when awarding contracts. Agencies can use ID/IQ contracts to assign work to vendors without a new contract. Multiple-award ID/IQ contracts allow fair opportunity for vendors to compete for orders. CGI Federal was selected as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov's rollout under an ID/IQ contract for IT services. The legal authority allows agencies to consider past performance of predecessor firms and key employees when selecting vendors in certain procurements. This information must be indicated in the solicitation and cannot be considered on an ad hoc basis. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires agencies to consider the currency and relevance of this information. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) mandates that agencies consider the currency, relevance, and source of information when evaluating vendors for contracts. Performance issues of a vendor or its predecessor firm may not automatically result in a downgrade in past performance evaluations. Factors such as capacity to perform and satisfactory performance records are also considered in determining a vendor's responsibility before awarding a contract. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires agencies to assess vendors' performance records, organization, experience, and technical skills before awarding contracts. Predecessor firms and key employees' performance may be considered, but agencies are not obligated to do so. The President's influence over agency decisions is limited by the FAR's prohibition on favoring contractors based on political ties. The FAR prohibits favoring contractors based on political ties to ensure impartiality in government business dealings. Conflict of interest is strictly prohibited to maintain integrity in relationships between the government and contractors. The FAR provision prohibits favorable treatment and conflict of interest in vendor selection to ensure impartiality and integrity in government business dealings. Federal procurement law limits preferential treatment to contractors and requires fair competition in awarding contracts. Foreign participation in federal procurement is also restricted. The Buy American Act restricts federal agencies to purchase domestic end products for public use, but services procured for HealthCare.gov are not subject to this restriction. While some restrictions limit agencies from contracting with vendors with foreign parents, these restrictions are narrow in scope. The Buy American Act restricts federal agencies from purchasing foreign products for public use, but services procured for HealthCare.gov are not subject to this restriction. Some restrictions limit agencies from contracting with vendors with foreign parents in certain circumstances, such as national security interests or domestic capabilities. One HealthCare.gov contractor was found ineligible for work due to proposing the use of foreign nationals under H1-B visas. According to news reports, CMS plans to replace CGI Federal with Accenture on a one-year contract worth $90 million to oversee HealthCare.gov. The contract was awarded on a sole-source basis due to time constraints, despite the usual requirement for competitive procedures under CICA. The executive agency may award contracts on a sole-source basis in certain circumstances, such as when there is only one responsible source available, or when there is an unusual and compelling urgency. Additional statutory and regulatory requirements may apply, and the head of the agency must notify Congress in writing at least 30 days before awarding the contract. The Contracting Officer must limit the duration of a contract to one year, or as needed to meet specific work requirements. The agency must solicit offers from multiple sources when relying on exceptions for sole-source awards. Time constraints may justify a sole-source award if only one contractor can meet the work requirements. The exception used by CMS for awarding a contract to Accenture has not been publicly disclosed yet. When justifying noncompetitive procedures for federal contracts, agencies must provide certified written justifications that may require approval from a government official other than the contracting officer. The Comptroller General reviews these justifications to ensure they provide a \"reasonable basis\" for a sole-source award. While federal contracts are generally not publicly available, Members of Congress and the public can request copies from the contracting agency under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which applies to government procurement. The FOIA applies to government procurement, allowing requests for contracts, which may be denied based on exemptions. However, obtaining a contract may not determine fault due to ambiguous language or waived requirements. Legal justifications could also explain failures to perform as required by the contract. Federal statutes and regulations mandate that standard terms be included in government contracts, requiring vendors to report performance-related issues such as exclusions from government contracting, convictions for certain offenses, overpayments, and violations of federal laws. Contractors may also voluntarily disclose issues to present information favorably to the procuring agency. The standard required disclosures for government contracts include reporting exclusions, criminal or civil liability issues, and performance-related issues. Vendors can voluntarily disclose information to the procuring agency to present it favorably. The Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) includes disclosures on exclusions, criminal or civil liability, nonresponsibility determinations, terminations for default, and past performance information from the past five years. Contracting officers consult FAPIIS to determine vendor responsibility, but there are restrictions on how the disclosed information can be used. Vendors are responsible, but contracting officers are limited in considering past performance information over three years old. Changes were made to HealthCare.gov before and after its rollout, some to meet contractual requirements, others altering the terms of the contract. Parties to a contract can agree to changes. Parties to a contract can agree to changes in the contract terms, either through bilateral modifications or unilateral changes permitted by Changes Clauses. These changes may result in adjustments to the contract price or performance time. The government may receive a price reduction for deleting work from a contract, while contractors may seek an increase for added work. Disagreements over contract performance, like those between CMS and its vendors for HealthCare.gov, can lead to claims under the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) for payment, contract term adjustments, or other relief. Claims must be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) allows contractors to submit claims to the contracting officer for a decision. The officer must issue a written decision within a specified time frame, which can be appealed to an agency board of contract appeals or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Appeals can further be made to higher courts, leading to a lengthy disputes process. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA) allows contractors to submit claims for review, which can lead to a lengthy disputes process. In some cases, this process can take over 20 years, as seen in General Dynamics Corporation v. United States. The outcome of any monetary recovery for CMS spending on HealthCare.gov will depend on contract terms and performance. The government's grounds for recovery from contractors depend on their performance as required in the contract. If a contractor fails to perform as required without legal justification, the government may be entitled to costs or damages. Some contracts include terms for liquidated damages or equitable reductions in price for non-performance. The government may recover costs or damages from contractors for non-performance as required in the contract, including through terms for equitable reductions in price. Recovery under the civil False Claims Act is possible for false claims for payment. CMS ended its contractual relationship with CGI Federal in 2014. CMS ended its contractual relationship with CGI Federal in 2014 because the contract's term expired in February, and CMS chose not to extend it. The government has the unilateral right to purchase additional supplies or services or extend the contract term, and the contractor cannot recover lost profits if the government decides not to exercise this option. Executive branch procurement contracts also allow the government to terminate the contract for its convenience or the contractor's default. Some commentators suggest aligning federal IT procurements with private sector practices to prevent issues like HealthCare.gov. Currently, agencies must assess risks, benefits, and costs before entering into IT contracts. Part 39 emphasizes the importance of managing risks associated with schedules, cost, technical feasibility, and dependencies in new projects. It instructs agencies to use appropriate techniques like modular contracting to mitigate risks. Contracting and program officials are jointly responsible for risk management during project selection and implementation. The requirement to use modular contracting for IT systems acquisition, as stated in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, is reiterated. Agencies may also use modular contracting for non-major systems. Part 39 emphasizes risk management in new projects, including the use of modular contracting for IT systems acquisition. It suggests dividing acquisitions into smaller increments and encourages timely contract awards to avoid obsolescence. Opportunities exist to enhance the framework as risk management techniques are encouraged but not required. Modular contracting is required for major systems to the extent practicable, but not for non-major systems. Some commentators suggest that federal agencies could avoid problems like those with HealthCare.gov by using performance-based acquisition (PBA), focusing on achieving results rather than the process. Risk management and modular contracting are encouraged but not required, leaving room for potential errors in deployment. Performance-based acquisition (PBA) focuses on achieving results rather than the process, with benefits such as lessening performance risk and eliminating the need for detailed specifications. The Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA) of 2003 grants agencies temporary authority to treat performance-based contracts for services as contracts for commercial items. Subpart 37.6 of the FAR provides guidance on developing performance work statements, standards, and quality assurance plans. The FAR emphasizes describing work in terms of desired results and enabling assessment against measurable standards. Despite promotion of PBA, agencies have not fully utilized it. The key question is how to encourage greater use of PBA. Some suggest that issues with HeathCare.gov stemmed from using traditional government vendors instead of innovative start-ups or commercial IT firms due to outdated federal contracting processes. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 promotes acquiring \"commercial items,\" but agencies struggle to work with commercial firms due to inflexible terms and conditions. The Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA) of 1996 and the Service Acquisition Reform Act (SARA) of 2003 have expanded the preference for procuring commercial items. However, controversy surrounds the application of these authorities, with concerns about agencies paying higher prices and not obtaining certified cost or pricing data from vendors. Congress has extended certain requirements to commercial vendors since 2003. Some commentators have objected to the erosion of commercial item authorities in IT procurement, which could complicate dealings with commercial vendors. Current law focuses on acquiring commercial items, not specifically using commercial vendors. Critics suggest that relying on a 2007 ID/IQ contract for HealthCare.gov led to issues as only vendors with that contract were considered, excluding potentially innovative ones. ID/IQ contracts allow government to order supplies/services as needed, awarded to multiple vendors for fair opportunity. Congress authorized their use in 1994 under FASA, requiring clear descriptions in solicitations to address concerns of broad scopes. ID/IQ contracts with broad scopes can be used routinely by agencies without competition. Concerns have been raised about contracts with vague relationships between work required and orders placed. Guidance on appropriate use of ID/IQ contracts is limited, with agencies advised to use them for recurring needs. Some suggest requiring IT vendors to post performance bonds, similar to practices in the 1990s. Some states required IT vendors to post performance bonds in the 1990s. The Miller Act of 1935 mandates construction contractors to post performance bonds on federal contracts. However, non-construction contractors are not covered by the Miller Act, and the FAR limits the requirement of performance bonds for non-construction contracts exceeding $150,000 when necessary to protect the Government's interest. Requiring performance bonds for IT contracts can help ensure uninterrupted performance and reduce the risk of contractor default due to insolvency. The government seeks assurance of financial capability from contractors, especially for progress payments and contracts involving dismantling or removal of improvements. Performance bonds are not mandated for non-construction contracts exceeding $150,000 under the FAR, but they are common in the construction industry under the Miller Act of 1935. The use of warranties in federal IT contracts is not mandatory per the FAR, but agencies can use them when appropriate. This could limit vendor competition and increase costs, as seen in the case of HealthCare.gov. Some state governments used express warranties in the 1990s for IT procurement, leading to discussions about similar requirements for federal contracts. The use of warranties in federal IT contracts is not mandatory per the FAR, but agencies can use them when appropriate. Factors influencing appropriateness include the nature of supplies/services, costs, government's ability to enforce, trade practice, and offsetting liability. The FAR encourages reliance on commercial warranties for repair/replacement of commercial items. Requiring express warranties for certain IT systems may seem appealing, but considerations include performance failures like those in HealthCare.gov. The use of express warranties in federal IT contracts is not mandatory according to the FAR. While some suggest that requiring specific warranties for IT systems could prevent performance failures like those seen in HealthCare.gov, it may also increase costs without necessarily improving benefits. Improved recording and consideration of vendors' performance under federal contracts could help agencies avoid such issues. Improved recording and consideration of vendors' performance under federal contracts could help agencies avoid dealings with vendors who have experienced performance problems in the past. Agencies are required to evaluate vendors' performance on contracts valued over $150,000 annually and at the completion of work. The FAR also outlines specific aspects of performance to be evaluated and defines five adjectival ratings for performance descriptions. The FAR requires agencies to evaluate vendors' performance on contracts over $150,000 annually. Performance aspects include product quality, cost control, timeliness, and subcontracting with small businesses. Agencies have discretion in defining past performance, determining relevance, and weighting factors in source selection. Contracting officers can draw reasonable inferences from past performance sources. This framework may be modified for standardization. The current framework for agency evaluations of contractors' past performance allows for modifications to standardize evaluations and consider past performance in source selection. The purpose is to inform agencies' decisions on potential performance risks and offsetting factors like price. Amendments to requirements could impact the number of vendors and costs, but mechanisms could differentiate between vendors with performance problems. Some suggest that vendors should demonstrate overcoming prior performance issues. Some suggest that performance problems, like those experienced by CGI Federal's predecessor firm, should be considered in source-selection decisions and determinations of responsibility and exclusion. Executive agencies are prohibited from contracting with vendors with unsatisfactory performance records. Vendors with serious deficiencies in contract performance are presumed to be nonresponsible. Past failures to perform adequately may also impact vendor responsibility. Failure to meet quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor in determining satisfactory performance. Responsibility determinations address risks of nonperformance on specific contracts, not to exclude poor performers from all dealings with federal agencies. Debarment is used for exclusion purposes, and agencies could engage in de facto debarment if responsibility determination is used to preclude a vendor from government dealings. Subpart 9.4 of the FAR authorizes agencies to debar a contractor for violating government contract terms. Debarment under the FAR is discretionary and is imposed for serious violations of government contract terms. Contractors must be given notice and a hearing before debarment, which is done in the public interest and not for punishment. Some agencies have been criticized for not using their debarment authority effectively. Some agencies have procedures to automatically refer vendors for potential debarment if their contracts are terminated for default. This could lead to increased litigation as vendors may dispute performance problems. However, a vendor with significant performance failures on one contract may not pose risks to other agencies. CMS served as the lead system integrator for HealthCare.gov, raising concerns about their capabilities. Legislation imposed limits on LSIs for the Department of Defense due to vendor discretion concerns, but these restrictions do not apply to civilian agencies like CMS. Congressional and public concerns about LSIs by DOD could potentially lead to performance risks. The decision not to use a lead system integrator with HealthCare.gov may have been influenced by concerns about LSIs raised by Congress and the public. Earlier debates focused on whether LSIs could perform inherently governmental functions, with guidance from the Obama Administration emphasizing the importance of federal employees performing the work and limiting contractors' discretion. The decision not to use a lead system integrator for HealthCare.gov may have been influenced by concerns about LSIs raised by Congress and the public. LSIs were debated for their ability to perform inherently governmental functions, with guidance emphasizing federal employees' role and limiting contractors' discretion. The use of an LSI could have clarified responsibility and reduced oversight to one vendor instead of over 50. However, agency deficiencies in contract administration remain significant regardless of the number of contractors involved."
