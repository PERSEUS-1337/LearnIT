    "content": "The report discusses employment services for noncustodial parents in the Child Support Enforcement program, which operates nationwide. It aims to ensure children receive support from both parents, with a focus on financial assistance. In FY2018, the program served 14.7 million children, with many families below the poverty threshold. Despite slow progress, the program collected 66% of the support due in that year. In FY2018, the Child Support Enforcement program collected 66% of the support due, amounting to $11.5 billion in uncollected arrears. Observers suggest that noncustodial parents' limited ability to pay hinders support collection, emphasizing the importance of NCP employment services. Higher NCP earnings from stable employment correlate with better child support payment compliance, facilitated by income withholding. Low-income NCPs face barriers like low wages hindering consistent employment and support payments. Noncustodial parents face barriers to consistent employment and child support payments, including low wages, irregular jobs, limited education, health issues, and criminal justice history. Child Support Enforcement (CSE) employment programs aim to help NCPs secure employment, leveraging CSE policies as incentives. These programs are not universally available but can improve NCPs' earnings and support payments. CSE employment programs are limited due to insufficient funding, hindering their ability to assist noncustodial parents (NCPs) in securing adequate employment and making child support payments. Observers suggest enacting legislation to address this issue. The report discusses the design of CSE-led employment programs for NCPs and the current federal funding options available. The report discusses the current federal funding options for CSE employment programs, reviews their effectiveness, and highlights proposals for dedicated funding. Eligibility criteria are crucial for determining services for unemployed or underemployed low-income NCPs, with the potential to expand services to other NCPs or prioritize specific cases. The CSE employment programs must decide on eligibility criteria to avoid duplication with other public programs. They can choose between mandatory or voluntary recruitment policies. Courts can order non-custodial parents (NCPs) to participate in work programs if they fail to pay child support. This can lead to contempt citations or criminal charges. NCPs may be given the option to seek work as an alternative to incarceration. Depending on the jurisdiction, NCPs may be left to find employment on their own or be connected to an employment program for assistance. Employment programs for non-custodial parents (NCPs) can be mandatory or voluntary, with high enrollment rates. Referrals can come from various sources, and incentives like court referrals and consequences for nonpayment encourage participation. However, recruitment and retention can be challenging as some NCPs decline to participate voluntarily. Employment programs for non-custodial parents (NCPs) face challenges in recruitment and retention, with many NCPs declining to participate voluntarily. Strategies to boost participation include expansive eligibility rules, incentives, intensive case management, co-locating services, and aggressive outreach. Intensive case management is crucial for engaging NCPs, assessing their needs, coordinating services, and monitoring progress. Case managers may refer NCPs to external resources for issues like housing. Employment programs for non-custodial parents (NCPs) may refer individuals to external resources for various issues such as housing, mental health, substance use, legal aid, and financial education. These programs also offer access to parenting and fatherhood services, including classes and referrals for parenting time, co-parent mediation, and legal concerns related to parenthood. Services are typically provided by partnering government workforce agencies or community organizations, offering employment-focused case management, job search assistance, job readiness, education, job skills training, job placement, and retention services in individual and group settings. Employment programs for non-custodial parents (NCPs) offer job search assistance, job readiness, education, job skills training, job placement, and retention services in individual and group settings. These programs may also provide work supports like transportation assistance, incentives for program engagement, and specialized services for those with criminal records. Federal funding for state CSE administration is limited, with uncertain availability and amounts. The federal government provides funding for state and local expenditures on Child Support Enforcement (CSE) activities, with no limit on reimbursement. In FY2018, federal matching payments exceeded $3.5 billion, accounting for 90% of federal CSE funding. States can seek waivers under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act for demonstration projects, with a maximum federal reimbursement of $2 million. Incentive payments, totaling over $510 million, are also available to reward states for strong program performance. In FY2018, states received over $510 million in incentive payments for strong program performance in Child Support Enforcement (CSE). States can reinvest these payments into eligible activities or request authorization for non-eligible activities that improve program effectiveness. Additionally, states can use non-CSE federal funding streams, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), to support employment programs for noncustodial parents (NCPs). Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding can be used to support employment programs for noncustodial parents (NCPs), providing services and benefits funded by TANF or state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) programs. States have flexibility in using TANF funds for non-assistance services like employment services for NCPs, but these programs must compete with other expenditure options. Additionally, funding from other programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can also be used to provide employment services to eligible NCPs. The Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) offers labor exchange services to all individuals. States and localities use various public and private funding to support CSE employment pilots. Evaluations show improvement in earnings and child support payments for NCPs in employment programs. This report focuses on statistically significant employment, earnings, and child support payment findings from random assignment experiments and other research designs that can plausibly identify program impacts. Rigorous research designs such as random assignment use valid comparison groups to isolate impacts, which are the changes in outcomes causally attributable to a program or policy. Employment programs for noncustodial parents (NCPs) have shown weak or no effects on employment, earnings, and child support compliance based on rigorous evaluations. Studies suggest that increased involvement from Child Support Enforcement (CSE) in these programs may lead to more positive impacts. However, there is a lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of spending on these programs. There is no rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of spending on employment programs for noncustodial parents (NCPs) compared to alternative Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program activities. Some CSE practitioners believe that employment services are more effective for NCPs with limited ability to pay. Rigorous evidence is available for traditional employment services and transitional jobs, but alternative employment services like occupational skills training have not been evaluated with NCPs. Earnings supplements like the Earned Income Tax Credit aim to increase employment and support other policy goals. The effectiveness of traditional employment services for noncustodial parents (NCPs) is mixed. Common services include job search assistance, job readiness training, assessments, job development, retention services, rapid re-employment, planning, and work supports. The National Child Support Noncustodial Parent Employment Demonstration (CSPED) study enrolled over 10,000 NCPs in eight states from 2013 to 2016, showing increased receipt of case management, employment, parenting, and enhanced services. The National Child Support Noncustodial Parent Employment Demonstration (CSPED) study found that while there was an increase in the receipt of various services such as case management, employment, parenting, and enhanced child support services, the level of additional services received was considered to be fairly light-touch. More intensive services like subsidized employment or on-the-job training were rarely utilized, and overall, CSPED did not consistently improve employment, earnings, or child support compliance compared to usual services provided by Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies. Earlier evaluations of similar programs reported more promising impacts, but with greater uncertainty in their results due to research design limitations. The evaluated demonstrations varied in target populations and recruitment strategies, serving highly disadvantaged populations. The programs provided typical or robust levels of service, but research designs do not clearly show which approach produces stronger impacts. Transitional jobs have shown promising effects on NCPs, increasing their ability to secure and retain employment, earnings, and child support payments. Transitional jobs programs target individuals struggling to secure consistent employment by providing subsidized meaningful work and income. While participants initially had higher earnings and employment after the program, these impacts faded over time. However, the increased likelihood of child support payment often persisted. Transitional jobs programs are costly and challenging to implement compared to traditional employment services. The Obama and Trump Administrations proposed increasing federal funding for CSE employment programs, with the Obama Administration suggesting reimbursement for job services for eligible NCPs and the Trump Administration proposing reimbursement for mandatory work activities. Legislation in the 116th Congress, such as the Julia Carson Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2019, also aims to allow federal reimbursement for certain job services in state CSE programs. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to increase funding for job services for noncustodial parents (NCPs) through state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs. This includes proposals to redirect TANF funding towards employment services for NCPs and create new programs like the ELEVATE Act of 2019. The ELEVATE Act of 2019 (H.R. 556/S. 136) and the Pandemic TANF Assistance Act (S. 3672) aim to provide funding for subsidized employment programs for low-income populations, including noncustodial parents (NCPs)."
