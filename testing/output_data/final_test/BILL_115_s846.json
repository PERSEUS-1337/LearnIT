Funds will be apportioned to each State based on a specific ratio. The Act establishes a program to assist States in rehabilitating or replacing bridges with significant load-carrying elements in poor condition or low load capacity. Funds will be apportioned to each State based on the total cost to rehabilitate or replace eligible bridges in that State compared to all States. The Secretary will calculate the total cost by multiplying the deck area of eligible bridges by the unit price on a State-by-State basis using the latest available data. The program established under subsection (b) allocates funds to States for rehabilitating or replacing eligible bridges. The Secretary will base determinations on inventories from section 144 of title 23, United States Code. Funds must be used for bridge rehabilitation and replacement, administered similarly to funds under title 23, but not transferable. Requirements from the FAST Act apply to the funds. The program under subsection (b) allocates funds to States for rehabilitating or replacing bridges. The Federal share of project costs is 100 percent. Upon completion, bridges must not be structurally deficient. Unobligated funds may be reapportioned after three fiscal years. The program allocates funds to States for rehabilitating or replacing bridges with a 100 percent Federal share of project costs. Unobligated funds after three fiscal years will be withdrawn and reapportioned to States that have not had funds withdrawn. Funding under the program must supplement, not supplant, other Federal funding for bridge projects. The prevailing rate of wage applies, and annual reports are required. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the amounts obligated by each State for bridge projects under the program. $2,750,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2020 for the Secretary to carry out this section."
