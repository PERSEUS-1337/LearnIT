AI understanding language meaning could lead to flexible transfer to other situations, a crucial step towards general AI. Enhancing learning possibilities for communication skills is essential to increase emergable complexity. Introducing empathy in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can improve learning time, as shown in experiments. The architectural element doubled the learning speed in experiments, showing high potential. Natural language is not rule-based, with limitless context-dependent notions. Understanding language's functional aspects is crucial for general AI. Emergent communication research aims to ground natural language through reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results in deep reinforcement learning. The ability to extract features from high dimensional input data without manual preprocessing is crucial in deep reinforcement learning. Classical approaches require a large number of training examples due to sparse rewards, leading to a slow convergence in generating meaningful representations. The human brain generates richer feedback through unsupervised prediction tasks, resulting in more expressive models. In deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised prediction tasks can lead to more expressive models by refining visual representations through auxiliary prediction tasks. This approach, inspired by the theory of mind, focuses on predicting the mental state of interaction partners to enhance active communication. The curr_chunk discusses how utterances can change the listener's hidden state, leading to more effective communication and accelerated learning in developing a shared language. The main contribution is an extension to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms that aim to establish a communication resembling an empathic connection between speaker and listener, resulting in faster convergence to a shared language. This was achieved by doubling the learning speed of a MADRL algorithm playing a referential game through an auxiliary prediction task for the speaking agent. The improvement is attributed to richer gradients in the lower layers of the neural network for input embedding. Neural networks are used in reinforcement learning to represent policies, allowing for the maximization of expected rewards. The downside is the need for a large amount of data samples to learn. Policy parameters are updated based on their effect on the objective using the REINFORCE algorithm. The REINFORCE algorithm with a learning rate \u03b2 estimates the effect on the objective. LSTM RNNs can accumulate input over time and produce consistent output. LSTMs are designed to remember information over many steps. Auxiliary unsupervised tasks in RL improve performance by predicting the next visual input. The auxiliary task enhances the internal representation of visual input, benefiting the main task. Previous work by MacLennan (1990) and Werner & Dyer (1991, 1993) explored learning communication in artificial agents, with advancements like introducing lying agents by Robbins (1994). The progress in learning communication can be attributed to advances in neural network algorithms. Previous work focused on simple information sharing, but recent studies have introduced more complex communication patterns. Some multi-agent learning setups prioritize communication success, while others focus on emerging protocols and their properties. Recent studies have introduced more complex communication patterns, with a focus on emerging protocols and their properties. Referential games are commonly used as a testbed for this research, showing that flexible language use can be understood by humans even when applied to unknown objects. The speaking agent in the field of language emergence is equipped with an auxiliary task to predict the hidden state of the listener, resembling empathy in humans. The unsupervised prediction task can be trained simultaneously with the main RL task. The main RL task generates samples for the unsupervised task, with gradients backpropagated into the encoding layers of the speaker. This enhances language emergence by providing richer feedback for internal communicatable representation. Experimental evidence shows doubled learning speed when added to existing language emergence approaches. The referential game setup by Lazaridou et al. (2018) was used to test the potential of the auxiliary prediction task. The Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (VisA) by Silberer et al. (2013) was utilized. The Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (VisA) by Silberer et al. (2013) contains attribute annotations for 500 concrete concepts, annotated with 636 general attributes. A speaker agent uses a policy to produce a message that is interpreted by a listener agent to identify the described concept, with both agents receiving a shared reward if the listener correctly identifies the concept. The speaker agent encodes input into a dense representation and generates a message using an LSTM. The listener agent encodes the message and candidate concepts to calculate compliance. Both agents output a probability distribution over possible actions. See Lazaridou et al. (2018) for more details. In reinforcement learning, agents aim to maximize expected rewards by maximizing the probability of actions leading to positive rewards. An auxiliary unsupervised prediction task is added to shape deep encoding layers, predicting the listener's hidden layer activation based on the speaker's input. The mean absolute error is used as the loss function. In reinforcement learning, agents maximize rewards by predicting listener's hidden layer activation. Mean absolute error is used as the loss function. A weighting factor \u03b1 ensures unsupervised task doesn't corrupt main task. Gradients of unsupervised task are added to reinforcement task without extra training steps. Implementation done using EGG toolkit. With \u03b1 around 0.1, learning speed can double or triple. Using an auxiliary predictive task in communication learning can double or triple the learning speed, with significant improvements in sample efficiency. This is shown through experiments comparing learning curves with and without the prediction task, where marks are reached in half or a third of the time, depending on the complexity of the game setup. The experiments show that speed is crucial in language emergence tasks. The algorithm allows for higher sample-efficiency without added computational cost, enabling the learning of more complex language tasks. Future research could explore applying the mechanism to entangled input and incorporating an auxiliary prediction task for improved alignment between speaker and listener. This mechanism has the potential to advance the field of language emergence significantly."
