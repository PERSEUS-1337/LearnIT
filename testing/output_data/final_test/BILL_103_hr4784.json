    "content": "The \"Mountain Park Project Act of 1994\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It involves the modification of the Mountain Park Project. The Mountain Park Project Act of 1994 is amended to include environmental quality activities and reallocation of project costs by the Secretary of the Interior. Investigations are to be conducted within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary of the Interior is required to conduct investigations to determine environmental quality activities for the Mountain Park project and reallocate project costs accordingly. This may include activities such as developing in-stream flows and wetland habitat. The Secretary will develop in-stream flows, wetland habitat, and other environmental activities to benefit the environment. Upon completing investigations, the Secretary will propose reallocating project costs and negotiate with the Mountain Park Master Conservancy District to adjust repayment obligations. The Secretary will propose reallocating project costs for environmental activities and negotiate prepayment options for the District's construction costs in Altus, Frederick, or Snyder, Oklahoma. The Secretary will determine the interest rate for loan repayment based on guidelines in Circular A-129. The interest rate will be used to calculate the amount owed by discounting the remaining repayment obligation. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine the interest rate for loan repayment based on guidelines in Circular A-129 and the Department of Treasury Financial Manual. The interest rate will consider the price of the District's obligation if sold to a third party. If tax-exempt financing is used, the interest rate will be adjusted to compensate for future tax revenue loss. Title to project facilities will remain with the United States despite any payments made by the District. The project facilities will remain with the United States, and Section 3101 of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 is repealed."
