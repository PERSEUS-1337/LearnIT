    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Long-Term Care Resident Part D Assistance Act of 2006\" and provides Part D assistance for residents of long-term care facilities. The \"Long-Term Care Resident Part D Assistance Act of 2006\" amends the Social Security Act to provide assistance to residents of long-term care facilities under Part D. The Secretary will establish procedures and may waive requirements to assist residents with coverage, including a dedicated toll-free number for staff members of long-term care facilities. The \"Long-Term Care Resident Part D Assistance Act of 2006\" allows staff at long-term care facilities to request coverage information for residents. Full-benefit dual eligible individuals in long-term care facilities can receive assistance in selecting a plan instead of being randomly enrolled. The Secretary coordinates with residents and long-term care facilities to help select and enroll in the most appropriate plan under this part. Reimbursement is provided to long-term care facilities for costs associated with new requirements and prescription drug expenditures for covered Part D drugs. The long-term care facility expends for payment for covered Part D drugs for residents who are Part D eligible individuals enrolled in a prescription drug plan but were unable to access timely prescription drug benefits. This includes costs associated with providing Part D assistance for residents of long-term care facilities. The long-term care facility must have procedures in place for educating residents on Part D assistance, including filling prescriptions, determining enrollment plans, and advocating for residents. The long-term care facility must educate Part D eligible residents on prescription drug coverage options and provide assistance with plan selection and enrollment. The facility must also periodically check if the resident's current plan covers necessary medications. The amendments made by this section require long-term care facilities to ensure residents have coverage for necessary drugs through a pharmacy contract. Effective upon enactment of the Act."
