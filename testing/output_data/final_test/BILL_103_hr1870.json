The Motor Vehicle Industry Competitiveness Act recognizes the importance of a strong US motor vehicle sector for international competitiveness and the economy. The industry directly employs 1.2 million workers and supports another million jobs in supplier industries. It accounts for a significant portion of various industries, including natural rubber, lead, machine tools, glass, semiconductor, aluminum, and steel. The United States motor vehicle industry has faced financial difficulties in recent years, with major losses and numerous companies going out of business. The trade deficit with Japan in 1991 exceeded $30 billion, contributing to the overall US world trade deficit. Despite negotiations, challenges persist in the sector. Despite years of negotiations through the MOSS process, US motor vehicle parts companies are excluded from the Japanese market, accounting for less than 1% of sales. This trade imbalance, caused by Japanese structural barriers like keiretsu, threatens the US motor vehicle parts industry and its suppliers. High healthcare costs make US motor vehicle makers less competitive, passing on $700 more per car than Japanese companies. Worldwide excess capacity in the motor vehicle industry adds pressure.
