    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Uranium Extraction and Milling Control Act of 2009\". The Congress finds that uranium is a naturally occurring element used in the production of highly enriched uranium, which is essential for nuclear explosive devices. Over 40,000 metric tons of uranium ore were produced worldwide in 2007, indicating a potential for significant expansion in the nuclear power industry. Iran and Syria have opened uranium mines in the past two decades, but the ore extracted is not suitable for commercial use. They maintain that their production is for peaceful purposes. Iran, Syria, and North Korea have significant uranium ore reserves that could be used for military purposes. The extraction and milling of uranium ore into yellowcake are not monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These countries have faced sanctions due to their nuclear weapons programs. The United States prohibits transfers of sensitive goods, services, or technology to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Foreign persons making such transfers may face sanctions. Preventing these countries from accessing uranium ore for their nuclear weapons programs is a key nonproliferation goal for the US and its allies. The United States policy is to oppose the transfer of goods, services, or technology relevant to uranium ore extraction to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. It also aims to collaborate with other countries to impose restrictions on such transfers internationally. Reporting requirements under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act are in place. The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act is amended to require the President to submit reports to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate at specified times. The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act is amended to require reports identifying foreign persons who transferred goods, services, or technology to Iran, Syria, or North Korea that could aid in uranium extraction. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act is amended to replace \"Committee on International Relations\" with \"Committee on Foreign Affairs\"."
