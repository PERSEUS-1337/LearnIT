    "content": "The Bush Administration requested $132.4 billion in federal research and development (R&D) funding for FY2006, a $400 million increase from FY2005. Congress approved a record $135.7 billion for federal R&D in FY2006, with most of the increase going towards defense weapons systems and NASA's human space exploration technology. The FY2006 appropriation for research and education in the U.S. Department of Agriculture is $2,677.4 million, a decrease from FY2005. The USDA conducts in-house research through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with a focus on food and fiber production, genetic resources preservation, and pest management. The FY2006 appropriation for ARS is $1,266.2 million, a 3.1% decrease from FY2005. The Administration proposed reductions in projects earmarked by Congress to fund high priority programs. The FY2006 appropriation for ARS is $131.2 million for buildings and facilities, supporting research priority areas and strategic goals like sequencing genomes of agriculturally imported species. The majority of ARS facilities are functionally obsolete and not in compliance with current health and safety standards. Funding for projects earmarked by Congress remains at FY2005 levels, including hyperspectral imaging in New Orleans, LA. The FY2006 appropriation for ARS includes increased support for research on animal and plant genomes, emerging and exotic diseases for homeland security, and other research areas like bovine spongiform encephalopathy, food safety, and biobased products/bioenergy. USDA has biocontainment complexes for research on threats to agriculture. Conferees have instructed ARS not to redirect support between states. Conferees have instructed ARS not to redirect support for programs between states without prior notification and approval. CSREES distributes funds for agricultural research to various institutions, including 1862, 1890, and 1994 land-grant colleges. The FY2006 appropriation for CSREES is $1,194.6 million, with funding distributed through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. Funding for formula distribution in FY2006 to state Agricultural Experiment Stations is $275.7 million. The FY2006 appropriation for state Agricultural Experiment Stations is $275.7 million, with $37.6 million allocated for the 1890 formula programs. The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program is funded at $183 million, supporting various agricultural research initiatives. Additionally, funding is provided for specific research programs such as tropical and sub-tropical research, aquaculture research, grain sorghum research, and air quality research. The conferees provided $128.2 million in special research grants, emphasizing the need to address issues of American Indian tribal nations. They directed the Department to collaborate with tribal nations and assess staffing needs for Indian reservation extension agents. The Economic Research Service (ERS) received a $1.8 million increase in FY2006 for developing a consumer data system and conducting a cooperative study on the U.S. sheep industry with the National Academy of Sciences. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts the Census of Agriculture and provides data on agricultural production and economic indicators. The FY2006 appropriation for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is $140.7 million, supporting eGovernment initiatives and USDA Enterprise Architecture development. Funding levels for the U.S. Department of Agriculture R&D are detailed in internal documents, including support for higher education institutions and program contingencies. The CSREES total funding includes support for various programs, with specific funding levels not yet available. The Department of Energy requested $8.4 billion for R&D in FY2006, with the final bill providing $8.9 billion. Funding for Science was $3.5 billion, with the House and Senate each providing $3.7 billion. In the Basic Energy Sciences program, construction of the Spallation Neutron Source is expected to be completed in FY2006. In FY2006, funds will shift from construction to operations in Fusion Energy Sciences, with a focus on U.S. participation in ITER. The Biological and Environmental Research program saw a decrease in funding, with the House and Senate restoring reductions for directed projects. The final bill allocated $130 million for congressionally directed projects. The House and Senate provided funding for increased facility operating time in Office of Science research facilities. The requested funding for R&D in National Security decreased by 3.8%. R&D in Weapons Activities received an increase of $147 million above the request, with differences in funding allocation between the House and Senate. Funding for Inertial Confinement Fusion saw an increase in the final bill, while other programs experienced reductions. Funding for R&D on nuclear proliferation detection would have increased by $46 million in the request. The request proposed a $46 million increase for R&D on nuclear proliferation detection, with the House, Senate, and final bill all allocating even more funding for this activity. Funding for R&D in Energy Supply was requested at $1.6 billion, down 6.4% from FY2005, with reductions in Fossil Energy R&D. The Senate provided $305 million more than requested, including increases for Fossil Energy R&D and Nuclear Energy R&D. The final bill allocated $1.8 billion for R&D in Energy Supply. Additionally, funding for R&D in Environmental Quality was requested at $21 million, less than half of the FY2005 level. The Department of Energy R&D funding was allocated $30 million, with various programs included such as Stockpile Services, Science Campaigns, and Inertial Confinement Fusion. Detailed funding schedules for specific weapon systems were classified. The Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding for FY2006 is $69.4 billion, with additional funds allocated for the Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The six-year budget plan estimates a total spending of $404.6 billion for RDT&E through FY2011, reflecting a reduction of nearly $9 billion between FY2006 and FY2009. The Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding for FY2006 is $69.4 billion, with a reduction of nearly $9 billion between FY2006 and FY2009 to help reduce the federal budget deficit. The FY2006 Science and Technology (S&T) funding would drop significantly, representing a 20% reduction from FY2005. Congress increased the FY2005 appropriation for S&T above the Administration's request. The FY2006 basic research budget request is $1.3 billion, an overall reduction of 12.8% from FY2005. The FY2006 basic research budget request is $1.3 billion, a reduction of 12.8% from FY2005. The FY2006 S&T request is 2.5% of the overall Department of Defense budget request of $419.3 billion, below the 3% target set by the Bush Administration and Congress. The House approved $71.7 billion for Title IV RDT&E, $2.3 billion above the Administration's request, and provided an additional $45 billion for troops in the field. The House appropriated $45 billion for expenses in the first six months of FY2006 for troops in the field and support for the war on terrorism. This included additional funding for Title IV RDT&E, with major increases for all accounts except Missile Defense. Significant reductions were made to various military programs, including the Army's Future Combat System and the Navy's DD(X) Next Generation destroyer project. The House also allocated $13 billion for Science and Technology, with a focus on basic research. The House appropriated $444 million for the RDT&E portion of the Defense Health Program in 2005, including funding for breast cancer and prostate cancer research programs. This was part of the Military Quality of Life appropriations passed on June 8, 2005. The Senate passed its defense appropriations bill on October 7, 2005, providing $70.4 billion for Title IV RDT&E, $516 million for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program (including funds for breast and prostate cancer research), and $73 million for RDT&E in the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. Additionally, the Senate allocated $50 billion for contingency operations in the first six months of FY2006, with $92 million going towards RDT&E. The House and Senate approved a defense appropriations bill in December 2005, providing $72.1 billion for Title IV RDT&E. The bill also allocated $67.8 million for RDT&E in the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program and $542 million for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program. Additionally, an approved floor amendment aimed to increase funding for basic research to 15% of the S&T budget, but as appropriated, basic research received approximately 11% of the funding. The defense appropriations bill in December 2005 provided $72.1 billion for Title IV RDT&E, with additional funding for the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program and the Defense Health Program. The bill also included Katrina-related emergency supplemental funding, totaling $41.3 million for RDT&E. The final bill allocated $13.4 billion for S&T funding, including $1.5 billion for basic research, which remained at 3% of the total DOD appropriation. The curr_chunk discusses military construction funding, including funds for Developmental and Operational Test and Evaluation, classified programs, and a $100 million allocation for the Air Force Tanker Transfer Fund. It also mentions a $200 million reduction in ballistic missile defense programs, with most funding in the Advanced Development account. This program is now funded through the Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill. NASA's FY2006 funding includes $16.456 billion from the SSJC appropriations Act, with rescissions from other acts. An additional $350 million was added for hurricane recovery. The R&D budget is estimated at $10.7 billion, excluding certain programs. NASA received approximately $10.7 billion for R&D in FY2005, with a request for $11.5 billion in FY2006. Congress appropriated around $11.5 billion for R&D, but comparisons across fiscal years are difficult due to budget structure changes. President Bush directed NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon by 2020 and eventually sending them to Mars and beyond. Funding for the space shuttle program post-2003 Columbia tragedy remains uncertain, with potential shifts from R&D programs. Definitive figures may be available with the FY2007 budget request. NASA's \"Vision for Space Exploration\" involves redirecting funding from other activities to focus on sending humans to Mars and beyond. This includes terminating the space shuttle program in 2010 and reducing funding for space station research. NASA is developing a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and launch vehicle to transport astronauts to the Moon and potentially to other destinations. The President directed the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to transport astronauts to the Moon and space station by 2014, but NASA Administrator Michael Griffin aims to accelerate it to 2012. Funding for the Vision for Space Exploration could impact NASA's support for aeronautics and science programs. Congress supports the Vision but emphasizes the need for a balanced program. Issues include whether to terminate the shuttle in 2010 or wait for the CEV, and whether to end U.S. use of the space station in 2016. NASA is debating whether to end U.S. use of the space station in 2016 or continue as planned. There is also a discussion on sending a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope for new instruments. The decision was previously canceled due to safety concerns, but advocates argue that it can continue to deliver important scientific data with new equipment. NASA's Administrator pledged to revisit the Hubble issue. NASA's Administrator, Dr. Griffin, plans to revisit the Hubble issue after completing two \"return to flight\" missions to better understand safety characteristics. The first mission in July-August 2005 had launch problems but was considered a success. The second mission is expected in 2006. For more on the Hubble issue, refer to CRS Report RS21767. NASA's R&D funding details are based on budget documents and estimates. NASA's budget for FY2005 and FY2006 is subject to changes in structure and program allocations, making comparisons challenging. An amended FY2006 request was submitted in July 2005, but the appropriations committees acted on the original request. Estimates indicate cuts to the International Space Station budget, with potential impacts on R&D funding. Additional funding from a FY2005 supplemental for hurricane recovery is included in the figures. In FY2006, NIH received a budget of $28.47 billion, a decrease of $81 million from the previous year. This was the first decrease in NIH's funding since 1970, attributed to an across-the-board rescission. The President had requested a budget increase, but the rescission resulted in a net loss for NIH. In FY2006, the NIH budget was $28.745 billion, with the House and Senate providing different funding levels. The majority of NIH's budget comes from the Labor-HHS-Education appropriation, with additional funding for environmental work. In FY2006, the NIH budget was $28.745 billion, with funding levels differing between the House and Senate. The annual increases for FY1999 through FY2003 were in the 14%-15% range each year, but for FY2004 and FY2005, increases were only 2% to 3%, below the estimated biomedical inflation index. Advocates originally recommended a 10% budget growth post-doubling, but later modified it to a 6% increase for FY2006 to maintain scientific momentum. The NIH budget for FY2006 was $28.745 billion, with funding levels varying between the House and Senate. The agency consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers, each focusing on specific diseases or areas of research. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, the OD, and a buildings and facilities account. The ICs allocate over 80% of their budgets to supporting peer-reviewed extramural research. The NIH budgets over 80% of its funds to support peer-reviewed extramural research through various funding mechanisms. The remaining 15%-20% goes towards intramural research programs and management costs. The FY2006 budget shaped policies for funding research project grants and other award mechanisms. NIH's FY2006 budget policies include reducing non-competing RPG awards by 2.35% and maintaining the average cost of competing RPGs at FY2005 levels. Funding for other mechanisms will be reduced by 1.1% from the conference level, except for Research Management and Support. NIH aims to fund about 38,300 RPGs, a decrease of 1.5% from FY2005, with a success rate of 19.5%. Concerns are raised about supporting new investigators, with a new Pathway to Independent Careers program announced in January 2006. In January 2006, NIH introduced the Pathway to Independence Award program to assist postdoctoral scientists in transitioning to independent research. The program includes a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase, with a total commitment of nearly $400 million over five years. Most institutes and centers experienced decreases in funding for FY2006, with only two accounts receiving increases. The decline in NIH's intramural Buildings and Facilities account was due to the completion of construction projects. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) received a 0.3% increase in funding for construction and renovation projects. The Office of the NIH Director (OD) saw a significant 33.5% increase to $478 million, with a focus on biodefense research and initiatives under the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. This includes funding for research on countermeasures against nuclear, radiological, and chemical threats. The NIH received up to $333 million for initiatives in high-risk basic research, clinical research, and collaborative research in FY2006. Congressional movement towards reauthorization legislation for NIH has been seen after a hiatus of twelve years. Discussions are ongoing regarding the balance of authority between the central NIH Director's Office and other agencies. The NIH is facing issues regarding authority and funding, with discussions on how to handle appropriations levels for the institutes and centers. Funding for FY2006 included a rescission of 1% totaling $285.974 million. NIAID funds include money for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. OD has Roadmap funds for ICs, with $96.0m for terrorism countermeasures. Separate account for NIEHS activities in Interior/Related Agencies appropriation. NIDDK has funds for diabetes research. Additional funds include $8.2m for NLM each year and $47m for NIH research on nuclear and radiological countermeasures. The FY2006 bill allocated $96 million to the Office of the Director instead of $97 million. The National Science Foundation (NSF) requested $5,605 million for FY2006, a 2.4% increase from FY2005. NSF plans to increase funding rate to 21% and grant size to $136,800 for three years. $35 million is proposed for the Office of International Science and Engineering. NSF will lead U.S. participation in the International Polar Year in 2007 and support the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The FY2006 budget included funding for various initiatives such as the National Nanotechnology Initiative, Climate Change Science Program, homeland security, and Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. Research and Related Activities received $4,333.5 million, with increased funding for the physical sciences to address concerns about support imbalance. The Research and Related Activities (R&RA) funding in FY2006 includes Integrative Activities, research instrumentation acquisition, disaster research teams, and Science and Technology Policy Institute. The budget request for IA is $134.9 million, with a 3.8% increase over the previous year. The Office of Polar Programs is also funded, with a transfer of responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard for polar ice breaking activities. Research project support totals $2,757.1 million, including funding for individual and small group research, centers, and center programs. In FY2006, the National Science Foundation (NSF) allocated funding for various centers and programs, including Science and Technology Centers, Materials Centers, Engineering Research Centers, Physics Frontiers Centers, Plant Genome Virtual Centers, and Mathematical Science Research Institutes. The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account received $250 million, a 44% increase from the previous year, to support the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment. NSF is a primary supporter of forefront instrumentation and facilities for academic research and education communities. In FY2006, NSF allocated funding for ongoing projects and those approved by the NSB. Projects must have the potential to shift scientific understanding or technology infrastructure. No new starts proposed in FY2006, but new starts requested in FY2007 and 2008 for Ocean Observatories, Alaska Region Research Vessel, and Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. Projects receiving support in FY2006 include Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction, EarthScope, IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and Rare Symmetry Violating. The FY2006 NSF funding supports projects like EarthScope, IceCube Neutrino Observatory, Rare Symmetry Violating Processes, and Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel. Priority areas include biocomplexity in the environment, human and social dynamics, and mathematical sciences. NSF emphasizes the need for cutting-edge tools and funding for 21st-century research and education. An investment in cyberinfrastructure will enable funding for modeling and research facilities. The NSF is investing $509 million in cyberinfrastructure to enhance modeling, simulation, visualization, and data storage capabilities. This funding aims to make cyberinfrastructure more powerful, stable, and accessible to researchers and educators. The NSF is also focusing on increasing grant size and duration, with a declining research grant application funding rate. Additionally, there is a need for improved oversight of large projects and a question regarding the selection process for major projects in the budget cycle. The congressionally mandated study recommended a more open process for project selection in the MREFC account. The National Science Board approved new guidelines for project development and a facility plan in May 2005. Total funding for the National Science Foundation was detailed in Table 6. The FY2006 request for the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) is $737 million, with specific funding allocations to be determined later. The focus is on increasing technological literacy, preparing professionals in science and math, and closing achievement gaps. Support is allocated for precollege, undergraduate, and graduate levels. In FY2006, the focus of funding in the Education and Human Resources Directorate is on teacher development activities and informal science education at the precollege level, with a majority of funding for new awards and activities at the undergraduate level. Priorities include the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, STEM Talent Expansion Program, and the President's Math and Science Partnerships program. Funding for the MSP program is decreased by 24.4% from the FY2005 estimate. In FY2006, funding in the Education and Human Resources Directorate focuses on teacher development and informal science education at the precollege level. The MSP program has made 80 awards in a three-year period with a funding rate of approximately 9%. Various programs aim to increase underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, including funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology. EPSCoR funding is $94 million in the FY2006 request. The FY2006 request for EPSCoR funding is $94 million, almost level with the FY2005 estimate. The House and Senate have passed the conference agreement on FY2006 appropriations for the NSF, providing a total of $5,653.4 million, $48.4 million above the Administration's request. The EHR receives $807 million in H.R. 2862, $70 million above the request. The EHR funding in H.R. 2862 is $807 million, $70 million above the request. The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program receives $25.8 million, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program receives $35.8 million. The MREFC is funded at $208.2 million, with support for projects like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, EarthScope, IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel. The Committee is concerned with the \"unacceptable increases\" in project costs for the Rare Symmetry Violating Processes (RSVP) and suggests altering or descoping the proposal. EPSCoR is funded at $100 million in FY2006, $6 million above the request. The Senate directs the NSF to assume polar icebreaking activities from the Coast Guard, with alternative sources if needed. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.37 billion for the Directorate of Science and Technology in FY2006. The FY2006 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security included a 23% increase in R&D funding for the S&T Directorate. The House provided $1.29 billion, a reduction from the request, while the Senate provided $1.45 billion, including additional funding for Coast Guard R&D. The final bill allocated $1.50 billion for the S&T Directorate and $17.8 million for Coast Guard R&D, consolidating various R&D programs under the S&T Directorate. The FY2006 budget proposed consolidating the Coast Guard R&D program under the S&T Directorate, following previous directions. The House accepted the move, but the Senate rejected it. The budget also included consolidations for the TSA R&D program and funding for the newly created Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). DNDO, although funded under S&T, operates as a separate office reporting directly to the Department of Homeland Security. The House and Senate recommended $100 million less than requested for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), expressing concerns about its handling and role within DHS. Some DNDO activities were previously funded by the S&T Directorate's radiological and nuclear countermeasures program, with differing funding amounts proposed by the House and Senate for these programs. The conference agreement provided an increase to $226 million for Customs and Border Prevention, including $125 million for radiation portal monitors at ports of entry. Additionally, $318 million was provided for DNDO, with $135 million allocated for radiation portal monitors and $19 million for radiological and nuclear countermeasures. The President requested $534 million for NOAA R&D programs, which is 15% of NOAA's entire budget request of $3.58 billion, representing a decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) manages NOAA's R&D program and facilities, with a requested budget of $316 million, a 6.8% decrease from FY2005. The House passed bill would have provided $501 million for NOAA's R&D programs, a 20% decrease from FY2005. This reduction is in contrast to the U.S. Oceans Policy Commission's recommendations for doubling ocean and coastal research budgets over the next five years. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2862 proposed increases for NOAA's R&D, totaling $693 million for implementing OPC recommendations and expanding oceanic research. This is $32 million more than FY2005 estimated funding. The Senate report recommended a 12.4% increase in OAR funding from $338 million in FY2005 to $380 million in FY2006. The conference committee on SSJC appropriations reported H.R. 2862 with an estimated $661 million for NOAA R&D in FY2006, including $373 million for OAR. The greatest change for R&D at NOAA in FY2006 is in individually funded ocean science educational programs. Funding for ocean research programs at NOAA in FY2006 has been consolidated under NOAA's Program Support base. The National Sea Grant Program and NOAA's National Ocean Service ocean sciences programs have seen cuts in funding. Conferees directed NOAA to compile a plan for implementing OPC recommendations before reconsidering funding for associated programs in the FY2007 budget. H.R. 2862 became P.L. 109-108 on November 22, 2005. For more information on NOAA's full budget request for FY2006, refer to CRS Report RS22109. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Research and Development Budgets for FY2004-FY2006 were detailed in a report from February 23, 2005. Funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aims to enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness through technological support. NIST's research also contributes to the advancement of U.S. commerce and product reliability. The President's FY2006 budget requested $532 million in funding for NIST, a 23% decrease from FY2005. The budget included $426.3 million for the Scientific and Technology Research and Services account, with $5.7 million for the Baldrige National Quality Program. MEP was to be funded at $46.8 million, 56% below FY2005 support. H.R. 2862 would have provided $548.7 million for NIST, 21% below FY2005 funding. The Senate version of H.R. 2862 proposed funding NIST at $844.5 million, with $399.9 million for the STRS account, $106 million for MEP, $140 million for ATP, and $198.6 million for construction activities. The construction budget for NIST was increased to $198.6 million, more than double the earlier figure. The final FY2006 appropriations legislation provided $761.8 million for NIST, with $399.9 million for the STRS account and $7.1 million for the Quality Program. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership received $106 million and the Advanced Technology Program was funded at $80 million. Funding for MEP decreased slightly from FY2005, while support for ATP declined by 41%. The construction budget also more than doubled to $175.9 million. In FY2005, the Omnibus Appropriations Act provided NIST with $695.3 million, with funding for internal research and development at $378.8 million. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership received $107.5 million, a significant increase. The Advanced Technology Program was funded at $136.5 million, and the construction budget received $72.5 million. Additionally, $3.9 million of unobligated balances from prior year funds in the ATP account were rescinded. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) has been a major funding issue, providing \"seed financing\" to businesses for developing technologies with broad applications. Opponents criticize it as \"corporate welfare,\" while supporters argue it assists businesses in developing crucial technologies. Despite initial lack of funding in FY2002, Congress has maintained support for ATP. In FY2002, no funding was provided for ATP. Although support was reinstated in FY2006, it was 41% lower than previous years. The budget for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership faced challenges in FY2004, with federal funding substantially reduced. However, funding was restored in FY2005 and has been maintained in FY2006. The Bush Administration requested $808 million for the Department of Transportation's research and development budget in FY2006, representing an 8% increase over the FY2005 funding level. Support for the Federal Highway Administration would also increase from $336 million to $444 million in FY2006. The Administration proposed shifting resources from state highway grants to highway research, resulting in an increase in funding for the Federal Highway Administration to $444 million in FY2006. R&D funding for the Federal Aviation Administration would decrease by 11% to $233 million, with cuts in development activities and the elimination of Congressional earmarks. FAA research covers weather, aircraft safety, human factors, and free flight technology. Funding for FAA security R&D has declined due to the transfer of aviation security and Coast Guard R&D to DHS. The House recommended a total of $727 million for DOT R&D in FY2006, a 2.2% reduction from FY2005 levels. In FY2006, the House approved a 2.4% increase for FHWA R&D and a 6.5% reduction for FAA's R&D programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill would provide $742 million for R&D, with an increase for FAA's R&D spending. Congress approved a record $841 million for transportation R&D in FY2006, including a 5% increase for FAA's R&D budget. In FY2006, Congress approved a 5% increase in FAA's R&D budget, totaling $841 million for transportation R&D. The Department of the Interior requested $581 million for R&D, a 4.9% decline from the previous year. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the primary supporter of R&D within DOI, focusing on mapping, geological resources, water quality, and biological resources. The proposed FY2006 budget for R&D within the USGS would decline from $541 million in FY2005 to $515 million. Geological Mineral Resources research funding is proposed to decline 13%, while Water Resources is scheduled to decline 5.5%. The USGS conducts research on geological hazards, collects data, operates monitoring networks, and helps warn the public of disasters like earthquakes. NOAA and DOI are working on improving tsunami and earthquake warning systems. USGS plays a major role in geological hazards research within the earth sciences. The USGS conducts important geological hazards research on earthquakes and volcanoes, as well as research on fish, wildlife, and natural habitats. They develop new methods to manage wildlife and invasive species, with nearly 90% of research performed within Interior labs to address science needs of various agencies. If Congress approves the President's proposed budget for FY2006, funding for DOI R&D will have declined 18% in real dollars since FY2004. Both the House and Senate rejected the Administration's proposal to cut funding for DOI's R&D programs. The House bill would increase funding for USGS R&D programs by $12 million over FY2005 estimates, while the Senate bill approved a $9 million increase. The Administration proposed to cut the Geological Resources program by 13%, but both the House and Senate approved modest increases for that program. Congress approved an estimated $555 million for USGS R&D for FY2006, a 2.5% increase over FY2005. Total Interior R&D spending is likely to remain flat in real dollars for FY2006. For FY2006, Congress approved $555 million for USGS R&D, a 2.5% increase over FY2005. Total Interior R&D spending increased by 1.4% to $620 million. Other agencies included in the funding are the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, Minerals Management Service, and National Park Services. The Environmental Protection Agency's Science and Technology account received $772.3 million for all S&T activities, including transfers from the Superfund account. The FY2006 Science and Technology total budget is $768.6 million, including $30.5 million transferred from the Superfund account. The amount exceeds the Senate's approval but is less than the House's, the requested amount for FY2006, and the enacted amount for FY2005. Noteworthy details include $18.9 million for climate protection programs, slightly less than FY2005, and $33.1 million for Research/Congressional Priorities, funding various research projects. The FY2006 Science and Technology budget at EPA is $768.6 million, with funding allocated for various research areas such as global change clean air, water quality, human health, ecosystem research, and land protection. The funding levels for these areas vary compared to FY2005, with some exceeding previous amounts while others are slightly less. The impact of efforts to ensure sound science, such as the Information Quality Act and Peer Review guidelines, on EPA's S&T work remains a question. The Bush Administration requested $132.4 billion in federal research and development (R&D) funding for FY2006, representing a $400 million increase over FY2005. Congress approved a record $135.7 billion for federal R&D in FY2006, with most of the increase going towards defense weapons systems and NASA's human space exploration technology. Basic research funding would decline by 0.5% below the FY2005 level, totaling $26.7 billion in FY2006. Total federal research funding is projected to increase to $57 billion, with NASA receiving the majority of the increase. Congress approved $72.1 billion for DOD R&D, a 4.2% increase over FY2005 levels. NIH funding would decline for the first time in 36 years. Despite the completion of doubling NIH's budget between 1998-2003, funding has declined to FY2003 levels after adjusting for inflation. Most R&D funding agencies now face shrinking budgets in real dollars, with agencies like the National Science Foundation, DOE's Office of Science, NASA (excluding human space exploration), and Agriculture experiencing stagnant budgets. As a result, all these agencies will have less R&D funding in FY2006 than in FY2003."
