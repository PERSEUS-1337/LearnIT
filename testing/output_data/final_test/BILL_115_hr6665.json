    "content": "The \"Offshore Wind for Territories Act\" is the short title of the Act. It applies the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to the territories of the United States. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include areas within the exclusive economic zone of the United States and the outer Continental Shelf adjacent to any territory or possession of the United States, except those conveyed by Congress to a territorial government for administration. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include territories and possessions of the United States in the definition of \"State\". Additionally, the act excludes the scheduling of lease sales in the outer Continental Shelf adjacent to territories and possessions of the United States. SEC. 3. DISPOSITION OF REVENUES WITH RESPECT TO TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES. Section 9 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to specify the disposition of revenues to territories of the United States from leases on the outer Continental Shelf. This includes deposits to the Treasury, the Coral Reef Conservation Fund, and miscellaneous receipts. The Reef Conservation Act of 2000 allocates 37.5 percent of revenues from leases on the outer Continental Shelf to territories of the United States based on a formula inversely proportional to the distance between the territory's coastline and the leased tract's geographic center. SEC. 33. Wind lease sales for areas of outer continental shelf are now allowed in territories of the United States under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Secretary is authorized to conduct wind lease sales on the outer Continental Shelf, including territories of the United States. A study will be conducted to assess the feasibility of wind lease sales in areas within the territorial jurisdiction of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The Secretary will consult with relevant parties and publish a study in the Federal Register for public comment. Results of the study must be submitted within 18 months. The study required under subparagraph (A) must be submitted to specific committees and delegates, and results should be publicly available on a government website. The Secretary will issue a call for information and nominations for proposed wind lease sales in feasible areas identified in a conducted study. Wind lease sales on the outer Continental Shelf territories meeting specific criteria will be conducted, based on feasibility studies and generated information. The call for information has generated sufficient interest for the area. The Secretary has consulted with the Secretary of Defense and the Governor of the territory regarding wind energy development suitability. If no area meets the criteria, the requirement shall not apply. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF CORAL REEF CONSERVATION FUND. The Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 is amended to include the creation of the Coral Reef Conservation Fund. The Coral Reef Conservation Fund is established in the Treasury to receive revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The funds are to be used by the Secretary of Commerce to carry out the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, with priority given to specific sections. Amounts deposited in the Fund remain available until appropriated by Congress. The President must include information on the Fund in the proposed budget for the United States Government. The Coral Reef Conservation Fund, established to receive revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is renamed as the coral reef public-private partnership fund. Appropriations from the Fund to the Secretary of Commerce are authorized without fiscal year limitation. In subsection (a), the Coral Reef Conservation Fund is renamed as the coral reef public-private partnership fund. Subsection (b) specifies that the Fund will now be referred to as a separate interest bearing account. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 6665 on December 10, 2018. This bill amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to include territories of the United States, establishes offshore wind lease sale requirements, provides funding for coral reef conservation, and addresses other purposes."
