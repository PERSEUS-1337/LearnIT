    "content": "The \"Data Center Optimization Act\" aims to enhance the efficiency of Federal data centers through consolidation and performance requirements. It includes provisions for savings disposition, reporting to Congress and the Federal Chief Information Officer, and specifies the agencies covered by the initiative. The \"Data Center Optimization Act\" defines key terms like Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, covered agency, Federal Chief Information Officer, and data center. The \"Data Center Optimization Act\" defines terms like desktop virtualization as technology creating virtual versions of IT devices and virtualization as simulating software or hardware to consolidate servers. The \"Data Center Optimization Act\" defines terms like desktop virtualization and virtualization, which are essential for increasing server utilization rates. A virtual machine (VM) is a simulated environment used in data centers. The Act also defines terms like Federal data center, power utilization effectiveness, and server utilization. Server utilization refers to the activity level of a server during peak hours. Cloud computing is a model that enables convenient network access to configurable computing resources. It has five essential characteristics and three service models. Cloud computing includes three service models: software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service, along with four deployment models: private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative is outlined in Section 4. The Federal Chief Information Officer, along with agency CIOs, must develop and implement an initiative to optimize Federal data centers by meeting Act requirements and additional measures. Within 6 months, a consolidated plan must be submitted to Congress detailing how agencies will use various methods to meet initiative requirements. The agency consolidation plans must be included in the President's annual budget submission materials, along with detailed budget justifications and appropriations estimates. SEC. 5. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO DATA CENTER CONSOLIDATION. Each covered agency must achieve 75 percent average server utilization in agency data centers by 2015. Agencies must close data centers with under 65 percent server utilization, or provide a detailed explanation for keeping them open. The Federal Chief Information Officer will assess agency explanations in the annual report to Congress. The annual report to Congress highlights the use of virtualization technology for consolidating services in data centers to increase server utilization rates. Agencies are shifting to a \"cloud first\" policy, encouraging the use of commercial cloud technologies and launching private government cloud services. The government is promoting the use of virtualization technology and cloud services to consolidate data centers. Agencies are encouraged to use regional clouds and other cost-effective methods. Covered agencies must achieve a power utilization effectiveness of 1.2 or less by 2015. A pilot program at the Department of Defense aims to research innovative ways for full metering. Each covered agency must establish methods to measure power utilization effectiveness and use desktop virtualization with existing workstations to save costs and improve security. Agencies should prioritize replacing data center servers with more efficient equipment. SEC. 6. DISPOSITION OF SAVINGS FROM DATA CONSOLIDATION. Each covered agency must track and report costs related to the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative annually, including factors like energy, personnel, real estate, capital expenses, and software licenses. Each covered agency is required to track and report savings from the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative annually, including factors such as energy, personnel, real estate, capital expenses, and software licenses. Covered agencies must use cost-effective measures to implement the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative and track savings annually. Any savings should be used to offset implementation costs and enhance IT capabilities within the agency. The Comptroller General will report on methods for calculating savings. The United States will explore ways to calculate savings from the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative, including setting up a special fund for data centers and server optimization. A report on the Comptroller General's findings and recommendations will be submitted to the Federal Chief Information Officer and Congress for consideration in developing the plan. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER. Each covered agency must submit an annual report to the Federal Chief Information Officer on the progress of the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative. The Federal Chief Information Officer, in turn, must submit a consolidated report to Congress assessing agency progress and updating the plan. This report may be included in the annual report required under section 3606 of title 44, United States Code. The report on the progress of the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative must be submitted annually to the Federal Chief Information Officer, who then submits a consolidated report to Congress. This report may also be included in agency budget submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. The Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative covers agencies listed in section 901(b) of title 31, United States Code, and may include additional agencies as determined by the Federal Chief Information Officer."
