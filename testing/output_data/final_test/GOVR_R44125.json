    "content": "The consumer data industry provides information to firms about consumer behavior during financial transactions. This data is used by lenders, banks, credit unions, and insurance companies to make decisions on loans, checking accounts, and insurance products. The use of consumer data goes beyond credit reporting and scoring for loans, encompassing a wide range of financial services. Insurance companies, payday lenders, merchants, and employers rely on consumer data to assess risks and make decisions on financial products and transactions. This reliance significantly impacts consumer access to financial opportunities. Negative information, such as overdrafts, account closures, loan defaults, and fraud incidents, can lead to credit denial and stay on consumer reports for years. Inaccurate or outdated information can limit access to credit, and correcting data can be time-consuming and complex. Exclusion of positive information, like timely repayments, from credit reports can also restrict credit access. The report provides background on the consumer data industry and its impact on financial opportunities. The report discusses consumer scoring and factors used to calculate credit scores, the regulatory framework of the consumer data industry, and policy issues related to inaccurate data, negative information retention, billing practices, consumer rights, and the use of credit bureau data for non-financial purposes. The report addresses policy issues related to credit reporting and the consumer data industry in the 116th Congress, including the use of alternative consumer data, data protection, and security concerns. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters has introduced draft bills to address these issues. The report provides background information on the consumer data industry, including credit reporting agencies (CRAs) and credit scoring. CRAs prepare consumer reports based on financial transactions history data, which may include credit repayment, tenant payment, employment, insurance claims, arrests, bankruptcies, and account management. Consumer reports from credit reporting agencies (CRAs) do not include consumer income or assets, race, ethnicity, religious or political preference, or medical history. The three largest nationwide providers of credit reports are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Other CRAs offer specialized consumer reporting services, such as collecting data on phone, utilities, and telecommunication payments. Property management companies and rent payment services may report to CRAs specializing in rent payment data for tenant and employment screening. Some CRAs focus on consumer reporting for the underbanked and near prime individuals. Some CRAs specialize in consumer reporting for underbanked, near prime, and subprime segments, debt collection, and fraud verification. Firms using consumer reports may also report information to CRAs as furnishers. Tradelines are accounts reported to CRAs by furnishers, serving as records of transaction activity. Furnishing tradelines is voluntary, with different reporting practices among furnishers. Furnishers report money balances owed, with discretion over types of obligations reported. Benefits to users increase as more companies participate, but there are costs involved. Firms must be approved and comply with CRA policies to become furnishers. Data transfer involves security risks, with standardized reporting formats and requirements. Furnishers must invest in technology compatible with CRAs' systems for compliance. Investing in technology compatible with CRA computer systems may lead to compliance costs, especially for smaller firms. Legal obligations under the FCRA require furnishers to report accurate information and investigate consumer disputes, potentially leading to legal costs. Different CRAs have varying business models and policies, resulting in differences in how they store and report information on consumers. This can lead to discrepancies in consumer reports obtained from different CRAs on the same individual. Consumer reports from different CRAs may vary due to differing policies. Consumer scores predict financial behaviors like loan default or insurance claims. Some firms specialize in producing consumer scores rather than credit records. Consumer scoring firms use different statistical models and weighting algorithms to calculate consumer scores, which can vary between firms. These firms may purchase consumer information from different CRAs with their own policies, leading to differences in scores for the same individual and behavior. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), enacted in 1970, regulates the credit reporting industry by requiring consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable procedures for fair and equitable handling of consumer information. This includes ensuring confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of information. The FCRA establishes consumers' rights regarding credit reports, permissible uses of credit reports, and responsibilities for those who collect, furnish, and use the information. It includes consumer protection provisions such as free disclosure of information after adverse actions, the right to one free credit report annually, and the ability to dispute inaccurate information. The FCRA also mandates that CRAs investigate and correct errors within 30 days. The FCRA mandates that CRAs investigate and correct errors within 30 days. Negative collection tradelines can stay on credit reports for 7 years, while tradelines from personal bankruptcy can stay for 10 years. The CFPB has authority over CRAs for consumer protection laws and supervises larger CRAs. The CFPB conducts examinations of credit reporting agencies (CRAs) with annual receipts of $10 million or more, focusing on data accuracy, dispute handling, and furnisher reporting. The CFPB works with CRAs and financial firms to improve credit reporting processes, including developing data governance programs and enhancing dispute resolution for consumers. Congress is also interested in enhancing consumer protections in this area. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 established new consumer protections in response to the Equifax data breach, including the right to a free credit freeze to prevent fraud and identity theft. Selected policy issues regarding credit reports and scores in consumer lending decisions are discussed, along with recent legislative and regulatory developments. The accuracy of consumer information in credit reports is a policy concern. In a 2012 FTC study, 26% of participants found potentially material errors in their reports. After corrections, 13% saw their credit scores increase, with over 40% seeing a rise of more than 20 points, leading to better credit terms. Inaccuracies can occur due to various reasons. The accuracy of consumer data in credit reports is crucial for predicting default risk. Errors may arise from inaccurate consumer input or furnisher data. Challenges in matching information to individuals can lead to fraud or identity theft. The CFPB has urged credit bureaus to improve data accuracy since 2014. The CFPB has urged the largest consumer reporting firms to provide standardized accuracy reports regularly. The top 100 furnishers provide most tradeline information to CRAs, with updates on account status. CRAs have improved communication tools for dispute resolution. Public record data standards were enhanced on July 1, 2017, for civil judgments and tax liens, requiring minimum identifying information and updates every 90 days. Chairwoman Waters' draft bill, the Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019 (CCRRA), aims to address concerns regarding inaccurate or disputed data on credit reports. It would establish new consumer rights around the dispute process, including providing more information about dispute investigations and granting consumers the right to appeal disputes to credit bureaus. The bill would also give consumers the right to seek injunctive relief and provide credit restoration to victims of adverse credit information. The bill aims to provide credit restoration to consumers affected by predatory activities and considers the appropriate length of time for negative information on credit reports. Negative information can impact a consumer's access to financial services and may lead to higher costs or denial of credit. Limiting access to financial services can disproportionately affect the consumer's ability to engage in financial transactions. The bill aims to provide credit restoration to consumers affected by predatory activities and considers the appropriate length of time for negative information on credit reports. This can limit job opportunities and impact access to financial services, leading to higher costs or denial of credit. Retaining inaccurate or outdated information on credit reports may result in consumers being offered costlier credit options or facing denials that do not accurately reflect their risk of default. Retaining negative information on credit reports allows lenders to see long-term trends, impacting credit scores and potentially leading to stricter lending policies. This could limit credit access and competition, favoring lenders with more consumer information. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) found that poor credit can signal criminal activity, and earlier removal of negative information may make it more difficult for an organization to detect fraud. The CCRRA would shorten the time period that adverse information could remain on a person's credit report by three years. The CFPB addressed inconsistent reporting practices by different holders of consumer debt, leading to variations in when unpaid debts appear on credit reports. Medical providers may assign or sell debts to collectors or buyers at different time intervals, impacting the timing of negative information on consumer reports. Debt collectors then report this information to CRAs, affecting tradeline accounts. The CFPB found that approximately 33% of credit reports surveyed had collection tradelines, with 52% related to medical collections. Other significant collection tradelines were unclassified debts (17.3%), cable/cellular bills (8.2%), utilities (7.3%), and retail stores (7.2%). Most medical debts were less than $1,000, showing that more than half of collection tradelines were for relatively small amounts. The median amount owed for medical collection tradelines was $207, with 75% under $490. Consumers often dispute medical debt due to inconsistent billing practices and lack of cost transparency. This leads to delays in payment and appearance of unpaid medical debt on credit reports. Regulators and industry are working to reduce medical tradelines. On December 31, 2014, the IRS announced a rule requiring nonprofit hospitals to determine patient eligibility for financial assistance before taking collection actions. This impacts only nonprofit hospitals. The three major credit reporting agencies established a 180-day waiting period for posting medical collections on consumer credit reports. P.L. 115-174 amends the FCRA to provide credit reporting protections for veterans, including excluding certain medical debt and removing fully paid or settled medical debt. Active duty military personnel receive free credit monitoring. The CCRRA would impose restrictions on the appearance of medical collections on consumer credit reports. The CCRRA would impose restrictions on the appearance of medical collections on consumer credit reports, codifying the CRA's 2017 180-day rule and requiring expedited removal of fully repaid or settled debts, including medical collections. Consumers often struggle to advocate for themselves regarding credit reporting issues due to lack of awareness of their rights. The CFPB receives more credit reporting complaints than any other industry it regulates and provides financial education resources to help consumers understand their rights. The CCRRA proposes free credit scores and reports for consumers, with additional reports available for specific events like applying for loans or identity theft. It also aims to provide more information on dispute rights and limit hard inquiries for certain credit products. Policy questions remain on the use of credit bureau data. The use of credit bureau data for employment decisions is a common practice among organizations. Employers use this information to reduce the risk of employee theft and legal liability. To comply with the FCRA, employers must inform applicants and obtain their written permission before obtaining a credit report. If an adverse action is taken based on the report, the applicant must be provided with a copy of the report and their FCRA rights summary. The CCRRA would ban the use of credit information for employment decisions, except when required by law or for national security investigations. The CFPB estimates that 20% of the U.S. population cannot have credit scores due to limited credit histories, categorizing some as credit invisibles with no credit record. According to the CFPB, 11.0% of the U.S. adult population are credit invisibles with no credit record, while 8.3% are considered nonscorable due to insufficient or outdated credit histories. Younger adults are more likely to be credit invisible or nonscorable, but as they age, this issue typically improves. Older adults, after the age of 60, may face the issue of having stale credit records. Consumers who are nonscorable may still be scored by other models depending on credit reporting data and scoring models used. Borrowers with impaired credit histories can improve their credit scores by using credit building loans like secured credit cards. Secured credit card lending can help borrowers build or repair their credit histories by allowing lenders to recover funds if payments are missed. Alternative credit scoring models may also assist credit invisibles by including additional predictive consumer payment activity. This could increase accuracy in determining financial relationships with currently nonscoreable consumer groups. Including additional information beyond traditional credit reports, such as utility and rent payments, could potentially benefit individuals with limited credit histories by increasing their access to credit. However, the reliability of medical debt tradelines as predictors of creditworthiness is questioned, leading to newer credit scoring models assigning less weight to medical debt. Developing credit scores with new information may help lenders identify new opportunities. In 2014, the FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider updated credit scoring models for mortgage underwriting. The CCRRA may require the CFPB to report on the impact of using nontraditional data on credit scoring. Implementation of newer credit scoring models may be slow due to costly upgrades for automated underwriting systems in the mortgage market. Upgrading automated underwriting systems in the mortgage market is costly for GSEs, FHA, and loan originators. Not all originators will choose to update their systems. Alternative credit scoring models may not significantly change credit access as credit score is just one factor in underwriting. Factors like debt-to-income ratio and medical/student loan debts still impact mortgage decisions. Alternative credit scores may help some borrowers but not across the board. Congressional interest in data protection is also a concern. Following the Equifax cybersecurity breach in 2017, there has been increased Congressional interest in data protection and security in the consumer data industry. Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs) are required to adhere to data protection standards under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This includes safeguarding consumer records and information to prevent unauthorized access or use that could result in harm. The CFPB lacks authority to regulate safeguarding customer records, FTC enforces Section 501(b) for nonbank financial institutions like CRAs. Bills in Congress aim to direct FTC to establish standards for safeguarding consumer information. A 2019 GAO report suggested actions for FTC, CFPB, and Congress to enhance data protection. The report recommended actions for the FTC, CFPB, and Congress to strengthen oversight of credit bureaus' data security. P.L. 115-174 requires credit bureaus to provide fraud alerts and free freeze/unfreeze alerts. The CCRRA would expand protections for identity theft victims, including free credit monitoring and identity theft services. The new regulations will define parameters for consumer benefits, specifying the duration and services included."
