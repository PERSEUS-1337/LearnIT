Our work introduces a new taxonomy to categorize regularization methods based on their impact on data, network architectures, error terms, regularization terms, and optimization procedures. We identify the fundamental building blocks of these methods and highlight their similarities. Practical recommendations are provided for users and developers of new regularization methods. Regularization in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, is crucial for generalizing well to unseen data. It involves any technique that aims to improve the model's ability to produce better results. The term has evolved to encompass modifications to learning algorithms that reduce test error without significantly impacting training error. Regularization in deep learning aims to improve generalization by utilizing various techniques in the loss function, optimization algorithm, and other methods. A new taxonomy of regularization methods is created to analyze existing techniques and identify their fundamental components, allowing for a better understanding and faster development of new methods. This approach decouples assumptions and tools used in regularization, enabling researchers to focus on enhancing existing assumptions or discovering new ones for better model performance. The taxonomy of regularization methods aims to categorize and analyze existing techniques for improving generalization in deep learning. It focuses on separating concepts and isolating fundamental components to facilitate the development of new methods. The central task is model fitting, finding a function that can be effectively applied. The central task is model fitting, finding a function to approximate a desired mapping from inputs to outputs. Neural networks are commonly used for this purpose, with trainable weights that are adjusted through a minimization procedure of a loss function. The loss function typically consists of an error function and a regularization term to penalize deviations from the targets. The error function penalizes deviations from the targets, while the regularization term penalizes the model based on other criteria. The expected risk is minimized by approximating the empirical risk using a training set sampled from the data distribution. This forms the basis for categorizing regularization methods. Regularization techniques contribute to regularization by modifying the training set, model family, error function, regularization term, and optimization procedure. The quality of a trained model depends on the training data and regularization can be applied through data transformations. These transformations can involve feature extraction, pre-processing, or generating new samples to enhance the learning process. Regularization techniques contribute to regularization by modifying the training set, model family, error function, regularization term, and optimization procedure. Data augmentation involves transformations with stochastic parameters to generate new samples, enhancing the learning process. Data augmentation involves transformations with stochastic parameters to generate new samples, enhancing the learning process. The exception to the stochasticity is when parameters follow a delta distribution, making the dataset size unchanged. Parameters can be deterministic or stochastic, with various strategies for sampling. Data augmentation involves transformations to maximize network error on challenging samples or minimize the difference between network prediction and a fake target. Optimization can be constrained or unconstrained, with stochastic sampling for the highest error. Transformations can be representation-preserving or modifying, altering the data distribution or feature space. Data augmentation involves transformations to maximize network error on challenging samples or minimize the difference between network prediction and a fake target. Transformations can be representation-preserving or modifying, altering the data distribution or feature space. Transformation can be applied to different representations, including hidden-feature space, target, generic, or domain-specific. The distribution of data can be the same for all samples or different for each input vector. The distribution of data can vary for each input vector, depending on factors like hidden-feature space, training dataset, batch of inputs, time, and trainable parameters. Various transformations are applied during training and testing, including data augmentation methods like Dropout. More details on methods using generic transformations can be found in Table 1. Table 2 lists domain-specific methods for image processing, with a focus on rigid and elastic image deformation. Target-preserving data augmentation involves stochastic transformations in input and hidden-feature spaces while maintaining the original target. These methods transform the training set to a new distribution for training. The training samples in the training set are replaced with a new distribution for training. This helps bridge the gap between expected and empirical risk, but both are approximations of the ground truth data. The curr_chunk discusses how datasets used for training are often approximations of the ground truth data distribution, with their own biases and advantages. Different transformations, like elastic image deformations, can introduce biases compared to the ground truth but may still have advantages like providing more training data. In cases of class imbalance, undersampling or oversampling can lead to less realistic but better models. The ideal training dataset may deliberately differ from the ground truth data distribution, especially if transformations are representation-preserving. Data-based regularization methods in deep learning aim to mimic the ground truth data distribution through various transformations. Techniques like Target-preserving data augmentation, Dropout, and Batch normalization are closely related. Future directions in network architecture selection for regularization are discussed. The method class assumes an appropriate learnable input-output mapping with a chosen architecture that can approximate the mapping well. The network can be small or deep, with the mapping being simple or complex but decomposable into simple nonlinear transformations. Layer operations involve data concentration around a lower-dimensional manifold, with convolutional networks being spatially local. Dilated and strided convolutions, along with pooling operations, enhance feature extraction in convolutional networks by preserving relevant high-resolution information and reacting robustly to spatial variations. The text discusses how features sensitive to distortions can be discarded, and how training with noise can make the mapping robust. Extracting noncoadapted features helps disentangle factors of variation, which is beneficial for ensemble learning. Ensemble learning involves combining predictions from weak learners to make a strong prediction. Various techniques like Maxout units, skip-connections, linearly augmented feed-forward networks, residual learning, stochastic depth, and DropIn are used to improve the learning process and model accuracy. These methods help in reusing lower-level features at higher levels of abstraction and prevent issues like vanishing gradients. Ensemble learning techniques like stochastic depth, DropIn, and Mollifying networks focus on extracting complementary features across different levels of abstraction to improve model accuracy. Simplifying random parts of the mapping and optimizing the number of units in the network are key for optimal generalization. Multi-task learning involves multiple tasks aiding each other in learning useful feature extractors without competing for resources. Assumptions about the input-output mapping are necessary for good data fitting, allowing for simplified model constraints like the number of layers and units to prevent underfitting or overfitting. Imposing assumptions about the input-output mapping in neural networks involves selecting the network architecture, which hardwires certain properties of the mapping. Regularization terms and invariances in the data set can also be used to impose assumptions. Assumptions can be hardwired into the operation performed by layers or the connections between layers. In neural networks, assumptions about input-output mapping are imposed through network architecture and regularization methods. Weight sharing reduces model complexity by reusing trainable parameters, as seen in convolutional networks and autoencoders. Activation functions play a crucial role in selecting the right transformation for hidden features. Choosing the right activation function is crucial in neural networks. For instance, Rectified linear units (ReLUs) have shown improved performance in deep architectures by reducing training times and increasing accuracy. ReLUs offer more expressive mappings compared to sigmoid activations, leading to better generalization. However, their hard negative cut-off and unbounded positive part may not always be desirable. Some activation functions designed for regularization include Dropout and Maxout units. Stochastic pooling is a noisy version of max-pooling that allows modeling distributions of activations. Multi-task learning involves modifying the network to predict targets for multiple tasks simultaneously and can be combined with semi-supervised learning. Learning to utilize unlabeled data on an auxiliary task is a concept shared with meta-learning and transfer learning. Model selection involves choosing the best trained model by evaluating predictions on a validation set, different from the one used for early stopping or the test set. Model selection methods involve choosing the best trained model by evaluating predictions on a validation set, which is different from the test set. Different techniques such as network growing, network pruning, and the Network information criterion can be used for model selection without requiring a validation set. The error function used should reflect the quality of the model, with examples like mean squared error or cross-entropy. Regularizing effects can also be achieved through the error function, such as Dice coefficient optimization for class imbalance. Regularization in model training involves modifying targets and mappings to account for additional tasks, with regularization terms depending on certain factors. Regularization can be achieved by adding a regularizer into the loss function, which is independent of the targets and used to improve model performance. Regularization in model training involves adding a regularizer to the loss function, which is independent of the targets and used to encode other properties of the desired model. This allows for inductive bias and the use of unlabeled samples in semi-supervised learning to improve the model based on desired properties. Weight decay is a popular regularization technique that controls the importance of consistency in semi-supervised learning. It corresponds to using a symmetric multivariate normal distribution as a prior for the weights. This regularization term enforces smoothness in the learned mapping of neural networks. The Jacobian penalty in neural networks penalizes mappings with large derivatives, depending on weights, network output, and derivatives of the output with respect to input and weights. Regularization methods in deep learning can be categorized into different branches, with weight decay being the most popular. Some methods are equivalent to others, such as Tangent prop simulating minimal data augmentation and Fast dropout being a deterministic approximation of Dropout in shallow networks. The last class of regularization methods involves regularization through optimization, blurring the lines between optimization and regularization in deep learning. Regularization and optimization are closely intertwined in deep learning, where the shape of the loss function and the optimization procedure dictate training progress in weight space. Dropout, a popular regularization method, can be viewed as a modification of the optimization process. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the primary optimization algorithm for deep neural networks, with weight decay favoring smaller weights. Regularization techniques in deep learning include weight smoothing, weight elimination, soft weight-sharing, fast dropout approximation, and mutual exclusivity. These methods aim to improve training progress and model generalization by manipulating network weights. Regularization techniques in deep learning include weight smoothing, weight elimination, soft weight-sharing, fast dropout approximation, and mutual exclusivity. Dropout minimizes weight penalty for shallow networks, promoting sharp predictions and better generalization. Other techniques like segmentation with binary potentials, flat minima search, tangent prop, Jacobian penalty, and noise injection also contribute to model improvement. Regularization techniques in deep learning involve noise injection on inputs, Hessian penalty, Tikhonov regularizers, loss-invariant backpropagation, and prediction-invariant backpropagation. These methods help improve model performance and generalization. Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that uses the gradient of the loss evaluated on a mini-batch from the training set. It is often combined with momentum and other tweaks to improve convergence speed. The algorithm can escape saddle points with the help of noise induced by varying mini-batches and supplementary gradient noise. If the algorithm reaches low training error in a reasonable time, the solution generalizes well. Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that uses the gradient of the loss evaluated on a mini-batch from the training set. It generalizes well under certain assumptions, working as an implicit regularizer to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods like Dropout, data augmentation, and weight decay are not always necessary for good generalization. Methods for initialization/warm-start, update, and termination are discussed. Sampling initial weights from a tuned distribution is a common method to prevent vanishing or exploding activations. Pre-training models on different tasks or data can help prime the learning algorithm for the main objective, preventing vanishing or exploding activations in deeper layers. However, pre-trained models should not be misused as a lazy approach, and methods like Curriculum learning can aid in the transition between pre-training and fine-tuning. Initialization methods can be categorized into two groups: Initialization without pre-training includes random weight initialization, orthogonal weight matrices, and data-dependent weight initialization. Initialization with pre-training involves methods like greedy layer-wise pre-training, curriculum learning, spatial contrasting, and subtask splitting. Update methods can affect individual weight updates through update rules or weight and gradient filters, such as injecting noise into the gradient. Update methods in weight optimization involve various techniques such as Dropout, Momentum, Nesterov's accelerated gradient method, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp, and Adam. These methods can affect individual weight updates by injecting noise into the gradient, but it is unclear which methods only speed up optimization and which aid generalization. Some methods like AdaGrad or Adam may even lose the regularization abilities of SGD. Other techniques include learning rate schedules, online batch selection, and alternatives to SGD like L-BFGS, Hessianfree methods, and ProxProp. The optimization methods BID100 and BID29 involve gradient and weight filters with annealed noise. Various termination methods can improve generalization by stopping optimization at the right moment. Early stopping is a popular method that uses a validation set to evaluate performance. The text discusses termination methods in optimization, focusing on Early stopping as a technique to improve generalization. It compares Early stopping to Weight decay regularization and highlights its ease of hyperparameter tuning. The text also mentions termination methods without using a validation set, such as fixing the number of iterations or using an optimized approximation algorithm. The text discusses regularization techniques for model development, emphasizing the importance of utilizing data information and prior knowledge. Recommendations include choosing appropriate data representations, reflecting learning goals in output nonlinearity, and utilizing known meaningful data transformations. Regularization techniques for model development involve reflecting learning goals in output nonlinearity and error function. Starting with successful techniques like ReLU and gradually increasing complexity while tuning hyperparameters is recommended. Gathering more real data, including labeled and unlabeled samples from the same or similar domains, is advisable when working with limited data. Data augmentation, additional input features, and labels for additional tasks can help improve model performance when working with limited data. Domain-specific transformations and adjusting network architecture are also important considerations. If natural ways to augment data are insufficient, transformations can be inferred from the data. When data augmentation is insufficient, transformations can be inferred from the data. Architecture and regularization terms can incorporate meaningful properties of the mapping, while optimization techniques like initialization and choice of optimizers are crucial for model training. Recommendations for developers of novel regularization methods include trying different optimizers like Nesterov momentum, Adam, and ProxProp to improve results. Understanding successful methods and addressing promising niches in taxonomy properties can have a significant impact. Data augmentation is more effective than loss terms in enforcing properties, as it allows for rich transformation parameter distributions. Future directions for data-based methods include adaptive sampling to reduce errors and training times, learning class-dependent transformations for more plausible samples, and addressing adversarial examples and network robustness. These directions require further investigation to improve results in the field. In this work, a broad definition of regularization for deep learning is proposed, with five main elements of neural network training identified. The approach includes a finer taxonomy for each element and example methods from these subcategories. The work aims to discover new regularization methods by combining existing ones, highlighting links between methods and potential for improvement. Some ambiguities exist in the proposed taxonomy. The text discusses ambiguities in interpreting neural network methods, particularly in mapping inputs to outputs and attributing noise to different components. Ambiguities arise in splitting the mapping into different sections, with choices influenced by common notions and Occam's razor. Stochastic methods like Stochastic depth can have multiple interpretations based on stochastic transformations applied to architecture or weights. The text discusses the ambiguity in interpreting neural network methods, particularly in mapping inputs to outputs and attributing noise to different components. It mentions the stochastic transformation of weights and data in hidden-feature space, as well as the use of dropout to apply a mask to hidden features. The text also discusses projecting dropout noise into input space and different interpretations of the dropout method.

It mentions the stochastic transformation of weights and data in hidden-feature space, as well as the use of dropout to apply a mask to hidden features. The term \"layer\" is commonly used for Dropout or Batch normalization in neural networks. Batch normalization involves the usage of trainable parameters in different parts of the network, known as weight sharing. The ambiguity of auxiliary denoising tasks in ladder networks and similar autoencoder-style loss terms can be interpreted in various ways. Target-preserving data augmentation methods are successful in improving the error term by considering ideal reconstructions as targets."
