    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act of 2015\" or the \"ConTACT Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the long-term effects of concussions, with an estimated 173,285 sports-related mild traumatic brain injuries treated annually in the US among children and adolescents. Repeat concussions can slow recovery and increase the risk of long-term problems. Repeat concussions can lead to second impact syndrome, causing brain swelling, permanent damage, and even death. Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are preventable, but many schools lack resources for proper concussion management. SEC. 317U introduces guidelines for diagnosing, treating, and managing mild traumatic brain injuries in school-aged children. This is crucial as repeat concussions can lead to serious consequences like brain swelling and permanent damage. Many schools currently lack resources for proper concussion management. The Secretary will establish guidelines for States on best practices for diagnosing, treating, and managing mild traumatic brain injuries in school-aged children within 90 days of the final report by the Pediatric MTBI Guideline Expert Panel. The guidelines will also address student athletes returning to play after an MTBI. The Secretary may make grants to States for adopting and disseminating guidelines to schools, ensuring adequate staffing with medical professionals, and implementing pre-season neuropsychological testing for student athletes. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information, including strategies for disseminating guidelines to schools and ensuring their implementation. The Secretary requires States to form strategic partnerships and provide data on MTBIs among student athletes. States must utilize expertise from high school sports associations and brain injury organizations. Coordination of activities is essential for implementing this section. The Secretary must coordinate with other federal agencies regarding MTBIs. A report to Congress is due within 4 years, detailing state adoption of guidelines, schools implementing neuro-psychological testing for student athletes, and data on MTBIs among students. Definitions for this section are provided. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI), school-aged children, second impact syndrome, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, States, and student athletes in grades 6 through 12 participating in school sports. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2017-2020 to support sports programs in elementary and secondary schools."
