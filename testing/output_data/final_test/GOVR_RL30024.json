    "content": "The difficulty in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, is closely linked to the U.S. economy and energy policy. Energy-related activities in 2008 contributed 86% of U.S. greenhouse gases. Despite the strong connection between energy policy and emissions, the U.S. struggles to integrate the two due to its historical reliance on cheap energy. The country is working on using energy more efficiently to reduce emissions per unit of output. The U.S. struggles to control greenhouse gas emissions, with energy-related activities contributing 86% of emissions in 2008. The shift towards natural gas and away from coal, along with a move towards high technology and services, has helped reduce emissions per unit of output. However, overall U.S. GHG emissions increased from 6 to 7 billion metric tons from 1990 to 2008. The debate over a GHG reduction program revolves around the three Cs: Cost, Competitiveness, and Comprehensiveness, each representing complex issues in program development. Costs associated with a GHG reduction program encompass various economic changes, including federal spending on research, regulatory operations, potential increases in expenses, and net costs/benefits analysis. Direct and secondary benefits from GHG reductions, such as technological advancements and decreased conventional pollutants, can be challenging to quantify. Competitiveness concerns arise from the impact of GHG reduction requirements on firms, both domestically and internationally. Comprehensiveness in the debate relates to the global nature of the problem and the need for coordinated responses to address GHG emissions. An individual country's action or inaction affects international competitiveness and growth in GHG emissions. Only a \"comprehensive\" GHG reduction requirement\u2014all nations having to meet comparable GHG reduction requirements\u2014would result in a \"level playing field\" in world markets. However, determining what constitutes \"comparable\" GHG reduction requirements is challenging due to diverse resource endowments and economic conditions of nations. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows for \"differentiated\" responsibilities between developed and developing nations. The international community has struggled for almost two decades to develop a fair and effective approach to reducing GHG emissions, with cost often being a key concern. The United States has been involved in GHG policy deliberations since ratifying the UNFCCC in 1992, with the National Academy of Sciences highlighting the complexities of addressing greenhouse warming. The National Academy of Sciences recommended policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10-40% of 1990 levels at low cost. However, the US did not commit to firm targets for CO2 reductions due to scientific uncertainty. The George H. W. Bush Administration refused to agree to a binding agreement on this issue. Some environmentalists and Members of Congress were hesitant to commit to binding CO2 emission reductions by a specific date. The UNFCCC allows for voluntary control measures, with concerns raised in Senate debates about compliance costs and competitiveness. Proponents of binding commitments argued that emissions controls could create jobs and improve economic health. The objective of the Convention is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous interference. The UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Developed countries were urged to lead in reducing emissions, with a goal to return to 1990 levels by 2000. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was a key part of the US response to the UNFCCC. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) was a response to the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait and the U.S.-led response, with a focus on energy conservation and renewable energy. The George H. W. Bush Administration considered EPACT crucial for reducing greenhouse gases, incorporating recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. EPACT included provisions for energy-efficiency standards, research programs, and evaluation of cost-effective technologies by the Department of Energy. EPACT included Title XVI to address global warming concerns by collecting, analyzing, and reporting information on climate change through the DOE. It aimed to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions at little cost, in line with the 1991 NAS report. The House Report expects substantial reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through H.R. 776, focusing on clean coal, renewable technologies, energy efficiency, and renewable energy initiatives. EPACT aligns with UNFCCC provisions, implementing U.S. commitments to reduce emissions. The U.S. implemented legislation to fulfill its commitment under the UNFCCC, with specific programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. The George H. W. Bush Administration issued the first U.S. plan in 1992, focusing on estimating emissions and existing activities related to greenhouse gases. The George H. W. Bush Administration's environmental initiatives, including the \"Green Lights\" program, were in line with the recommendations of the 1991 IPCC report on climate change. These initiatives aimed to be economically efficient, flexible, and beneficial for reasons beyond just climate change. The Clinton Administration's Climate Change Action Plan aimed to hold U.S. greenhouse gas emissions near 1990 levels by the year 2000, with a projected rise of only 1.4%-6% compared to a 13% rise under a \"business as usual\" scenario. This plan was issued following a White House Conference on Global Climate Change in June 1993. The Clinton Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993, aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It included nearly 50 program activities to achieve this goal, with a focus on market choices to conserve energy. The plan was not submitted to the UNFCCC but was described as the core of a forthcoming submission to meet convention obligations. In 1994, a technical supplement was issued to document the assumptions and parameters used in developing the plan. The 1993 Clinton Administration's Climate Change Action Plan aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. It included various programs to promote energy conservation, increase efficiency, and reduce emissions, such as a \"Golden Carrot\" program for industrial equipment efficiency and a renewable energy consortium. Total greenhouse gas emissions were projected to return to 1990 levels by 2000 under this plan. The Clinton Administration's Climate Change Action Plan aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. However, by 1997, projections showed emissions would increase about 13% above 1990 levels due to unanticipated economic growth and lack of full funding from Congress. The plan focused on public-private partnerships to cut CO2 emissions and enhance productivity. The 1991 NAS report suggested that controlling greenhouse gas emissions could save money through increased efficiency. The UNFCCC established COP to negotiate agreements on global climate change. Concerns were raised at COP-1 about exempting newly industrializing countries like Brazil and China from future binding reduction requirements despite their projected emissions increase. The issue of exempting certain countries from future binding reduction requirements gained importance at COP-2 and COP-3 in Kyoto in December 1997. The U.S. Senate approved Senate Resolution 98, stating conditions for the U.S. to sign any international agreement on greenhouse gases under the UNFCCC. The U.S. Senate approved Senate Resolution 98, setting conditions for signing international agreements on greenhouse gases under the UNFCCC. The resolution requires specific schedules to limit developing countries' emissions, prohibits agreements causing harm to the U.S. economy, and mandates detailed discussions on legislative actions and cost analysis for treaty implementation. The Senate's concerns include the cost to the U.S. economy, competitive effects on trade, and environmental effectiveness of treaties exempting developing countries. The Senate's approval of Senate Resolution 98 called for a reexamination of the NAS report's argument on reducing greenhouse gas emissions at modest cost. The Kyoto Protocol did not meet the conditions of S.Res. 98 as it did not bind developing countries to emission reduction schedules. Critics argue that commitments are not comprehensive until major emitters like China and India sign on. The Clinton Administration signed but did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, while the Bush Administration abandoned it citing flaws like exemptions for developing countries. President Bush criticized the Kyoto Protocol for exempting China and other developing countries, calling it unrealistic and arbitrary. He argued that complying with the mandates would have negative economic impacts. Instead, he proposed a new approach focused on science and market-based incentives to address global climate change while ensuring continued economic growth and prosperity. The George W. Bush Administration outlined six principles in building a climate change policy, including stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations, economic growth, market-based incentives, flexibility, and global participation. These principles align with previous administrations' policies. The George W. Bush Administration's climate change plan focused on reducing greenhouse gas intensity rather than overall emissions, aiming for an 18% reduction by 2012. Additionally, they formed the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate in 2005. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) was formed in 2005 by the George W. Bush Administration. It includes the United States, China, India, Japan, Australia, and South Korea, aiming to facilitate international cooperation on cleaner technologies and practices to address pollution, energy security, and climate change concerns. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the partnership involves both developed and developing nations equally. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) was established in 2005 by the George W. Bush Administration. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the partnership's initiatives are voluntary, focusing on energy security and supply rather than mandatory reduction requirements for global climate change. Some members did try to include explicit consideration of climate change in the debate on energy policy, leading to discussions on mandatory versus voluntary efforts to address global climate change. In 2003 and 2005, Senate bills for mandatory greenhouse gas reduction programs failed. In the 109th Congress, a Sense of the Senate resolution on climate change was introduced, emphasizing the need for action to slow or stop greenhouse gas emissions. The Senate resolution calls for a national program of mandatory limits on greenhouse gases to combat emissions without harming the economy. The resolution passed after a failed attempt to table it. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 also addressed climate change indirectly through energy conservation and auto efficiency standards. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 indirectly addressed climate change through energy conservation and auto efficiency standards. In the 110th Congress, the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported out a revised version of America's Climate Security Act of 2007, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the bill failed on a procedural vote in the Senate. Obama and Biden outlined climate change initiatives during their candidacy. During their candidacy, Senators Obama and Biden outlined climate change initiatives in a \"New Energy for America\" plan, including a pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program. President Obama's administration signaled a shift by appointing John Holdren as Science Advisor and establishing partnerships for developing commercial scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration. President Obama's administration made significant moves towards addressing climate change by appointing key officials and pushing for legislation such as H.R. 2454, a bill aimed at establishing a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions. Obama also directed the EPA to reconsider decisions made by the previous administration regarding carbon dioxide emissions regulations in California. These actions set the stage for the UNFCCC meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009. The bill proposed a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2012, with emissions gradually decreasing until 2050. It included renewable energy requirements, carbon capture mandates, and EPA emission standards. Emission allowances were distributed to various sectors to address impacts on low-income households and protect industries from import competition. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 1733. In 2009, momentum for climate change legislation began to wane as opponents focused on potential costs, competitive disadvantages, and rising emissions from developing nations. The Senate considered bills like S. 1733 for a cap-and-trade program and S. 1462 for renewable energy requirements, but concerns about assessing the situation remained. The cap-and-trade program aims to ensure cost-effective emission reductions by creating a market for allowances to emit GHGs. Emitters can choose to reduce emissions or buy allowances based on economic interest, potentially reaching billions of dollars in value annually. The cap-and-trade program aims to create a market for allowances to emit GHGs, potentially reaching billions of dollars in value annually. The cost of reducing emissions is less than the total value of allowances, leading to debates on the actual costs. This has caused misunderstandings and misrepresentations in debates, resulting in distorted perceptions of massive costs. The citing of large costs, combined with rising emissions from developing countries like China, has slowed the passage of control legislation. The 2009 Copenhagen Conference aimed to address global climate change post-Kyoto. The 2009 Copenhagen Conference aimed to address global climate change post-Kyoto by engaging the United States and China, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Despite initial reluctance from the George W. Bush Administration, President Obama actively participated in negotiations with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to reach an agreement. The outcome showed progress in bridging the gap between developed and developing nations but also highlighted ongoing challenges in finding common ground on reducing emissions. The Copenhagen agreement aimed to reduce global emissions to hold the temperature increase below 2 degrees C. Developed nations committed to specific emission targets for 2020, while developing nations pledged mitigation actions. The accord included monitoring and verification procedures and promised $100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries. The Copenhagen agreement focused on reducing global emissions to limit temperature increase. Developed nations set specific emission targets for 2020, while developing nations committed to mitigation actions. The United States and China submitted their commitments, with the US aiming for a 17% reduction by 2020 and China targeting a 40-45% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020. China aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45% by 2020, increase non-fossil fuel consumption to 15%, and expand forest coverage by 40 million hectares. These actions are voluntary and will follow UNFCCC principles. Policy assumptions changed after the US abandoned the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen negotiations in 2009. The initial UNFCCC ratification was based on the belief that emissions reductions could be achieved at minimal cost. The UNFCCC treaty was ratified with the assumption that emissions reductions could be achieved at little cost, reducing concerns about negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. Compliance with the treaty was voluntary, allowing flexibility in meeting emission reduction goals without penalties. This contrasts with the mandatory reduction requirements of the Kyoto Protocol. The George W. Bush Administration's concern about potential CO2 control costs led to reversing a campaign pledge for emissions reductions. The Obama administration is addressing cost issues through efficiency gains, cap and trade, and voluntary goals. Technological breakthroughs for low-cost alternatives remain uncertain, with critics questioning the feasibility of low-cost solutions. The UNFCCC was ratified during a time when competitiveness issues were focused on Japan and Europe. The EU has implemented reduction policies, addressing U.S. competitiveness among Annex I nations. Concerns about competitiveness now focus on developing economies like India and China. Legislation is addressing these concerns. Competitiveness has been a key focus in legislation introduced in response to concerns about firms affected by climate change mandates and imports from nations without similar mandates. The UNFCCC was ratified when developed nations dominated GHG emissions, but now non-Annex I countries are significant emitters. A comprehensive approach is needed as China surpassed the U.S. as the largest emitter in 2005. The UNFCCC's goals of reducing GHG emissions and preserving economic policies of non-Annex I countries are challenged. Annex I countries' promises of assistance have not yielded desired results, requiring potential fundamental changes in their relationship. Copenhagen aimed to maintain these goals by allowing nations to set their own emission reduction or mitigation goals and establishing a funding mechanism for non-Annex I nations. The effectiveness of voluntary programs remains to be seen. The Kyoto Protocol is being implemented to address the failure of developed nations to reduce emissions voluntarily as agreed in the UNFCCC. Lessons learned from programs like the European emissions trading scheme will inform future actions to reduce emissions. The European emissions trading scheme and lessons learned will inform global efforts beyond 2012. The Copenhagen agreement's impact, especially regarding China and the United States' emission reduction goals, remains uncertain. The United States committed to lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but faces challenges in balancing cost, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness. Success depends on domestic responses and the actions of other major emitters."
