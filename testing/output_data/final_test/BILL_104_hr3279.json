    "content": "EARLY DEFERRED ANNUITIES FOR FORMER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EMPLOYEES. Definitions for the Civil Service Retirement System, defense contractor, and early deferred retirement age are provided in this section. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to retirement benefits for transferred employees of the Department of Defense, including severance pay, separation pay, and eligibility for immediate retirement. These definitions are crucial for understanding the benefits available to former employees affected by military installation closures or realignments. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for former Department of Defense employees affected by military installation closures or realignments, including separation from Federal service and completion of 5 years of civilian service. Former Department of Defense employees affected by military installation closures or realignments must have completed 5 years of civilian service creditable under section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, by the date of separation from Federal service. They must also be employed by the defense contractor within 60 days following separation to perform the same function as before, and remain employed until attaining early deferred retirement age or be involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct. Former Department of Defense employees affected by military installation closures or realignments must have completed 5 years of civilian service creditable under section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, by the date of separation from Federal service. They must also be employed by the defense contractor within 60 days following separation to perform the same function as before, and remain employed until attaining early deferred retirement age or be involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct. For determining eligibility for a deferred annuity under section 8338(a) of title 5, United States Code, a transferred employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the age requirement upon attaining early deferred retirement age. The computation of the annuity of a transferred employee retiring under this section applies to those who were employed in a position classified under the General Schedule before separation from Federal service. The annuity computation for transferred employees retiring under this section involves adjusting the average pay based on pay rate increases. This applies to employees who were in General Schedule positions before separation from Federal service. The annuity computation for transferred employees involves adjusting average pay based on pay rate increases for comparable positions. Service for a defense contractor is not creditable. Transferred employees who receive separation or severance pay upon leaving Federal service are not eligible for an early deferred annuity unless they repay the full amount with interest. They can start receiving the annuity while working for a defense contractor. (g) Lump-Sum Credit Payment: If a transferred employee dies before reaching early deferred retirement age, they will be treated as a former employee not retired for purposes of section 8342 of title 5, United States Code. The Office of Personnel Management will issue regulations to implement this section, effective August 1, 1996, applying to transferred employees separating from Federal service on or after that date."
