Despite initially supporting the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), he later decided not to renew their mandate after becoming a target of investigations. President Jimmy Morales, elected in 2015 on a platform of transparency and anti-corruption, is now under investigation for corruption himself. He tried to terminate CICIG early unilaterally, raising concerns about undermining ongoing investigations and judicial proceedings in Guatemala. The Guatemalan Congress is also considering legislation that could reverse progress in holding officials accountable for corruption and crimes against humanity. Guatemala faces political and social challenges, including high levels of violence, inequality, and poverty, with indigenous people experiencing economic and social marginalization. Guatemala has a history of internal conflict and violence, including a 36-year civil war. The military repressed and violated the human rights of its citizens, with over 200,000 people killed or disappeared. The majority of victims were Mayan. Despite establishing a civilian government in 1986, military repression and human rights violations continued until peace accords were signed in 1996. The United States maintained close relations with most Guatemalan governments. Since the late 1980s, Guatemala has transitioned to democracy from military rule, with democratically elected civilian governments in power for over 30 years. However, corruption, drug trafficking, and resource inequality still plague the country, leading to fragile democratic institutions. Despite efforts to combat corruption, high levels of impunity persist due to intimidation of judicial officials and widespread corruption. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has investigated political parties for campaign finance violations in recent years. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal investigated campaign finance violations in 2014 and 2015, leading to the dissolution of two major parties. President Morales presented his General Government Policy for 2016-2020, focusing on zero tolerance for corruption and other key pillars. However, halfway into his term, Morales faced corruption investigations and criticism for not upholding his anti-corruption pledge. In 2017, his brother and son were arrested on corruption charges. In 2017, the president's brother and son were arrested on corruption charges. Guatemala's attorney general and CICIG sought to lift the president's immunity for alleged campaign finance violations and military bonuses. The president attempted to expel CICIG's head, Commissioner Ivan Vel\u00e1squez, and later prevented him from reentering the country. In 2019, the president tried to terminate CICIG's mandate unilaterally, but the Constitutional Court ruled against him. Critics view these actions as attempts to hinder anticorruption investigations. Morales will lose his immunity when his term ends in January 2020. President Morales will lose his immunity from prosecution when his term ends in January 2020. Public trust in the police and government is low, with strong support for CICIG and the Public Ministry. Tensions have risen as Morales tries to impede CICIG and Congress seeks to reduce penalties for corruption. Peaceful protests have called for Morales and Congress members to resign due to corruption scandals. Continued impunity and failure to provide public services could prolong tensions in Guatemala. Powerful interests have fought against anticorruption efforts, threatening officials and promoting legislation to protect themselves. Prosecution of corruption may lead to violent responses. Efforts to weaken CICIG and the Public Ministry include discrediting officials and activists. Since mid-2017, opponents of anticorruption efforts in Guatemala have escalated tactics such as discrediting officials, activists, and organizations, manipulating the judicial system, and fabricating criminal allegations to silence critics. The International Commission of Jurists report highlights the passive response of the Guatemalan state to these attacks on judicial independence. The upcoming national elections in June 2019 will not see President Morales running for reelection due to constitutional limits. President Morales will not run for reelection due to constitutional limits in Guatemala. If no candidate wins over 50% in the first round of elections, a second round will be held on August 11. Corruption remains a key issue for voters, with 11 out of 27 parties facing charges of illicit campaign financing. Former Attorney General Thelma Aldana is a presidential candidate for the Seed Movement party, known for her anticorruption efforts. Thelma Aldana, a presidential candidate for the Seed Movement party, is internationally recognized for her anticorruption work. She was awarded the 2018 Right Livelihood Award for exposing abuse of power and prosecuting corruption. Despite being labeled as right-wing politically, Aldana expressed interest in an inclusive platform. Following her candidacy announcement, a Guatemalan judge ordered her arrest on charges of embezzlement, which she denies. Sandra Torres, a presidential candidate with the UNE party, faces allegations of illicit campaign financing. Zury Rios, daughter of a former dictator, is also running for president despite initial objections. President Morales's actions have raised concerns among observers. President Morales's efforts to hinder CICIG before the elections could strengthen corrupt parties. Weakening CICIG's enforcement of campaign finance laws may allow drug cartels to continue financing politicians. Morales has made significant tax reforms but has also tried to terminate CICIG and replace reformist officials with allies, raising concerns domestically. President Morales has replaced reformist officials with allies in the tax administration, raising concerns about corruption and reversing reformist policies. Under Juan Francisco Sol\u00f3rzano's leadership, the SAT significantly increased tax collection through judicial measures, recovering $297 million in unpaid taxes in 2016 compared to $5 million in 2015. Despite austerity measures in 2016, the Guatemalan Congress passed an expansionary budget for 2017. The Guatemalan Congress passed an expansionary budget for 2017, aided by increased state revenues from improved tax collection. Sol\u00f3rzano was involved in anticorruption cases and was later fired by President Morales. The homicide rate decreased under the oversight of the interior ministry, leading to the dismissal of senior police officials in 2018. Concern was expressed by various groups over the officials' dismissal. The Ombudsman, Jord\u00e1n Rodas, warned Guatemalans to be vigilant against any signs of regression. The ouster of police Director Nery Ramos was criticized by the trade association CACIF, citing his success in reducing crime. The U.S. Embassy praised Ramos for reducing homicides by 10% compared to January 2017 and for fighting corruption. Some municipalities requested military support due to high violence levels, leading the government to temporarily deploy troops to assist the police. Previous administrations have relied heavily on the military for security measures despite efforts to develop a comprehensive approach. The Morales administration announced a plan to remove the military from citizen security operations by the end of 2017, focusing on external threats as per a peace accord. The interior minister who initiated the plan was fired, but the plan to withdraw military troops from the streets continued. The new Minister of the Interior indicated a shift towards fighting gangs over corruption. President Morales faced criticism for not cracking down on corruption and for his ties to individuals under investigation. He attempted to designate criminal gangs as \"terrorist organizations\" and faced backlash for appointing officials that jeopardized Guatemalan security. The Constitutional Court demanded justification for these appointments. Attorney General Aldana and Commissioner Vel\u00e1squez worked on corruption cases, expressing disappointment in Morales for not supporting their efforts. President Morales faced criticism for not supporting anticorruption efforts and portraying himself as a victim of the judicial system. Initially, his political power was limited due to inexperience and a weak party position in the legislature. Morales's party won 11 seats, but defections increased their total to 37, with allegations of bribery influencing some defections. President Morales faced criticism for not supporting anticorruption efforts and portraying himself as a victim of the judicial system. Initially, his political power was limited due to inexperience and a weak party position in the legislature. Morales's party won 11 seats, but defections increased their total to 37, with allegations of bribery influencing some defections. Morales has formed an alliance in Congress, passing legislation and consolidating support. The legislature blocked investigations into campaign finance violations and bonuses paid to him. Public outcry led to the repeal of a law weakening anticorruption measures. The Congress elected new leadership in 2018, all of whom voted for the controversial \"Pact of the Corrupt.\" Attorney General Maria Consuelo Porras submitted a third request to lift the President's immunity in August 2018. The Guatemalan Congress voted to maintain President Morales' immunity from prosecution despite a third request from Attorney General Maria Consuelo Porras. Morales has faced criticism for contracts with a lobbying firm linked to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, signed without proper authority. He has also been criticized for limiting press access and involvement in foreign affairs. Morales's administration faced scrutiny after a fire killed 41 girls in a state-run home. Several officials were dismissed and charged, with trials beginning in February 2019. Concerns were raised about Morales's party's ties to former military officers potentially influencing support for CICIG and limiting investigations into military corruption and human rights violations. The new government in Guatemala investigated military corruption and human rights violations, leading to legal action against retired army colonel Edgar Ovalle, a key advisor to Morales. Ovalle's immunity was lifted in 2017, and he has been missing since then. Several other military officers linked to the FCN-Naci\u00f3n party have also been arrested on similar charges. Members of a military veterans' association, Avemilgua, which Ovalle helped found, have been involved in supporting the FCN-Naci\u00f3n and defending former dictator Efrain Rios Montt in court. Rios Montt was initially found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity during the civil war but had his conviction overturned later. In 2016, a retrial began for Efrain Rios Montt, who was ordered to stand trial for the massacre of 201 people in Dos Erres. Rios Montt died in 2018 before the trials concluded. President Morales denied genocide during the civil war but acknowledged crimes against humanity. The Defense Ministry revealed in 2017 that Morales received a substantial salary bonus, leading to the arrest of his former defense minister. Guatemala's democratic development has seen high-level government officials being arrested and tried for corruption and human rights abuses. In recent years, high-level government, judicial, and military officials in Guatemala have been arrested and tried for corruption and human rights abuses. This has led to a backlash against reform efforts, threats against officials, and a political crisis involving President Jimmy Morales. The Public Ministry, headed by the Attorney General, has worked with CICIG to strengthen the rule of law in the country. CICIG has helped reduce criminal impunity by assisting with investigations and prosecutions since 2007. President Morales appointed a new Attorney General, Maria Consuelo Porras, in 2018. Reforms and restructuring of the judicial system in Guatemala have been successful with the collaboration of CICIG, leading to increased conviction rates in murder trials and targeting corruption and organized crime. The public widely supports CICIG, and international support has been expressed for their work. CICIG's investigations have resulted in charges against over 200 government officials, including two former presidents, ministers, police chiefs, military officers, and judges. CICIG Commissioner Ivan Velasquez and former AG Thelma Aldana worked together to pursue high-profile corruption cases and build the capacity of prosecutors and judges. The International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) has supported the Public Ministry in over 100 cases, leading to more than 300 convictions, including against former President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti. CICIG-backed justice reforms have contributed to a 5% annual decrease in murder rates in Guatemala from 2007 to 2017. The president-elect of El Salvador has called for a similar commission in his country. El Salvador has requested a similar commission to be established in their country. Investigations by the Public Ministry and mass protests led to the resignations of the president and vice president in 2015. The \"La Linea\" case exposed a customs fraud network at the national tax agency, resulting in numerous arrests. President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti were indicted for corruption and resigned. Guatemala formed an interim government, held lawful elections, and elected President Jimmy Morales in 2016. Dozens of high-level officials were implicated in the corruption case. The \"La Linea\" case in Guatemala implicated high-level government officials and private-sector individuals, leading to concerns about delays in the sentencing process. Former President P\u00e9rez Molina remains in prison, while former Vice President Baldetti is serving a 15\u00bd-year sentence for embezzlement. More officials in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches have been implicated in corruption cases following this landmark case. In Guatemala, high-level officials including three Supreme Court justices faced corruption charges. The country ranked 143rd on the Corruption Perceptions Index in 2017. Former President Alvaro Colom and his cabinet members were arrested for a $35 million fraud case. Colom denies the charges and is out on bail. President Morales had sought advice from experts and international sources early in his term. President Morales initially sought advice on fighting corruption and extended the term of CICIG until 2019. However, after attempts to lift his immunity, Morales declared the head of CICIG persona non grata, leading to a political standoff with the constitutional court and a recommendation for his immunity to be revoked by the Guatemalan congress. On September 11, 2017, the Guatemalan Congress voted to protect the president from further investigation, with only 25 deputies supporting the removal of his immunity. Despite public outcry and protests demanding the resignation of President Morales and 107 legislators who voted to weaken anticorruption laws, the Congress passed a \"national emergency\" bill to reduce penalties for campaign finance violations. This decision was later repealed due to public pressure. In September 2017, the Guatemalan Congress rejected a vote to lift the president's immunity, despite increased support with 70 votes. The Defense Ministry's substantial salary bonus to President Morales was under investigation, leading to calls for his immunity to be lifted for further scrutiny. Despite losing support within his government, Congress voted against lifting Morales's immunity. In 2018, President Morales faced a political crisis as officials resigned over his order to expel Commissioner Velasquez. Despite launching a new civic organization against corruption, Morales ultimately decided not to renew CICIG's term in August 2018. In August 2018, President Morales announced the end of CICIG's mandate, leading to protests and international concerns. He barred Commissioner Vel\u00e1squez from reentering the country and gave CICIG staff 24 hours to leave, defying Constitutional Court rulings. The United States demanded Guatemala return armored vehicles provided for counternarcotics operations. The Morales administration's decision to impeach Constitutional Court members who support CICIG led to protests and calls for Morales to resign. Despite some differences in opinion, many in Congress are concerned that Morales's actions could undermine U.S. efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Guatemala. The Trump Administration initially supported CICIG in 2017 but did not do so again in 2018. The Guatemalan Truth Commission found that state forces were responsible for 93% of human rights violations during the country's internal conflict, with most victims being noncombatant civilians and Mayan. Guatemala convicted former dictator Rios Montt of genocide in 2013. Former Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz's term was marked by pursuing justice for human rights violations during the civil war. Attorney General Aldana and CICIG made progress in historic cases like the \"Creompaz case,\" convicting military commanders for murder, sexual violence, and enforced disappearances. In 2017, a former military chief of staff and other officials were sent to trial for crimes against humanity. Immunity was removed from FCN-Naci\u00f3n deputy Edgar Ovalle for his alleged involvement in the case. Observers have expressed concern that President Morales has failed to protect human rights, with particular issues surrounding his campaign team's lack of cooperation with human rights advocates. Additionally, key advisor Edgar Ovalle, who has since disappeared, was implicated in a case involving forced disappearances allegedly committed by the Guatemalan military during the civil war. In March 2016, previously unknown documents detailing military operations from 1983 to 1990 were seized and made public by a judge, contradicting the army's previous denials of their existence. The Morales administration in Guatemala has faced criticism for refusing to meet with indigenous leaders to address a rise in violence against indigenous people. The Guatemalan Union of Human Rights Defenders has documented over 200 attacks on human rights defenders in 2018, with 26 indigenous activists killed. Legislators are pushing a bill for amnesty for crimes against humanity, including torture and forced disappearance. The proposed amendment in Guatemala includes amnesty for some crimes but not for torture, forced disappearance, and crimes against humanity. It would release prisoners serving time for these crimes and halt all investigations into rights abuses during the civil conflict. The legislature passed the first two votes on the bill, but the third vote was suspended due to protests from human rights advocates, victims' groups, and international organizations. The G13 group of donors, including the United States, stated that providing amnesty would violate Guatemala's international obligations. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Guatemala to cease discussion of the amnesty bill and to permanently shelve it, citing concerns about international obligations, reconciliation efforts, and erosion of faith in the rule of law. Despite the suspension of the vote, amnesty proponents plan to schedule the bill for a third vote. Additionally, amendments to the penal code are being considered that could achieve similar objectives, such as preventing the imprisonment of individuals over 70 and limiting pretrial detention to one year. If passed, the bill would free former military officers convicted of crimes against humanity. The judicial reforms in Guatemala aim to free many convicted individuals, including former military officers, and those charged with corruption. Various organizations support these reforms to combat corruption and strengthen the judicial branch. However, there are opposing forces emerging as anticorruption efforts intensify, leading to threats and attacks against judicial authorities. The UN OHCHR and International Commission of Jurists have expressed concerns about these attacks and efforts to criminalize lawyers. The International Commission of Jurists expressed concern about criminalizing lawyers, community leaders, and human rights defenders in Guatemala. Despite efforts to combat impunity, Guatemalan courts still face irregularities and delays in trials. The work of CICIG and attorneys general has led to over 300 individuals facing legal action, including high-level officials. Several high-level officials in Guatemala, including the former president and vice president, are either in prison, facing trial, or being charged. President Morales pledged to support CICIG but also expressed concerns about interference in Guatemala's administration of justice. Three of Morales's Cabinet members resigned over the political crisis caused by his attempt to expel CICIG's commissioner. Morales sent a representative to the U.N. to express concerns about CICIG. U.S. Congress supported CICIG and criticized Morales's actions. Guatemalan Congress approved changes in judge selection. ICJ report suggested reforms to strengthen judicial system. CICIG launched judicial observatory to improve judiciary rulings. The ICJ found that the Guatemalan state has responded passively to defamation campaigns and attacks on judicial independence. Groups seeking to stop reforms are the same elements behind social media defamation campaigns against CICIG head Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez. Guatemalan Congress passed reform packages in 2016 to streamline legislative procedures and make political and electoral systems more transparent. In late 2017, Guatemala passed laws to improve the judicial process, including creating a Judicial Career Council and a National Bank of Genetic Data. Despite efforts for reform, proposed amendments to promote judicial reform have not been passed by Congress, with the most divisive change being the recognition of the indigenous justice system. Some believe Congress is stalling reforms due to connections to individuals under investigation. The current Congress is hesitant to pass reforms due to links to individuals under corruption investigation. In September 2017, actions were taken to preserve the president's immunity and reduce penalties for campaign finance violations. A bill amending the penal code could free former officials and businesspeople facing corruption charges, including ex-President Perez Molina. Some trials have been delayed by tactics from their own lawyers. Guatemala has seen stable economic growth, being recognized as a top performer in Latin America by the World Bank. Guatemala, a top performer in Latin America, has struggled with high poverty rates despite stable economic growth. The country's GDP is $75.62 billion, with a per-capita income of $4,060 in 2017. Ranked 127th on the 2018 Human Development Index, Guatemala faces high levels of economic inequality and poverty, with the overall poverty rate increasing to 59% in 2014. Indigenous people have a poverty rate of over 79%. Despite efforts for equitable development, rural and indigenous populations continue to face challenges. Guatemala's rural and indigenous populations remain marginalized, with high poverty rates and disparities in education. The country lags behind in development outcomes, with steps to address these issues largely unimplemented. Extreme poverty is on the rise, and nonindigenous children receive more years of schooling than indigenous children. Nonindigenous children in Guatemala receive twice as much schooling as indigenous children. The World Bank recommends rapid economic growth, increased public investment, and pro-poor policies to improve social conditions. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects Guatemala's economic growth to average 2.9% in 2019, with a slight dip to 2.4% in 2020. The IMF warns that slowed economic growth and rapid population growth will hinder per-capita income growth and poverty reduction. Factors hindering economic growth include corruption, limited government revenues, weak institutions, and inadequate infrastructure. A recent economic analysis found that corruption hinders economic activity in Central America. Anti-corruption measures in Guatemala, like those by the MP and CICIG, help boost economic growth by reducing corruption. Guatemala's lack of quality services and education leads to a low-skilled workforce, limiting growth potential. Improving education could double Guatemala's economic growth rate. Guatemala has the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio in the region at 12.6%, with 71% of the population in informal employment. Tax collection improved in 2016-2017, but sustaining this progress will require strong political commitment. Previous tax reforms in 2012 aimed to increase revenues but faced challenges. The IMF has urged Guatemala to increase tax revenue to at least 15% of GDP to address social, security, and infrastructure needs. Land conflicts, particularly in mining areas, are contentious and often violent in the region. Indigenous populations oppose mining due to violations of their land rights and exclusion from decision-making processes. Guatemala is a signatory to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. Guatemala, a signatory to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, faces ongoing land conflicts related to mining, biofuels, dams, ranching, and drug trafficking. The government granted numerous mining licenses without proper consultations, leading to violent disputes. Lack of regulations for prior consultations continues to delay projects, including in the coffee industry, a key export for Guatemala. Guatemala's coffee industry is facing challenges such as coffee leaf rust, low prices, and drought, causing many farmers to leave the market. Remittances from Guatemalans abroad play a significant role in boosting the economy. The country has close relations with the United States, with occasional tensions over human rights issues. Current U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include addressing illegal migration drivers, supporting democracy, human rights, rule of law, economic growth, trade relations, fighting crime, and supporting Central American integration. The Trump Administration expressed support for CICIG and Commissioner Vel\u00e1squez in Guatemala, emphasizing the fight against corruption. Former Guatemalan officials were indicted on drug trafficking charges, with extradition requests and ongoing corruption cases in both Guatemalan and U.S. courts. Former Guatemalan presidential candidate Manu\u00e9l Baldiz\u00f3n faces three corruption charges in Guatemalan courts, including bribery, conspiracy, and money-laundering related to Odebrecht construction contracts. The U.S. arrested Baldiz\u00f3n in January 2018 and plans to extradite him back to Guatemala. The Odebrecht scandal has implicated politicians across Latin America. Baldiz\u00f3n sought asylum in the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other U.S. officials met with Guatemalan President Morales and other Central American leaders in June 2017 to discuss migration and security at a conference in Florida. In June 2017, Vice President Mike Pence met with Central American leaders to discuss migration and security in Florida. Pence emphasized the need to strengthen sending countries' economies to address migration to the United States. However, the Trump Administration has proposed cutting aid to the region and focusing on security over development. President Morales followed Trump's lead by moving Guatemala's embassy to Jerusalem, which was criticized internationally. Trump threatened to cut off aid to countries supporting a U.N. resolution on Jerusalem. In February 2018, Trump thanked Morales during their meeting in Washington. In February 2018, Trump met with Morales in Washington, thanking him for his support on Israel and discussing the importance of stopping illegal immigration from Guatemala. The Trump Administration did not join other countries in supporting CICIG in 2018. Secretary Pompeo expressed continued support for a reformed CICIG in September 2018. In March 2019, the Administration spoke out against Guatemala's proposed amnesty bill and suspended military aid over the misuse of jeeps provided by the Department of Defense. The United States provides assistance to Guatemala through various regional initiatives, including CARSI, PEPFAR, and Food for Peace. U.S. assistance is guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, focusing on the Western Highlands region with high poverty rates. The objective is to create sustainable structures and organizations supported by the Guatemalan government. Some institutions, like the attorney general's office, have improved with U.S. support, while others still need assistance. The U.S. provides assistance to Guatemala through various initiatives like CARSI and PEPFAR. While some institutions have improved with U.S. support, others remain weak. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to address root causes of illegal immigration by improving prosperity, security, and governance. Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion for the Strategy for FY2016-FY2018, with conditions placed on aid for Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Congress withheld 25% of aid until conditions on limiting irregular migration were met, and another 50% until concerns such as combating corruption and supporting poverty reduction programs were addressed. The State Department certified that the three northern triangle governments met Congress's conditions in FY2016 and FY2017, but not in FY2018. The 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act maintained legislative conditions for 50% of assistance to the central government. The Trump Administration proposed cutting aid to Guatemala by 36% for FY2020 and shifting focus towards security over development goals. The Trump Administration's proposed budget aims to cut aid to Guatemala by 36% for FY2020, shifting focus towards security over development goals. This includes eliminating traditional food aid and closing down the Inter-American Foundation, which supports grassroots development in Latin America. Critics are concerned that reducing nonemergency food aid could worsen malnutrition and stunting in Guatemala, potentially leading to increased emigration. The United States aims to improve agricultural and food production, livelihoods of youth, women, and indigenous people, and ease the transition of returning migrants in Guatemala. Congress rejected most proposed cuts for aid to Central America by the Trump Administration. Funding for Guatemala in FY2017 was just under $126 million and in FY2018 was less than $120 million as part of the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The 116th Congress allocated $528 million for Central America in FY2019. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.J.Res. 31, P.L. 116-6) allocated $528 million for Central America, with specific funding amounts for Guatemala and CICIG. The 116th Congress introduced bills addressing immigration, border security, and governance issues in Guatemala. For example, H.Res. 18 aims to redirect foreign assistance to address the causes of illegal immigration. S. 716 and H.R. 1630 propose targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Act. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act would impose targeted sanctions on Guatemalan nationals involved in corruption, money laundering, or human rights violations. The Department of Defense suspended military aid to Guatemala's Ministry of the Interior for misuse of armored jeeps. In response to increased Central American immigration, the Obama Administration urged northern triangle governments to invest in development and security, leading to the Alliance for Prosperity proposal. The Alliance for Prosperity in the northern triangle, a $22 billion initiative with the help of the Inter-American Development Bank, aims to stimulate the productive sector, develop human capital, improve public safety, and strengthen institutions. Some criticized the initial plan for not focusing on development in the poorest regions, but efforts have since been shifted. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador launched a trinational task force in 2016 to address security issues. In November 2016, a trinational task force was launched to address security issues in the northern triangle region. The task force focuses on border protection, dismantling criminal structures, combating human trafficking and drug trafficking, and stopping contraband flow. The initiative includes increased information sharing and cooperation among the governments and law enforcement agencies of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. In December 2018, the governments agreed on a Comprehensive Development Plan, aiming to implement the Global Compact for Migration to improve international migration cooperation. The Honduran Foreign Minister and Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs prioritize respecting migrant dignity and addressing migration causes. Guatemala and the United States have significant trade relations under CAFTA-DR, with supporters citing reforms and critics noting previous trade imbalances. Since CAFTA-DR, the U.S. goods trade surplus with Guatemala has increased to $2.9 billion in 2017. U.S. exports to Guatemala rose by 143%, while Guatemalan exports to the U.S. only increased by 28% from 2005 to 2017. Total U.S.-Guatemala trade in goods and services for 2017 reached $13.5 billion, with U.S. exports amounting to $8.5 billion. Key U.S. exports include mineral fuels, machinery, cereals, and agricultural products like corn, soybean meal, and poultry. U.S. imports from Guatemala totaled about $4 billion, with bananas and knit apparel being significant items. The U.S. imports from Guatemala were around $4 billion, with bananas, plantains, knit apparel, woven apparel, coffee, silver, and gold being major items. Guatemala was the 43rd largest trading partner of the United States in 2017. A labor dispute arose between the U.S. and Guatemala under CAFTA-DR, with the U.S. alleging violations of labor commitments. The arbitral panel in 2017 found Guatemala failed to enforce labor laws effectively, but the U.S. couldn't prove it negatively impacted trade. This raised concerns about the effectiveness of labor regulations in U.S. free trade agreements, leading to potential renegotiation of CAFTA-DR by the Trump Administration. Guatemala is a major transit country for illicit drugs, with porous borders enabling drug trafficking. President Morales opposes drug legalization and the country has seen record drug seizures. The U.S. provides assistance to improve Guatemala's police forces. The 2018 INCSR highlighted improvements in Guatemala's drug control and border security, but noted high corruption levels and low public confidence in government institutions. Limited budget resources hinder effectiveness. Additional steps needed for sustainable drug control mechanisms include support for anti-corruption efforts, accelerated judicial processes, improved interagency cooperation, and adequate financial resources. Corruption within the Guatemalan government has enabled illicit drug trafficking. The U.S. Department of Justice requested the extradition of former Interior Minister Lopez Bonilla. The Justice Department requested the extradition of former Interior Minister Lopez Bonilla for alleged ties to drug cartels. Former Vice President Roxana Baldetti was also indicted on drug trafficking charges. The Trump Administration suspended military aid to Guatemala for counternarcotics operations. The United States ended the transfer of equipment and training to Guatemalan task forces due to misuse of armored jeeps by the Interior Ministry. Approximately 1.5 million U.S. residents claim Guatemalan ethnicity, with over 950,000 foreign-born Guatemalans living in the U.S. in 2017. Migration from Guatemala to the U.S. has been driven by various factors such as socioeconomic opportunities, natural disasters, social violence, and family reunification. Unlike Honduras and El Salvador, Guatemalans have not received Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigration relief. Guatemalans benefit from the DACA program, which offers immigration relief from removal under specific circumstances. The Trump Administration announced plans to phase out DACA, but no legislation has been passed. DACA renewals are being accepted due to federal court orders, but new applications are not. The number of unaccompanied migrant children from Guatemala apprehended at the U.S. border has risen significantly. The number of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors apprehended at the U.S. border has fluctuated over the years, with a peak of 22,327 in FY2018. The U.S. government launched the Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole program in 2014 to provide a safer alternative for asylum seekers. Guatemalans have also benefited from the DACA program, despite the Trump Administration's plans to phase it out. The Central American Minors (CAM) program provided refugee status to some states and parolee status to others between December 2014 and September 2017. The program was ended by the Trump Administration in November 2017. In 2013, 62% of unaccompanied migrant children from Guatemala did not mention serious harm as a reason for leaving, with 84% citing family reunification, work or study opportunities, or helping their families as motivation. Two Guatemalan children, aged 7 and 8, died in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody in December 2018, prompting health inspections for all children in custody and efforts to reduce congestion in government holding facilities. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and the Central American Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity were developed in response to the surge in immigration in 2014. The Trump administration's proposed budgets have focused on security over development, with cuts in assistance to the region. McAleenan emphasized the need for Congress to budget for medical and mental health care for children in immigration facilities. U.S. laws on intercountry adoption aim to prevent children from being bought, kidnapped, or subjected to human trafficking. In FY2007, U.S. citizens adopted 4,726 children from Guatemala, but adoptions were suspended in 2008 due to non-compliance with Hague Convention standards. Guatemala has not yet established regulations to meet convention standards, leading to delays in entering into force. The Hague Convention aims to prevent human trafficking, child stealing, and child selling in intercountry adoptions. Adoptions from Guatemala were suspended in 2008 due to non-compliance with the Hague Convention. Only cases in process by December 31, 2007 were allowed to proceed, with about 3,000 pending at that time. By 2016, all but 3 cases had been resolved. The Guatemalan government is focused on improving domestic adoption processes but remains open to discussions with the U.S. State Department to establish intercountry adoption procedures."
