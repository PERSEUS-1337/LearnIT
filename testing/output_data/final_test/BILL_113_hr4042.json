    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Bank Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital Requirements Study Act of 2014\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"banking institution,\" \"Basel III capital requirements,\" \"Federal banking agencies,\" and \"mortgage servicing asset.\" The term \"servicing asset\" refers to assets resulting from contracts to service loans secured by real estate owned by third parties. A \"nonsystemic banking institution\" is any banking institution not identified as a \"global systemically important bank\" by the Financial Stability Board. Other defined terms include \"bank holding company,\" \"insured depository institution,\" and \"savings and loan holding company.\" The curr_chunk discusses a study on determining the appropriate capital for mortgage servicing assets. The Federal banking agencies will conduct a study on capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic banking institutions. The study will focus on the risk to insured depository institutions, the history of the market for mortgage servicing assets, the ability to establish value for these assets, and regulatory approaches beyond capital requirements. The study will analyze the impact of Basel III capital requirements on nonsystemic banking institutions in the mortgage servicing business, including competition and consumer service. It will also assess the implications of fully implementing these requirements on the mortgage servicing marketplace and their significance in insured depository institution failures. The Federal banking agencies will issue a report to Congress within a year, detailing the results of a study on the impact of Basel III capital requirements on mortgage servicing assets and their relevance to insured depository institution failures. The Federal banking agencies are studying the impact of Basel III capital requirements on mortgage servicing assets before finalizing regulations. SEC. 4. DELAY OF RULEMAKING. Regulations implementing Basel III capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets in nonsystemic banking institutions will be delayed for 6 months after a report is issued. Before issuing a final rule, Federal banking agencies must issue a new proposed rule for public comment and consider regulatory approaches addressing concerns about the value and saleability of mortgage servicing assets."
