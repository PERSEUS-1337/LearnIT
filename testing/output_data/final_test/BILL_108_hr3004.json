    "content": "The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003, also known as the Electric Reliability Standards, amends the Federal Power Act to include a new section on electric reliability. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, Electric Reliability Organization, and reliability standards. The Electric Reliability Improvement Act of 2003 defines key terms related to the bulk-power system, Electric Reliability Organization, and reliability standards. The term 'reliability standard' approved by the Commission ensures reliable operation of the bulk-power system, including existing facilities and planned modifications. 'Reliable operation' means operating within system limits to prevent failures. The term 'Interconnection' refers to a geographic area where bulk-power system components are synchronized to prevent system failures. 'Transmission organization' is defined as an entity approved by the Commission to operate transmission facilities. 'Regional entity' is an entity with specific responsibilities in the power system. The Commission has jurisdiction over the ERO, regional entities, and all users, owners, and operators of the bulk-power system to enforce reliability standards. Compliance with these standards is mandatory for all entities involved. The Commission must issue a final rule within 180 days of enactment to implement these requirements. Following the issuance of a Commission rule, any person may apply for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO). The ERO must have the ability to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system and ensure independence from users and operators while maintaining fair stakeholder representation. The ERO committee must allocate dues fairly, enforce reliability standards impartially, provide public comment opportunities, and maintain balance of interests. The Electric Reliability Organization must file proposed reliability standards with the Commission for approval, ensuring they are just, reasonable, non-discriminatory, and in the public interest. The Commission considers technical expertise in evaluating these standards. The Electric Reliability Organization must submit proposed reliability standards to the Commission for approval, considering technical expertise. The Commission will remand any disapproved standards back to the organization for further review. The Commission can order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit proposed reliability standards for specific matters. The final rule must include fair processes for resolving conflicts with existing Commission-approved agreements. The Commission can order changes to reliability standards if a conflict is found. The Electric Reliability Organization must develop and file modified standards if needed. The ERO can impose penalties for violations of approved standards after a hearing process. The Electric Reliability Organization can impose penalties for violations of approved standards after a hearing process. Penalties must be reviewed by the Commission within 30 days of filing. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. Expedited procedures are in place for penalty review hearings. The Commission can order compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties on users or operators of the bulk-power system. Regulations authorize the ERO to delegate authority to a regional entity for proposing and enforcing reliability standards if certain conditions are met. The Commission can delegate authority to regional entities for efficient administration of bulk-power system reliability. The Commission has the power to ensure compliance with reliability standards and impose penalties when necessary. The Electric Reliability Organization must seek approval from the Commission for any proposed rule changes, ensuring they are just, reasonable, and in the public interest. Penalties for violations must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offense and consider efforts to remedy the violation promptly. The Electric Reliability Organization conducts periodic assessments of the bulk-power system's reliability and adequacy in North America. The President is encouraged to negotiate international agreements with Canada and Mexico for effective compliance with reliability standards. The organization has authority to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for the bulk-power system only, without the power to order additional generation or transmission capacity. The Electric Reliability Organization has the authority to enforce compliance with reliability standards for the bulk-power system. States can take action to ensure safety and reliability of electric service within their borders, as long as it does not conflict with any reliability standard. The Commission will review State actions for consistency with reliability standards and may temporarily halt any conflicting State action. The Commission can establish regional advisory bodies upon petition from two-thirds of States in a region with over half of their electric load served within the region. These bodies provide advice on governance of regional entities and proposed standards within the region. The Commission may establish regional advisory bodies to provide advice on governance and proposed standards within the region. The Commission may give deference to the advice of these bodies if organized on an Interconnection-wide basis. The provisions of this section do not apply to Alaska or Hawaii."
