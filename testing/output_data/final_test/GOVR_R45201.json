    "content": "The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federal agency responsible for improving the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. It serves approximately 2.2 million eligible individuals through programs and facilities on reservations and in urban areas. IHS works with 573 federally recognized tribes, providing services directly or through tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Snyder Act of 1921 and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act authorize IHS programs. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is funded through various sources including discretionary appropriations, collections, and mandatory appropriations. These funds support programs such as sanitation facilities construction, urban health, health professions recruitment, substance abuse and mental health treatment, and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians grants. IHS can also receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, and third-party insurers. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding from discretionary appropriations, collections, and a mandatory appropriation of $150 million. Discretionary appropriations are divided into three accounts: Indian Health Services, Contract Support Costs, and Indian Health Facilities. IHS also collects payments from federal programs like Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as state programs and private insurance. Additionally, IHS collects rent from facilities it owns. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding from discretionary appropriations, collections, and a mandatory appropriation of $150 million annually for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. The President's budget request aims to shift the FY2019 appropriation to discretionary funding. Funding for IHS has generally increased over time, with appropriations for Indian Health Services, Contract Support Costs, and Indian Health Facilities showing growth through FY2018. The FY2018 appropriation for IHS saw significant increases in funding for various programs, including mental health and substance abuse services, Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, and facility maintenance. The FY2019 President's request, formulated before the final FY2018 appropriations were enacted, represents a decrease in funding for several IHS programs and activities. The FY2019 President's request for IHS represents a decrease from FY2018-enacted levels but an increase from FY2017-enacted levels. IHS facilities collect payments from third-party payors, with Medicaid being the largest source of collections, followed by Medicare and private insurance. Payments from the VA for services provided to IHS beneficiaries enrolled in the VA have also been received since FY2014."
