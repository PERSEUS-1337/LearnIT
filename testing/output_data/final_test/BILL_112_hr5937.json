    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2012\" and includes findings related to breast cancer education. The Congress finds that breast cancer disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic/Latina women, with African-American women under 40 having a higher incidence than Caucasian women. It is recommended that individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery consider breast reconstructive surgery, as immediate reconstruction is cost-effective and combines both surgeries. According to the American Cancer Society, delayed breast reconstruction may be beneficial for women needing post-surgical radiation. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 requires health plans to cover breast reconstruction, including necessary stages and symmetry surgery on the opposite breast. Some women may opt for breast prostheses instead of surgical reconstruction. Up to 70 percent of eligible women for breast reconstruction are not informed of their options, leading to many not undergoing the procedure. Some states have laws requiring women to receive information on breast cancer treatment and reconstruction options. Studies have shown that lack of information and referrals to reconstruction surgeons are key reasons why women do not undergo breast reconstruction. According to a 2008 report by Greenberg, most women undergo breast reconstruction because the option was offered and discussed by the breast cancer surgeon. Women with Medicare have an 11% reconstruction rate, while those with managed care or indemnity insurance have a rate of approximately 54%. Nationally, only 33% of eligible women with breast cancer undergo breast reconstruction. SEC. 399NN-1. BREAST RECONSTRUCTION EDUCATION. The Secretary will implement an education campaign to inform breast cancer patients about breast reconstruction options, prostheses, and coverage under federal law. Patients have the right to choose their provider for reconstructive care. The education campaign will inform breast cancer patients about breast reconstruction options, prostheses, and coverage under federal law. Patients can choose their provider for reconstructive care, including the option for delayed reconstruction after other treatments. The campaign may include additional relevant information determined by the Secretary, but it cannot limit the available healthcare providers for patients. The Secretary will consult with medical societies and patient advocates regarding information dissemination for breast cancer patients, reconstructive surgery, and prostheses."
