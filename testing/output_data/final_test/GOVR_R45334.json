    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established a risk adjustment program to reduce incentives for insurers to avoid enrolling high-risk individuals in private health insurance markets. The program assesses charges to plans with healthier enrollees and makes payments to plans with sicker enrollees, administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as a budget-neutral program. The risk adjustment program established by the Affordable Care Act aims to address health risk differences among plans in each state, allowing for premium variations based on allowable rating factors. Insurers are now limited in setting premiums based on gender or health status in the individual and small-group markets. The ACA's risk adjustment program addresses health risk differences among plans in each state, allowing for premium variations based on factors like health status. Insurers are limited in setting premiums based on gender or health status in individual and small-group markets. Insurers may use benefit designs, networks, formularies, and marketing techniques to avoid high-risk individuals. High-risk individuals may seek comprehensive health insurance plans due to perceived need for more services. Insurers cannot consider individual health status when setting coverage and premiums. Risk adjustment program aims to prevent insurers from enrolling only low-risk individuals and ensure price differences reflect plan benefits. The risk adjustment program aims to prevent insurers from enrolling only low-risk individuals and ensure price differences reflect plan benefits. It is a component of various insurance programs, including Medicare and some state Medicaid programs, as well as in countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany. Program designs may vary, with HHS using the Medicare risk adjustment program as the basis for the ACA risk adjustment program. The report provides responses to frequently asked questions about the ACA risk adjustment program, including background information, mechanics of the program, and future changes. Understanding private health insurance coverage and federal regulations can provide context for the permanent risk adjustment program. The concept of insurance revolves around managing risk, with consumers and insurers approaching health insurance risk differently. Consumers purchase health insurance to protect against financial losses from high-cost medical care, while insurers use various methods to ensure their business remains viable by balancing premiums with the collective risk of providing coverage. The insurer operates a viable business by balancing premiums with the collective risk of the covered population. Insurers use methods to pool risk and ensure that premiums collected are sufficient to fund claims. Before the ACA, insurers could assess risk based on factors like health status and age, charging higher premiums for higher-risk individuals or denying coverage. Individuals with preexisting conditions could have those conditions excluded from coverage. The ACA reformed the private health insurance market by requiring insurers to provide coverage regardless of health status or preexisting conditions, which was not the case before. Insurers could charge higher premiums based on health status and age, and exclude coverage for preexisting conditions prior to the ACA. Under the ACA, insurers cannot deny coverage based on health status or preexisting conditions. Premiums can be adjusted based on factors like enrollment, location, tobacco use, and age. Market reforms aim to increase individuals purchasing health insurance, with some eligible for financial assistance through exchanges. The individual mandate requiring health insurance coverage or a penalty was effectively eliminated in 2019. The uncertainty faced by insurers due to the expanded pool created by ACA reforms centers on the types of individuals seeking coverage, including healthy and unhealthy individuals, previously uninsured individuals, and the demand for healthcare services. Individuals expecting high healthcare usage are more likely to enroll in plans with more benefits. Individuals expecting high healthcare usage are more likely to seek out coverage with more benefits. Under current federal law, insurers cannot set premiums based on gender or health status in the individual and small-group markets. Insurers may still try to avoid high healthcare users by using different benefit designs, networks, formularies, or marketing techniques. The ACA established three risk mitigation programs to reduce financial risk for insurers and stabilize health insurance prices in individual and small-group markets: transitional reinsurance, temporary risk corridors, and permanent risk adjustment programs. The ACA established three risk mitigation programs to stabilize health insurance prices: transitional reinsurance, temporary risk corridors, and permanent risk adjustment programs. These programs aim to make the market stable, encourage insurer participation, and reduce uncertainty for insurers. The risk adjustment program in the ACA helps insurers by transferring funds to plans with sicker enrollees to cover higher costs, while plans with healthier enrollees may owe funds to other insurers. This program aims to encourage insurers to set premiums that accurately reflect the risk of their enrollees. The risk adjustment program in the ACA aims to encourage insurers to set accurate premiums based on enrollees' risk. Insurers submit data for their plans, and CMS calculates risk scores for each plan based on enrollee information and diagnoses. This helps determine plan transfer payments. The risk score is a measure of how costly an enrollee is anticipated to be for the plan. CMS uses risk scores to calculate the plan liability risk score, which is used in the payment transfer formula to determine insurer payments or charges based on predicted costs and expected premiums. Payments and charges are aggregated across rating areas by plan and insurer in the individual or small group market. The risk adjustment program involves aggregating data across rating areas by plan and insurer in the individual or small group market. CMS releases a final report with transfers, due on June 30 following the benefit year. Insurers submit data for eligible plans, including enrollee and claims information, to a server for verification and risk adjustment process. The risk adjustment process involves CMS and insurers receiving plan-level data files and insurers receiving detailed individual-level data. CMS uses Truven MarketScan\u00ae data to calculate risk adjustment payments based on enrollee data submitted by insurers. There are three risk adjustment models for different age groups. The risk adjustment process involves CMS and insurers receiving plan-level data files and detailed individual-level data. Factors used to determine an enrollee's risk score include diagnosis information, demographics, coverage duration, and plan participation. Coefficients are determined for each health plan metal level designation. CMS adapted diagnoses from the Medicare risk adjustment model for use in the ACA program. Diagnoses are grouped into diagnostic groups and further aggregated into conditions. The risk adjustment process involves grouping diagnoses into diagnostic groups (DXGs) and then into condition categories (CCs). CCs describe similar diseases related clinically and in cost. Hierarchies among CCs determine hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) to identify the most severe manifestation. Factors for risk score include demographic information and HCCs based on age categories. The risk adjustment process involves grouping diagnoses into diagnostic groups and condition categories to determine hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) based on demographic factors like age and sex. Additional factors in the adult model include capturing costs for partial year enrollment and a severity interaction factor. Eight HCCs indicate severe illness, impacting related costs. The model includes increased costs for interactions with severe illness and certain HCCs. Cost-sharing plans have a factor for enrollees, leading to lower cost-sharing requirements and potentially increased health service utilization. CRS developed a risk score calculation example using coefficients from HHS parameters. The payment transfer formula in the risk adjustment program determines money flow from low-risk to high-risk plans. CMS administers risk adjustment as a budget-neutral program within each state, transferring funds based on health status differences among plans. The risk adjustment program transfers funds from low-risk to high-risk plans based on health status differences to ensure budget neutrality. Predicted costs and expected revenues are used to calculate plan charges or payments, with factors like average premium and market type taken into account. Transfers are calculated for each plan in separate rating areas within a state and aggregated by plan and insurer. CMS reports risk adjustment payments and charges for each benefit year. The risk adjustment program transfers funds between low-risk and high-risk plans based on health status differences to ensure budget neutrality. Three factors, including plan liability risk score (PLRS), induced demand factor, and geographic cost factor (GCF), are used in the risk adjustment transfer formula to determine a plan's predicted costs. PLRS is calculated by multiplying an enrollee's risk score by the months enrolled and summing this month-weighted risk score across all enrollees in a plan. The induced demand factor measures how an enrollee's use of health services can be attributed to the more generous benefits provided by a plan. This factor varies by metal level and is intended to prevent insurers from receiving payments through risk adjustment due to differences in the plan design and benefits. The geographic cost factor (GCF) accounts for differences in input prices and medical care utilization that vary geographically within a state and may affect premiums. The Geographic Cost Factor (GCF) is determined by comparing average silver plan premiums in a rating area to the state average. Four factors, including actuarial value (AV) and allowable rating factor (ARF), are used in the risk adjustment transfer formula to determine expected premium revenue. AV accounts for differences in enrollee costs covered, while ARF reflects enrollee ages and impact on premiums based on age rating rules. The most expensive group's rating cannot be more than three times higher than the lowest group. The Geographic Cost Factor (GCF) is determined by comparing average silver plan premiums in a rating area to the state average. The Allowable Rating Factor (ARF) reflects enrollee ages and impact on premiums based on age rating rules. The most expensive group's rating cannot be more than three times higher than the lowest group. Plans with higher ARF can collect more premium revenue due to age rating differences. Insurers can set premiums lower for high-risk enrollees under the risk adjustment program. Insurers adjust premiums based on risk adjustment transfers, receiving payments for high-risk enrollees and paying charges for low-risk enrollees. CMS expects insurers to anticipate these payments and adjust premiums accordingly. Premiums are set in spring before open enrollment, with risk adjustment data due by April 30 the following year. In the 2019 benefit year, risk adjustment data collection is due on April 30, 2020. An example from the American Academy of Actuaries report shows three insurers in a hypothetical state and market: Insurer A, B, and C. Insurer A's premium is 10% below the market average, attracting a healthier population with a risk adjustment charge of $30. This charge amounts to about 11% of Insurer A's collected premiums. In the 2019 benefit year, Insurer A's net premium after the risk adjustment charge is $240, resulting in a 1% shortfall. Insurer B matched market average premiums and has the largest market share, avoiding a risk adjustment transfer. Insurer C, with a premium of $330 and a sicker-than-average population, will receive a risk adjustment payment of $30, also facing a 1% shortfall. The relative position of an insurer's premiums within the market affects the adequacy of premium amounts after risk adjustment transfers. Insurers must correctly account for the difference between their enrollees' risk and the risk of the entire market to avoid unanticipated losses or gains. Incorrectly anticipating market risk may lead to premiums being too low, resulting in a risk adjustment charge. The risk adjustment program assesses insurers with healthier-than-average enrollees, potentially leading to solvency issues if premiums are insufficient to cover the charge. Small and new insurers may struggle to set premiums due to variability in risk profiles. The program aims to prevent insurers from charging different premiums based on enrollee risk, allowing price differences to reflect plan benefits, efficiency, and value. The risk adjustment program aims to prevent insurers from charging different premiums based on enrollee risk, allowing price differences to reflect plan benefits, efficiency, and value. Insurers are expected to adjust premiums to anticipate transfer payments or charges. However, the program does not guarantee that premiums will cover the costs of average claims within a state, potentially leading to solvency issues for insurers with higher-than-average risk enrollee populations. The program transfers funds between insurers but does not add money into the system, resulting in premiums that may not cover the costs of enrollees in the entire state or market. Additionally, the program does not ensure stable premiums from year to year. The risk adjustment program aims to prevent insurers from charging different premiums based on enrollee risk. Insurers develop rates based on factors like population covered, medical costs, and laws. Premiums are set to reflect the health status of the risk pool at the state level. Plan design and expected utilization of health services also impact premiums. Premiums for health insurance plans are determined by factors like plan design, health care costs, administrative expenses, and profit margins. Various laws, regulations, and policy changes can also impact premiums. In 2017, factors affecting premiums included the end of transitional reinsurance programs and changes in the small-group market. In 2018, legislative and regulatory uncertainty played a role in premium fluctuations. The risk adjustment program, which began in 2014, recently completed calculations for the 2017 benefit year. The final risk adjustment report for each benefit year is published on June 30 of the following year. Despite CMS suspending collections and payments in 2018 due to a court decision, a final rule was issued on July 24, 2018, reissuing the risk adjustment. The report and appendixes can be found on the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight website. The risk adjustment program, initiated in 2014, had its methodology reissued in a final rule on July 24, 2018, to ensure program continuity. Analysis by the American Academy of Actuaries and CMS indicated that the program functioned as intended in 2014, with risk adjustment transfers balancing insurers' loss ratios. Insurers' medical loss ratios, the percentage of premiums spent on healthcare claims, were brought closer together through these transfers. The risk adjustment program aims to balance insurers' loss ratios by transferring funds based on their risk levels. Premiums include factors beyond claims costs, such as administrative expenses and profit. Insurers with higher paid claims per enrollee tend to receive risk adjustment payments, while those with lower plan liability risk scores may face charges. Both the American Academy of Actuaries and CMS analyzed the impact of the program. Both the American Academy of Actuaries and CMS analyzed the impact of risk adjustment on insurers based on their size. Smaller insurers had more variability in risk adjustment payments and charges as a percentage of premium. Smaller insurers were more likely to have a higher risk adjustment transfer relative to premium percentage due to their market share. Insurers with higher market share are closer to the market average, while smaller insurers have enrollees skewed towards lower or higher-than-average risk. CMS noted that an insurer's size did not determine if they received a risk adjustment payment or charge. The American Academy of Actuaries and CMS analyzed the impact of risk adjustment on insurers based on size. They noted potential operational difficulties experienced by insurers in the first year of the program, such as technical issues with data collection. Both organizations suggested that data submission would improve over time and pricing premiums would become more accurate. Two significant changes were made to the risk adjustment program for the 2018 benefit year. The changes include adding prescription drugs to the risk adjustment model to enhance accuracy and creating a high-cost risk pool. CMS developed prescription drug categories (RXCs) to group drugs for inclusion in the risk adjustment model, working with clinicians to determine RXCs for diagnoses and severity indicators. CMS added prescription drugs to the risk adjustment model to improve accuracy and created RXCs to group drugs for inclusion. The agency will monitor drug utilization for unintended impacts and may adjust RXCs in the future. The American Academy of Actuaries recommended including prescription drugs in the model for better cost prediction and payment accuracy. Starting in 2018, CMS implemented a national-level high-cost risk pool for the individual and small group markets to ensure fair payments for high-cost conditions treated with expensive drugs. Insurers receive adjustments for high-cost enrollees with claims costs exceeding $1 million, maintaining budget neutrality. CMS will calculate an adjustment as a percentage of an insurer's total premiums in each market to transfer funds for high-cost enrollees. The adjustment is expected to be less than 0.5% of premiums and aims to address the inadequacy of risk adjustment for very high-cost enrollees. Risk adjustment programs do not accurately predict high-cost enrollees, leading insurers to avoid them. A high-cost risk pool with a $1 million threshold is proposed to address this issue, similar to the ACA's transitional reinsurance program. The proposed high-cost risk pool has a $1 million threshold, higher than the transitional reinsurance program's $90,000 attachment points in 2016."
