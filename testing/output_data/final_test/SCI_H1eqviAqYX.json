    "content": "Recent advances in neural Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models show a data-driven approach to response generation. However, these models often produce short and generic replies, limiting their practical use in open-domain tasks. An analysis of the optimization goal of Neural Response Generation (NRG) reveals that Seq2Seq models tend to select common words and overlook query semantics in word ordering. To address this issue, a max-marginal ranking regularization term is proposed to improve the performance of Seq2Seq models. In response to the limitations of Seq2Seq models in generating relevant and coherent replies, a max-marginal ranking regularization term is proposed to improve performance. Empirical experiments have validated the analysis and methodology proposed in this study. In this paper, an investigation is conducted on the performance of seq2seq models on the NRG task. Universal replies in dialog corpora consist of highly frequent words and cover a large portion of the data, deviating NRG models from other applications. A ranking-oriented regularization term is proposed to address this issue in model training. The paper proposes a max-marginal ranking regularization to improve Seq2seq models in generating informative responses and avoiding generic replies. Experimental results show better performance and reduced ambiguity in responses. The main contributions include analyzing the loss function of Seq2seq models on the NRG task and addressing the issue of universal replies through the proposed regularization. One issue with Seq2Seq models is the tendency to generate common and unrelated responses, as the semantic constraint from query to response is weak. Unlike machine translation, where responses must be semantically equivalent, responses in NRG are not required to be equivalent. In NRG, replies do not need to be semantically aligned like in NMT. The model learns shared information among replies to choose common high-frequent responses. Responses in NRG are diversified to satisfy causality with queries. Valid translations in French show fixed word-level mapping between query and targets. The sequence-mapping problem in NRG involves target word selection and word ordering to generate coherent replies. The model learns to select target words and order them in the response, reflected in the loss function. The objective is to determine the probability of target word selection and word ordering given a query and possible words. The objective in NRG is to maximize the joint probabilities of target word selection and word ordering in generating coherent replies. This involves optimizing the conditional probabilities based on the frequency of words in the response set. The Seq2Seq strategy for word selection in responses is based on the frequency of words, with common words having higher probabilities. The probability of each response is inversely proportional to the number of responses, and the mean frequency of words in replies is around 1. Target word selection probability is limited by the diversity of answers. The translation task requires word-level mappings as source and target sentences are semantically equivalent, limiting target word selection probability. Zipf's law states that word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank, affecting word ordering probability. According to Zipf's law, word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. A universal reply consists of top-t ranked words, with a probability of p(w) \u2265 1/(10t). The amount of possible queries for a universal reply is proportional to the size of query-response pairs. Lemma 2 establishes that the probability of a chosen word belonging to the most frequent t words is greater than 0.69. The proportion of universal replies among possible responses can be computed using combinations, and the total probability of these replies can be determined accordingly. The probability of a response y in a corpus can be calculated using Eq. 5, with M \u221d N being a large number for practical datasets. Each informative query has K ground-truth replies, and a reply y not in universal replies has K unique queries. The word ordering probability can be determined based on Lemma 1. The word ordering probability for non-universal replies can be optimized by maximizing p(y|S(y)). This language model probability is independent of the query x and is calculated sequentially based on previously outputted words. The insufficient constraint of the target words' cross-entropy loss in NRG hinders seq2seq models from exploring parameters due to the distribution of the NRG corpus favoring universal replies. Removing multiple replies could address this issue, but filtering the dataset at scale poses training difficulties. The difficulty of model training is increased by the scale of the dataset. Naively removing multiple replies can harm reply diversity in the NRG task. An ideal chatbot agent is expected to provide specific replies related to keywords like 'film', 'background', 'director', and 'book'. To emphasize the impact of queries on these relevant words, a max-marginal ranking loss is proposed. Training involves categorizing responses as positive or negative to reinforce relevant replies with discriminative information. Training instances are reconstructed as triplets to include the original query-response pair and noise for negative answers. The model's loss function is reconstructed to include a penalty for irrelevant responses, controlled by the hyper-parameter \u03bb. The gradient of the composed loss function is computed using the sub-gradient method, with a condition based on the difference between predicted and noise responses. The loss function is formalized with a penalty for irrelevant responses, controlled by \u03bb. The proposed loss aims to penalize frequent words and irrelevant candidates, focusing on different words rather than generic ones. The goal is to optimize the model for sequence generation by penalizing irrelevant responses. The dataset used in this study contained almost ten million query and response pairs collected from a popular Chinese social media site. Case studies were extracted and translated into English, with query and reply lengths set for training efficiency. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, with statistical details provided. Thirty percent of queries had multiple responses, each appearing about 1.33 times in the training dataset. The study validated the proposed model by comparing it with various baselines, including S2SA, S2SA + MMI, Ranking-Reg, and Ranking-Reg + MMI. Response quality was evaluated using Word Perplexity (PPL) and ROGUE score. In experiments, response quality was evaluated using Word Perplexity (PPL) and ROGUE score BID9. Diversity measurements Distinct-1 and Distinct-2 were also employed. Human annotators verified the quality of generated responses for 100 queries with 10 replies each. The models had an initial learning rate of 1e-4. The models were implemented in Theano and trained on a GPU for 7 epochs. Models with rank regularization took twice as long to train. Hyperparameters were set based on validation set performance. The model with max-marginal ranking regularization converged faster, improving performance on target loss PPL. Performance metrics are summarized in TAB2. The model with max-marginal ranking regularization outperforms the model with primary loss function on the target loss PPL. Results show that the S2SA model generates responses with more words from the ground truth answers, leading to higher ROUGE scores. This can be attributed to the common words shared between predictions and ground truth, as well as the universal nature of some replies in the test set. The model with rank regularization outperforms S2SA in response re-rank capability, increasing meaningful responses by 10% and reducing irrelevant cases by 4%. Human evaluation shows a preference for safe responses, attributed to promoting highly related words and reducing universal replies. The seq2seq model with ranking regularization shows improved diversity in responses compared to Distinct-1 and Distinct-2. MMI has a smaller impact on diversity than ranking regularization, indicating that Seq2Seq models tend to generate universal replies. Greedy search revision is less effective than ranking regularization in addressing response quality issues. The seq2seq model with ranking regularization prefers meaningful content in queries with sufficient information. Responses show diversity in locations, with S2SA generating universal replies and other models inferring specific locations like \"Joy City shopping mall.\" The use of greedy beam search promotes relevant universal replies. The seq2seq model with ranking regularization generates more informative and interesting sentences compared to baselines, with diverse replies and a preference for meaningful content. The model's ability to boost semantically relevant words leads to better results, while the rank loss model produces more varied sentences discussing the topic of \"unreliable.\" The seq2seq model with rank regularization can generate diverse and informative responses, boosting relevant answers to higher ranks. Recent years have seen the development of data-driven dialog models using conversational data. During inference, these models sample latent variables to produce varied responses. Methods to improve response diversity modify the Seq2Seq architecture, and the ranking penalty has been used to promote ground-truth sequences in beam search results. The paper investigates the issue of generic responses in Seq2Seq based neural response generation models. It proposes a word-level margin to improve ground-truth sequences in beam search results. The study analyzes the optimization goal of models and statistical characteristics of conversational data to address the problem of uninformative responses. The study proposes a max-marginal ranking regularization term to enhance Seq2Seq models in generating informative responses. Empirical experiments show that models using this strategy outperform current baseline models on conversation datasets."
