The Chesapeake Bay Program coordinates various organizations within NOAA, Chesapeake Bay Regional Sea Grant Programs, and National Estuarine Research Reserve System for coastal research, fisheries assessments, data management, remote sensing, coastal management, and habitat conservation. The Cooperative Oxford Laboratory of the National Ocean Service coordinates programs on nonindigenous species, marine species pathology, human pathogens, and ecosystem health. It also ensures coordination between NOAA, EPA, and other agencies, and establishes peer review mechanisms for projects. The Office must ensure projects have scientific merit, assist in disseminating project results, and submit biennial reports to Congress and the Secretary of Commerce on Chesapeake Bay protection progress. The Director of the Chesapeake Bay Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must submit proposals for continuing new activities in the Chesapeake Bay and integrating them with partners' activities to meet the commitments of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement and subsequent agreements.
