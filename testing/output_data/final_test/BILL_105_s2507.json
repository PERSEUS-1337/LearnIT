The Act titled the \"United States Cruise Ship Tourism Act of 1998\" defines terms such as coastwise trade, cruise ship, and documented vessel. Coastwise trade refers to passenger transportation within the United States or via a foreign point. A cruise ship is a self-propelled vessel of at least 9,000 gross tons with accommodations for at least 200 passengers, offering various services but not operating as a ferry. The term \"documented vessel\" is defined in section 2101 of title 46, United States Code. The term \"person\" refers to a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, or other entity with controlling interest owned by U.S. citizens as per the Shipping Act, 1916. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 3. Employment of foreign-built, U.S.-flag cruise ships in the coastwise trade. The Secretary may issue a certificate of documentation with coastwise endorsement for a cruise ship not built in the United States, or if rebuilt, not rebuilt in the United States, under certain limitations. The cruise ship must have been built or rebuilt not more than 10 years before the date of enactment of this Act. The Secretary may issue certificates of documentation with coastwise endorsement for cruise ships meeting specific size or passenger capacity requirements. Up to 3 cruise ships can receive these certificates, and additional conditions may be imposed by the Secretary. Cruise ships meeting these criteria are eligible for a certificate of inspection. The Secretary may issue certificates of documentation with coastwise endorsement for cruise ships meeting specific size or passenger capacity requirements. The cruise ship must comply with international agreements, have automatic sprinkler and fire detection systems, and be classed by a recognized classification society. Failure to comply with international agreements will result in the loss of eligibility for the certificate. The Secretary may rely on a classification society's certification to confirm a cruise ship's compliance with international agreements. A coastwise qualified US-flag, foreign-built cruise ship can be placed under foreign registry without approval, but the coastwise endorsement will be revoked in such cases. Limited employment of foreign-flag cruise ships in the coastwise trade of the United States is regulated under Section 4. The Secretary may approve the employment of a coast-wise qualified foreign-flag cruise ship in the coastwise trade of the United States for up to 2 voyages per year, with each voyage not exceeding 2 weeks. This includes transportation of passengers for hire along the U.S. coast or through the Panama Canal. Foreign-flag cruise ships can be employed in coastwise trade along one coast of the United States between two foreign countries. There is a limit of 30 days per cruise ship per year, and the ship must be time-chartered to a charterer that does not own or operate a cruise ship or is affiliated with an owner or operator of a cruise ship. Foreign-flag cruise ships can be employed in coastwise trade along one coast of the United States between two foreign countries. A coastwise qualified foreign-flag cruise ship may be authorized for more than 30 days in a calendar year if fewer than 30 requests for coastwise trade employment authority are received by the Secretary. SEC. 5.
