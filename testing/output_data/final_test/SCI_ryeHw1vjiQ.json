    "content": "In this work, different strategies were used to incorporate prior knowledge into generative modeling approaches for obtaining speaker-dependent low dimensional representations from short-duration speech segments. Convolutional variational autoencoders were utilized, with statistics of the learned posterior distribution serving as low dimensional representations. A variation of the prior within the framework was introduced to enforce speaker dependency in the latent layer. The model was trained for input reconstruction and a discriminative task on latent layer outputs. The effectiveness of triplet loss minimization and speaker recognition as implicit priors was evaluated on the cross-language NIST SRE 2016 setting. The text discusses incorporating prior knowledge into generative modeling using convolutional variational autoencoders for speaker-dependent low dimensional representations. It introduces a variation of the prior to enforce speaker dependency and evaluates the effectiveness of implicit priors in the cross-language NIST SRE 2016 setting. The Lower Bound (ELBO) equation is simplified to include an inference model and a generative component, with the posterior assumed to be an uncorrelated Gaussian. The reparametrization trick is used for training the VAE with stochastic gradient descent. The text discusses speaker verification using convolutional variational autoencoders. The encoder network computes statistics of q \u03b8 (Z|X) and Z, while the decoder reconstructs the input. Speaker verification involves comparing two utterances for enrollment and verification. Training loss includes mean squared error and cross-entropy loss. The text discusses speaker verification using convolutional variational autoencoders. Evaluation is performed on the speaker verification task using RMSProp. Test data in Tagalog and Cantonese, train data in English. Comparing embeddings obtained with a VAE and two proposed strategies with x-vectors. Speaker identities increase discriminability of learned representations. Speaker recognition on statistics of the posterior is noted. Performing speaker recognition on statistics of the posterior is more effective than triplet loss minimization alone. Adaptation results in a significant improvement in discriminability of representations."
