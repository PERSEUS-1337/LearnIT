    "content": "The United States Army is required to conduct joint, multinational operations across the spectrum of operations, from stability and civil support to major combat. Units are trained to be full-spectrum-capable, optimized for ground campaigns but aiming for a globally deployable force. The Army's focus is on achieving a full-spectrum, expeditionary capability despite being an all-volunteer rotational force. The all-volunteer Army has evolved into a rotational force to prevent soldiers from leaving due to excessive combat tours. This restructuring led to a shift from division-based to brigade combat team-based force to increase the force pool. The Army transitioned to a brigade combat team (BCT)-based force to increase combat units available for deployment. The goal is to have 76 BCTs - 48 active and 28 Army National Guard, along with support brigades. By September 2007, 35 active brigades had converted to BCTs, with 3 more in progress. The new BCT configuration aims to be more flexible in handling various challenges. The Army National Guard also converted 9 brigades to BCTs in 2007. Additionally, support units were transformed into Multi-Functional and Functional Support Brigades. The Army transitioned to a brigade combat team (BCT)-based force to increase combat units available for deployment. By the end of FY2007, 58 Multi-Functional Support Brigades and 96 Functional Support Brigades were created in the active and reserve components. These units are full-spectrum and not specialized for specific operations. The Army plans to complete the conversion of the force by FY2012, with the only major future change being the fielding of Future Combat System (FCS) equipped BCTs starting in FY2014. The Army transitioned to a brigade combat team (BCT)-based force to increase combat units available for deployment. By the end of FY2007, 58 Multi-Functional Support Brigades and 96 Functional Support Brigades were created in the active and reserve components. These units are full-spectrum and not specialized for specific operations. The Army plans to complete the conversion of the force by FY2012, with the only major future change being the fielding of Future Combat System (FCS) equipped BCTs starting in FY2014. 15 existing Heavy BCTs are being touted as full-spectrum forces, but some suggest that FCS BCTs may not be appropriate for counterinsurgency and stabilization operations in restrictive terrain and urban areas. The Army and Marine forces defeated Iraq's conventional forces in about three weeks, attributed to U.S. military technology and airpower. The Army's Rapid Decisive Operations concept was validated, but their performance in Stability Operations Phase was considered inadequate. Stabilization operations are more challenging than defeating conventional forces and require immediate action post-defeat. The U.S. failed to properly plan and execute post-defeat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to power vacuums and insurgencies. The Army's performance in counterinsurgency varied, with the need to relearn warfare challenging its \"full spectrum\" capability assertion. Lessons from Iraq were taken into account by the Department of Defense and Services. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Services have implemented doctrinal, educational, and training changes to enhance counterinsurgency and stabilization capabilities, influenced by lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. A directive titled \"Military Support for Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) Operations\" was issued in response to Phase IV inadequacies, emphasizing the importance of stability operations as a core U.S. military mission. The DOD directive emphasizes the equal importance of stability and combat operations, marking a cultural shift for the U.S. military. The Army has historically avoided stability operations but has now developed doctrine for such operations, influencing how it organizes, equips, and trains its forces. The Army published Field Manual (FM) 3-07 in February 2003 to provide doctrinal foundations for stability and support operations. FM 3-07 does not recommend specialized units and instead relies on existing units. In December 2006, the Army and Marine Corps released FM 3-24, emphasizing the need for a successful counterinsurgency campaign. The Army's approach to counterinsurgency emphasizes non-military agency involvement, a lighter military strategy, and continuous learning. There is no recommendation for specialized counterinsurgency units in FM 3-24, with a focus on full-spectrum-capable units. The Army has made significant changes in soldier and officer education and unit training to prioritize stabilization and counterinsurgency operations. Military education now emphasizes training leaders at all levels, shifting away from conventional force-on-force combat operations. The Army has revamped its education system to focus on stabilization, counterinsurgency, cultural awareness, and language skills. Courses at the Command and General Staff College now include over 200 hours of counterinsurgency training. Officer and NCO courses have been shortened to meet the demands of deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army aims to develop leaders who are skilled in warfare, governance, diplomacy, and cultural awareness. Training for soldiers includes basic and specialized occupational training before joining their units. The focus is on combat-related and survival skills. The Army's training has been modified to focus on combat-related and survival skills needed for Iraq and Afghanistan, with significant changes at Combat Training Centers. These centers now provide \"graduate level\" training for brigade-sized and smaller units, reflecting lessons learned in combat and addressing counterinsurgency and stabilization missions. The Warsaw-type Pact mechanized and armor forces, light infantry, and irregular forces are now trained at Combat Training Centers with innovations like villages, urban centers, role players, car bombs, and IEDs. The focus has shifted to continuous counterinsurgency and civil affairs operations, working with various organizations. Some units arrive at the centers with reduced readiness due to rapid combat deployments, impacting the quality of training. The Army has shifted its training focus from \"graduate level\" counterinsurgency to mission-essential tasks. Units receive abbreviated pre-deployment training at their home station if they haven't had a CTC rotation. Concerns have been raised about the Army \"cutting corners\" in training by not sending units to CTCs. Force structure changes include converting to BCTs and transitioning from a \"Cold War Structure\" to better address the War on Terrorism. The Army is converting units to better address the War on Terrorism, aiming to relieve stress on high-demand units and improve readiness. The new units are full-spectrum-capable and not specifically designed for counterinsurgency. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff emphasizes the importance of stepping up U.S. advising of security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for the U.S. exit strategy. The training and advising of Afghan and Iraqi military and police units by U.S. forces aim to build capacity for security responsibilities to be transferred to local forces, allowing for a reduction in U.S. troop presence. Ad hoc teams of mid-grade officers and NCOs are deployed for about a year to work alongside Iraqi and Afghan units, following a 72-day training program at Ft. Riley, Kansas. The U.S. military trains and advises Iraqi and Afghan military and police units, providing them with tactics, intelligence, and support. U.S. Army leaders anticipate at least another 15 years of \"persistent conflict\" globally. Concerns exist about the temporary nature of advisory teams and the need for a more efficient approach to long-term training missions. The U.S. military trains and advises Iraqi and Afghan military units for long-term missions. Special advisory teams undergo 10 weeks of training before a year-long deployment. Concerns include the time it takes for teams to become effective, career detriments for officers, and falling behind in promotions due to being off their career paths. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates challenged the Army's current policies in a speech to the Association of the United States Army, emphasizing the need for the Army to regain its edge in fighting conventional wars while adapting to modern conflicts. The Army is urged to adapt to modern conflicts by focusing on unconventional warfare, mentoring indigenous forces, and enhancing nontraditional capabilities. This has sparked a debate on reorganizing the Army to address its shortcomings. The debate over proposals for a sweeping reorganization of the Army to address shortcomings in Iraq has divided Army leaders into two groups: one advocating for specialized units for counterinsurgency, stabilization, and training missions, and another group supporting full-spectrum units. Various proposals for specialized units are being considered, with a focus on Army Special Forces for counterinsurgency and training missions. The Army Special Forces are shifting focus from counterinsurgency and training missions to direct action missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are proposals for specialized counterinsurgency units, with one suggestion being to divide ground forces into three distinct forces for conventional warfighting, counterinsurgency, and homeland defense. The proposal suggests dividing ground forces into three components: traditional mechanized units for combat operations, special forces for counterinsurgency and stabilization missions, and Reserve units for homeland security tasks. This would allow the Army to optimize its forces for specific tasks rather than a full-spectrum approach. The proposal recommends dividing ground forces into three components: traditional mechanized units for combat operations, special forces for counterinsurgency and stabilization missions, and Reserve units for homeland security tasks. This specialization could lead to greater expertise in each area, potentially improving efficiency in future operations. However, drawbacks include the expense of maintaining three separate forces and potential cultural biases within the Army. The proposal suggests shifting the focus of U.S. ground forces from conventional warfighting to counterinsurgency and stabilization missions, potentially reallocating defense funds. This approach may face opposition from advocates of high-cost weapons systems. Another solution proposed is to create special staff sections within Brigade Combat Teams to address counterinsurgency needs. To address counterinsurgency needs, creating special staff sections within Brigade Combat Teams is proposed. These sections would be responsible for formulating plans, policies, and doctrine, as well as providing funds for tasks like logistics and intelligence. Officers in these sections would require specialized training, offering enhanced capabilities at a low cost and without major organizational changes. Creating specialized staff sections within Brigade Combat Teams is proposed to address counterinsurgency needs. While this could enhance the BCT's ability in counterinsurgency operations, it may not directly impact individual soldiers and smaller units. Some argue against creating specialized counterinsurgency units, stating that the primary role of the United States in counterinsurgency is to strengthen and support partners. U.S. involvement in counterinsurgency combat should be seen as an emergency expedient, undertaken only when absolutely necessary. Therefore, creating specialized units may not be an effective use of resources. Creating specialized staff sections within Brigade Combat Teams is proposed to address counterinsurgency needs. It may not be effective to create specialized units for counterinsurgency combat as existing units can be modified for direct combat. The argument is based on current U.S. military doctrine, but it may be unrealistic to always have partners equal to the task. There have been proposals for specialized units for stabilization, security, and reconstruction operations, as well as peacekeeping operations. The Congressional Budget Office proposed restructuring the Army to create specialized Stability and Reconstruction (S&R) Divisions, which would include military police, engineer, medical, civil affairs, and psychological operations units. This proposal aimed to increase the Army's ability to conduct various missions and reduce reliance on the reserve component. The Congressional Budget Office proposed creating specialized Stability and Reconstruction (S&R) Divisions, including military police, engineer, medical, civil affairs, and psychological operations units, along with a single Stryker BCT. This option would save the Army almost $14 billion from 2006 to 2022 by reducing the need for modernizing combat units and high-tech weapons. However, it would also reduce the Army's ability to fight wars by having six fewer BCTs available. The proposal suggests integrating stabilization force packages into BCTs to start reconstruction operations after combat ends. This involves creating multi-functional stabilization task forces with a mix of combat and support forces focused on maintaining security, law enforcement, and infrastructure repair at the local level. Some argue that while establishing specialized stabilization units may be appealing, there are significant downsides to this idea. Combat units are often necessary to deter renewed conflict and win battles in counterinsurgency operations. Large-scale missions may be too much for a small number of specialized units to handle alone, requiring assistance from general-purpose formations. The Army is advised to increase rapidly deployable military police, judges, and other experts for stabilization operations. The Marines have established a Marine Corps Training and Advisory Group (MCTAG) for training and equipping advisor teams. Marines may be assigned temporary training and advisory duties, similar to the Army's current approach. Former U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel John A. Nagl proposes the establishment of a permanent 20,000 member Advisory Corps to oversee the training and deployment of 750 advisory teams. These teams, led by various ranks, would advise and train host nation military forces from the ministry of defense level down to battalion level. Soldiers in the Advisory Corps would serve three-year tours and could return to conventional units or stay for additional tours if desired. The Army has not been supportive of LTC Nagl's proposal to establish a permanent advisory corps. BG Anthony Cucolo rejected the notion, stating that Special Forces already provide the necessary capabilities. LTG Peter Chiarelli also opposes the idea, believing that Special Forces handle the mission effectively. The Army is considering equipping conventional forces to support Iraqi security forces if Special Forces capabilities are exceeded. This includes internally resourcing training and transition teams from U.S. or coalition units. The current Army practice of preparing external trainers at Ft. Riley, KS may be replaced with equipping BCTs with the necessary knowledge and equipment for foreign security training. The Army is looking to enhance conventional forces to support Iraqi security forces by equipping BCTs with the necessary knowledge and equipment for foreign security training. This proposal aims to address issues such as the quality and diversity of team members, curriculum inadequacy, instructor experience, and lack of external support. If approved, the first enhanced BCT could be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan by fall 2008. Army leadership believes that specialized units are not necessary, and full-spectrum units can handle operational challenges effectively. The Army argues that maintaining full-spectrum BCTs in Iraq is crucial due to the need for rapid transitions between different types of missions, such as counterinsurgency, stabilization, and training/advisory tasks. They believe that specialized stabilization units would be risky and ineffective in the unpredictable tactical environment, emphasizing the importance of building relationships with the local population and security forces. The Army argues for maintaining full-spectrum BCTs in Iraq to swiftly switch between missions like counterinsurgency, stabilization, and training/advisory tasks. Elevating the training and advisory mission to a \"core mission\" would require Army units to handle conventional combat, counterinsurgency, stabilization, and training/advisory missions, potentially spreading them too thin. Prioritizing the Army's missions, as during the Cold War, might be a more effective approach. Gates suggests prioritizing unconventional wars for the Army, considering the lack of a major ground force adversary. While the Army has made significant changes in doctrine, education, and training, there is a lack of corresponding changes in force structure. The Army is undergoing changes in force structure, with a focus on full-spectrum units. There are discussions about creating specialized units for counterinsurgency and stabilization, but it is unclear if these proposals have been critically reviewed. The Army is considering specialized units for counterinsurgency and stabilization, but there is a lack of comprehensive analysis comparing all options, including the current full-spectrum approach. Additional training, education, and equipment are needed for brigade combat teams to handle various missions. The Army's need for \"pentathletes\" among its officers and NCOs may be challenging to achieve. The Army is facing challenges in retaining experienced mid-career NCOs and Captains, as well as high-potential junior leaders. This loss could lead to less competition for promotion, potentially promoting less capable officers. To fill officer ranks, the Army is sending NCOs and junior soldiers to Officer Candidate School, impacting the NCO corps. This situation may hinder the Army's ability to maintain a full-spectrum capability and put additional stress on soldiers and BCTs. The Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act requires the Department of Defense to conduct a quadrennial review of its roles and missions, focusing on core mission areas and service capabilities. This review may also address counterinsurgency, stabilization, and training missions, potentially recommending the formation of specialized units to address these areas."
