Mark Twain, also known as Samuel Clemens, is recognized as a significant American literary figure whose work has had a lasting impact on the nation's history and culture. His books, including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, continue to be widely read and studied, with over 6,500 editions translated into 75 languages. Twain's legacy remains strong, with numerous books and doctoral dissertations published about his life and work in the past two decades. Mark Twain's work is remembered for addressing social issues in America at the turn of the century, including the legacy of the Civil War, race relations, and economic inequalities of the \"Gilded Age.\" Americans continue to seek more about his life and work, visiting National Historic Landmarks like the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, CT and the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, MO. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to mint $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items under the Act. According to the United States Code, all coins minted under this Act will be considered numismatic items. The design of coins minted under this Act will reflect Mark Twain's life and legacy, with specific inscriptions and designations required. The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with relevant bodies and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single designated mint facility within a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2013. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.\n\nThe coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value of the coins, the surcharge provided in section 7(a), and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be made at a reasonable discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted at a discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act include a surcharge of $35 per coin for the $5 coin and $10 per coin for the $1 coin. Surcharges received will be distributed to support the restoration of the Mark Twain house and grounds, promote Mark Twain's legacy, and fund programs at the University of California, Berkeley. The surcharges from the sales of coins will support programs to study and promote Mark Twain's legacy. One-fifth will go to the Center for Mark Twain Studies at Elmira College, New York, and another one-fifth to the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal, Missouri. The Comptroller General of the United States will audit the organizations receiving the funds. No surcharge may be included for certain coin issuances under this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to avoid exceeding the annual 2 program limit under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code."
