    "content": "The United States is the world's largest economy, leading trading nation, and major destination for foreign direct investment. In 2017, the U.S. GDP reached $19.5 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the world's output. Despite being the largest exporter, U.S. imports overshadow exports due to high domestic demand. Factors affecting trade include the value of the U.S. dollar, global demand for dollar-denominated assets, and international economic conditions. The United States is the dominant economy in the world, but its position has shifted in the past two decades. Changes in trade patterns present opportunities and challenges for U.S. international trade relations, intensifying congressional interest in U.S. trade policy. Congress may need to shape trade policy to reflect changing trade composition, enhance the competitive position of U.S. firms, workers, and industries, promote access to new foreign markets, and address trade barriers and tensions with emerging economies. International trade is crucial for the U.S. and global economy, with trade as a share of global GDP increasing from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017. Trade openness and reforms have led to higher productivity, incomes, and reduced poverty. However, recent years have seen slower growth in world merchandise trade, with a 2.0% growth rate in 2016, the slowest since 2009. World merchandise trade growth slowed to 2.0% in 2016, the slowest since 2009, but rebounded to 5.4% in 2017 driven by higher investment and consumption. Weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices contributed to the previous slowdown. Analysts attribute structural factors like world investment slowdown and China's shift to a consumption-driven economy, as well as growing trade protectionism. Despite projections for trade growth in 2018 and 2019, rising trade tensions pose downside risks. The IMF, WTO, and OECD warn of slowing global trade growth due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Recent restrictive measures by the US and its partners are already impacting trade flows and prices. Concerns about supply chain disruptions and intensified restrictions are affecting business outlooks and investment plans. The OECD projects that further trade tensions could have adverse effects on global investment and jobs. US world trade has steadily grown over the past decade, with $2.4 trillion in exports and $2.9 trillion in imports in 2017. Since 2009, U.S. exports have grown by 48.5% and imports by 47.6% in nominal terms. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percentage of GDP expanding from 5% to over 12% in 2017, and imports from 4% to over 15%. The process of globalization has led to changes in the U.S. economy, with emerging market economies playing a larger role in global trade. The European Union, Japan, and emerging market economies are key players in world trade flows. U.S. trade with emerging economies is increasing, with significant growth in exports to the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and imports from East Asia and the Pacific. Trade with China has seen the fastest growth, representing a significant portion of U.S. merchandise exports and imports. The importance of emerging economies in U.S. trade is on the rise. The growing importance of emerging economies in U.S. trade is evident in the shifting dynamics of services exports and imports. Trade with China and India has increased, while traditional partners like the United Kingdom and Canada have seen a decrease. The composition of U.S. trade has also changed, with exports of petroleum and coal products rising, and exports of semiconductors and computer equipment declining. Global value chains have become more complex, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the United States. The international fragmentation of U.S. production through global value chains has increased trade with both developing and developed countries. Lower global trade barriers and technological advances have facilitated the growth of these chains, blurring the distinction between exports and imports. This complexity makes it challenging to determine who benefits and loses from global trade. The growth in global production chains and trade in intermediates complicates the interpretation of trade balances. Over 25% of national exports include foreign content, with the U.S. seeing an increase in foreign value-added share in exports since the mid-1990s. Traditional accounting methods may distort trade data due to the complexity of global production chains. The complexity of global production chains and trade in intermediates distorts traditional accounting methods, making it difficult to fully understand the implications of trade data for the U.S. economy. Conventional trade data may underestimate U.S. trade, especially in services, as they do not measure on a value-added basis and do not attribute services inputs in the traded value of manufactured and agricultural products. China's free market reforms since 1979 exemplify this phenomenon. Since 1979, China's free market reforms have made it a major global supply chain center, attracting multinational corporations due to its low-cost labor. Products labeled \"made in China\" are often assembled using imported components, with a small value added in China. Profits from sales, like iPhones and iPads, mainly go to the multinational company owning the brand. The U.S. trade data often attributes the full value of imports like iPhones and iPads to China, even though most of the profits and high-wage functions occur in the United States. This results in an inflated trade deficit figure, as U.S. imports from China are actually from multiple countries. The U.S. trade deficit with China in 2009 would have been reduced by 25% if trade flows were measured based on value-added. U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico contain significant value added from the United States. The report relies on data from various sources including the U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, and International Trade Commission. The report provides an overview of U.S. exports, imports, and trade balances in 2017 using data from various sources. It aims to inform policy discussions by presenting current data and statistics on U.S. trade in an accessible way through charts, tables, and brief explanations. The curr_chunk provides an overview of world economic and trade developments, focusing on major trends in trade between the United States and the rest of the world. It includes data on global GDP growth in 2017 and highlights the growth rates of advanced economies and emerging markets. In 2017, global GDP growth was influenced by the slowdown in China's economic growth. The United States, China, Japan, and Germany accounted for significant portions of world GDP. Major U.S. trading partners had varying growth performances, impacting bilateral trade and exchange rates. Worldwide growth was driven by domestic demand in advanced economies and China, with the Eurozone experiencing its highest growth rate since 2008. In 2017, global GDP growth saw an increase, with Canada and France experiencing higher growth rates. India's economy slowed but is projected to pick up in the following years due to structural reforms. China's economy grew modestly, with a slight increase in its growth rate. China's growth rate is expected to slow in the coming years, with a projected rate of 6.60% in 2018 and 6.18% in 2019. The IMF forecasts improved performance in the short-term for advanced economies and emerging markets. However, growth rates are expected to slow in the medium term, with aging populations and shrinking labor forces in advanced economies acting as a drag on expansion. Fiscal policy is expected to remain expansionary in 2018 and 2019, but begin to turn contractionary by 2020. Monetary policy is expected to remain supportive in the Eurozone and Japan, but may tighten faster in the United States. Global financial conditions are projected to stay accommodative. Growth in emerging and developing Asia is forecasted to exceed global growth, with a growth rate of 6.52% in 2018 and 6.31% in 2019. Emerging and developing Europe is expected to slow down to 3.77% in 2018 and 1.98% in 2019. Latin America and the Caribbean are projected to grow by 1.20% in 2018 and 2.19% in 2019. The Middle East and North Africa are expected to see growth rates of 2.44% in 2018 and 2.72% in 2019. In 2018, North Africa is expected to grow by 2.44% (up from 2.19% in 2017) and 2.72% in 2019. Sub-Saharan Africa's growth is projected to increase to 3.07% in 2018 (up from 2.75% in 2017) and 3.76% in 2019, driven by higher commodity prices. World trade volumes saw significant growth in 2017, increasing by 5.24% due to stronger global economic growth and supportive fiscal conditions. In 2017, world trade volume of goods and services increased by 5.24%, with both advanced and emerging market economies experiencing growth in exports and imports. Emerging market and developing economies saw a higher growth rate, driven by China's increased exports and imports. Exports from all regions except the Middle East and North Africa grew at a higher rate in 2017 compared to 2016, with emerging market and developing economies leading in export growth. In 2017, Asia led in exports with a 9.68% increase, followed by emerging Europe at 8.91%. The Eurozone also saw a significant export growth from 2.63% to 5.19%. Developed economies had more momentum by the end of 2017, with the largest import volume gains in emerging markets. World merchandise exports expanded by 10.56% in 2017. In 2017, world merchandise exports grew by 10.56%, reaching $17,478.8 billion. The EU was the largest trading bloc with $11,346.5 billion in total trade. China's share of world exports increased to 12.68%, while the U.S. share decreased to 8.87%. The U.S. remained the largest merchandise importer, accounting for 13.79% of world imports. World exports and imports of services also increased significantly in 2017. The U.S. share of world services imports and exports has fluctuated in recent years. The WTO forecasts a gradual moderation in merchandise trade growth in 2018 and 2019, with uncertainty due to trade tensions. World exports of goods and services are projected to expand in 2018, with advanced economies and emerging markets both expected to see growth. The U.S. economy grew faster in 2017 with a 2.2% increase in real GDP, up from 1.5% in 2016. The largest contributions to this growth came from professional and business services, finance, insurance, manufacturing, education, health care, and retail trade. Net exports had a negative contribution to GDP growth in 2017, similar to 2016. GDP growth from net exports was negative in 2017, with exports of goods and services contributing to growth. Government spending had a minimal impact on growth. The U.S. economy is projected to continue strong performance in 2018, with forecasts of 2.9% growth. Labor market data indicate full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.1% in 2017. The U.S. current-account deficit remains a concern. The U.S. current-account deficit increased in 2017 to $449.1 billion, with a rise in the merchandise trade deficit offsetting surpluses in services trade and primary income. The trade deficit for goods and services also increased to $552.3 billion in 2017. In 2017, the U.S. current-account deficit rose to $449.1 billion, with a merchandise trade deficit increase. U.S. goods exports grew to $1.55 trillion, while goods imports increased to $2.36 trillion. The trade surplus for services expanded to $255.2 billion, with services exports rising to $797.7 billion. In 2017, U.S. services exports saw increases in financial services (10.32%) and telecommunications, computers, and information services (9.52%). Services imports also rose to $542.5 billion. U.S. merchandise exports totaled $1.55 trillion, a 6.62% increase from 2016, while merchandise imports were $2.36 trillion, up 6.92%. This led to a $56.4 billion increase in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit to $807.5 billion in 2017. In 2017, the United States had trade surpluses in agricultural foods and industrial supplies. Energy-related products saw significant increases in both exports and imports. Capital goods were the largest export category, followed by industrial supplies, consumer goods, automotive, and foods. The top exports were petroleum, chemicals, and metals. In 2017, U.S. exports saw increases in all merchandise categories, with the largest increase in industrial supply and materials (up 17.77% or $68.8 billion). Other notable increases were seen in automotive vehicles, parts, and engines, as well as capital goods. At the product level, there were significant increases in crude oil, coal, natural gas, and raw cotton exports. In 2017, U.S. exports increased in all categories, with the largest rise in industrial supplies and materials. Significant increases were also seen in automotive vehicles, parts, and engines, as well as capital goods. Notable declines were observed in civilian aircraft, telecommunications equipment, soybeans, and medicinal, dental, and pharmaceutical products.

The top imports included household goods, passenger cars, crude, metals, machinery, chemicals, telecommunications equipment, and computers. Oil-drilling machinery, crude, metals, trucks, computers, and fish showed the largest import increases. U.S. exports of energy products rose sharply in 2017, with significant increases in petroleum, coal, and natural gas exports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil production reached 9.3 million barrels per day in 2017, increasing by 464,000 barrels per day from 2016. In November 2017, production hit a record high of 10.07 million barrels per day. The growth is driven by tight rock formations and hydraulic fracturing. EIA projects production to continue growing in 2018 and 2019, reaching 10.7 and 11.3 million barrels per day. Additionally, U.S. coal exports increased by 61% in 2017, with exports to Asia doubling. In 2017, U.S. coal exports to Asia doubled, with Europe still being the largest recipient. Steam coal, mainly used for electricity generation, saw a significant increase in exports. Top recipients of U.S. steam coal included the Netherlands, South Korea, India, Mexico, and Japan. India imported nearly three times more steam coal in 2017 to support its growing electricity capacity. The EU was the top trading partner for the U.S. in terms of two-way merchandise trade, followed by China, Canada, and Mexico. The EU was also the leading market for U.S. exports, totaling $284.8 billion, with Canada as the second largest export market. China was the leading source of U.S. imports.

Imports from Chile saw the largest percent increase at 26.59%, while imports from Peru and Bahrain also grew significantly. Imports from NAFTA partners (Canada and Mexico) rose by 3.54%. U.S. imports under FTAs declined the most from Oman, Colombia, and South Korea. The United States is the top exporter of services, accounting for $780.9 billion in 2017. Other top exporters include the UK, Germany, France, and China. China and India have been among the top 10 exporters since the mid-2000s. The top 10 exporting countries together accounted for 52.14% of world services exports in 2017. The United States is also the largest importer of services, followed by China, Germany, France, and the UK. In 2017, the top 10 importer countries accounted for 52.04% of world services imports.

In 2017, the U.S. trade deficit on goods and services was 2.83% of GDP, up from 2.68% in 2016 but down from 5.51% in 2006. Congress shapes U.S. trade policy through legislative and oversight authority granted by the Constitution. This includes regulating commerce with foreign nations, imposing taxes, and addressing unfair trade practices. The Trump Administration's trade policy, labeled \"Putting America First,\" raises questions about the role of trade in the U.S. economy and the country's position in the global economy. The 2018 Trade Policy Agenda shifts from previous administrations by questioning the benefits of U.S. leadership in the global trading system and emphasizing concerns over potential limits on U.S. sovereignty. Political and economic factors influence the current trade policy environment. The current trade policy environment in the U.S. is influenced by political factors such as public opinion, perspectives of the President and Congress, and tensions between branches, as well as economic forces like global developments and trade barriers. Policymakers are facing decisions on these issues. U.S. policymakers are at a crossroads regarding trade policy. Congress may consider the benefits of international trade and the promotion of greater economic integration. Trade liberalization could lead to more efficient resource allocation and economic growth. The debate over international trade policy in the U.S. centers on the balance between benefits and costs. Policymakers are considering whether to continue adhering to trade rules or to reevaluate and potentially renegotiate agreements. Critics argue that the impact of trade agreements on economic trends is difficult to determine. The debate over international trade policy in the U.S. centers on the balance between benefits and costs. Critics argue that it is difficult to determine the impact of trade negotiations on economic trends. Policymakers may want to address inequities in trade policy by requiring fair trading practices in agreements. Trade agreements could help \"level the playing field\" and rebuild a consensus on trade. However, some trading partners resist U.S. values in trade policy. Congress faces issues like the future of the global trading system, the impact of changing U.S. trade dynamics, taking advantage of growing markets, and improving trade data quality. The U.S. government compiles trade data in four different ways, including Census basis, balance of payments basis, and national income and product accounts. Data can be adjusted for inflation to analyze trade volumes. Valuation methods are crucial in trade data evaluation, with the Census Bureau reporting imports on a c.i.f. basis. This includes insurance, shipping, and other charges. U.S. import data are reported on a customs basis, while other countries often include insurance and freight charges in their import figures, leading to potential overstatement of imports and understatement of trade surpluses. The classification system used, such as the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, is also important for industry or sector analysis. The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is crucial for assigning duty rates, with each digit adding specificity to the classification. Other classification systems like NAICS are useful for different types of analysis. Resources for international trade and economic statistics are available online. The monthly \"FT900,\" titled \"U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services,\" is a comprehensive statistical source issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis.
