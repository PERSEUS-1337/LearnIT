    "content": "Deep generative models like VAE and GAN are important in machine learning and computer vision. A new algorithm called Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) addresses issues in VAE and GAN by embedding an invertible network in the latent space. LIA uses a two-stage training scheme via adversarial learning. The training scheme for Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) involves adversarial learning, where the decoder is first trained as a standard GAN with an invertible network. The partial encoder is then learned from an autoencoder by detaching the invertible network from LIA. Experiments on face and LSUN datasets confirm LIA's effectiveness for inference and generation in various applications like high-quality image generation, text-to-speech transformation, information retrieval, 3D rendering, and signal-to-image acquisition. Generative models, including autoencoders and Variational AutoEncoders (VAE), are crucial in addressing challenges in computer vision and other disciplines. In comparing various generative models like Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), auto-regressive models, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and normalizing flows for data dimensionality reduction and reconstruction, the focus is on mapping data points from observable space to low-dimensional feature space. Manifold learning aims to find the mapping function under constraints, but the sparsity of data in high-dimensional space can lead to overfitting. Research on the opposite mapping from low-dimensional to high-dimensional space is also necessary. The text discusses the role of the opposite mapping function g(\u00b7) in reconstructing data in the context of generative models like Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). It emphasizes the importance of establishing dual maps z = f(x) and x = g(z) for inference and generation processes within the VAE framework. In VAE, imprecise variational inference leads to blurry image generation and posterior collapse with sophisticated decoder models. GAN excels in photo-realistic generation but lacks an encoder for inference on real images. Previous attempts to combine VAE and GAN for improved generation have been made. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model combines the benefits of GANs and normalizing flows by using an invertible network to bridge the encoder and decoder of VAE. This symmetric design allows for exact fitting of the prior distribution and addresses issues with learning deep flows and computing Jacobian matrices. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model brings two key benefits: exact fitting of the prior distribution from an unfolded feature space, easing the inference problem, and deterministic training due to a two-stage adversarial learning approach. This approach decomposes the LIA framework into a Wasserstein GAN and a standard autoencoder, resulting in superior performance on inference and generation compared to state-of-the-art generative models. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model utilizes a neural architecture that unrolls data distribution from complex to simple prior. It is based on VAE and normalizing flow, incorporating an invertible neural network in the latent space. The framework includes a decoder, feature extractor, and discriminator for reconstruction and distinguishing real/fake distributions. LIA performs nonlinear dimensionality reduction on input data for low-dimensional feature transformation. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model utilizes a neural architecture for nonlinear dimensionality reduction on input data x to transform them into a low-dimensional feature space R dy. The feature y is then mapped to the latent variable z via an invertible mapping \u03c6(y), allowing for exact recovery of y. A simple invertible network is found to be sufficient for constructing the mapping from R dy to the latent space R dz in the LIA framework. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model uses an invertible network to map features from Rdy to Rdz. The network is built with an arbitrary differentiable function \u03c4 and can also utilize affine coupling mappings for more complex tasks. To ensure accurate reconstruction, a multi-layer perceptron with leaky ReLU activation is used. Instead of traditional methods like distance or cross entropy, a perceptual loss is employed for robustness to image variations. The functionality of the feature extractor is to produce representations of input and output data, which can be acquired through supervised or unsupervised learning. Norm-based reconstruction constraints in autoencoder architectures can lead to blurry image generation, which can be addressed using adversarial learning with a discriminator. The optimization objective can be formulated using Wasserstein GAN to balance the loss between real and generated data distributions. The regularization of coupling the prior and the posterior is the KL divergence used to optimize the encoder parameters by backpropagation. However, an end-to-end learning strategy does not lead to satisfactory convergence. A two-stage stochasticity-free training scheme is proposed to decompose the framework for better training. The framework is decomposed into two parts for better training. The first step involves training the decoder using adversarial learning with an invertible network. In the second step, the invertible network is detached, reducing the framework to a standard autoencoder. This design prevents posterior collapse and facilitates high-resolution image generation.GAN models like ProGAN, StyleGAN, and BigGAN can generate photo-realistic images from random noise. The GAN models can recover precise images by finding the latent variable z for a given x. Training involves using an invertible network in the LIA framework. The optimization objective follows the principle of Wasserstein GAN. The invertible network's role is transformation invertibility without constraints on probabilities. This strategy can be applied to any GAN model, embedding the invertible network symmetrically in the latent space in the LIA architecture. The invertible network is embedded in the latent space symmetrically, allowing detachment from the LIA framework to create a conventional autoencoder. The feature extractor in perceptual loss is the VGG weight up to conv4 pretrained on ImageNet. The two-stage training architecture is widely used in computer vision and GANs for image processing tasks. The LIA model simplifies training by only requiring learning of the partial encoder f, leading to more precise inference. The LIA model simplifies training by focusing on precise inference for VAEs and GANs, addressing challenges with end-to-end training and unstable gradients in deep architectures. Integrating GAN with VAE has roots in previous works like VAE/GAN and implicit autoencoders. Training VAE in an adversarial manner has also been explored, highlighting the trade-off between encoder roles. The preference is for a complete GAN with a discriminator for better performance. The LIA model simplifies training by focusing on precise inference for VAEs and GANs, addressing challenges with end-to-end training and unstable gradients in deep architectures. It prefers a complete GAN with an indispensable discriminator. Related works include models combining VAE and inverse autoregressive flow, as well as latent-flow-based VAE approaches. These models optimize the posterior probability of normalizing flows, which differs from the deterministic optimization in LIA. Stochasticity-free training is achieved through the symmetric design of the invertible network in the latent space, distinguishing it from other approaches. Alternative attempts involve specifying the generator of GAN with normalizing flow or mapping images into feature space with partially invertible networks. These approaches face high complexity computation for high-dimensional data. The approach focuses on reconstructing real images from latent codes using a decoder from LIA and a generator from StyleGAN. The invertible network replaces the mapping network in StyleGAN, with 8 layers. Hyperparameters for the discriminator are set at \u03b3 = 10 and \u03b2 = 0.001. Perceptual loss is calculated using conv4_3 from VGG weights. The study compares generative models including MSE-based optimization methods, ALI, and AGE network. An encoder and StyleGAN with original MLP are trained. Evaluation metrics include FID, SWD, and MSE. The code released is directly used for the experiments. The study evaluates generative models using different optimization methods and networks. Evaluation metrics include FID, SWD, and MSE. The code from ProGAN is used for experiments on manipulating reconstructed faces from latent codes. The models are tested on the FFHQ database with 70,000 high-quality face images. The study evaluates generative models using different optimization methods and networks, testing on the FFHQ database with 70,000 high-quality face images. Results show that LIA significantly outperforms others in reconstructing images of objects and scenes from the LSUN database. ALI and AGE produce correct but mediocre quality images, with potential for improvement using new techniques. MSE-based optimization produces comparable quality facial parts with LIA for normal faces, but fails with large variations like long hair, hats, beard, and large poses. The StyleGAN with encoder struggles to recover target faces like LIA, which excels in reconstructing images from the LSUN database. LIA enables semantic photo editing and produces superior results compared to other methods. Additional manipulation and mixing results are available for reference. The reconstructed objects by LIA faithfully maintain the semantics and appearance of the original images, showing detailed information recovery such as cats' whiskers. LIA significantly improves reconstruction quality through two-stage training, with the decoder trained using adversarial learning. The decoder in LIA is trained with adversarial learning to ensure photo-realistic generated images. The encoder, trained with perceptual and adversarial losses, provides more precise latent feature vectors. This two-stage training is facilitated by detaching the encoder and decoder in the invertible network. Gradient volatility is high in variational inference, leading to noisy and uninformative gradients during training. In contrast, LIA's encoder gradients are stable across layers, resulting in a monotonically decreasing loss. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model utilizes an invertible network in an autoencoder for image generation and accurate latent code inference. The invertible network removes probability optimization and connects the prior with feature vectors. LIA's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on FFHQ and LSUN datasets, showcasing its ability for reconstruction and high-resolution image generation. The Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA) model struggles to faithfully recover all image content, especially unusual parts like a hand on a little girl or a Bombay cat's necklace. One possible solution is to increase the dimension of latent variables or use an attention mechanism in the decoder. Comparing interpolation in the latent feature space can help visualize the generative model's capabilities and how well it fits the data distribution. Comparing interpolation results of three generative models: LIA achieves smoother results preserving facial properties, MSE-based optimization relies on StyleGAN for reconstruction quality, while Glow deviates from real faces. Style mixing with reconstructed faces shows LIA's accurate latent code inference capability. Our algorithm accurately infers latent codes and generates high-quality mixed faces through optimization of MSE loss with respect to latent code z and feature w. The disentanglement effect of w is evident, while z suffers from feature entanglement."
