    "content": "NO INCREASE IN PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. The section is titled \"The No Pay Raise for Congress Until the Budget is Balanced Act\" and highlights findings related to the United States national debt exceeding $12.6 trillion, with projected deficits of $1.3 trillion for fiscal year 2010. Each American's share of the debt is over $41,000, and the debt increases by $4 billion daily. Foreign investors hold 48% of the US debt. Foreign investors held 48 percent of the United States' public debt at the end of 2009, including $776.4 billion owed to Communist China. The Federal budget deficit is now seen as the most critical issue, with Congress passing 4 major extension bills costing taxpayers nearly $30 billion. A survey showed that 83% of Americans believe the deficit is due to politicians' unwillingness to cut spending, and only 11% think the Government spends money wisely. More than twice as many US adults view debt owed to China as a greater threat to national security than terrorism from radical Islamic terrorists. Congress is urged to prioritize balancing the Federal budget to protect national security and financial stability due to the failure to cut wasteful spending. The text emphasizes the importance of reducing the national debt limit to enforce fiscal responsibility in Congress. It also suggests that the pay for members of Congress should not be increased until the Federal budget is balanced and calls for responsible legislation to avoid adding to the deficit. Additionally, it includes restrictions on cost of living adjustments for Members of Congress. The text restricts cost of living adjustments for Members of Congress until the Federal budget deficit reaches $0, as determined in an annual report submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on any determination regarding cost of living adjustments for Members of Congress and whether the restriction on adjustments will apply to the next fiscal year. SEC. 2. REPEAL OF INCREASE OF THE OFFICE BUDGETS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. $100,000,000 in unobligated balances from funds for the legislative branch are rescinded. Funding cannot be used for pilot programs for mailings of postal patron postcards by Senators. SEC. 3. RESCISSION OF UNSPENT AND UNCOMMITTED FEDERAL FUNDS. SEC. 3. RESCISSION OF UNSPENT AND UNCOMMITTED FEDERAL FUNDS. $9.2 billion in unobligated discretionary federal funds are rescinded.
