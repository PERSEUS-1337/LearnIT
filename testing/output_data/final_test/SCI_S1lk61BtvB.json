    "content": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have strengths and weaknesses in generative modeling tasks. Hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks have been proposed to address mode collapse and sample quality issues, but face challenges with the trade-off between data log-likelihood and divergence to the latent prior. A novel objective with a \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" reconstruction cost and stable synthetic likelihood estimation is proposed to improve performance. The VAE-GAN framework aims to balance high data log-likelihood and low divergence to the latent prior, outperforming hybrid VAE-GANs and plain GANs in mode coverage and sample quality. GANs excel in generating high-quality samples but may miss entire modes of the data distribution, known as the mode collapse problem. In contrast, VAEs explicitly maximize data likelihood and can cover all modes. VAEs maximize data likelihood and cover all modes, but may result in lower sample quality due to reconstruction cost. Recent work integrates GANs into VAE frameworks to improve generation quality and mode coverage. Hybrid VAE-GANs struggle to match the Gaussian prior in the latent space. In hybrid VAE-GANs, the latent space often does not align with the Gaussian prior, leading to issues with reconstruction log-likelihood and divergence. The addition of synthetic likelihood in the objective further complicates matters, affecting sample quality and diversity. Estimating the ratio using a network with a controlled Lipschitz constant improves stability during training. Our contributions include proposing a novel objective for training hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks, relaxing constraints on the encoder for generating realistic images across all data distribution modes. The objective estimates the synthetic likelihood term with a controlled Lipschitz constant for stability and shows improvement on multi-modal synthetic data, CIFAR-10, and CelebA. Generative Autoencoders like VAEs maintain a Gaussian latent space, while AAE and WAE address issues with the latent space alignment. In this work, a novel objective is proposed for training hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks to maintain both the latent representation constraint and high data log-likelihood. A GAN-based synthetic likelihood term is integrated to enhance the sharpness of generated images and address mode collapse issues in classical GANs. MDGAN, EBGAN, BEGAN, InfoGAN, PacGAN, and D2GAN are different GAN models with unique approaches to training and improving the performance of generative models. Each model introduces novel techniques such as using multiple discriminators, energy functionals, Wasserstein distance objectives, maximizing mutual information, dealing with mode collapse, and utilizing two discriminators for divergence calculations. These methods aim to enhance the training process and the quality of generated images in GAN frameworks. In BourGAN, the latent space distribution is learned to reflect the data distribution. Ravuri et al. propose a moment matching paradigm different from VAEs or GANs. Hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks can benefit from these techniques to improve results. Gulrajani et al. suggest Wasserstein Loss based formulations in GANs. In Wasserstein Loss based GAN formulations, various techniques such as Spectral Normalization, distance constraints, and extension to Banach Spaces have been proposed to improve performance. Regularization techniques developed for WGANs are used to enhance stability in hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks. Additionally, focus has been on progressively learning complex model architectures for better results. High-quality class conditional generations have been achieved at high resolutions, with diverse class conditional generation being easier due to lower intra-class variability. In the context of improving performance in hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks, various approaches have been proposed such as discriminator feature matching, matching encoder and decoder joint distributions, and using synthetic likelihoods in place of loglikelihood terms. These techniques aim to enhance the effectiveness of unconditional image generation tasks. Hybrid VAE-GANs combine VAEs and GANs to generate high-quality samples while covering all modes of the distribution. This improvement includes allowing the encoder multiple chances to draw desired samples and enforcing stability to maintain low divergence to the prior while generating realistic images. Our novel \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" objective combines VAEs and GANs to generate high-quality samples covering all modes of the data distribution. The approach maximizes log-likelihood similar to VAEs, ensuring the generator covers all modes of the data distribution. The hybrid VAE-GAN objective of the state-of-the-art \u03b1-GAN integrates a synthetic likelihood ratio term, but it severely constrains the recognition network by forcing all samples to explain x equally well, penalizing variance in the latent space. This makes it difficult to match the Gaussian prior in the latent space. The BMS-VAE-GAN framework addresses the trade-off between data log-likelihood and latent divergence. It leverages multiple samples from q\u03c6(z|x) and introduces a stable synthetic likelihood term to handle classifier output instability. The BMS-VAE-GAN framework introduces a novel objective that considers only the best sample from the generator G \u03b8 for computing the reconstruction loss. It relaxes constraints on the recognition network by using multiple samples, allowing for higher variance in q \u03c6 (z|x) to better match the prior and reduce the trade-off with data log-likelihood. Additionally, a synthetic likelihood term is integrated to generate sharper images. Integrating a synthetic likelihood term with weight \u03b2 in the generator encourages the generation of realistic samples, addressing the issue of blurry samples in complex high dimensional distributions like image data. The synthetic likelihood estimator D I distinguishes between real and generated samples, assigning low likelihood to generated samples and higher likelihood to real data samples. This approach complements the L 1 /L 2 reconstruction likelihood (with weight \u03b1) to ensure coverage of all modes. Unlike previous work, this method aims to generate sharper images by leveraging synthetic estimates of the likelihood. Our synthetic likelihood estimator D I converts the likelihood term to a ratio form for synthetic estimates, using an auxiliary variable y to distinguish between generated and real samples. The ratio p \u03b8 (y=1|z,x) /1\u2212p(y=1|x) should be high for indistinguishable samples. Direct estimation of this ratio exacerbates instabilities, so we use a neural network D I to estimate it for images. The network D I is trained to produce high values for images that are indistinguishable from real images. To ensure smoothness, the Lipschitz constant K of D I is directly controlled. This constraint allows the generator to smoothly improve sample quality. The Lipschitz constant is constrained to 1 using Spectral Normalization. Stochastic gradient descent is used to deal with the numerically unstable likelihood function. The sharpness of generated images can be improved by penalizing the generator using the least realistic sample from multiple samples. The \"Best-of-Many\"-VAE-GAN objective penalizes the generator using the least realistic sample from multiple samples. The log likelihood term is dominated by the Best of T samples as generated samples become more diverse. The KL-divergence term is recast in a synthetic likelihood ratio form to avoid degradation in image quality. The KL-divergence term is reformulated in a synthetic likelihood ratio form to improve image quality. A classifier-based estimate is used to calculate the KL-divergence to the prior, addressing issues of mismatch. The benefits of using the \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" approach are demonstrated, especially when employing a classifier-based estimate. Experiments are conducted on multi-modal synthetic data, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets using a single Nvidia V100 GPU with 16GB memory. The BMS-VAE-GAN approach aims to minimize computational overhead by using the best of T=10 samples. It addresses the mismatch to the prior in the latent space and improves data sample quality on challenging datasets. The generator/discriminator architecture is consistent with previous work by Srivastava et al. (2017). Our BMS-VAE-GAN, utilizing the best of T=10 samples, surpasses state-of-the-art GANs and baseline models like WAE and \u03b1-GAN. The explicit maximization of data log-likelihood allows capturing all modes in datasets. The \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" objective leads to a higher proportion of high-quality samples compared to WAE and \u03b1-GAN. Analysis of latent spaces reveals points likely under the Gaussian prior but with low probability under the marginal posterior. Our \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" objective helps match the prior in the latent space, generating high-quality samples that outperform state-of-the-art GANs and hybrid VAE-GAN baselines. Auto-encoding approaches struggle with the highly multi-modal CIFAR-10 dataset due to the limitations of a simple Gaussian reconstruction likelihood. The CIFAR-10 dataset poses a challenge for hybrid VAE-GANs due to its highly multi-modal nature. Two different architectures are used for the generator/discriminator pair: DCGAN based and Standard CNN. Experimental details include the use of the ADAM optimizer with specific learning rates and baselines for comparison with BMS-VAE-GAN. The curr_chunk discusses various GAN architectures such as SN-GAN, BW-GAN, Dist-GAN, and \u03b1-GAN + SN, along with their FID scores on CIFAR-10 dataset. The \u03b1-GAN + SN is highlighted as an improved version with Spectral Normalization for stable estimation of synthetic likelihoods. The FID scores show the performance of different architectures, with \u03b1-GAN + SN achieving a score of 24.6. The FID scores of different GAN architectures on CIFAR-10 dataset are compared, with \u03b1-GAN (Rosca et al., 2019) showing better fit than plain DCGAN. The \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" optimization scheme outperforms both DCGAN and \u03b1-GAN, while BMS-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art WAE. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model outperforms state-of-the-art GANs, including \u03b1-GAN + SN and Tran et al., showing effectiveness in generating high-quality samples and better reconstructing image distribution. Our novel \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" objective improves sample quality and data reconstruction in image distribution. Evaluations on CelebA at resolutions 64\u00d764 and 128\u00d7128 show the effectiveness of our BMS-GAN compared to baselines like WAE and \u03b1-GAN. Training uses simple DCGAN based generators and discriminators for generation. Our \u03b1-GAN + SN is an improved version of the \u03b1-GAN with Spectral Normalization for stable estimation of synthetic likelihoods. Various GAN baselines were included in the study such as WGAN-GP, SN-GAN, and Dist-GAN. Training of BMS-VAE-GAN and \u03b1R-GAN models utilized the two time-scale update rule with specific learning rates for the generator and discriminator. The study compares different GAN models on CelebA dataset, with FID scores reported after training for 200k iterations. The BMS-VAE-GAN model outperforms others with FID scores of 14.3, 13.6, and 42.7 for T=10, T=30, and resolution 128x128 respectively. The pure autoencoding BMS-VAE shows improvement over WAE in terms of FID scores.

Additionally, the \u03b1-GAN + SN regularized with Spectral Normalization performs significantly better than the baseline, showing the effectiveness of a regularized direct estimate of the synthetic likelihood. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model surpasses \u03b1-GAN + SN baseline with a FID score drop to 13.6. By utilizing \"Best-of-Many-Samples,\" we achieve sharper results covering more data distribution. Our hybrid VAE-GAN framework outperforms state-of-the-art models on CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in generative modeling. Our approach in generative modeling on CelebA and CIFAR-10 involves maximizing log-likelihood of data with a Gaussian latent space distribution. VAEs and Hybrid VAEGANs use amortized variational inference with a jointly learned variational distribution. To address intractability, we apply the Mean Value theorem of Integration to leverage multiple samples and approximate difficult terms using KL divergence. To estimate the right distribution, the KL divergence is used, heavily penalizing high values for low p(z). This maximizes the ratio p(z) / q(z|x). The \"many-sample\" objective is derived, introducing an auxiliary variable y for likelihood ratio estimation. Hinge loss is used to update D I for real images, while D L is updated with cross-entropy loss. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model is trained using algorithm 1, updating components R \u03c6, G \u03b8, D I, and D L. Unlike previous methods, we train R \u03c6 and G \u03b8 jointly for computational efficiency. We use hinge loss to update D I for improved stability. Evaluation on CelebA shows better sample quality compared to DCGAN, although the improvement is smaller due to CelebA being less multi-modal than CIFAR-10. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model enables a better match to the prior in the latent space compared to other GANs. Additional examples of closest matches are provided, showing regions captured by BMS-VAE-GAN but not by other models. Comparison with state-of-the-art GANs in Figure 4 reveals that BEGAN produces sharp images but lacks diversity. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model generates sharp and diverse images with minimal artifacts, outperforming other GANs such as SN-GAN and Dist-GAN. The FID scores in Table 2 demonstrate this balance, with additional qualitative examples in Figure 5 showcasing sharper images compared to \u03b1-GAN +SN. The LPIPS diversity score in Table 9 further supports the superior performance of our BMS-VAE-GAN in generating high-quality images. Our BMS-VAE-GAN model generates diverse examples, showcasing the effectiveness of the \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" objective. Evaluation using the LPIPS metric is presented in Table 9."
