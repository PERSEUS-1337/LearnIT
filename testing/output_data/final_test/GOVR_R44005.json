    "content": "A question of privilege in the House is a formal declaration by a Member asserting a situation affecting the House's rights, safety, dignity, and proceedings. The Member submits a resolution detailing the situation and urging action. This privilege takes precedence over all questions except a motion to adjourn. House Speaker Thomas Reed emphasized the sacredness of Members' rights and privileges, stating that the House's highest duty is to conserve them intact, even in dubious circumstances. A question of privilege in the House is a formal declaration by a Member asserting a situation affecting the House's rights, safety, dignity, and proceedings. The Speaker must rule on its validity with guidance from the House Parliamentarian. Information is provided on restrictions governing when a question can be raised and considered on the House floor. The report provides guidance on valid questions in the House, including scripts of parliamentary language and examples of valid and not valid questions. It also includes data on questions raised in the past two decades, such as the number of valid questions per Congress and how they were disposed of. House Rule IX requires Members to give notice before raising a question of privileges. The Speaker can rule on the validity of the question, which may interrupt the daily business flow. The report provides guidance on valid questions in the House and includes data on questions raised in the past two decades. The House Rule IX mandates Members to give notice before raising a question of privileges. The Speaker can make an immediate ruling on the validity of the question, which may interrupt the daily business flow. The question is privileged for immediate floor consideration under certain circumstances, such as resolutions reported from committee or offered by the majority/minority leader. However, restrictions govern when a question can be raised on the floor, such as not interrupting a roll call or yea-or-nay vote. A question of privilege may not interrupt a roll call or yea-or-nay vote, and a Member may not rise to a question of privileges during a call of the House in the absence of a quorum unless it relates to the immediate proceedings. If the Speaker rules that the question does not qualify as a valid question of the privileges of the House, the House may move to different business. Any Member who disagrees with the ruling may appeal, allowing the House to decide if the decision of the Speaker will stand as the judgment of the House. A Member can introduce a different resolution if a question is ruled not valid. They can also use other means to communicate concerns, like special order speeches. Once a question is ruled valid, the House can take action on it. Debate on a question of privilege is limited to one hour. During debate on a resolution, time is divided between the proponent and designated leaders. Members can offer amendments under specific conditions. A non-debatable motion called \"previous question\" can be used to end debate. If defeated, another hour of debate and amendments are allowed. During debate on a resolution, a motion to table can be made to prevent further consideration or a vote. The resolution may be rephrased and presented again on another day. Alternatively, the House may choose to refer the resolution to a committee for further work or consideration. A motion to postpone consideration of a resolution is uncommon for questions of the privileges of the House in the modern Congress. If agreed to, it suspends consideration of the measure either indefinitely or until a specific time. A sponsor may also choose to withdraw a resolution after it has been offered, even after debate has occurred. House rules require decorum during debate, with remarks confined to the question under debate. The Speaker prohibits references to the conduct of other Members and indecent language. Exceptions may be made for questions of House privileges, but are closely limited. The Speaker enforces rules prohibiting abusive language, profanity, and breaches of decorum during debates on House resolutions. References to the conduct of other Members are not allowed unless related to pending questions of House privileges. Debates on House privileges can sometimes become contentious, as seen in a recent debate on a committee chairman's actions. In a debate on House privileges, a committee chairman's actions led to a request for Capitol Police to remove minority-party committee Members. A Member objected to remarks violating decorum rules, leading to a demand for the remarks to be withdrawn. In another instance, a Member condemned a committee chairman's behavior during a hearing, causing a disruption with Members displaying pictures of the chairman. The presiding officer had to suspend consideration multiple times to restore decorum. House precedent prohibits Members from staging exhibitions and recognizes questions related to honor and security. The principle dates back to 1795 but was officially articulated in House rules in 1880 to restrict the process of considering such questions. The rule was adopted to prevent time-consuming speeches under the pretext of privilege. House Rule IX states that valid questions of the privileges of the House must affect the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings. House precedent guides the Speaker in determining what constitutes a valid question, with examples provided for clarity. Consult the Office of the Parliamentarian for specific guidance. The resolution must clearly show the matter at hand for it to be considered valid. The resolution presented must demonstrate an invasion of House rights, based on actual events, not potential ones. Categories of questions not considered valid include those related to House organization and Members' rights. Valid questions include matters like investigating a Member's election or declaring a vacancy in the House. Questions related to the privileges of the House often involve issues such as incapacitating illness preventing a Member-elect from taking office, election contests, removal of a committee chairman pending investigation, and constitutional powers like impeachment and expulsion. The Ways and Means Committee typically raises questions regarding the Origination Clause and the Senate's infringement on the House's privilege to originate revenue bills. The House's constitutional power or duty does not automatically make any related matter a question of the House's privileges. For example, a 1996 case where a question of the House's privileges was raised to pass an adjustment to the public debt limit was deemed invalid. The presiding officer emphasized that just because the Constitution mandates something, it doesn't mean any Member can insist on bringing it up at a specific time or in a specific way of their choosing. The House should enforce constitutional mandates through its rules, but ultimately, it is up to the House to decide. The House decides how and when to enforce rules, including matters related to the conduct of Members, officers, and employees. Valid questions have included removing officers for misconduct, investigating Member misconduct, and releasing information from Ethics Committee investigations. Privileges of the House encompass issues concerning the legislative process integrity. Questions related to the integrity of the legislative process in the House have included alleged improprieties in committee procedures, such as the use of a forged document and unilateral release of committee records. Valid questions have condemned actions like adjourning a hearing before allowing the ranking Member to speak. However, not all committee actions deemed objectionable are considered valid questions of privilege. Improprieties on the House floor have also been addressed, including issues with the presence of certain individuals. Questions related to improprieties on the House floor have addressed the presence of unauthorized persons, conduct in the press gallery, integrity of electronic votes, accuracy of House documents, entries in the Journal and Congressional Record, and comfort and conveniences of Members. Resolutions for corrections in the Congressional Record have been considered valid, while allegations of factual inaccuracy in speeches recorded in the Congressional Record have not been recognized as valid questions. Comfort and convenience matters, such as the construction of an elevator for the House, have also constituted valid questions of the privileges of the House. Matters related to Members' safety, including physical and cybersecurity concerns, have been considered valid questions in the House. Resolutions addressing structural deficiencies, fire safety issues, and electronic security breaches have been recognized as valid, while others such as additional laborers in the bathroom or a new House restaurant have not been deemed valid questions. A motion to amend the House rules does not constitute a question of privilege. Resolutions altering House rules or prescribing special orders of business are not considered valid questions of the House's privileges. This was exemplified in a ruling where a resolution prescribing House consideration of specific legislation was deemed invalid as it could lead to individual Members acting as a virtual Rules Committee. In a ruling, it was stated that a resolution alleging failure of the House to take legislative actions does not constitute a question of privilege. This could lead to individual Members acting as a virtual Rules Committee, where anything could be privileged, and nothing would enjoy true privilege. The presiding officer clarified that a resolution expressing legislative sentiment does not constitute a question of privilege as it does not affect the rights or integrity of the House. Giving privilege to such resolutions would allow any Member to bring up any topic at any time. During the 104th to 113th Congress (1995-2014), Members raised 140 questions of privilege in the House. Majority Members had 69% of their questions agreed to, while the minority party offered 72% of valid questions. The proportion of questions offered by the minority remained consistent.

According to Rule IX, a resolution raised as a question of privilege by a Member has immediate precedence within two legislative days. The chair will designate a time for consideration of the resolution, and the determination of whether it constitutes a question of privilege will be made then. When a resolution is offered as a question of privilege by a Member, parliamentary language is used to present it. The Member rises and states the question, followed by the Clerk reading the resolution. The Member then presents arguments on whether it constitutes a question of privilege, with the Speaker recognizing them for that purpose. The Member rises to present a resolution as a question of privilege, followed by the Clerk reading the resolution. The Speaker then determines if the resolution qualifies as a question of privilege."
