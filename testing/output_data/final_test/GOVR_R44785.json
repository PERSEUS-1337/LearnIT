    "content": "The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established by ACA Section 4002 with a permanent annual appropriation. The PPHF's annual appropriation increased from $500 million for FY2010 to $2 billion for FY2015 and subsequent years. Congress has directed the distribution of PPHF funds for specific fiscal years. Amendments have been made to use PPHF funds as offsets for other activities. Annual appropriations to the PPHF in current law vary from $500 million to $1.5 billion for different fiscal years. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established by ACA Section 4002 with varying annual appropriations, ranging from $500 million to $2 billion. Section 101 of the ACA would repeal PPHF appropriations for FY2019 and beyond, rescinding any unobligated balance from FY2018. The Community Health Center Fund, created by ACA Section 10503, provided mandatory appropriations of $3.6 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2017. This fund replaced discretionary appropriations for the health center program. The Community Health Center Fund has been a significant source of funding for health centers, making up a large percentage of their appropriations. In FY2018, the fund will not receive a mandatory appropriation, but Section 102 proposes an additional $422 million for FY2017. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America relies heavily on government funding, with federal funds accounting for about one-third of its total revenue in 2013. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) receives federal grants and reimbursements for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries, with federal Medicaid revenue estimated at approximately $390 million in 2013. PPFA does not receive a direct annual appropriation but relies on reimbursements for covered services. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) receives federal funds through various programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, Social Service Block Grant, Crime Victims Assistance Program, and SNAP. Additionally, PPFA also receives discretionary funds from programs like Maternal and Child Health Block Grants. Under federal law, federal funds are generally not available to pay for abortions, except in specific cases. The Hyde amendment, in place since 1976, restricts the use of federal funds for abortions. Section 103 of the AHCA would prohibit federal funds from being provided to certain entities for a one-year period. Section 103 of the AHCA would prohibit federal funds from being provided to certain entities, including Planned Parenthood, for a one-year period. The provision specifies criteria for entities that would be prohibited from receiving federal funds. Planned Parenthood is an abortion provider that received over $350 million in Medicaid expenditures in FY2014. CBO identified it as the likely entity affected by a bill prohibiting federal funds. Qualified entities could enroll certain groups in Medicaid before completed applications were processed. The ACA expanded the types of entities that could determine presumptive eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries based on their eligibility category. Providers of clinic and outpatient hospital services could determine eligibility for pregnant women, while agencies serving low-income children could determine eligibility for children. Individuals deemed presumptively eligible had to formally apply for coverage within a specified time frame to continue receiving benefits. The ACA expanded Medicaid presumptive-eligibility determinations for various groups, allowing hospitals to make determinations for all Medicaid eligibility groups starting in 2014. States can also provide a presumptive-eligibility period for specific groups such as the ACA Medicaid expansion group and low-income families eligible under Section 1931 of the Social Security Act. The provision would terminate hospitals' ability to make presumptive-eligibility determinations for certain Medicaid groups effective January 1, 2020, by modifying relevant sections of the Social Security Act. It would also end the authority of specified states to elect to make such determinations for the ACA Medicaid expansion group or individuals with income exceeding 133% of the federal poverty level. Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by federal and state law, with states setting criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet categorical and financial criteria, as well as residency, immigration status, and citizenship requirements. Some groups are mandatory for coverage, while others are optional, with states able to apply for waivers to expand health coverage. The ACA changed Medicaid income eligibility levels for poverty-related children aged 6 through 18 from 100% to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) in 2014. States transitioning these children from CHIP to Medicaid continue to be financed with states' CHIP annual allotment funding at a higher federal matching rate. A proposed amendment would repeal the provision covering children up to 133% of FPL effective December 31, 2019. The ACA changed Medicaid income eligibility levels for poverty-related children aged 6 through 18 from 100% to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) in 2014. States would still be required to cover children with household incomes of up to 100% of FPL after December 31, 2019. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states through the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, which varies by state. The ACA Section 2401 established the Community First Choice option under SSA Section 1915(k), allowing states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as an optional Medicaid state plan benefit. The Community First Choice option under the ACA allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports as a Medicaid state plan benefit. Eight states have received approval for this option as of January 2017. The increased FMAP rate for the Community First Choice option would be repealed on January 1, 2020. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law, with states setting criteria within federal standards. Individuals must meet categorical and financial criteria, as well as residency, immigration status, and citizenship requirements. Some eligibility groups are mandatory, while others are optional. States can apply for waivers to expand coverage. The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new minimum Medicaid eligibility. The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income-eligibility level for most non-elderly adults beginning January 1, 2014. The U.S. Supreme Court made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states. As of January 1, 2014, 24 states and the District of Columbia implemented the expansion, with seven more states following suit. Section 112(a)(1)(A)(i) and (iii) would make the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states after December 31, 2019. The ACA established 133% of FPL as the new mandatory minimum Medicaid income-eligibility level for most non-elderly adults beginning January 1, 2014. Section 112(a)(1)(A)(ii) would repeal the state option to extend coverage to non-elderly individuals above 133% of FPL by specifying an end date of December 31, 2017. The provision in Section 112(a)(1)(B) of the ACA defines expansion enrollees for Medicaid eligibility and grandfathered expansion enrollees as those enrolled in Medicaid before December 31, 2019, without a break in eligibility. These definitions also apply to existing Medicaid provisions referencing the ACA expansion group. The ACA Medicaid expansion provides a federal matching rate for newly eligible individuals, starting at 100% in CY2014 and phasing down to 90% in CY2020 and subsequent years. Section 112(a)(2)(A) maintains the matching rate for states that covered newly eligible individuals before January 1, 2020, but after December 31, 2019, the rate only applies to expenditures for newly eligible individuals. The ACA added a federal matching rate for newly eligible individuals in Medicaid, starting at 100% in CY2014 and decreasing to 90% in CY2020. The expansion state federal matching rate varies by state and is based on each state's regular FMAP rate and annual transition percentages. The formula for the expansion state matching rate includes transition percentages of 50% in CY2014, 60% in CY2015, 70% in CY2016, 80% in CY2017, 90% in CY2018, and 100% in CY2019 and beyond. The expansion state federal matching rate phases up until CY2019, matching the newly eligible federal matching rate for subsequent years. Section 112(a)(2)(B) proposes amending the formula to keep the matching rate constant after CY2017. After December 31, 2019, the rate applies only to eligible individuals enrolled in Medicaid by that date. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer alternative benefit plans (ABPs) to certain Medicaid enrollees, including those eligible through the ACA Medicaid expansion. States can choose to provide ABP coverage to other subgroups as well. The ACA required ABP packages to include the 10 essential health benefits, but after December 31, 2019, this requirement may no longer apply. Medicaid ABP coverage may no longer be required to include the EHB. SSA Section 1923 mandates Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income patients to address their financial challenges. DSH funding is capped, with each state receiving an annual allotment. The ACA reduced the number of uninsured individuals in the US through its health insurance coverage provisions. The ACA included provisions to reduce the number of uninsured individuals, leading to less need for Medicaid DSH payments. Current law includes aggregate reductions to Medicaid DSH allotments for FY2018 through FY2025, with amendments made by subsequent laws. Section 113 aims to eliminate these reductions after FY2019, impacting FY2018 and FY2019, with allotments calculated as if the reductions never occurred after FY2019. Allotments under the ACA Medicaid DSH program would include inflation adjustments for years with reductions, and non-expansion states would be exempt from allotment reductions. Expansion states are those offering ACA Medicaid expansion or coverage for incomes exceeding 133% of FPL. IRC Section 36B provides premium assistance tax credits based on household income for federal health programs. Medicaid uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility for federal health programs, including the ACA Medicaid expansion. MAGI is calculated by deducting 5% from each individual's AGI and comparing it to income standards set by the state. MAGI includes AGI plus certain types of income, such as tax-exempt interest and nontaxable portions of Social Security. Medicaid regulations use Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibility, which includes certain types of income like interest income and nontaxable Social Security benefits. Irregular lump sum income is counted only in the month received. Household income must be considered for eligibility, and all household members' income is included in the determination. Medicaid regulations distinguish between income eligibility for applicants and new enrollees. Section 114(a) would require states to consider \"qualified lottery winnings\" and/or \"qualified lump sum income\" received after January 1, 2020, when determining Medicaid eligibility based on MAGI for individuals, without counting it as household income. The provision establishes rules for prorating winnings and income for Medicaid eligibility based on MAGI, with a state option for hardship exemptions. The provision defines qualified lottery winnings and lump-sum income for Medicaid eligibility, with criteria for hardship exemptions and advance notice of eligibility loss. The bill specifies that states can recover lottery winnings to pay for Medicaid medical assistance. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law, with coverage effective retroactively for services provided in or after the third month before the month of application. The bill amends SSA Sections to limit retroactive coverage of Medicaid benefits to the month of application. DRA established limitations on home equity for Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid previously excluded the entire value of an applicant's home for LTSS purposes. The bill amends SSA Sections to limit retroactive coverage of Medicaid benefits to the month of application. DRA established limitations on home equity for Medicaid eligibility, excluding the entire value of an applicant's home for LTSS purposes. Medicaid bars eligibility if the applicant's equity interest in the home exceeds a statutorily determined limit, which is annually adjusted. The minimum home-equity limit in 2017 is $560,000, with the option for states to apply a higher limit up to $840,000 in specific geographic areas. States can exempt a home as a countable asset for individuals aged 21 or under SSI, blind, disabled, or lawfully residing in the home. Ten states have a higher home-equity limit than the minimum amount. Section 114(c) would repeal the authority for states to choose a higher home-equity limit. This change would apply to Medicaid eligibility determinations made more than 180 days after enactment. On January 1, 2014, the ACA Medicaid expansion took effect in 24 states and the District of Columbia. Seven additional states implemented the expansion at different times. States set their own payment rates for Medicaid providers, which must align with federal requirements for efficiency and quality of care. Section 115 of the ACA establishes safety-net funding for non-expansion states to adjust payment amounts for Medicaid providers. This funding is available for states that have not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion and aims to increase matching rates for Medicaid providers in those states. Non-expansion states would receive increased matching rates of 100% for FY2018 through FY2021 and 95% for FY2022, with a maximum safety-net funding of $2.0 billion per year. Allotments would be based on the number of individuals below 138% of FPL in each state. Payment adjustments to providers cannot exceed their costs for providing healthcare services to Medicaid enrollees or the uninsured, determined by the Secretary. The ACA Medicaid expansion requires states to determine income eligibility based on MAGI for most non-elderly populations. States must redetermine Medicaid eligibility annually, except when there are changes in a beneficiary's circumstances. Beginning October 1, 2017, Section 116(a) of the ACA would require states to redetermine Medicaid eligibility every six months for individuals eligible through the Medicaid expansion or state coverage option for those with income exceeding 133% of FPL. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with the FMAP rate varying by state based on per capita income levels. The federal government and states jointly finance Medicaid, with the FMAP rate varying by state based on per capita income levels. Section 116(b) increases the federal match for administrative activities related to Medicaid eligibility redeterminations from October 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019. Section 117(a) would modify SSA Section 1902 to permit states to impose work requirements as a condition of receiving benefits under Medicaid for most beneficiaries, effective October 1, 2017. The provision added in 1902(oo) allows states to require non-disabled, non-elderly, non-pregnant adults to meet work requirements for Medicaid assistance starting October 1, 2017. Work requirements include various activities like employment, job training, and community service. The work requirements for Medicaid assistance added in 1902(oo) include community service programs, vocational training, job skills training, education related to employment, and child-care services. Certain groups like pregnant women, individuals under 19, and sole parents are exempt from participation. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with the federal government's share determined by the FMAP rate. This rate varies by state and is designed to allocate more funding to states with lower incomes. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, populations, providers, and services. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program jointly financed by the federal government and states. Administrative activities receive a 50% federal matching rate, with a proposed increase of five percentage points for work requirement implementation. In FY2015, Medicaid provided healthcare services to 70 million individuals at a cost of $552 billion. Medicaid is a voluntary program where states design their own versions within federal guidelines. States incur costs by paying service providers and performing administrative tasks, with the federal government reimbursing a portion of expenses through the FMAP formula. The FMAP formula determines federal funding for Medicaid based on states' per capita incomes. States submit expenditure estimates to CMS for federal matching funds, which are reconciled with actual expenditures on Form CMS-64. Medicaid funding is an entitlement for states and individuals, with federal matching funds based on state spending. Proposed reforms would switch to a per capita cap model starting in FY2020, setting limits on federal payments to states. Each state's spending in FY2016 would be used as a base for targeted spending for each enrollee category in subsequent years. Starting in FY2020, Medicaid funding would increase annually based on inflation. States exceeding their targeted spending would face funding reductions the following year. New York's target amount could be reduced if certain local contributions are required. States could opt for block grant funding instead of per capita cap for certain categories, with fewer statutory requirements. States could choose this option for a 10-year period. Section 121(1) would reference the new SSA Section 1903A in the statute governing federal payments to states. In FY2020, a new SSA Section 1903A would apply a per capita cap on Medicaid payments to states. Excess medical assistance expenditures would result in reduced federal payments the following year. This would impact all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Adjusted total medical assistance expenditures exceeding target amounts under new SSA Section 1903A would lead to reduced federal payments based on the federal average medical assistance matching percentage. Adjusted total medical assistance expenditures under new SSA Section 1903A would have two formulas: one for FY2016 and another for FY2019 and subsequent years. Both formulas exclude certain payments and adjustments. The FY2016 formula is based on actual expenditures and population percentage, while the FY2019 formula is for future years. The FY2019 formula for adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for a state and fiscal year would be based on medical assistance payments reported on Form CMS-64, excluding certain payments. Expenditures would include non-DSH supplemental payments but not expenditures for the Vaccines for Children program. The new SSA Section 1903A outlines target total medical assistance expenditures for each enrollee category, calculated based on a formula for FY2020 and subsequent years. Target per capita medical assistance expenditures are determined by the provisional FY2019 amount increased by the annual inflation factor. The new SSA Section 1903A establishes target total medical assistance expenditures for each enrollee category, calculated using a formula for FY2020 and beyond. Target per capita medical assistance expenditures are based on the previous year's amount adjusted for inflation, with different inflation factors for various enrollee categories. Starting in FY2020, states may see a decrease in the target total medical assistance expenditures under certain conditions. The new SSA Section 1903A establishes target total medical assistance expenditures for each enrollee category, calculated using a formula for FY2020 and beyond. States may see a decrease in the target total medical assistance expenditures under certain conditions, such as states with a Medicaid DSH allotment in FY2016 more than six times the national average and requiring political subdivisions to contribute funds towards medical assistance. The HHS Secretary calculates provisional FY2019 per capita target amounts for each 1903A enrollee category based on state's average per capita medical assistance expenditures. The formula considers the number of enrollees and total medical assistance expenditures. States expanding coverage after FY2016 are treated differently. The FY2019 adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for each state are calculated based on the number of 1903A enrollees. This calculation excludes certain non-DSH supplemental expenditures and includes the non-DSH supplemental payment percentage for FY2016. The FY2019 average per capita amount is determined by adjusting the FY2016 average per capita medical assistance expenditures for the percentage increase in the medical care component of the CPI-U. Adjusted total medical assistance expenditures for each state in FY2019 are calculated based on the number of 1903A enrollees. 1903A enrollees are defined as Medicaid enrollees not covered under the block grant option and not falling into specific categories. The new SSA Section 1903A provides special payment rules for various categories of enrollees, including elderly, blind and disabled, children, expansion enrollees, and other non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults. The enrollment count is based on the average monthly amount reported through Form CMS-64. The new SSA Section 1903A introduces special payment rules for different enrollee categories, including elderly, blind, disabled, children, expansion enrollees, and non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults. It allows for recalculation of certain amounts for data errors without exceeding a 2% increase in total medical assistance expenditures. Additionally, it mandates reporting and auditing of CMS-64 data for ACA Medicaid expansion and transitional increase in federal matching percentage for certain administrative expenses. The new SSA Section 1903A introduces additional reporting requirements on states starting October 1, 2018, for medical assistance expenditures and enrollee categories. The HHS Secretary will determine specific reporting requirements and conduct audits on states' enrollment and expenditures. This section also provides a temporary increase in federal matching percentage for administrative activities. The temporary increase in federal matching percentage for administrative activities related to improving data reporting systems impacts expenditures from October 1, 2017, to October 1, 2019. States have the option to receive block grant funding instead of per capita cap funding for a portion of their Medicaid program starting in FY2020 for a 10-year period. Block grant funds can only be used for specified health care assistance coverage. The block grant option allows states to receive funding for specified health care assistance coverage instead of per capita cap funding for Medicaid. The block grant state plan must be approved by the HHS Secretary within 30 days, with some statutory requirements waived. The block grant state plan under Medicaid must adhere to reasonable standards for income and resources and ensure freedom of choice for enrollees to access services from any qualified provider. States can choose to cover children, non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults, or only non-elderly, nondisabled, non-expansion adults under the block grant. Pregnant women must be provided coverage under the block grant option. States must provide coverage to pregnant women and children under a block grant option in Medicaid, including those with income up to certain percentages of the Federal Poverty Level. The state can determine the coverage items and services under the block grant, with some exceptions. States can specify cost-sharing and delivery model for block grants in Medicaid, with coverage including hospital care, surgical care, medical treatment, prescribed drugs, and health care for children under 18. Block grant funding formula is based on target per capita medical assistance expenditures for different categories. The block grant funding formula for Medicaid includes target per capita medical assistance expenditures, number of enrollees, and federal average medical assistance percentage. Funds are adjusted annually based on CPI-U increase, with quarterly payments made using the enhanced FMAP rate. States are responsible for any additional funds needed. The state is responsible for grant expenditures under the block grant option, with audits required to ensure funds are used appropriately. ACA Section 1402 provides subsidies to reduce cost-sharing expenses for health insurance plans in the individual market. Section 131 would repeal ACA Section 1402, terminating cost-sharing subsidies for exchange plans starting in 2020. Congress has provided financial assistance for high-cost medical needs through various actions, including funding high-risk pools in 35 states before the ACA. The ACA authorized state grants for High-Risk Pools (HRPs) to provide coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. Additional appropriations were made by Congress for HRPs during multiple sessions. The ACA also established the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) to offer transitional coverage until 2014 when private insurance plans would be required to cover preexisting conditions. The ACA established the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) to provide transitional coverage until 2014 when private insurance plans would be prohibited from excluding preexisting conditions. Congress also created a transitional reinsurance program under the ACA to support high-risk enrollees in non-grandfathered individual market plans from 2014 to 2016. The program collected contributions from health insurance issuers and third-party administrators to make reinsurance payments for high-cost enrollees. The Patient and State Stability Fund, established under a new Title XXII to the SSA, provides funding to states from 2018 to 2026. States can use the fund for activities such as assisting high-risk individuals without employer-sponsored insurance to enroll in the individual market. The Patient and State Stability Fund provides funding to states from 2018 to 2026 for various purposes, including stabilizing premiums, reducing health insurance costs, promoting insurance issuer participation, and increasing insurance options in the individual and small-group markets. It also aims to promote access to preventive, dental, or vision services, maternity coverage, mental health and substance abuse disorder services, and early intervention for children and young adults with mental illness. The new title specifies the application process for states to receive payments from the Patient and State Stability Fund, including how payments will be used, required contributions, and allocation formulas for 2018 and 2019. States only need to apply once for subsequent years. The formula for allocations to states for 2018 and 2019 relies on medical claims, uninsured individuals below 100% of FPL, and issuers in the state's exchange. For 2020-2026, the CMS Administrator will develop a method for allocating Patient and State Stability Fund payments, considering medical claims, uninsured individuals, and issuers in the state's insurance market. Stakeholder consultation is required before establishing the allocation. The CMS Administrator will establish an allocation method for 2020-2026 to improve the health insurance risk pool, promote competition, and increase choice for health care consumers. If a state does not have an approved application for allowed activities, market stabilization payments will be made to issuers offering coverage in the individual and small-group markets. Payments will be made for claims exceeding $50,000 but not exceeding $350,000, with the payment percentage specified by the CMS Administrator for years 2020 through 2026. Unused funds will be reallocated. Section 2204 of the CMS Administrator's plan for 2020-2026 includes reallocation of unused funds to states and requires state contributions towards approved activities. Contributions start at 7% in 2020 and increase annually to 50% by 2026. Appropriations for the Patient and State Stability Fund are specified, with $15 billion each year for 2018 and 2019, and specific amounts for 2020-2026. The CMS Administrator's plan for 2020-2026 includes appropriations of $10 billion each year for allowed activities, with funds remaining available through December 31, 2027. Additional appropriations of $15 billion for maternity coverage and $8 billion for certain states are also specified. The new PHSA Section 2701(b)(1)(C) allows states to waive the continuous coverage penalty and use health status for premium development. $8 billion would be allocated to states with waivers, to assist individuals facing increased premiums. The CMS Administrator is prohibited from allocating funds to states using them for unauthorized purposes. Additionally, a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would be established within the Patient and State Stability Fund. The Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program in the Patient and State Stability Fund would provide payments to health insurance issuers to offset high-cost enrollees' medical claims costs. The CMS Administrator will define eligible individuals, establish program parameters, and collect a percentage of enrollees' premiums. The Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program will collect a percentage of enrollees' premiums and determine payment parameters for high-cost medical claims. $15 billion is appropriated for the program from 2018 to 2026, with state operation starting in 2020. The program is established to offset high-cost enrollees' medical claims costs. The Affordable Care Act mandates individuals to have insurance coverage or face a penalty. Most individuals must maintain minimum essential coverage, including private and public options. Premiums for certain plans can only vary based on self-only or family enrollment, geographic area, tobacco use, and age. Plans cannot charge older individuals more than three times the premium of a 21-year-old. Most plans in different markets must be offered on a guaranteed-issue basis. The Affordable Care Act mandates individuals to have insurance coverage on a guaranteed-issue basis, accepting all applicants. Plans cannot exclude coverage for preexisting conditions. Section 204 eliminates the penalty for not having insurance retroactively from CY2016. The individual mandate under IRC Section 5000A retroactively begins in CY2016. Section 133 introduces a penalty for applicable policyholders in the individual market by increasing premiums by 30% during an enforcement period. This penalty applies to enrollments starting in plan year 2019 and also to special enrollment periods in plan year 2018. Applicable policyholders include those with a gap in coverage exceeding 63 days and young adults up to age 26 who did not enroll in coverage after aging out of dependent coverage. The enforcement period for enrollment in health insurance plans begins when an individual enrolls, lasting 12 months for 2019 enrollments and from the first to last month for special enrollments in 2018. ACA Section 1302 mandates plans in individual and small-group markets to meet certain generosity levels, expressed as actuarial values (AV) such as bronze (60% AV) to platinum (90% AV), where higher AV means lower consumer cost sharing. Section 134 would amend ACA Sections 1302(a)(3) and 1302(d) to remove the requirement for plans to meet a certain generosity level starting in 2020. Premiums for plans in individual and small-group markets may vary based on enrollment type, geographic area, tobacco use, and age, with age rating limited to a 3:1 ratio for adults. Section 135 of ACA allows states to sell large-group coverage through the health insurance exchange, applying rating restrictions to all fully insured plans in the large-group market. The HHS Secretary may establish an age rating ratio of 5:1 for adults starting in 2018, limiting how much more older individuals can be charged compared to 21-year-olds. States can choose a different ratio. Federal law already restricts factors for determining eligibility and premiums for private health insurance. PHSA Section 2701(a)(1), as amended by ACA Section 1201, limits premium variations in individual and small-group markets to self-only or family enrollment, geographic area, tobacco use, and age. PHSA Section 2704(a), as amended by ACA Section 1201, prohibits excluding coverage for preexisting conditions. PHSA Section 2705(a), as amended by ACA Section 1201, also restricts factors for determining eligibility and premiums for private health insurance. PHSA Section 2705(a), amended by ACA Section 1201, prohibits private health insurance plans from basing coverage eligibility on health status-related factors. This includes factors like health status, medical conditions, claims experience, and genetic information. Plans cannot charge higher premiums based on health status and can offer discounts for wellness program participation. The ACA prohibits adjusting premiums based on genetic information and requires certain health plans to offer a core package of services, including ambulatory care, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity care, mental health services, prescription drugs, and more. The ACA mandates essential health benefits like preventive services, chronic disease management, and pediatric care. Section 136 allows states to seek waivers from federal health insurance requirements for specific purposes. States could apply for waivers to implement changes to age rating ratios, essential health benefits, and the continuous coverage penalty for plans purchased in the individual and small-group markets. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of states applying for waivers to waive the penalty on individuals with a gap in health insurance coverage. This waiver would allow issuers to use health status as a factor in developing premiums. States must have a program in place or participate in a Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program to obtain this waiver. The new subsection (b)(3) outlines waiver application requirements for states to apply for waivers to waive penalties on individuals with a gap in health insurance coverage. States must demonstrate how approval of the application would lead to outcomes such as reducing average premiums, increasing enrollment, stabilizing the market, stabilizing premiums for preexisting conditions, or increasing health plan choices. The application must also detail what provisions would replace the waived ones. The new subsection (b)(2) outlines the approval process for state waivers under the EHB. Waivers cannot extend longer than 10 years unless a state requests continuation. Waivers cannot apply to certain ACA sections, such as requirements for qualified health plans. The curr_chunk discusses various sections of the ACA, including the CO-OP program, MSP program, Basic Health Program, state innovation waivers, and health care choice compacts. It also mentions new standards for state waivers and prohibits gender-based rate variations and coverage limitations for preexisting conditions. Additionally, it references the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund established under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of the American Health Care Implementation Fund within HHS to cover administrative costs of implementing the ACA. It appropriates $1 billion for this purpose and specifies the provisions it will support. The ACA Section 1401 authorized premium tax credits to help individuals pay for health insurance, applicable to qualified health plans offered in health insurance exchanges. The credits are refundable and advanceable, available to those without access to subsidized public or employer-sponsored coverage meeting certain standards. The ACA Section 1401 authorized premium tax credits to help individuals pay for health insurance through qualified health plans in exchanges. The amount of the premium tax credit varies based on individual income and the cost of the standard plan in their local area. The required premium contribution is capped based on income relative to the Federal Poverty Level, with lower-income individuals receiving more tax assistance. The ACA Section 1412 establishes an advance payment program for tax credits, reconciled at year-end. Excess credits must be repaid, with limits set by IRC Section 36B(f)(2)(B). ACA Section 1414 allows taxpayer information disclosure. Section 201 of the ACA would require individuals to repay the entire excess amount of premium tax credits for tax years 2018 and 2019, regardless of income. Section 202 would disregard certain requirements for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) for ACA premium tax credit purposes. Section 202 of the ACA allows for the application of premium tax credits towards catastrophic plans but not grandfathered, grandmothered, or abortion coverage plans. It also permits the purchase of abortion-only coverage or plans with abortion coverage, but prohibits the use of ACA premium tax credits for these. Additionally, Section 202 amends reporting requirements for off-exchange Qualified Health Plans. Section 202 of the ACA specifies age and income-adjusted applicable percentages for premium contributions in tax year 2019, ranging from 2% to 11.5%. It aims to provide more tax assistance to lower-income individuals and will be adjusted for premium growth. Section 45R of the IRC, added by ACA Section 1421, offers a small business health insurance tax credit to help small employers afford coverage for fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees. The small business health insurance tax credit is available to nonprofit and for-profit employers with fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees. Employers must cover at least 50% of the cost of each employee's self-only health insurance. The credit is available for two consecutive tax years if insurance is obtained through a SHOP exchange. Starting in 2018, the credit amount is based on QHPs that do not include abortion coverage. The provision states that employer contributions for abortion coverage are not eligible for tax credits under IRC Section 45R. The small business health insurance tax credit will not be available starting in tax year 2020. The individual mandate requires most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. The individual mandate, effective since 2014, requires individuals to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The penalty is based on a percentage of income or a flat dollar amount, with increases over the years. Section 204 aims to eliminate the penalty retroactively from 2016 by reducing the percentage of income to 0% and the flat dollar amount to $0. Section 205 would modify the tax penalty associated with IRC Section 4980H, effectively eliminating it by reducing the penalty to $0 retroactively beginning in CY2016. The Cadillac tax, created by ACA Section 9001, imposes a 40% excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage exceeding a specified limit. The tax was originally set to take effect in 2018 but was delayed until 2020. Section 206 proposes to further delay the implementation of the Cadillac tax until January 1, 2026. Section 207 of the ACA would repeal the requirement that medicine or drugs must be prescribed to be considered qualified expenses for tax-advantaged health accounts. This change would be effective starting in tax year 2017. Additionally, ACA Section 9004 imposed a 20% tax on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs used for non-medical expenses. Section 208 of the ACA would reduce the tax rates on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs to 15% and 10% respectively, applicable after December 31, 2016. IRC Section 125 allows employers to establish cafeteria plans for employees to choose between cash and nontaxable benefits like health insurance. Section 209 of the ACA would repeal the contribution limit for health FSAs starting in tax year 2017. Additionally, a new excise tax on certain medical devices, equal to 2.3% of the sales price, was imposed under IRC Section 4191 effective January 1, 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 imposed a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Section 210 states that the tax does not apply to sales after December 31, 2016. Employers providing Medicare-eligible retirees with prescription drug coverage meeting federal standards are eligible for subsidies equal to 28% of costs exceeding $400, up to $8,250. These subsidies incentivize employers to maintain drug coverage for retirees. Section 211 of the ACA would repeal the requirement to coordinate federal subsidies with business deductions for retiree prescription drug coverage, allowing for full deduction of costs without reduction. Effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2016. Taxpayers who itemize deductions can deduct qualifying medical expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income (AGI), reduced to 7.5% for taxpayers aged 65 or older before January 1, 2017. ACA Section 212 proposes to lower the AGI threshold to 5.8% for all taxpayers starting in 2017. ACA also imposed a Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) surtax of 0.9% on taxpayers with income over $250,000 if married filing jointly; $125,000 if married filing separately. The proposed changes include repealing the 0.9% Medicare surtax for high-income earners, effective after December 31, 2022. The federal tax code currently offers two credits for health insurance: the Health Coverage Tax Credit and the premium tax credit under the ACA. Section 214 proposes amending IRC Section 36B to establish a new refundable tax credit for health insurance starting in tax year 2020. Eligibility criteria include being covered under a state-certified QHP, not eligible for other coverage, being a US citizen, national, or qualified alien, and not incarcerated. QHP coverage excludes certain plans and abortion coverage except in specific circumstances. The proposed amendment to IRC Section 36B introduces a new refundable tax credit for health insurance starting in 2020. Eligibility criteria include being covered under a state-certified QHP, not eligible for other coverage, being a US citizen, national, or qualified alien, and not incarcerated. Qualifying family members for the credit are limited to the individual's spouse, dependents, and children aged 26 or younger enrolled in the same QHP. A joint tax return is required for married couples, and the credit amount is based on age-adjusted flat credit amounts or premiums paid for the QHP. The proposed amendment to IRC Section 36B introduces a new refundable tax credit for health insurance starting in 2020. The age-adjusted credit amounts for eligible individuals range from $2,000 to $4,000 based on age. The total credit amount is calculated based on the five oldest individuals in a family and is subject to a MAGI limitation. The maximum tax credit allowed for an individual and qualifying family members is $14,000. Starting in 2021, adjustments will be made to the age-adjusted credit amounts, MAGI limitation, and aggregate dollar limitation. The proposed amendment to IRC Section 36B introduces a new refundable tax credit for health insurance starting in 2020. The age-adjusted credit amounts for eligible individuals range from $2,000 to $4,000 based on age. Adjustments will be made annually by the CPI-U. If an individual has a qualified small-employer health-reimbursement arrangement, the credit amount would be reduced. An individual cannot receive both the Health Coverage Tax Credit and the tax credit under IRC Section 36B. The deduction for health insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals would be reduced by the new tax credit amounts. Section 214 would amend ACA Section 1412 to require regulations for protection of taxpayer information, eligibility verification, and program integrity for the advance payment program starting in tax year 2020. HSAs are tax-exempt accounts for health expenses, owned by individuals with a qualifying high-deductible health plan. The HSA-qualified HDHP must meet certain criteria, including a minimum deductible and out-of-pocket limits. For 2017, the minimum deductible is $1,300 for single coverage and $2,600 for family coverage, with out-of-pocket limits of $6,550 and $13,100 respectively. Contributions to HSAs have annual limits, with 2017 limits set at $3,400 for self-only coverage and $6,750 for family coverage. Section 215 proposes to increase HSA annual contribution limits. Section 215 proposes to increase the HSA annual contribution limits for self-only and family coverage to match the out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified HDHPs. This change would be effective starting in tax year 2018. Eligible individuals can establish and contribute to HSAs when they have a qualifying HDHP and no other health plan. Contributions to HSAs may be made by eligible individuals, other individuals, or entities on their behalf. HSA contributions are deductible as an above-the-line deduction if made by individuals. In 2017, contributions to HSAs are subject to annual limits adjusted for inflation. The contribution limit is $3,400 for self-only coverage and $6,750 for family coverage. Individuals aged 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000 each year. Married couples with HSA-qualified family coverage are subject to specific contribution rules. Section 216 proposes amending IRC Section 223(b)(5) to allow married individuals to contribute to their respective HSAs without considering their spouse's coverage. This means that spouses can contribute more than the annual limit for family coverage, with the limit reduced by any Archer MSA contributions. Each spouse can also make catch-up contributions if eligible. The provision in Section 217 would allow both spouses to make catch-up contributions to one HSA and divide the contribution amounts equally between them, unless they agree on a different division. Withdrawals from HSAs are generally tax-exempt for qualified medical expenses, except for health insurance and expenses incurred before the HSA was established. Section 217 would amend IRC Section 223(d)(2) to allow HSA withdrawals for qualified medical expenses incurred before the HSA was established if it is set up within 60 days of coverage under an HSA-qualified plan. This provision would apply to coverage starting after December 31, 2017. Additionally, Section 221 would amend ACA Section 9008 to exempt certain covered entities from an annual tax on branded prescription drug sales over $5 million to specified government programs. Section 221 would amend ACA Section 9008 to exempt certain health insurers from an annual fee based on net health care premiums written. The fee is set at varying amounts from 2014 to 2018, with adjustments based on U.S. health insurance premium growth after 2018. Insurers are not subject to the fee on their first $25 million of net premiums written, with a 50% fee imposed on net premiums above $25 million and up to $50 million. The fee is imposed on 50% of net premiums above $25 million and up to $50 million, and 100% of net premiums in excess of $50 million. Certain health insurers or insurance arrangements are exempt from the fee, including self-insured plans, voluntary employees' beneficiary associations, and governmental entities. ACA Section 9010(j) made these provisions effective for calendar years after December 31, 2013, with a one-year moratorium provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Section 222 would amend ACA Section 9010. Section 222 amends ACA Section 9010 to remove the annual fee for calendar year 2017. Section 231 repeals the tax on indoor tanning services effective after June 30, 2017. Section 241 terminates the limitation on deducting remuneration for health insurance providers under IRC Section 162(m)(6). Section 241 terminates the limitation on deducting remuneration for health insurance providers under IRC Section 162(m)(6) for individuals with income above specified amounts. Section 251 would repeal the net investment tax on high-income taxpayers, effective beginning tax year 2017.
