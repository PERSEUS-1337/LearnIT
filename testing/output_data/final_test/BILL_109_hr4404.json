    "content": "The Act titled \"Americans Helping Americans Tax Credit Act of 2005\" includes a new section called \"KATRINA INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT\" under business-related credits. The Katrina investment tax credit allows recovery area companies to receive a 25% credit on qualified equity investments made during the taxable year. Qualified equity investments include cash, cash equivalents, or property exchanged for stock or capital interest, as well as the cost of qualified property used in the company's business. A recovery area company is defined as a domestic corporation or partnership. A recovery area company, defined as a domestic corporation or partnership, must meet specific criteria related to its location, income source, property use, and business operations to qualify for the Katrina investment tax credit. The Katrina investment tax credit applies to qualified property in a recovery area company, with specific criteria for location, income source, and business operations. If a recapture event occurs within 5 years of the qualified equity investment, the tax for that year will be increased by the credit recapture amount. The credit recapture amount is calculated based on the decrease in credits allowed to the taxpayer for prior years, plus interest at the underpayment rate. No deduction is allowed for the interest. The applicable percentage determines the recapture amount. The applicable percentage for recapture events ranges from 100% to 20% based on the timing after the qualified equity investment is made. The recapture event for a qualified equity investment occurs if the recovery area company ceases to qualify, redeems the investment, or disposes of the acquired property. The credit allowed by this section can be transferred through sale or repurchase agreements. The Katrina investment tax credit can be transferred through sale or repurchase agreements and is not included in gross income. This section does not apply to qualified equity investments made after December 31, 2007. The credit is now part of the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item, section 45N(a). The Katrina investment tax credit, effective after September 1, 2005, applies to qualified equity investments in taxable years following that date."
