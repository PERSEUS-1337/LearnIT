    "content": "The Act titled \"True Cost of War Act of 2013\" requires a report on the long-term costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Congress makes findings regarding the extensive military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001, with over $1.5 trillion appropriated for the Department of Defense, State Department, and medical costs. The Department of Defense has received supplemental appropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with future costs being difficult to estimate due to a lack of information on actual expenditures and key cost factors. Over 2.4 million members of the US Armed Forces have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the beginning of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, over 4,400 members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 2,100 in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Additionally, more than 1,715 members of the Armed Forces have suffered amputations, over 250,000 veterans have been treated for mental health conditions, with more than 100,000 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and approximately 253,330 with confirmed traumatic brain injury diagnosis. Approximately 54 percent of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts have sought treatment for traumatic brain injury at VA hospitals. The Independent Review Group identified traumatic brain injury, PTSD, severe burns, and amputations as signature wounds, stating recovery can take months or years with recurring symptoms and life complications. The President, along with contributions from key officials, must submit a report to Congress estimating the costs of previous and long-term military operations. This includes Operation New Dawn and Operation Enduring Freedom, taking into account force levels and deployment duration. The President must provide estimates and projections for military operations through fiscal year 2023, considering the total number of deployed Armed Forces members for Operation Enduring Freedom in Southwest Asia. This includes active duty and reserve components called for training, backfilling, or other related missions. The President must provide estimates and projections for military operations through fiscal year 2023, including the breakdown of deployments of regular and reserve components for Operation Enduring Freedom. This also includes the number of Armed Forces members expected to serve multiple deployments and the usage of contractors and private military security firms during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Enduring Freedom. Additionally, the report should cover the number of veterans currently suffering.
