    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sound Science for the Environment Act\". The Congress acknowledges the need for a mechanism to provide timely and credible scientific information on environmental issues to policymakers and the public. Understanding the scientific basis of environmental problems is crucial for finding effective solutions. This requires integrating scientific assessments, problem-focused research, communication of information, and education of professionals. A healthy environment is crucial for quality of life, economy, and national security. The Nation should wisely use fiscal resources by eliminating duplication in Federal environmental research and consolidating programs for a more cost-effective and efficient approach. The Act aims to consolidate environmental science functions and establish the National Institute for the Environment to improve decision-making on environmental issues and provide national leadership in environmental science and research. The National Institute for the Environment will conduct comprehensive assessments of environmental issues, establish a Center for Environmental Assessment to identify emerging issues, evaluate environmental knowledge gaps, communicate scientific understanding to decision-makers and the public, and identify areas for further research. The National Institute for the Environment aims to provide scientific information on critical environmental issues, evaluate research constraints, set goals and priorities, collaborate with scientific organizations, award grants for research, and establish a Directorate of Research. The National Institute for the Environment aims to establish a Directorate of Research to fund issue-oriented research on environmental resources, systems, and sustainability, ensuring disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary approaches. Additionally, it plans to establish a National Library for the Environment. The National Institute for the Environment aims to establish a National Library for the Environment as a comprehensive electronic information system linking existing environmental information networks and providing quality-assured data and information for scientists, decision-makers, and the public. The National Institute for the Environment aims to establish a National Library for the Environment as a comprehensive electronic information system. This includes conducting targeted information programs, providing long-term maintenance of environmental information resources, and sponsoring education and training for environmental scientists and professionals. The National Institute for the Environment supports study and research in environmental sciences, curriculum development, teacher training programs, diversity inclusion, and public environmental education programs. SEC. 6. BOARD OF GOVERNORS. The Board of Governors for the Institute establishes goals, priorities, and policies in the national interest. It consists of 18 members appointed by the President with Senate approval, representing non-Federal scientists and users of scientific information on the environment from diverse groups. The Board of Governors for the Institute consists of 18 members appointed by the President with Senate approval. Members should have expertise in environmental studies and represent diverse fields. The President should aim for diversity in appointments, including women, minority groups, and individuals recommended by prestigious scientific organizations. Members serve a 6-year term, with exceptions for initial appointments. The Board of Governors for the Institute consists of 18 members appointed by the President with Senate approval. Members serve initial terms of 2, 4, or 6 years. An individual cannot serve more than 2 consecutive 6-year terms.

Members' travel expenses are covered. Members of the Board who are not federal employees can receive travel expenses, including per diem, similar to government service standards. Full-time federal employees or Members of Congress serving on the Board cannot receive additional pay or benefits. SEC. 7. STAFF. The Institute shall be administered by a Director appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Director must have expertise in environmental sciences and exercise all authority granted to the Institute. The Director of the Institute oversees the integration of duties and functions, ensures involvement of relevant environmental sciences and users, receives pay not exceeding level II of the Executive Schedule, serves a 6-year term, is a member of the National Science and Technology Council, and a nonvoting ex-officio member of the Board. Assistant Directors are appointed for specific areas within the Institute. The Institute's Director oversees duties and functions, ensures integration with relevant environmental sciences and users, and serves a 6-year term. Assistant Directors are appointed for specific areas within the Institute. The Environmental Assessment, Research Directorate, National Library for the Environment, and Education and Training Directorate work together to integrate all functions of the Institute. SEC. 8. INTERAGENCY COOPERATION.\n\nThe Institute may acquire unclassified data and nonproprietary information from other Federal agencies to fulfill its duties. Federal agencies must cooperate and provide requested information to the Institute. The Institute will work with all agencies to ensure its information and products are accessible.\n\nSEC. 9. INTERAGENCY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Interagency Advisory Committee is established to ensure environmental efforts of the Institute and other Federal agencies are complementary. It provides recommendations to the Board to align priorities, avoid duplication, and inform other agencies of scientific findings. Members include heads of various Federal agencies like the EPA, NOAA, and NIH. The Interagency Advisory Committee, comprised of heads of various Federal agencies, elects a Chair who is a nonvoting member of the Board. SEC. 10. GRANTS, CONTRACTS, AND OTHER AUTHORITIES. The Institute may provide financial assistance through grants, loans, agreements, and contracts to eligible scientists and researchers. Federal agency scientists do not receive preference for funding, and funding recipients must meet Institute criteria. The Institute can receive funds from other Federal agencies and accept gifts or property. Funds received will be deposited in the Treasury and made available to the Institute as per appropriations Acts. SEC. 11. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRANSFERS OF FUNCTIONS TO INSTITUTE.
