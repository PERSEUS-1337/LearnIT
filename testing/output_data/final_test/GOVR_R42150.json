    "content": "In 2008, several large financial firms faced near-collapse and received government assistance to avoid failure. Bear Stearns, GMAC (later Ally Financial), and AIG were helped, while Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy after being denied assistance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put under government conservatorship, and the FDIC facilitated the acquisition of Wachovia and Washington Mutual by other banks. Citigroup and Bank of America received government guarantees on some assets. Policymakers justified these actions due to the firms being \"too big to fail.\" The concept of \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) emerged during the 2008 financial crisis when several large firms were rescued by the government to prevent widespread disruptions in financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to address systemic risk issues, including the TBTF problem, through enhanced regulation for \"systemically important\" firms. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III implemented regulations for \"systemically important\" financial institutions, including limits on size and activities, and a new receivership regime for failing non-banks. Basel III also imposed stricter requirements on large banks. Legislation reduced the application of Dodd-Frank and Basel III provisions to fewer banks. Critics argue that these reforms may not fully address the TBTF problem. The report discusses the economic issues raised by TBTF, broad policy options, and policy changes made by relevant Dodd-Frank provisions. Evidence shows the increasing concentration of assets in large financial firms in the U.S. with more than $250 billion in assets, indicating a growing TBTF problem. Large banks in the U.S. have seen a significant increase in their share of total industry assets over the years. The top three banks held 5% to 15% of assets until the 1990s, which rose to about 40% by 2008. As of 2017, the five largest bank holding companies accounted for 48% of total assets. Despite this concentration, U.S. banks are relatively small compared to other OECD economies. Additionally, not all very large financial institutions are commercial banks, with companies over $100 billion in assets including insurers, broker-dealers, and investment funds. Large non-banks have emerged in the financial system, some chartered as bank holding companies or thrift holding companies. The financial crisis reduced the number of large financial firms but increased the size of remaining firms through mergers and acquisitions. Financial firms are large in assets and liabilities but not in revenue due to the nature of financial intermediation. Berkshire Hathaway is the only firm with revenues from financial businesses. The financial sector is not dominated by a few large firms like in other industries. Traditional policy tools like antitrust have not been used against large financial firms recently. The \"Too Big to Fail\" phenomenon in finance is due to the nature of financial intermediation. Contagion can be transmitted from small or large financial institutions. Large financial firms pose unique problems due to their extensive counterparty exposure. When these firms fail, it can lead to severe losses for third parties and trigger \"fire sales\" in securities markets, causing market price depressions. Some economists argue that the issue lies in firms being \"too interconnected to fail,\" dominating key market segments. According to the IMF, a few large firms control crucial market segments like private securitization and derivatives dealing. The systemic risk posed by large financial firms like Lehman Brothers suggests that firms can be too interconnected to fail, leading to disruptions in credit flow. Policymakers may struggle to identify which firms pose systemic risk, potentially leading to more firms being politically TBTF than economically TBTF. The failure of Lehman Brothers worsened the financial crisis, highlighting the dangers of firms being too big to fail. The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 worsened the financial crisis, causing disruptions in credit flow. Bailing out \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) firms may be necessary to prevent fallout to the broader financial system and economy. While some oppose rescuing TBTF firms on moral or economic grounds, it is essential for market efficiency to avoid firms that are TBTF. The TBTF problem leads to inefficient allocation of resources in large firms, hindering economic efficiency. Saving a firm that is TBTF may prevent capital from shifting to more efficient uses and perpetuate bad decision-making. This results in too much financial intermediation at large firms and too little at smaller firms. Preventing TBTF firms is crucial for market efficiency. Preventing TBTF firms from failing is crucial for maintaining financial system stability in the short run, but rescuing them can lead to a less stable system in the long run due to moral hazard. This theory suggests that if TBTF firms expect to be bailed out, they may take greater risks, capturing profits from high-risk activities while the government bears losses. Government intervention to rescue TBTF firms can create moral hazard by incentivizing risky behavior. The direct beneficiaries of a rescue include management, owners, creditors, account holders, and counterparties who may be protected from losses. This assistance can lead to excessive risk-taking by management, even if they believe they may be replaced in the event of failure. Government rescues of TBTF firms can lead to moral hazard as managers may take excessive risks without personal liability for losses. Shareholders may experience some losses through stock dilution, but creditors and counterparties are generally shielded. Government intervention only occurs in extreme cases, leading to moral hazard primarily in systemic events. Counterparties to TBTF firms may ignore risks assuming government intervention, giving TBTF firms a competitive advantage. The funding advantage for TBTF firms may lead to moral hazard as creditors provide credit at a lower cost. Studies show evidence of this advantage, but it is not solely due to moral hazard. A Government Accountability Office review found that the funding advantage for large firms declined by 2011. The funding advantage for large banks during the crisis is not clearly evident in 2012 and 2013, with some models showing higher funding costs. Credit rating agencies rating financial firms higher due to assumed government support is seen as evidence of this advantage, although the magnitude of this \"ratings uplift\" has decreased in recent years. This funding advantage, sometimes called the TBTF subsidy, does not necessarily imply direct government support like a traditional subsidy. Policy options for addressing Too Big To Fail (TBTF) can be categorized into six broad categories: \"Bailouts\"; Limiting Firm Size; Limiting Scope of Activities; Regulation; Minimizing Spillovers; and Resolving a Failing Firm. The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes in regulation and resolution, with recent legislative proposals also focusing on these areas. Policy options can be preventive (preventing TBTF firms from emerging or posing systemic risk) or reactive (containing fallout during a crisis). A comprehensive policy may incorporate multiple approaches to address different aspects of the problem. Some policy approaches are complementary and could be successful in conjunction with others to address the TBTF problem. Problems at large firms during the crisis may not be TBTF problems per se, but rather representative of issues all firms face. Therefore, policies should treat these problems systematically for all firms, not just TBTF firms. Prudential regulation, special resolution regimes, and policies limiting spillover effects could be applied to all firms in a given area. Policies limiting spillover effects could apply to all firms in an area, not just large firms. Differential treatment of TBTF firms may shift systemic risk to non-TBTF firms. \"Bailouts\" vary in definition, with TBTF bailouts potentially delivered through unique assistance or existing government programs. Before the financial crisis, TBTF policy was ambiguous, not specifying what would happen to large financial firms if they became insolvent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had implicit TBTF status, receiving benefits similar to government entities. The question of whether to bail out or wind down failing financial firms was central to addressing TBTF concerns. The financial crisis exposed the lack of explicit TBTF policy due to limited experience with financial instability since the Great Depression. The Fed's historical response to financial turmoil involved providing liquidity to banks, but there was no standing policy for non-bank financial firms before the crisis. During the recent financial crisis, the lack of explicit policy for non-bank financial firms led to reactive and ad hoc measures by the Fed to prevent the failures of firms like AIG and Bear Stearns. Despite the absence of a safety net, federal assistance was provided to some banks and non-bank financial firms. The crisis prompted the use of broad emergency authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to prevent the collapse of TBTF firms. During the financial crisis, emergency authorities like Section 13(3) and FDIC's systemic risk authority were used to prevent failures of firms like Bear Stearns and AIG. Programs like TARP injected capital into financial firms, while HERA and EESA provided assistance to prevent insolvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Authorities expired in 2010, but funds continued under existing contracts. In hindsight, the government's special assistance to large financial firms during the financial crisis turned out to be cash-flow positive, with income and principal repayments exceeding outlays. However, the economic cost of assistance, factoring in the rate of return a private investor would have required, is not reflected in cash-flow measures. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that special assistance through TARP and other programs generated positive outcomes. The government's special assistance to large financial firms during the financial crisis, including Citigroup, Bank of America, and auto financing firms, resulted in positive profits. TARP assistance to AIG was subsidized, but there were no net losses. Title XI of the Dodd-Frank Act limited the Fed's emergency assistance to solvent firms only. During the financial crisis, the government provided special assistance to large financial firms like Citigroup and Bank of America, resulting in positive profits. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) ruled out future uses of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for money market funds. Critics of ad hoc bailouts found them arbitrary, unfair, and lacking transparency, but many economists credit them with restoring financial stability. Policymakers have since supported eliminating future bailouts to prevent excessive risk-taking. During the financial crisis, the government provided special assistance to large financial firms like Citigroup and Bank of America, resulting in positive profits. Critics of ad hoc bailouts found them arbitrary, unfair, and lacking transparency, but many economists credit them with restoring financial stability. Policymakers have since supported eliminating future bailouts to prevent excessive risk-taking. However, imposing \"market discipline\" is not achieved simply by proclaiming a \"no bailouts\" policy. Market participants must be convinced that policymakers will not deviate from this policy to prevent moral hazard. The decision to rescue firms during the crisis may lead creditors to expect future bailouts, making it challenging to establish a credible \"no bailouts\" policy. Policymakers can make it harder for future policymakers to bail out firms by limiting existing authority. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to prevent future bailouts, but critics doubt its effectiveness. The Dodd-Frank Act narrowed emergency authority to prevent future bailouts, but critics believe that regulators would still use it to save TBTF firms. Policymakers debate repealing or limiting emergency authority like the Fed's 13(3) authority, the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, and the FDIC's systemic risk exception. Maintaining broad discretionary emergency authority allows quick reactions to unforeseen crises, which could be crucial in a fast-moving crisis. Eliminating broad authority could delay assistance and worsen economic damage. TARP serves as an example of emergency authority. TARP is an example of emergency authority enacted quickly during a crisis, but its enactment took weeks while contagion can spread in days. Three disadvantages of ad hoc bailouts are cited: arbitrary assistance, lack of contingency planning shifting risk to taxpayers, and policy uncertainty heightening systemic risk. Lack of explicit policy added to panic after Lehman Brothers failed, as market participants expected similar government assistance as Bear Stearns. These disadvantages could be addressed through a no bailouts policy or by explicitly stating terms for receiving assistance. The optimal approach to bailouts is to clearly define terms for receiving assistance to avoid moral hazard. Bailouts incur direct costs to the government and create a less stable financial system. Failure to bail out firms could lead to systemic risk spreading, while bailouts may increase moral hazard. The 2008 financial crisis raised the question of whether it is more costly to bail out TBTF firms or allow them to fail. The crisis worsened after Lehman Brothers failed, but ended after TARP and emergency programs were created. Ad hoc rescues had not stabilized financial markets until TARP was enacted. The failure of TBTF firms like Lehman Brothers raised questions about the effectiveness of ad hoc rescues in stabilizing financial markets. The uncertainty remains on whether a consistent policy of allowing firms to fail would have led to similar outcomes. The fundamental issue of how to handle the failure of large interconnected firms without causing financial instability persists. Effective market discipline may reduce the likelihood of failure, but eliminating it entirely is not feasible. The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy highlighted challenges in the existing bankruptcy process. The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy raised concerns about financial instability in the existing bankruptcy process. Policymakers may need to consider altering TBTF firms' characteristics or imposing size limits to prevent future bailouts and maintain financial stability. Section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act limits mergers or consolidations that would result in a firm holding more than 10% of total liabilities of certain financial firms or 10% of total deposits of insured depository institutions in the US. The Financial Stability Oversight Council found that this would only affect the four largest BHCs in 2011. Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act allows the Federal Reserve to intervene in mergers and acquisitions, restrict products offered, terminate activities, and sell assets to maintain financial stability. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the Federal Reserve and FSOC to take actions against financial firms with over $250 billion in assets if they pose a threat to financial stability. Fees can be assessed on banks and non-banks with assets over $50 billion to finance supervision and resolution costs. Regulations targeting large financial firms are discussed in the \"Regulating TBTF\" section. GSEs are reducing their investment portfolio under conservatorship. Under conservatorship, GSEs are reducing their investment portfolio balances by 15% annually until reaching $250 billion by the end of 2018. The size restrictions only apply to investment holdings and are not mandated by statute. Determining systemic risk based on firm size is complex, as it can be influenced by overall size or importance in specific financial segments. Simply capping institution sizes may not eliminate systemic risk entirely. The benefits of reducing the size of firms include eliminating moral hazard and the need for future bailouts stemming from \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) institutions. However, size restrictions may also raise costs or reduce the quality of financial products provided by these firms, with the impact on economic efficiency depending on the underlying causes. Large firms play a crucial role in the economy, impacting economic efficiency in various ways. Eliminating large firms could improve efficiency even if costs increase, but size restrictions may reduce efficiency if economies of scale are a primary factor. Large firms contribute to market liquidity, customer convenience, and financial needs that small firms may not be able to meet. The success of large firms through innovation or monopoly rents also affects economic efficiency. While reducing firm size can lower systemic risk, the impact on the likelihood of failure is inconclusive. Some argue that large firms may be less likely to fail due to diversification and risk management. Canada's banking system avoided the 2007-2009 financial crisis due to its concentrated nature. Size restrictions on financial firms could disadvantage U.S. firms globally. Shifts to foreign firms may not reduce systemic risk if their regulations are weaker than in the U.S. The text discusses potential measures to address the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue in financial firms. Suggestions include imposing a tax on assets or liabilities above a certain threshold to penalize size, rather than restricting size directly. This tax could neutralize any funding advantage from TBTF status. Other options like higher capital requirements could also increase funding costs for large firms. A phased approach may be needed to reduce the size of firms without causing disruptions to the financial system. When designing policies for large financial firms, one consideration is whether to have a graduated size threshold to avoid firms trying to stay just below it. Some policy options focus on limiting certain activities of financial firms, such as Glass-Steagall and the Volcker Rule. Most large financial firms are organized as bank holding companies, with subsidiaries engaging in various non-traditional banking activities like asset-backed securitization, trust services, and insurance. Some large financial firms are interconnected across different sectors like money market mutual funds and broker-dealers. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, restricts banks from proprietary trading and owning hedge funds and private equity funds in the US. Exemptions include activities like market making and investments in government securities. Insurance companies are mostly not affected by the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, restricts banks from proprietary trading and owning hedge funds and private equity funds in the US. Exemptions include activities like market making and investments in government securities. P.L. 115-174 exempted banks with less than $10 billion in assets and minimal trading activities from the Volcker Rule. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act required banks to \"push out\" certain swap dealer activities outside of the depository subsidiary. The rule implementing Section 716 was effective July 2013, with a two-year transition period. GSEs are large financial firms with a narrow range of business activities permitted by their charter. Size restrictions are straightforward to impose, but preventing firms from being too interconnected is more complex. Policymakers could consider a \"reinstate Glass-Steagall\" approach to prevent a single financial holding company from operating in multiple lines of financial business. Reducing the scope of firms in the financial sector could potentially decrease risky activities and the need for future bailouts. This could also simplify monitoring by regulators and creditors. However, there may be costs associated with limiting the scope, such as the loss of economies of scope and customer benefits from diversified and interconnected firms. Large firms operating in multiple lines of business may reduce risk through diversification, making them less prone to instability. Reintroducing Glass-Steagall separations without other regulatory changes could reinforce a system where banking is closely regulated while other financial firms are not, potentially mitigating systemic risk. Examples like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac show that forbidding banks from engaging in other activities is not a foolproof solution to avoid failures. The recent crisis experience raises doubts on the assumption that banks and institutions cannot be a source of systemic risk. The growth of \"shadow banking\" blurs the distinction between different lines of business in finance, making it difficult to segregate activities and regulate them. Non-banks engaging in bank-like activities could pose similar systemic risk without prudential regulation, especially with the potential for activities to migrate abroad. The potential for activities to migrate abroad, where \"universal banking\" is common, raises concerns about systemic risk. One policy approach is to limit or ban TBTF firms' participation in risky activities not central to their business model. This is justified by the need to protect taxpayers from large losses during financial stress. The Volcker Rule, for example, restricts banks from proprietary trading with their own funds. The debate continues on whether proprietary trading is inherently riskier than other banking functions like lending. Regulatory supervision and risk management techniques like hedging can help mitigate risks in financial activities. The debate over whether proprietary trading is riskier than other banking functions like lending continues. Various proposals suggest banning banks from engaging in broker-dealer and market-making activities in securities and derivatives. Some advocate for \"ring fencing\" banking activities into separate entities within a holding company structure. Limiting permissible activities may lead to arbitrary distinctions and challenges in regulating risky activities. Proposals to ban certain banking activities may lead to challenges in distinguishing between allowed and banned activities, potentially incentivizing firms to find ways to circumvent the ban. Limiting the scope of activities would apply to all banks, but larger banks are more likely to engage in a wider range of non-bank businesses. Some argue that no policy can completely prevent the emergence of \"too big to fail\" firms. In the context of proposals to ban certain banking activities, it is argued that no policy can completely prevent the emergence of \"too big to fail\" firms. Regulation could be used to address the moral hazard problem and reduce the likelihood of their failure by setting higher standards for TBTF firms through prudential regulation such as capital requirements. The regulatory regime before the crisis was not based on firm size, but rather on charter type. Before the crisis, regulatory oversight in depository banking focused on safety and soundness standards to minimize risks associated with deposit insurance and access to the Fed's discount window. Non-bank financial firms lacked similar government protection, leading to a lack of regulation for safety and soundness. The issue of \"too big to fail\" firms was not explicitly addressed in pre-crisis regulations. Before the crisis, large financial firms were subject to Fed prudential oversight at the holding company level if they were organized as BHCs or financial holding companies. Regulation at the holding company level did not mean that all subsidiaries were regulated in the same way as depository subsidiaries. \"Firewalls\" were meant to protect the depository subsidiary from losses at non-bank subsidiaries. Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, were also subject to prudential regulation by their own regulators. Some large firms that faced financial difficulties during the recent crisis were not BHCs under Fed regulation at that time. During the financial crisis, some large financial firms that were not Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) faced difficulties. These firms included government-sponsored enterprises, insurance companies, investment banks, and hedge funds. Some firms voluntarily became BHCs during the crisis, while others like AIG and Lehman Brothers were thrift holding companies supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act created regulations to address these issues. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act established a regulatory regime for large bank holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial firms. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has the authority to identify non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) based on certain criteria. Foreign financial firms operating in the US could also be designated as systemically important. Firms with assets under $50 billion are exempt from these regulations. FSOC's final rule exempts firms with assets under $50 billion from heightened prudential regulation. The criteria for designation include gross notional credit default swaps, derivatives liabilities, debt outstanding, leverage ratio, and short-term debt ratio. FSOC has designated AIG, Metlife, Prudential Financial, and GE Capital as systemically important, with only Prudential Financial's designation remaining. MetLife's designation was struck down by the U.S. District Court, and GE Capital announced plans to sell most of its assets in April 2015. In 2018, GE's appeal was dismissed. GE announced plans to sell most of GE Capital in 2015 to no longer be systemically important. FSOC rescinded GE Capital's designation in 2016 and AIG's in 2017. FSOC has not designated any asset managers as systemically important. The Fed became the prudential regulator for non-bank SIFIs and BHCs with over $50 billion in assets under Dodd-Frank Act. The \"Hotel California\" provision prevents BHCs from changing their charter to avoid enhanced regulatory standards without FSOC's permission. Currently, there are 13 U.S. BHCs with over $250 billion in assets. Zions converted from a BHC to a bank in 2018 to escape the enhanced regulation. Foreign banks operating in the United States with over $250 billion in global assets must comply with enhanced prudential standards. Those with more than $50 billion in U.S. assets must establish intermediate BHCs subject to heightened standards. Final rules for non-bank SIFIs are pending, while large BHCs have already implemented enhanced regulatory standards including stress tests, liquidity requirements, and risk management. The Federal Reserve sets prudential standards for large banks, including stress tests, liquidity requirements, and risk management. Additional standards may be proposed based on risk factors, with fees assessed to cover supervision costs. Regulation is tiered based on asset size, with requirements for risk committees and stress tests for banks with over $10 billion and $100 billion in assets, respectively. The Federal Reserve requires banks with over $100 billion in assets to undergo stress tests. Basel III regulations categorize banks based on asset size, with \"Advanced Approaches\" for those with $250 billion or more in assets. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are designated annually by the Financial Stability Board, with 30 banks currently holding this status worldwide. The Financial Stability Board designates 30 banks as G-SIBs globally, with 8 in the US and some having US subsidiaries. Advanced approaches banks must meet a 3% supplementary leverage ratio. US regulators require G-SIBs to meet a 5% leverage ratio at the holding company level by 2018. Basel III mandates G-SIBs to hold a common equity surcharge of at least 1% to reflect their higher risks. Fed's final rule in July 2015 phased in this capital surcharge. The Fed issued a final rule in July 2015 to phase in a capital surcharge for G-SIBs, which could be increased to 4.5%. Most G-SIBs would face a higher capital surcharge than required by Basel III. Additionally, Basel III introduced liquidity standards, the liquidity coverage ratio, and the net stable funding ratio, which apply only to large banks. In September 2014, banking regulators finalized a rule for the liquidity coverage ratio, requiring firms to hold enough liquid assets for cash flow needs during stress. In May 2016, a rule for the net stable funding ratio was proposed, mandating firms to have stable funding for net outflows in a stressed environment over a year. These rules apply only to large banks, not non-bank SIFIs, but non-bank SIFIs will have their own liquidity requirements. Size thresholds are also used in other regulations like the Volcker Rule and debit card interchange fees in the Dodd-Frank Act, applying only to banks with over $10 billion in assets. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has identified globally systemically important insurers, with three headquartered in the United States. Designated insurers must develop recovery and resolution plans and hold more capital by 2019. The FSB has released a methodology for identifying systemically important firms that are not banks or insurers. Statutory changes to GSE prudential regulation are pending broader GSE reform. Successfully containing Too Big to Fail (TBTF) through regulation involves considerations on systemic risk posed by financial firms. Some argue that banks pose unique systemic risks due to deposit-taking activities. If non-bank financial firms are also deemed systemically important, similar regulations may apply to them. Large non-banks have diverse features that could contribute to systemic risk. Some non-banks have features like leverage and vulnerability to runs, while others do not. Large insurers are regulated at the state level for safety and soundness, but state regulators may not be equipped to regulate noninsurance subsidiaries for systemic risk. The Office of Financial Research identified asset managers that could pose systemic risks, with some arguing that only activities, not firms, in this industry pose systemic risk. A \"one size fits all\" model for regulating firms in different businesses is unlikely to be practical. Bringing non-banks under the Fed's purview raises questions. Bringing non-banks under the Fed's purview raises questions about applying bank regulations to non-banks and the expertise of federal bank regulators. Insurers argue that bank regulations are not suitable for them, and the Fed lacks specialized expertise in insurance. The issue of regulating all activities of holding companies or only certain systemically important ones with \"firewalls\" is also raised. Prudential regulation cannot prevent all failures, as seen in the recent financial crisis. Regulation aims to prevent large financial firms from taking excessive risks, reducing the occurrence of disruptive losses. Both markets and regulators failed to predict the losses that led to the financial crisis. Market participants may have a higher risk tolerance than society as a whole, making regulatory intervention necessary. Regulators may have better access to risk information than creditors and counterparties of TBTF firms. Skeptics doubt regulators' ability to prevent risky behavior, citing past failures. Regulation aims to limit risky behavior but may inadvertently increase correlation of losses across firms. Some argue that large firms are too complex for regulators to effectively oversee. Large financial institutions have complex structures with numerous subsidiaries, making it difficult for regulators to identify and understand risks. Critics argue that overly sophisticated regulations may not be effective, and simpler rules could be more robust. There are concerns that regulators may be unable to take action against \"too big to jail\" firms without jeopardizing financial stability. This complexity poses challenges for regulatory oversight and addressing the risks associated with systemically important firms. A special regulatory regime for TBTF firms may backfire if not strict enough, leading to regulatory capture and exacerbating the moral hazard problem. This could signal to market participants that these firms have a protected status, potentially allowing them to borrow at lower costs. The experience with GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is cited as a historical example of such risks. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had lower borrowing costs due to market belief in government support, leading to regulatory capture. Despite being well-capitalized by their regulator, they held little capital, lacked diversification, and suffered significant losses during the crisis. Critics fear that a separate regulatory regime for TBTF firms could provide a competitive advantage similar to the GSEs. A heightened prudential regime for firms designated as systemically important could lead to increased costs in the financial system but may reduce risk-taking and enhance stability. This could result in higher lending costs but lower likelihood of firm failure, potentially creating a less volatile credit environment over time. However, there is a concern that such a regime could backfire from a systemic risk perspective. Enhanced regulation for systemically important firms may lead to increased costs and reduced risk-taking. However, there is a concern that this could backfire by causing financial intermediation to shift to unregulated firms, resulting in a less regulated financial system. Determining which firms should be subject to enhanced regulation can be done on a case-by-case basis or automatically based on quantitative thresholds. Size alone may not capture all systemically important firms due to complexity and interdependence. Setting a numerical threshold for determining systemically important firms may result in capturing non-systemically important firms if set too low or excluding important firms if set too high. Size is a simpler metric than complexity or interdependence, but a case-by-case designation process is more resource-intensive. Critics argue that the current designation process lacks transparency and may not accurately identify systemically important firms until they face distress. FSOC's designation process lacks transparency and may not allow firms enough opportunity to address their systemic importance. Concerns exist about incorrect judgments due to lack of expertise and the Treasury Secretary's veto power. Policymakers must choose between a simpler, imperfect proxy or a more targeted, laborious approach for enhanced regulation. Policy options focus on mitigating contagion and counterparty risk in TBTF firms. Counterparty risk arises when a party in a transaction cannot meet its obligations, potentially leading to cascading failures. Measures to reduce this risk include using clearinghouses, requiring capital/margins, hedging risk exposures, and setting limits on exposure. Regulation F and the Dodd-Frank Act impose limits on counterparty exposure to prevent systemic contagion. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes counterparty credit exposure limits for large financial institutions to reduce risk. It also allows for enhanced supervision of systemically important financial market utilities. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes counterparty credit exposure limits for large financial institutions to reduce risk and allows for enhanced prudential supervision. It designates systemically important financial market utilities that can borrow from the Fed in \"unusual or exigent circumstances.\" Regulators focus on how a firm's failure would affect counterparties and broader financial conditions to prevent spillover effects on the overall financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes counterparty credit exposure limits for large financial institutions to reduce risk and enhance prudential supervision. It aims to prevent spillover effects on the overall financial system by focusing on how a firm's failure would impact counterparties and broader financial conditions. If counterparty exposure were transparent, market participants could hedge themselves against failure, reducing contagion effects. However, the complexity and opacity of linkages make predicting sources of contagion difficult. Policymakers underestimated the disruptive potential of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008, despite warning indicators like elevated default risk signals from credit default swaps. Without a prudential regulator monitoring a firm's activities and examining its counterparties, identifying spillover effects from a firm's failure becomes challenging. Lack of transparency in counterparty exposure makes it difficult for market participants to hedge against failure, leading to potential contagion effects. Solutions that shift rather than eliminate counterparty risk may not be effective in preventing financial disruptions. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses counterparty risk by designating financial market utilities for enhanced regulation and access to Fed lending. Critics argue this creates moral hazard. Reducing counterparty risk may increase financial system costs, but without proper incentives, market costs may be too low. If a TBTF firm fails, there are established approaches to manage the failure. The FDIC's resolution regime is used to manage failing banks, while bankruptcy is used for other financial firms like broker-dealers. The FDIC can take a bank into receivership and exercise powers like transferring assets and paying obligations to resolve it swiftly and protect federally insured deposits. This prioritizes the FDIC over other creditors in the resolution process. The FDIC's resolution regime allows for swift resolution of failing banks, giving priority to insured deposits. Prompt corrective action and least cost resolution aim to minimize losses. The FDIC can initiate resolution before failure, limiting losses to creditors. Least cost resolution may prevent moral hazard, but can be waived for systemic risk. Market participants expected this exception for large firms like Wachovia and Citigroup. The FDIC resolves failed banks through the \"purchase and assumption\" method, selling assets and deposits to healthy banks. Losses not absorbed by creditors are covered by the FDIC's deposit insurance fund. Before the crisis, failed non-banks went through standard bankruptcy, with limited government involvement. Congress enacted resolution authority for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008. In 2008, Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA), creating the FHFA to regulate housing GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA was given powers to resolve the GSEs, leading to their conservatorship in September 2008. The Treasury Secretary was granted authority to lend or invest in the GSEs to prevent insolvency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went into conservatorship in 2008 due to insolvency, with Treasury funds being transferred until 2012. Shareholders lost equity value, but creditors were paid in full. The Dodd-Frank Act required systemically important firms to prepare resolution plans, with regulatory action for failure to do so. Title II of the Act also created early remediation requirements for certain financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) for resolving financial firms in distress to prevent adverse effects on financial stability. Different types of firms have specific resolution processes, involving multiple regulators and approval from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) for resolving financial firms in distress to prevent adverse effects on financial stability. The process involves the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors making a recommendation to the Treasury Secretary for resolution, determining systemic risk, and potential default, with limited rights to appeal for the company. The FDIC manages the resolution if necessary, with receivership powers provided by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) for resolving financial firms in distress to prevent adverse effects on financial stability. The FDIC has receivership powers to manage assets, sign contracts, and prioritize unsecured creditors. Shareholders and creditors bear losses, and management responsible for the company's condition can be removed. Bridge companies can be created to divide good and bad assets temporarily. Unlike FHFA's regime, Dodd-Frank does not allow conservatorship. The FDIC can provide credit to a firm in receivership if private funding is unavailable. Costs not recouped during resolution are covered through assessments on counterparties and risk-based assessments on large financial firms. The lack of pre-funding raises concerns about systemic risk in assessing counterparties after the fact. The FDIC can provide credit to a firm in receivership if private funding is unavailable. Costs not recouped during resolution are covered through assessments on counterparties and risk-based assessments on large financial firms. The lack of pre-funding raises concerns about systemic risk in assessing counterparties after the fact. In the resolution process, the FDIC's assistance is limited to a percentage of the failed firm's total consolidated assets, with the most promising strategy being to place the parent company into receivership and transfer its assets to a newly created bridge holding company to avoid disruption. Equity claims of the firm's shareholders and claims of firms with assets exceeding $50 billion are involved in the resolution process. The resolution process involves transferring ownership and control of the surviving franchise to private hands. The debt holders' claims will be converted to equity, making them owners of the new company. The \"Single Point of Entry\" approach requires the holding company to have sufficient common equity and debt to absorb losses. The FDIC proposed a rule for this in December 2013, and the Fed finalized a rule for G-SIBs in December 2016. The Federal Reserve finalized a rule in December 2016 requiring Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) to meet a \"total loss-absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) requirement through equity and long-term debt. Some analysts argue that the bankruptcy process is not equipped to handle the failure of a financial firm that dominates important market segments, citing the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy as evidence. The Federal Reserve, with Treasury support, intervened to prevent the failure of such firms. The Federal Reserve intervened to prevent the failure of Bear Stearns and AIG, believing their bankruptcy would undermine financial stability. A resolution process for all TBTF financial firms offers an alternative to bailouts or messy bankruptcies. Failures of large depositories like Wachovia and Washington Mutual under the FDIC's resolution regime were less disruptive than Lehman Brothers' collapse. The resolution of Wachovia and Washington Mutual under the FDIC's regime imposed losses on stockholders and unsecured creditors. The smooth handling of these failures raises questions about the resolution of non-bank failing firms, especially if a large institution were to fail with no clear entity capable of acquiring it. This could lead to greater concentration in the financial system. Critics argue that Title II gives policymakers too much discretionary power, potentially leading to higher costs and preferential treatment of favored creditors. This could result in \"backdoor bailouts\" allowing government assistance beyond bankruptcy limits, perpetuating moral hazard. Unlike the FDIC regime, a resolution for TBTF firms may prioritize systemic risk over cost, potentially making it more expensive for the government. A resolution process could be costlier for the government than bankruptcy, but it may avoid some bankruptcy costs like legal fees. Critics fear that a resolution regime could be used to prop up TBTF firms indefinitely, similar to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Title II does not allow conservatorship, but mandatory receivership was required for the GSEs under HERA. Policymakers are cautious due to the Lehman Brothers' turmoil. Some critics suggest amending the bankruptcy code for complex financial firms instead of a special resolution regime. The bankruptcy process already allows for quick reorganization and sale of healthy business units, as seen in the case of Lehman Brothers. Unlike Title II, bankruptcy does not allow conservatorship but can effectively address financial firm issues. The bankruptcy process, unlike Title II, lacks the ability to base decisions on financial stability concerns or ensure access to necessary liquidity for financial firms. Title II does not guarantee that creditors would suffer losses, and imposing losses on them without triggering contagion remains uncertain. A receiver would have short-term incentives to limit losses to creditors to prevent systemic risk, similar to the recent crisis. The TLAC requirement in a resolution regime aims to impose losses on debtholders to prevent systemic risk. However, the lack of pre-funded mechanisms may lead to temporary taxpayer losses. Uncertainty remains on whether a special resolution regime can effectively shut down a failing firm without causing systemic disruption. Policymakers may err on the side of including more failing firms in the resolution process due to uncertainty about which firms are TBTF. The resolution process aims to prevent systemic risk by imposing losses on debtholders, but challenges arise in resolving foreign subsidiaries. Contagion from TBTF firms was a major source of systemic risk during the financial crisis, leading to government interventions that protected creditors and exacerbated moral hazard. Regulatory shortcomings are also blamed for the lack of effective resolution mechanisms. The recent financial crisis highlighted the issue of \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) institutions, with debates on regulatory authority and failed regulation. Policy ambiguity before the crisis aimed to promote market discipline, but government assistance became the norm during the crisis for firms like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG. During the financial crisis, Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG received government support, while Lehman Brothers did not. Policy ambiguity led to a rapid shift from market discipline to government assistance, undermining pre-crisis credibility. Policymakers may need statutory changes to enforce market discipline effectively. Changes are being considered to limit policymakers' ability to provide assistance in the event of a future TBTF failure by eliminating broad emergency authority like Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FDIC's systemic risk exception. There is debate over whether the Dodd-Frank Act changes have effectively achieved this goal, as future legislation could still allow for assistance. Concerns exist that a \"no bailouts\" promise may not prevent moral hazard if policymakers have short-term incentives to provide government assistance during crises. One view is that government assistance to TBTF firms based on the 2008 experience creates little incentive for market participants to monitor risk-taking, leading to moral hazard. Policy options to mitigate this include regulating TBTF firms for safety and soundness or using government policy to reduce systemic risk. A special regulatory regime like the one in the Dodd-Frank Act could set strict standards to counter moral hazard, but the complexity of large firms and potential regulatory capture pose challenges. Explicit regulation of TBTF firms removes ambiguity that could promote market discipline. The Dodd-Frank Act's special regulatory regime aims to identify TBTF firms clearly, reducing ambiguity to promote market discipline. If regulators fail to enforce strict standards, TBTF firms could gain a competitive advantage, as seen with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. To mitigate systemic risk, measures like the resolution regime in Dodd-Frank Act aim to reduce contagion effects. The challenge in eliminating systemic risk posed by TBTF firms is demonstrated by events in 2008. Critics point to open-ended assistance to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a cautionary tale. Some argue for eliminating TBTF by reducing the size or scope of the largest firms, but it is uncertain what size limit would eliminate TBTF. Eliminating TBTF involves uncertainties in setting size limits and the potential loss of benefits to the financial system. Different policy approaches, such as preventive and reactive measures, may be needed to address the problem. Market discipline is one approach that could be considered. Market discipline approach, when coupled with size limits, is seen as the most likely to succeed in addressing TBTF firms. Policies involving identification of TBTF firms may not be compatible with market discipline. Efforts to minimize spillover effects can be more effective if TBTF firms are regulated for safety and soundness. Policymakers historically manage moral hazard through safety and soundness regulation, resolution regimes, and limits on spillover effects. Deposit insurance limits market discipline's role, but it still plays a role with uninsured depositors and creditors. TBTF poses additional challenges to banks. The Dodd-Frank Act attempted to address the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue by incorporating various policy approaches, but its efforts to limit the size and scope of firms were narrow. Future policymakers face challenges in effectively regulating firms with complex activities and must consider the strengths and weaknesses of different policy approaches to combat TBTF. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to tackle the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) problem by implementing various policy measures, but efforts to restrict the size of financial firms were limited. The continued growth of large firms post-crisis raises concerns about the unresolved TBTF issue. The true test of success lies in managing the failure of a large firm without a bailout and ensuring their stability during financial downturns, which may take years to determine. Market perceptions will play a role in assessing the ongoing existence of the TBTF problem. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to address the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) issue, but TBTF firms were not solely responsible for the financial crisis. While TBTF exacerbated the crisis, other systemic risks were also at play. Policy options discussed in the report may be more effective if applied broadly, rather than exclusively to TBTF firms. Focusing solely on large institutions for systemic risk may create a false sense of security. An optimal financial system allows large firms to fail without destabilizing the financial system, aiming to limit systemic risk to acceptable levels. Mitigating the moral hazard of \"too big to fail\" firms may lead to higher credit costs initially but could result in less volatile credit availability over time. Policymakers may need to balance the tradeoff between less credit and a more stable financial system. The recent crisis led to the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced regulatory requirements on large financial institutions to promote stability. Thresholds were raised to $250 billion in assets, with discretion given to apply requirements to banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion range if needed. The Federal Reserve has discretionary authority to provide financial stability and ensure the safety of banks with assets in the $250 billion range. This authority can also be applied to foreign banks with over $100 billion in global assets. Provisions are divided into ongoing requirements, emergency powers, and assessments on large institutions. Most ongoing requirements have already been implemented. The Federal Reserve has implemented most ongoing requirements, but emergency powers have never been invoked."
