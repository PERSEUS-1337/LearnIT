    "content": "Home visiting is a service strategy for families with young children or expecting children, involving structured models of interaction with specific goals and regular home visits over time. It is a primary prevention strategy offered before any specific problems are identified. Home visiting models target families with risk factors for poor child outcomes and implement intervention strategies to prevent recurrence of poor outcomes. These models aim to impact maternal and child health, early childhood development, and family functioning. Approximately 400,000 to 500,000 families receive early childhood home visitation services, representing 3% of all families with children under six. Early childhood home visitation targets families with risk factors for poor child outcomes, with approximately 400,000 to 500,000 families receiving services. Visitors, such as trained nurses or professionals, start visits during pregnancy and continue until the child is two years old or enters school. Participation is voluntary, driven by research on brain development and the importance of early environments. Parents play a significant role in shaping their children's experiences, and home visiting programs aim to help parents understand their child's development. Since the 1960s, various early childhood home visiting models have been assessed for their effectiveness in enhancing child development. While results have been mixed, some models have shown to be particularly effective. Researchers recommend home visiting as part of strategies to improve early childhood outcomes. Different voluntary prenatal and early childhood home visitation models are used, with implementation varying at the state and community level. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is conducting a grant initiative to help implement proven effective home visitation models. Federal government supports various programs where home visitation is a primary strategy for achieving program goals. Home visiting models vary in their target populations, services intensity, staff qualifications, and program goals. Some federal programs explicitly support home visiting, while others allow funds to be used for similar activities. Six early childhood home visitation models are discussed as examples. Early childhood home visitation programs like the Parent-Child Home Program and SafeCare are examples of privately originated models with established core components and training standards. These programs have been evaluated and have resources available for replication. Home visitation is a primary prevention strategy, offering services to families before any issues are identified. Other models exist that meet similar criteria, but the discussion here is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Early childhood home visitation programs like Nurse Family Partnership and Healthy Families offer services to families before any issues are identified. These models target specific demographic features for additional family support. Parents as Teachers model focuses on providing support to families with specific needs. The SafeCare model is focused on families with a history of child abuse or neglect, aiming to prevent further maltreatment. Various home visitation programs, such as Healthy Families America and Parents as Teachers, offer support to pregnant women and families with young children, continuing until the child reaches a certain age. The Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) and Parent-Child Home Program models start when the child is around 2 or 3 years old and end around preschool or kindergarten enrollment. The Nurse Family Partnership model begins during the first-time mother's pregnancy and ends when the child turns two. The SafeCare model starts after the child's birth and lasts for the duration of the program curriculum, typically four or five months, with visits occurring weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Both HIPPY and Parents as Teachers models include group meetings. The various home visiting program models involve home visits lasting one hour, with some allowing for 30-minute or up to 90-minute visits. The Nurse Family Partnership requires home visitors to be registered nurses, while other models accept individuals of any education level after completing training. The Healthy Families model emphasizes the importance of home visitors establishing rapport with families. Some programs prefer home visitors to be from the local community. The various home visiting program models have different criteria for home visitors, such as being from the local community or alumni of the program. Each model has varying primary goals and activities to achieve them, with some focusing on school-readiness and others on broader child development issues. Methods used to provide parents with information about their child's growth and development also vary across the program models. Table 1 outlines goals and characteristics of six home visiting program models. Table 2 displays the presence of five program models by state, with varying numbers of locations. SafeCare has been implemented statewide in Oklahoma and is undergoing implementation in Georgia, California, Washington, and Maryland. Many states and localities have home visiting programs in place. Many states and localities have implemented home visiting programs targeting low-income families with certain risk factors. A 2007 survey by Columbia University's National Center on Children in Poverty found that 40 states have state-based home visiting programs, with 24 states operating at least 32 distinct programs under a state legislative mandate. The 2007 survey by Columbia University's National Center on Children in Poverty found that most publicly funded home visiting programs targeted low-income families with specific risk factors. The survey also revealed that the most common program goals for state-based home visiting programs were related to parenting, children's early health, and development. Over 70% of programs focused on these areas, with around half including outcomes related to pregnancy. Additionally, reducing government services related to child abuse was a goal in over 40% of programs surveyed. The survey identified 70 state-supported home visiting programs in 40 states, with only 17 implementing well-known models like Healthy Families and Nurse Family Partnership. Some programs used a combination of models, while others relied on \"homegrown\" approaches to address specific target populations. In a 2006 report on home visiting programs, researcher Miriam Wasserman noted that states often launch programs based on local needs without prioritizing evidence of success. Grassroots efforts and secure funding have led to the proliferation of certain program models. In a 2006 report on home visiting programs, researcher Miriam Wasserman highlighted the importance of grassroots efforts and influential champions in the development of program models. Examples include initiatives by Governor Evan Bayh in Indiana, Michele Ridge in Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton in Arkansas, and the relationship between Senator \"Kit\" Bond and former Senator Dirk Kempthorne in Idaho. The Bush Administration sought $10 in funding for these programs in its FY2008 Budget Request. The Bush Administration requested $10 million in funding for home visitation programs in its FY2008 Budget Request. Congress provided the initial funding as part of the FY2008 appropriations process. The Administration for Children and Families awarded cooperative agreements to 17 grantees in 15 states to support state and local infrastructure for the programs. The Administration for Children and Families awarded $500,000 per year grants to 17 grantees in 15 states to support infrastructure for evidence-based home visiting programs. Grantees are implementing various home visiting models and Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., and the Chapin Hall Center for Children will conduct a cross-site evaluation of the programs. The Administration for Children and Families awarded grants to support infrastructure for evidence-based home visiting programs. Mathematica and Chapin Hall provide technical assistance and coordinate a peer learning network for grantees. Recipients spent the majority of the first year engaged in collaborative planning efforts to ensure all relevant programs and funding streams are included. The plan will lay out the necessary infrastructure for widespread adoption of evidence-based home visiting programs. HHS/ACF requires interagency collaboration for home visitation projects, involving child welfare agencies and CBCAP lead agencies. Collaboration with other federally supported efforts is also recommended. Funding for Health Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) and Project LAUNCH initiatives, as well as ACF home visiting program, was directed by Congress in P.L. 111-8. However, specific funding for the home visitation initiative was not included in the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117). The FY2010 appropriations bill (H.Rept. 111-366) suggested that mandatory funding would be provided for the ACF home visiting initiative as proposed by the Obama Administration. The Administration also requested legislative authority for a new state grant program to support home visits to low-income mothers and pregnant women with mandatory funds. Both the House-passed (H.R. 3962) and Senate-passed (H.R. 3590) health care reform bills included provisions for state grant programs to support evidence-based home visiting programs. The bills propose a state grant program to support evidence-based home visiting programs for low-income families with young children and expectant mothers. States receiving funds are not required to continue supporting ACF home visiting grantees, but they are not prohibited from doing so. Funding for home visiting programs typically comes from a mix of federal, state, local, and private sources. Support for home visiting programs comes from various federal funding sources, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education. Different federal programs provide support in different ways, such as operating their own home visiting models or permitting home visiting services as one of many eligible activities for program funding. Additionally, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are among the federal programs that contribute to funding. The federal government provides support for home visiting programs through various programs, including Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). These programs offer funding and resources for early childhood home visitation under broad program authorities, allowing for a range of activities to support the overall goals of the programs. The federal government supports home visiting programs through various programs such as Medicaid, TANF, Title V, Title XX, Title XIX, and Title XXI. Other programs like CBCAP, Early Head Start, Child Care and Development Fund, Community Services Block Grant, Healthy Start, and Adolescent and Family Life Care Demonstration Grants also provide support for home visiting. Additionally, ED programs like the Infants and Toddlers Program and ESEA programs may also support home visiting. The federal government supports home visiting programs through various programs such as Medicaid, TANF, Title V, Title XX, Title XIX, and Title XXI. Other programs like CBCAP, Early Head Start, Child Care and Development Fund, Community Services Block Grant, Healthy Start, and Adolescent and Family Life Care Demonstration Grants also provide support for home visiting. Additionally, federal agencies like HHS, ED, OJJDP, Corporation for National and Community Service, and Department of Defense administer programs that support home visiting efforts. The federal government categorizes home visiting programs into two categories based on their relationship to program goals or statutes. The first category includes programs where home visitation is a mandatory or recommended component, such as Even Start and Early Head Start. The second category consists of programs with broadly stated goals where home visiting is not explicitly required or permitted, but funding may still be possible due to their flexible nature. Home visiting services could be funded through programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to support the goal of assisting needy families. While these programs may support home visiting activities, they may only contribute a small portion of total spending. The list of federal programs provided is not exhaustive but illustrates the strong link between home visiting and existing programs. State funding sources for early childhood home visiting programs include state general revenues, TANF maintenance of effort (MOE) funds, and state funds allocated to match federal grant programs. A study found that 44% of home visiting program budget dollars came from state revenues, with programs also utilizing state tobacco settlement dollars. The tobacco settlement of 1998 provided funding to states, which coincided with the emergence of home visiting programs across the country. Approximately 13 bills were enacted by state legislatures targeting children's services with tobacco settlement funds. Home visiting programs receive funding from federal, state, local public, and private sources. Funding sources vary by program model and over time. For example, a 2004 survey found that 54% of funding for Healthy Families America came from the federal government, 38% from the state, and 8% from local sources. The HFA survey data showed a shift in funding sources, with more state funding than federal funding. In 2004, federal funding for HFA programs mainly came from TANF, with a decrease in overall funding from nearly $296 million in FY2002 to almost $185 million in FY2004. The HFA survey data provides insight into Healthy Families America budgets, but it only represents a subset of programs. Funding sources vary between HFA and other home visiting programs, with HFA receiving more support from HHS human services programs. The Nurse Family Partnership program receives funding from various sources including Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, National Institutes of Health, TANF, and Medicaid. Medicaid funding for NFP programs is increasing while TANF funding is decreasing according to founder David Olds. Parents as Teachers (PAT) and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) receive significant financial support from Education Department (ED) programs, such as Education for the Disadvantaged and Even Start. PAT originated with support from the education community in 1981. Parents as Teachers (PAT) and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) receive support from the education community. PAT started in 1981 with a pilot project in Missouri, funded by the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Danforth Foundation. The program has since expanded to all school districts in Missouri and is now supported by Title I funds from the Education Department. PAT and HIPPY programs are referenced in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, requiring coordination of parental involvement strategies. Grants from Parent Information Resource Centers must allocate 30% of funds for parent education programs like Parents as Teachers and HIPPY. Even Start provides funds for program improvement to eligible organizations with a history of effective family literacy services. National investment in home visiting programs is hard to estimate due to diverse program models and funding sources. Based on a study by the National Center for Children in Poverty, over $250 million is spent annually on home visiting programs in responding states, covering about 55 programs. However, this figure is only a partial account as it does not include funding from non-responding states or programs that do not meet the defined criteria. Total annual spending for home visitation is estimated to be between $750 million to $1 billion. The NCCP report found that about $250 million was appropriated for parent education and home visiting programs in FY2007 and $281 million in FY2008, with federal funding sources accounting for roughly 15% of total appropriations. Home visitation researcher Deanna Gomby estimated annual costs for these programs to be between $750 million to $1 billion. Estimates for home visiting programs range from $1,000 to $3,000 per family annually. Costs vary by program model and site, with examples like Healthy Families America spending $1,950 to $5,768 per family in FY2004. Nurse Family Partnership's costs range from $2,914 to $6,463 per family per year. The cost of program models and sites can vary due to factors like services intensity, staff qualifications, and scope of services. The average cost for a slot in Early Head Start exceeds $11,000 annually. Home visiting studies show benefits such as preventing child abuse, enhancing cognitive development, and improving parenting behaviors. Home visiting programs have shown positive effects such as preventing child abuse, enhancing cognitive development, and improving parenting behaviors. Researchers believe that early childhood home visitation can be effective in improving outcomes for families and children, although the size of the effect is small. Efforts are ongoing to understand successful components of home visitation and find additional effective methods to meet family and child needs. Home visiting programs can be effective in improving outcomes for families and children, but researchers differ on the strength of evidence across program models and outcomes. It is emphasized that program goals must align with content and be delivered effectively. Home visiting is not a cure-all solution but should be integrated with other services to support families and ensure positive outcomes for young children. Home visiting programs are effective in improving outcomes for families and children. Research shows that center-based education, preventive health care, parenting support groups, and clinical mental health services are beneficial. Continued study is needed to understand effectiveness and ensure quality improvement in program implementation. Randomized control trials have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of home visiting programs. Home visiting programs are evaluated through randomized control trials where the \"treatment\" group receives home visiting services while the control group does not. Studies must have a large participant pool, be conducted in multiple sites, and show consistent findings. Follow-up studies may assess long-term effects such as academic success. Other evaluation methods include \"quasi-experimental\" studies. Quasi-experimental studies evaluate home visitation programs by comparing outcomes of families receiving treatment to those who did not. Findings from studies with larger participant pools and conducted in multiple locations are considered more reliable. Some evaluations also track changes over time within the group of families served. The effectiveness of home visiting programs is often evaluated through quasi-experimental studies comparing outcomes of families who received treatment to those who did not. Feedback from these programs can be crucial for implementation, but randomized control studies are considered the gold standard for evidence. However, these studies are costly and time-consuming, leading to ethical concerns about withholding support from control group members. The researchers at Michigan State University note the challenges of implementing randomized control trials for home visiting programs due to the complexity of family needs and circumstances. They argue that multiple models of home visiting are necessary and that the overall efficacy of home visiting has been proven, suggesting a focus on refining existing program models rather than conducting random trials. Home visiting programs aim to improve maternal and child health, early childhood development, and family functioning. Desired outcomes include decreased infant mortality, improved health and development, enhanced parent-child interaction, and school readiness. Home visitation programs aim to improve social/emotional and cognitive development, enhance school readiness, and promote longer-term academic success for children. They also seek to improve parenting skills, reduce child abuse/neglect, increase maternal education attainment, and enhance family self-sufficiency. Factors influencing effectiveness include clear program goals, home visitor education/training, service intensity/duration, family retention, and integration with other parenting support and early childhood programs. Home visitation programs focus on improving children's health, education, and socio-emotional development. Research shows that these programs can reduce emergency room visits, injuries, and accidents for children. However, some studies suggest that home visitation programs may not increase overall healthcare utilization. Deanna Gomby found that home visitation programs do not necessarily increase preventive health care utilization. Some programs have shown benefits for mothers such as reducing subsequent pregnancies or increasing the time between pregnancies. Maternal mental health and substance abuse are critical issues that home visitors may struggle to address, impacting the effectiveness of the programs on outcomes. Poor maternal mental health can lead to employment barriers and affect mother-child interactions, with implications for children's behavioral, academic, and health outcomes. Prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs can lead to various birth complications and disorders in children. Despite this, a significant number of pregnant women still report substance usage, including illicit drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol. A study on the Hawaii Healthy Start Program showed positive maternal mental health outcomes for participating mothers compared to a control group. The Hawaii Healthy Start Program study found that home visitation had no significant effect on maternal substance abuse overall. However, families receiving a higher dose of services showed reduced maternal alcohol use. Another study on the Nurse Family Partnership model in Denver showed that mothers visited by paraprofessionals had better mental health outcomes compared to control group mothers, but there was no significant difference for nurse-visited mothers. The nine-year follow-up to the Nurse Family Partnership program in Memphis, TN, found that nurse-visited mothers used fewer substances, but had no significant effect on maternal depression. Research on home visiting programs in Elmira, NY, showed that nurse-visited mothers had fewer subsequent pregnancies by the child's fourth birthday. The Nurse Family Partnership program in Memphis and Elmira showed positive effects on reducing subsequent pregnancies. Nurse-visited mothers had longer intervals between births and fewer cumulative subsequent births per year. Elmira had a larger reduction in subsequent pregnancies (67%) compared to Memphis (23%). Denver NFP site also found a greater interval between pregnancies for nurse-visited mothers. A study comparing the effects of home visiting programs on teen mothers found that fewer home visited mothers had multiple pregnancies compared to control group mothers. However, the Hawaii Healthy Start program showed no effects on repeat births. Low birth weight is a significant indicator of maternal and child health. Weight is a leading cause of infant deaths and childhood illnesses. Home visiting studies have shown positive outcomes, such as nurse-visited adolescents having heavier babies and lower rates of low birth weight infants. Teen mothers in the PAT-only group also had lower rates of low birth weight babies. The Healthy Families America program in New York also had positive results for participants. The Healthy Families America program significantly reduced the rate of low birth weight babies among participating mothers compared to the control group. However, there were no significant effects on premature births or babies requiring neonatal intensive care. A study in New York found that participating parents were more likely to have health insurance for their children compared to the control group. The Hawaii Healthy Start Program had no effect on parents' health insurance coverage but did increase the likelihood of having a primary care provider for their child. Immunization and well-child visit rates were similar between participating and control group children. In a study comparing the Parents as Teachers program to a control group, participating children showed higher rates of full immunization. Linking home visiting with quality pediatric care can lead to improved child health and safety outcomes, including fewer emergency room visits for injuries and ingestions. Results from various studies on home visiting programs show that nurse-visited children had fewer health care encounters for injuries and ingestions compared to control group children. However, not all programs showed beneficial effects on emergency room use, hospitalization, and urgent medical care. Studies also evaluate the impact of these programs on children's social, emotional, and cognitive development, including language skills, behaviors, academic achievement, and matriculation rates. Studies on home visiting programs have shown that children who received home visits outperformed control group children in cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes. However, the effect sizes were typically small to medium. Some programs like Parents as Teachers, HIPPY, and the Parent-Child Home Program have demonstrated that home visited children excel in school grades, achievement test scores, suspensions, and high school graduation rates. Some evaluations of Nurse Family Partnership programs do not assess child cognitive development outcomes, but studies in Elmira, NY, and Memphis, TN, show limited to no effects on cognitive development. However, a nine-year follow-up study in Memphis found that nurse-visited children born to low-resource mothers had GPAs equivalent to control group children born to high-resource mothers. Nurse-visited children also had fewer conduct failures in elementary school compared to control group peers. High school drop out rates were lower for children in the Parent-Child Home Program compared to the control group, 16-20 years after the study. Both groups were considered \"at-risk\" initially. Graduation rates for program participants were 30% higher than the control group. The high school graduation rates for PCHP participants were significantly higher than the control group and low-income students nationally. Controlled trials of Nurse Family Partnership programs have shown mixed results on child development, with some studies suggesting positive effects on children's early learning environments. Some studies suggest linking program quality to outcomes for better understanding of effects. In Denver studies, the home visitor's role (nurse vs. paraprofessional) had varying effects on children's outcomes. The paraprofessional program showed more supportive home environments for early learning, but no significant effects on language, executive functioning, or behavior. In contrast, the nurse program had positive effects on home learning environment, language development, executive functioning, and behavior. Some literature suggests child-focused strategies may be more beneficial for cognitive development. Home visiting services have a positive impact on cognitive development in children, with an effect size of 0.26. However, programs combining home visiting with center-based early childhood education show almost twice the effect size at 0.48. Research suggests that high-quality center-based child care and preschool education are essential for lasting cognitive and developmental benefits in children. Early Head Start programs, which combine center-based and home-based services, have shown positive results in this regard. Recent research has shown that participation in center-based early childhood programs enhances cognitive development and reduces negative social-emotional aspects by age three. However, not all home-based Early Head Start programs have shown positive effects on cognitive development. Full implementation of HHS performance standards in home-based programs has been linked to positive impacts on child cognitive development. Studies have found that Early Head Start programs combining center-based and home-based services show significant gains, with effects in the 20-30% range. These programs enhance language and social-emotional development in children, improve parenting behaviors, and promote self-sufficiency activities among parents. Home visitation programs aim to impact parenting behaviors, reduce child abuse, and neglect, as well as encourage educational attainment and work attachment. Home visitation programs aim to impact parenting behaviors, reduce child abuse, and neglect, as well as encourage educational attainment and work attachment. Research suggests that improved parenting practices and attitudes may prevent child abuse and neglect by providing parents with information about their children's developmental needs and abilities, and communicating positive parenting skills. In randomized control trials, changes in parenting behaviors or attitudes were more likely to be observed than significant differences in rates of reported or substantiated child abuse or neglect. The Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) showed reduced substantiated child abuse and neglect reports in one site (Elmira) in a randomized control trial. The Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program in Elmira showed reduced substantiated child abuse and neglect reports, although not statistically significant until years after the program ended. Home visited parents who completed SafeCare training modules were less likely to recommit child maltreatment. Other studies have shown mixed results, with some encouraging findings in Hawaii but no significant results in other evaluation sites. Some evaluations of the Parents as Teachers program did not find significant effects on rates of child maltreatment. A study on teenage mothers receiving PAT services with case management showed they were less likely to be investigated for child maltreatment compared to those not receiving services. However, there was no significant difference in child maltreatment investigations between teen mothers receiving PAT-only services and those in the control group. The effectiveness of programs related to children's experiences of abuse or neglect is challenging to measure due to low incidence rates and the need for large study participant numbers to show significant effects. Varying definitions and state policies on child abuse further complicate national or multisite evaluation efforts. Regular visits from nurses or family workers are factors to consider in program effectiveness assessments. Families regularly visited by a nurse or family worker may be more likely to be reported to Child Protective Services. A study in New York found that mothers in the Healthy Families program who admitted to serious abuse were twice as likely to have a CPS report. Other measures like health care visits for injuries or parental self-reports have been used to assess the impact of home visiting programs on child abuse. A study on the Healthy Families New York model showed that home visited mothers reported engaging in fewer abusive practices compared to control group mothers. Positive effects were stronger for first-time mothers under age 19 enrolled in the prenatal period. SafeCare implementation also led to parents engaging in more positive behaviors. Home visitation effectiveness in changing parenting behaviors and reducing child abuse may be due to home visitors addressing family stress factors and providing peer support. In a study of a statewide home visiting program in Hawaii, researchers found a trend towards less neglectful behavior from home visited mothers compared to the control group. However, the program did not prevent child abuse or promote nonviolent parenting. One critical issue hindering effectiveness was the failure to address family risk factors like domestic violence and mental health needs. In a meta-analysis of family support programs, efforts to improve parenting behaviors were most successful when specifically targeted. Home visitation programs aim to improve parenting behaviors by focusing on developing parents' skills and self-confidence. Programs like Parents as Teachers and HIPPY include parent group meetings for peer support. The goal is to increase family self-sufficiency through educational attainment and labor force participation. In the year following the child's birth, differences in welfare dependence emerged between nurse-visited and control group mothers. Nurse-visited first-time mothers showed greater labor force participation two years after the evaluation. Thirteen years later, nurse-visited unmarried mothers from low socioeconomic backgrounds spent less time on public aid compared to control group mothers. Similar findings were seen in other trials with at-risk mothers. In a study comparing nurse-visited mothers to control group mothers after an NFP trial, it was found that nurse-visited mothers spent less time on public assistance. In another trial, paraprofessional-visited mothers worked more than control group mothers two years after the trial ended. There were no significant differences in workforce participation or educational achievement between nurse-visited, paraprofessional-visited, and control group mothers. The President's FY2010 budget included a proposal for mandatory funding. The President's FY2010 budget included a proposal for mandatory funding for home visitation programs. Legislative proposals and health care reform bills also supported funding for home visiting programs. The FY2011 budget did not specifically mention establishing a home visiting program. The Obama Administration proposed a capped entitlement program to support grants for states, territories, and tribes for home visiting programs. The Obama Administration proposed a program to support formula grants for evidence-based home visitation programs for low-income mothers and pregnant women. The program aimed to create long-term positive impacts for children and families, including reducing child abuse and neglect, improving children's health and development, and enhancing parents' ability to support optimal child development. Expanding proven effective home visitation programs was expected to yield positive outcomes. The Obama Administration proposed expanding proven effective home visitation programs to save Medicaid costs, totaling $664 million over 10 years. Funding for the program would start at $124 million in FY2010 and increase to $1.837 billion by FY2019, serving 50,000 families initially and 450,000 by FY2019. States would need to provide matching funds to receive federal grants. The Obama Administration proposed expanding proven effective home visitation programs to save Medicaid costs, totaling $664 million over 10 years. Funding for the program would start at $124 million in FY2010 and increase to $1.837 billion by FY2019, serving 50,000 families initially and 450,000 by FY2019. States, territories, and tribes seeking grants under the proposed home visitation program would be required to submit a plan describing the program model, evidence for its effectiveness, and ensuring model fidelity. Funding would include technical assistance, monitoring, and evaluation to ensure effectiveness over time. The Obama Administration proposed additional funds to support promising home visitation programs based on research evidence and adaptations of evaluated programs. Funding would include technical assistance, monitoring, and evaluation to develop these models effectively. A minimum of 5% of the program's funding would be reserved for research, evaluation, training, and administration. The Administration expected the HHS agency to administer the new state grant program, coordinating planning across agencies for an effective program structure. The Obama Administration proposed additional funds to support home visitation programs, with a coordinated strategy involving various agencies. The FY2010 budget resolution included a reserve fund for home visitation programs. The Obama Administration proposed additional funds for home visitation programs, with a coordinated strategy involving various agencies. Health care reform bills in the House and Senate would establish a grant program to support expanded home visitation services. The House bill would appropriate $750 million over five years, while the Senate bill would allocate $1.5 billion over the same period. There is currently no existing program providing grants exclusively for funding home visiting programs. The House and Senate bills propose funding for home visiting programs, with differences in funding levels and requirements. The House bill (H.R. 3962) includes specific provisions for voluntary participation, while the Senate bill emphasizes state procedures to ensure voluntary participation. The House bill (H.R. 3962) proposes a new optional Medicaid benefit for \"nurse home visitation services\" for first-time pregnant women or children under two years old, allowing states to seek federal reimbursement. The Senate bill (H.R. 3590) does not include a similar Medicaid amendment. The House bill (H.R. 3962) proposes a new optional Medicaid benefit for \"nurse home visitation services\" for first-time pregnant women or children under two years old. Evidence suggests these services are effective in improving maternal and child health, reducing child abuse, neglect, and injury, increasing family stability, and promoting economic self-sufficiency. Federal reimbursement for these services would be effective from January 1, 2010. The Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support of the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on proposals to provide funds to states for early childhood home visitation programs. Witnesses supported broader implementation of evidence-based early childhood home visitation programs, with differing opinions on which families should be targeted for services. Witnesses emphasized the importance of engaging families early, potentially during pregnancy or at birth, and targeting first-time young mothers for successful outcomes in early childhood home visitation programs. Researchers highlighted the need for programs to clearly link activities to goals, provide services consistently, and employ well-trained home visitors for success. Selected Federal Programs That Provide or Support Home Visitation include various programs that support early childhood home visitation efforts, such as Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. These programs may require home-based services, permit home visiting as an activity, or allow home visiting under broad authorities or program goals. Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP) under Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) provide grants to support community-based services for preventing child abuse and neglect. These grants are distributed by formula to lead entities in all states, which develop services to strengthen families and prevent abuse. Core services include home visiting, parent education, social services referrals, and respite care. Many state CBCAP contacts in FY2007 explicitly supported home visiting services. The CBCAP program received approximately $42 million in funding for FY2010 and is administered by the Office of Child Abuse and Neglect. Early Head Start is a federally funded program for low-income expectant parents and families with infants and toddlers, providing child development and family support services through various delivery options. Early Head Start programs offer center-based, home-based, or combination options for children and families. In 2006, 51% of slots were center-based and 41% were home-based. Center-based programs provide child development services in a center setting with limited home visits. Home-based programs offer weekly home visits and group socialization experiences. Combination programs blend center sessions with home visits. Professionals conduct home visits and receive training in child development and family support. In FY2008, Early Head Start teachers and home visitors received training in child development and family support. Legislation required HHS to develop standards for home visitors. For FY2010, Early Head Start programs were estimated to receive $690 million. Additionally, funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act remained unobligated. The program is administered by the Office of Head Start. Even Start programs, authorized by ESEA Title I, integrate early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills. Funds are distributed to states and subgranted to local education agencies and community organizations. Services include home-based instruction, adult literacy, early childhood education, and parent support. The program serves children aged zero to seven and their parents, with a focus on improving literacy and education levels. The Healthy Start program provides funding for health services to high-risk pregnant women, infants, and mothers in communities with high infant mortality rates. It aims to reduce disparities in maternal deaths and infant mortality, with a budget of $66 million for FY2010. Administered by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, it also includes educational services for parents to help their children learn. Healthy Start projects aim to reduce infant mortality by meeting the basic needs of mothers and infants through services like home visits. A 2003 survey of 95 grantees found that 99% provided home visits to clients, with most offering them to pregnant or parenting clients. About 35% of grantees used a specific schedule for home visits, while 64% scheduled visits based on client need. Healthy Start projects provide home visiting services to clients based on their needs, including depression screening, well baby care, and smoking cessation. The program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act and receives funding of approximately $105 million. Additionally, the Infants and Toddlers Program under IDEA provides grants to states for implementing comprehensive programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities. The Part C program under IDEA provides coordinated services for children with developmental delays, delivered in their natural environment, mainly in the home. Services are based on an Individual Family Services Plan (IFSP) tailored to address the child's specific needs. Administered by the Office of Special Education, Part C does not follow a set curriculum but focuses on addressing identified developmental delays. The Part C program, administered by the Office of Special Education, received $439 million in FY2010. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant aims to improve healthcare access for mothers and children, reduce infant mortality, provide prenatal and postnatal care, increase children's health assessments, and implement family-centered care systems. Title V block grant funds are used by states for various purposes including direct services, community capacity building, personal and preventive health services, and infrastructure-building. The program also funds Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) projects to increase capacity and integration of local service systems. In FY2010, the Title V program received $662 million in funding. The Title V program received $662 million in FY2010 funding (P.L. 111-117) for women, infants up to one year old, and military families facing unique parenting challenges. The funds are distributed to states under a block grant, with some allocated for CISS and SPRANS grants. The program is administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau within HRSA at HHS. Military families can access the New Parent Support Program for children up to three years old (or five years old for the Marine Corps). The New Parent Support Program (NPSP) offers services for military families with children up to three years old (or five years old for the Marine Corps). Services may include home visiting, playgroups, classes, hospital visits, and referrals. Home visitors provide guidance on child development, breastfeeding, nutrition, and behavior management. Staff members must be licensed professionals and undergo background checks. NPSP is part of the military's Family Advocacy Program (FAP). The Parent Information and Resource Centers (PIRCs) help implement parental involvement policies to improve student academic achievement. Projects focus on serving parents of low-income, minority, and limited English proficient children. The Parent Information and Resource Centers (PIRCs) focus on serving parents of low-income, minority, and limited English proficient children in elementary and secondary schools. PIRC grants are distributed through competitive grants to nonprofit organizations or a consortium of a nonprofit organization and a local education agency. Funding for PIRC grants in FY2010 was $39 million, with about 30% allocated towards early childhood parent education programs. PIRC grants are administered by the Office of Innovation and Improvement at the Department of Education. The PSSF program authorizes funds for state child welfare agencies for family support, family preservation, reunification, and adoption services. In FY2010, the program received $408 million, with $64 million allocated for family support services, including home visitation. The PSSF program aims to strengthen families, increase parenting confidence, provide a safe environment for children, and enhance child development. Data on states using PSSF funds for home visitation is not available. Federal initiatives are focused on improving coordination among early childhood programs and services. Several federal initiatives have been established to improve coordination among early childhood health, education, and social services programs, including the requirement for governors to establish State Advisory Councils on Early Childhood Education and Care. These councils aim to enhance collaboration across critical early childhood programs within each state. The curr_chunk focuses on conducting a needs assessment and developing recommendations for improving early childhood education and care programs. It includes identifying opportunities for collaboration, increasing children's participation in existing programs, establishing a unified data collection system, creating a professional development plan, assessing higher education institutions, and recommending improvements in early learning standards. The Head Start Act mandates governors to designate a council for these purposes. The Head Start Act requires governors to designate a council for the State Advisory Council and coordinate its activities. States can receive one-time start-up grants of $500,000 or more for early childhood education. Funding of $100 million was available in FY2009, with a 70% match required from grantees. The Office of Head Start administers all Head Start activities, including State Advisory Councils. Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems are funded through competitive grants to states to ensure school readiness. Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS) are funded through competitive grants to states to ensure school readiness by creating a seamless system of early childhood services. The five core areas include access to health care, socio-emotional development services, early care and learning programs, parenting education, and family support services. This initiative is supported by Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funding and was first funded in FY2003. States receiving ECCS grants are focusing on early care and learning policies, with an emphasis on strategies promoting health, mental health, and family support. Home visiting is a key family support strategy aligned with the initiative's school readiness goal. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau announced funding in FY2009 to support the integration of ECCS with other programs like Project LAUNCH and the Administration for Children and Families Home. Project LAUNCH provides competitive grants for states and tribes to promote children's wellness from birth to age eight. Grantees support evidence-based initiatives, including home visitation models like Parents as Teachers and Healthy Steps. The Baby University Nurse Home Visiting Program, First Born Home Visiting Program, Safe Care, and Touchpoints trained visitors provide services to at-risk infants and parents. Grantees also offer parent training, family strengthening programs, developmental assessments, mental health, and physical health programs. Grantees are required to create a State Council on Young Child Wellness and collaborate with public agencies. Initial funding was provided under the Public Health Service Act for FY2008 and FY2009. The initiative under the Public Health Service Act supports 25 grantees, mainly state health departments, with funding provided by Congress. The program is administered by the Center for Mental Health Services within HHS. States are required to establish Interagency Coordinating Councils to advise on the implementation of the Part C program. Governors appoint members to the council, including various early childhood stakeholders. State councils for early childhood stakeholders must include at least 20% parents of children with disabilities. They meet quarterly and advise on resources for early intervention programs, appropriate services for children up to age five, and integration of services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. State councils for early childhood stakeholders must include parents of children with disabilities. They advise on resources for early intervention programs and prepare annual reports on the state's programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities."
