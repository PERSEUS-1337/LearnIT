The \"Workforce Fairness and Tax Relief Act of 2003\" allows states with approved unemployment compensation laws to enter agreements with the Secretary of Labor for special unemployment assistance in qualified worker training programs. States can terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. A qualified worker training program is defined as a program meeting specific requirements. Special unemployment assistance is available for individuals participating in qualified worker training programs. The assistance is payable in the same amount and under the same conditions as regular compensation, with exceptions such as not needing to meet certain work availability requirements. Assistance ends after 12 months from the individual's benefit year, and they are considered unemployed for federal and state law purposes. Individuals may receive special unemployment assistance if they have exhausted all rights to regular and extended compensation under State law and have no rights to compensation for a week under any unemployment compensation law. Special unemployment assistance may be available to individuals who were terminated due to a plant closure or are identified as long-term unemployed with limited job opportunities in their area. Individuals eligible for special unemployment assistance must have been terminated due to a plant closure or be long-term unemployed with limited job opportunities. They must also meet specific criteria and actively participate in approved training activities for suitable reemployment as determined by the Secretary. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO STATES HAVING AGREEMENTS. Payments to states with agreements under this Act will receive an amount equal to a percentage of covered costs for qualified worker training programs. The applicable percentage starts at 100% for the first 3 years and then decreases to 50% annually. Covered costs include special unemployment assistance. The Secretary determines the amount of special unemployment assistance paid under the program and necessary for its administration. Payments to states under the Act can be made in advance or as reimbursement based on estimated entitlements for each month. Estimates may be adjusted based on past discrepancies. Estimates for payments under the program can be based on statistical, sampling, or other agreed methods between the Secretary and the State agency. SEC. 4. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Payments to States under section 3 will be made as certified by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State.
