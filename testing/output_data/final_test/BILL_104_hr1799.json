    "content": "The text chunk discusses the addition of a new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to the Environmental Remediation Tax Credit. It includes sections on the amount of the credit, designation of eligible states, allocation of credit limits, and definitions and special rules. The environmental remediation credit is 40% of costs incurred by the taxpayer for remediation of a contaminated site with an approved plan. The credit cannot exceed the allocated amount under section 54B for the site. The remediation plan must be completed as specified. The environmental remediation credit requires certification from the EPA for the completion of the remediation plan, and the credit is spread out over a 5-year period. If the taxpayer determines that the cost of completing the remediation plan for a contaminated site exceeds 200 percent of the estimated costs, and the State or local official agrees, the taxpayer can stop the plan and receive an environmental remediation credit for costs incurred before stopping. This credit is spread out over a 5-year period. A taxpayer is not eligible for any credit under this section for a qualified contaminated site if they were the owner or operator of a business on the site before the enactment of this subpart, arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials at the site, accepted hazardous materials for transport to the site, or are related to a taxpayer meeting these criteria. For the environmental remediation credit program, a qualified contaminated site is defined as any contaminated site within a State designated under section 54A(a). State or local government agencies can administer the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency for such sites. \"Section 54A designates eligible states for the environmental remediation credit program.\" The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development designates States for participation in the environmental remediation credit program based on eligibility requirements, including the submission of an application and establishment of an environmental credit remediation program with assessment procedures and a credit allocation plan. The environmental remediation credit program requires States to have a credit allocation plan with selection criteria, provision for non-Federal contributions, and a designated State official for administration. Selection criteria include the condition of the contaminated site. The environmental remediation credit program requires contaminated sites to be unused for at least 1 year before participation, with a strong likelihood of redevelopment for industrial or commercial use leading to job creation and tax base expansion. Completion of remediation and redevelopment within a reasonable timeframe is expected. SEC. 54B. ALLOCATION OF CREDIT LIMITS. There is an overall credit limitation of $200,000,000 for each calendar year after 1995. States can use their portion of the limitation to allocate environmental remediation credit amounts to contaminated sites. SEC. 54C. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. The term 'contaminated site' refers to sites with environmental conditions like release of hazardous substances, storage tanks with dangerous substances, or illegal waste disposal. Hazardous substances are defined by specific environmental laws. Environmental remediation under this subpart includes removal or remediation activities according to an approved plan, restoration of natural resources, and mitigation of losses. Certain materials like petroleum, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, and urea formaldehyde foam insulation are considered hazardous substances. The qualified contaminated site may incur costs for health assessments, environmental audits, off-site contamination remediation, and other necessary expenses related to environmental conditions. The basis of the site is reduced by any credits received under this subpart. Related persons are treated as such if they are connected in any way. The environmental remediation credit is added to the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. There is a limitation on carrying back the environmental remediation credit before the effective date. Related persons are treated as such if they are connected in any way. The environmental remediation credit under section 54 can be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of section 54. Additionally, a deduction for the unused credit is allowed under section 196 of the Code. A clerical amendment is made to include the environmental remediation credit in the table of subparts for part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments for tax-exempt financing of environmental remediation of qualified contaminated sites will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. The amendment allows for tax-exempt financing of environmental remediation of qualified contaminated sites through qualified contaminated site remediation bonds. The amendment allows tax-exempt financing for environmental remediation of qualified contaminated sites through qualified contaminated site remediation bonds, subject to limitations on financing provided to ineligible persons. The amendment allows tax-exempt financing for environmental remediation of qualified contaminated sites through qualified contaminated site remediation bonds, subject to limitations on financing provided to ineligible persons. Eligibility for the credit under section 54 is determined based on the amount of financing provided for costs related to environmental remediation and the fair market value of the site after completion of the remediation plan. The term 'qualified contaminated site' is defined in section 54(e). Section 147(c) does not apply to qualified contaminated site remediation bonds. A penalty is imposed for failure to satisfactorily complete a remediation plan financed by such bonds, disallowing interest deductions during EPA-determined remediation periods. The remediation plan financed by qualified contaminated site remediation bonds must be satisfactorily completed to avoid penalties and disallowance of interest deductions during EPA-determined remediation periods. Amendments are made to the section heading and table of sections to include \"qualified contaminated site remediation bond.\""
