    "content": "In mid-November 2010, traditional chiefs in Ghana's western region petitioned for 10% of national oil revenues to be allocated to a development fund. President John Atta Mills appointed a National Gas Development Task Force to oversee the gas commercialization project, crucial for the country's oil and gas production. The Ghanaian parliament was considering passing two oil sector bills to manage petroleum revenue and exploration. The government in Ghana has drafted two bills, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, 2010, and the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, 2010, to govern the country's growing oil and gas sector. There is internal parliamentary disagreement over the revenue management bill, potentially delaying its passage. In October 2010, former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings was appointed as the African Union (AU) envoy for Somalia. President Obama hosted a group of civil society leaders from sub-Saharan Africa in August 2010. In June 2010, United Airlines started direct flight service from the United States to Ghana, strengthening U.S.-Ghanaian relations. Ghana is considered a key U.S. partner in the region due to its successful transition to democracy and economic growth despite widespread poverty. President Obama's visit in 2009 and former President Bush's visit in 2008 highlighted this partnership. Ghana has experienced substantial economic gains despite widespread poverty rates. It is praised for its stability and role in mediating conflicts in West Africa. The country contributes troops to international peacekeeping operations and receives U.S. training for deployments. Ghana's recent discovery of crude reserves has also garnered attention. Ghana's recent discovery of sizable crude oil reserves has drawn attention for its potential to boost national income and development. However, like other oil-rich developing countries, Ghana may face challenges in governance and resource management. The country also faces issues with illicit narcotics trafficking, particularly cocaine being transported from South America to Europe via West Africa. This has led to increased cooperation between the U.S. and Ghana in countering such trafficking. President Barack Obama visited Ghana in 2009, making it the earliest visit to sub-Saharan Africa by any U.S. President in his first year in office. President Obama's 2009 visit to Ghana highlighted the country as a trusted partner in sub-Saharan Africa and emphasized the importance of free and fair elections, good governance, and civil society in promoting development. The trip underscored the U.S.'s commitment to investing in Africa's development and recognized Africa as a crucial part of the interconnected world. Obama stated that the visit signaled ongoing U.S. interest in Africa's security, economy, and social and political development. President Obama highlighted Ghana's successes in sustaining democracy, openness, and economic growth during his visit. He emphasized Ghana as a model for success in Africa and expressed a commitment to strengthening the friendship between the United States and Ghana. Additionally, he mentioned U.S. investments in maternal health in Africa and his personal connection to the continent. During his visit to Ghana, President Obama acknowledged the country's success in democracy and economic growth. He also visited Cape Coast Castle, reflecting on the impact of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the beginning of the African American experience. Obama emphasized the capacity for human evil and the significance of returning with his family to this historical site. President Obama's trip to Ghana, following successful elections, highlighted the country's commitment to democracy. Ghana's democratic leadership in Africa was praised amidst troubling coups in other nations. The visit symbolized hope in overcoming historical challenges. The visit by President Obama to Ghana after successful elections showcased the country's democratic progress and contrasted with anti-democratic trends in Africa. Ghana's transfer of power between political parties marked a significant milestone in its democratic journey. The president's trip to Ghana included a speech to the Ghanaian parliament focusing on democracy, good governance, and development in Africa. The speech emphasized the need for strong institutions, good governance, anti-corruption efforts, and transparency. President Obama emphasized the importance of anti-corruption efforts, national self-determination, and transparency in achieving socio-economic and political development in Ghana. He also highlighted the potential of oil and energy resources for development, and his Administration's focus on U.S. assistance in education, healthcare, and trade capacity-building in Africa. Ms. Gavin characterized the Ghana visit as intentional to highlight Africa's integration into the Administration's foreign policy strategy. African voices were emphasized in global discussions on key issues, with a focus on economic resilience, climate change, and good governance. President Mills took office on January 7, 2009, succeeding former. President Mills succeeded former President Kufuor in 2009, with a focus on stabilizing the economy by controlling the exchange rate, fiscal spending, and inflation. Despite challenges like the global recession and weakening commodity prices, there was a decline in imports and growth in exports. President Mills, in 2009, pledged to fulfill key policy goals outlined in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party election platform. This includes good governance, anti-corruption efforts, security force capacity building, increasing female representation in government, economic growth through business-friendly policies, and investment in health and education sectors. President Mills emphasized key policy goals in his 2010 state of the nation address, focusing on agricultural production, investments in health and education, poverty reduction programs, and infrastructure development. Ghana's 2008 elections resulted in a parliamentary majority for the NDC and a narrow presidential victory for John Atta Mills. His election was seen as a test of democratization in Africa following challenges in other countries. The 2008 election in Ghana marked the country's progress towards democracy after a transition from \"no-party\" rule in 1992. President Kufuor of the NPP stepped down after serving two terms, leading to John Atta Mills taking office in 2009. Mills succeeded Kufuor after a peaceful election in 2008, which followed previous electoral contests between the two candidates. The 2008 election campaign in Ghana was largely peaceful, with key issues including dissatisfaction over shortages and rising prices. Economic expansion and oil revenue favored the NPP, while internal divisions affected the NDC. Mills emerged as the NDC presidential candidate without opposition, despite previous losses. Former Foreign Affairs Minister Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo won the NPP nomination in the first round of voting, surprising some observers. The NPP nomination process drew criticism for the high nomination fee. Voting on December 7 was free, open, and transparent, with minor technical exceptions. Key problems highlighted included temporary shortages of voting. Key problems highlighted during the vote included temporary shortages of voting materials at some polling places and minor allegations of irregularities in two constituencies. Observers also raised concerns about potential serious issues such as an inflated voters' register, high turnout in some areas, malpractices, electoral fraud, and intimidation of party poll observers. Additionally, there were reports of politically motivated efforts to disenfranchise selected voters through the selective closure of Ghana's borders. Despite these challenges, many attribute the overall success of the election to adherence to democratic processes. The election's success is attributed to adherence to the rule of law and public support, despite challenges like shortages of voting materials and allegations of irregularities. Efforts to legally challenge the process were abandoned after a call for respect of results. John Mills of the NDC won almost 48% of votes, while Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the NPP won just over 49%. In the runoff election between Mills and Akufo-Addo, Mills initially had a 50.1% vote share while Akufo-Addo had 49.9%, leading to a close race. Due to incorrect allocations of voting materials in Tain District, a repeat of runoff balloting was ordered, giving the district's voters the potential power to decide the election outcome. After a close runoff election between Mills and Akufo-Addo, Mills emerged as the winner with a 50.23% vote share. Kufuor, a former president, was ineligible to run in 2008 due to term limits. In previous elections, Kufuor had won in 2000 and 2004, with the latter marred by limited violence. The New Patriotic Party (NPP) increased its legislative margin in parliamentary elections. In the 2008 elections, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) won 128 seats, increasing its legislative margin by 26%, while the NDC won 94 seats. Kufuor's reelection in 2004 marked Ghana's fourth consecutive democratic election, showing a transition to democratic rule since 1992. The PNDC coup in Ghana followed years of military-dominated governments after Kwame Nkrumah was ousted in 1966. Nkrumah led Ghana to independence in 1957 and was known for advocating African unity and socialism. Kufuor's first-term agenda focused on national unity, fighting corruption, and reviving the economy, which faced challenges like flat growth, currency deflation, and high inflation. President Kufuor tackled economic challenges in Ghana by privatizing state firms, diversifying the economy, and implementing fiscal austerity policies. His administration achieved goals such as utility deregulation and increased economic growth. Ghana's GDP grew steadily, reaching $22.77 billion in 2011. Ghana's economy has shown significant growth, with export earnings increasing from $5.3 billion in 2008 to an estimated $7.3 billion in 2010. The discovery of offshore oil reserves, particularly the Jubilee field, has boosted future export earnings. The economy is projected to rise to $17.88 billion in 2010 and $22.77 billion in 2011, driven by rising commodity prices and growth in tourism. Oil production is expected to contribute significantly to export earnings from 2011 to 2016. Ghana's economy has shown significant growth, with export earnings increasing. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a growth rate of 4.7% in 2010 and a sharp rise to 14% in 2011, driven by investment in the oil sector. Domestic savings rates are rising, and expatriate remittances have boosted growth, notably in construction. The Ghana Stock Exchange has boomed, and Ghana received its first sovereign credit rating in 2003. Agriculture remains important for the domestic economy. Ghana's economy is growing rapidly, with services and extractive industries like mining and oil sectors expanding. Agriculture employs around 60% of workers but contributes only 33% to GDP. Services, including IT and finance, now contribute 42% to GDP. The gold mining sector has also seen substantial growth, providing around 25% of GDP. Gold exports make up nearly 45% of annual GDP. Ghana's economy heavily relies on gold exports, accounting for nearly 45% of annual GDP in 2008. The government supports small-scale sectors through micro-loans and business-friendly policies. Ghana received debt relief under various initiatives, leading to additional international financial assistance. The World Bank supports Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction efforts. The World Bank supports Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II) with about $3.5 billion. Ghana was ranked third among global \"Top Reformers\" for improvements in public service, contract mediation, and business start-ups. Despite economic success, poverty remains widespread, especially in rural areas. Ghanaians have better access to public goods compared to surrounding countries. In 2006, 39.2% of rural Ghanaians lived below the national poverty line, compared to 10.8% of urbanites. Nearly 54% of Ghanaians lived on $2 or less a day. Poverty rates are slowly declining, with average annual income growing from $310 in 2003 to $700 in 2009. Social indicators have improved, but there are mixed assessments on achieving U.N. Millennium Development Goals. Electricity is crucial for economic development, but insufficient supply and outages have been recurring issues, notably in 2007 due to low water levels in Lake Volta. Ghana has been facing challenges with electricity supply due to low water levels in Lake Volta in 2007. The government has been working on various national and international power projects to address the issue. New projects involving hydroelectric, gas-fired, and wind technologies are in progress to meet the rising demand for electricity. Ghana produces more power than it consumes and plans to increase its generation capacity by adding thermal projects. This will enable Ghana to become a major regional electricity exporter. Efforts to increase electrical production capacity in Ghana have been ongoing, with projects including a major transmission line to Burkina Faso and extending power to under-served areas in northern Ghana. The West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) project, backed by the U.S., aims to bring natural gas from Nigeria to Ghana and its eastern neighbors. Despite facing delays, the first gas reached Ghana in late 2008, with regular commercial deliveries starting in August 2010. Sectoral reforms have accompanied the increase in production capacity, with public electrical and water rate pricing structures sharply increased in late May 2010. The government committee reduced electricity rate hikes by 10% after public protests. Ghana struggles with oil refining due to debt at Tema Oil Refinery. Short-term oil credit supply agreements with Libya, Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea have been made. Plans for a new refinery are being negotiated. The Kufuor administration in Ghana attributed economic success to fiscal discipline, improved revenue collection, and liberal economic reforms. Investments were made in education, healthcare, communications, and infrastructure to improve living standards. The government also addressed challenges related to aging infrastructure and rising public spending. The Kufuor Administration in Ghana aimed to address socio-economic and regulatory challenges related to an anticipated increase in oil earnings. Criticized for lack of transparency in oil revenue commitments and failure to enact energy sector legal reforms, they established a task force to ensure funds were used for economic diversification and to develop the oil sector. Plans were made for a national stabilization fund to minimize economic shocks from dependence on cocoa, gold, timber, and oil exports. The Mills Administration continued similar economic and policy goals but focused more on a state-centric growth strategy funded by the energy sector for industrial development. The Mills administration in Ghana is implementing a state-centric growth strategy funded by the energy sector, focusing on investments in human resource development, infrastructure, oil and gas sectors, and modernizing agriculture. Plans include building a Deep Sea Port, rehabilitating the Western railway corridor, and developing industries such as aluminum, petrochemical, fertilizer, salt-based chemicals, and consumer products using oil and gas revenues. The Ghanaian government under President Mills is diversifying the economy by investing in industries like iron and steel, caustic soda, and consumer products. The goal is to reduce dependence on traditional exports like cocoa, gold, and timber by 2016. Other key policy goals include increasing food security, supporting fishermen, and establishing an Agricultural Development and Investment Fund. The overall strategy aims to create jobs, improve incomes, and raise living standards for Ghanaians. Ghana's government under President Mills aims to diversify the economy by investing in various industries and achieving middle-income status. Key policy goals include education, health, water, and housing investments, as well as developing oil and gas reserves to become a top producer. Production is set to begin in late 2010, with potential for increased output depending on further field development. Ghana's largest oil reserve is in the Jubilee field, with estimated proven reserves of 278 million barrels of oil. However, newer assessments suggest the reserve could be larger, with a mid-point estimate of 490 million barrels. Tullow Oil, the operator of the field, indicated in July 2010 that the reserve is even larger than previously thought. Tullow estimates that the Jubilee reserve holds between 600 MMBO (P90) and 1,500 MMBO (P10) with significant upside potential. Other fields in the Deepwater Tano block, like Tweneboa, could contain between 100 MMBO (P90) and 1,400 MMBO (P10). Ghana's gross resource potential is estimated at 4.5 billion barrels, with at least 3 billion barrels of reserves identified so far. Multiple blocks are under exploration with potentially large discoveries. Kosmos Energy's optimistic claims suggest one billion barrels of recoverable oil near Jubilee, with potential for over 10 billion barrels. Most of Ghana's oil fields also contain natural gas condensate. Jubilee's gas-to-oil ratio is estimated at 1,100 to 1,200 standard cubic feet per barrel. Production at Jubilee is set to start in late 2010 under a $3.3-3.4 billion Phase 1 Development Plan focusing on extraction from a core area known as the Jubilee Unit Area. The Jubilee field is set to be commercially tapped with a dedicated FPSO vessel in place. Production infrastructure is 92% complete, with projections of 120,000 barrels of oil per day in Phase 1, potentially doubling to 240,000 barrels per day in Phase 2. Gas production is expected to peak at 120-140 MMSCFD. Plans for gas usage depend on oil extraction, with some gas to be reinjected for oil pressure and production. The GNPC plans to boost oil pressure and production in the field, produce liquid natural gas for sale, and deliver \"dry\" gas to domestic electricity plants. They aim for national energy self-sufficiency, avoid gas flaring, and construct gas pipelines capable of transporting 300 MMSCFD of gas. Additionally, the Ghanaian government is negotiating with China Tianchen Chemical Engineering Corporation to build a $1.8 billion oil refinery with a daily capacity of 120,000 barrels, allowing Ghana to produce double its daily consumption. The development of Jubilee in Ghana aims to increase oil production significantly, potentially doubling the country's daily consumption. However, controversies surrounding Kosmos Energy's entry into the sector and efforts to sell its stake in Jubilee have strained U.S.-Ghanaian relations. The NDC government has raised concerns about the E.O. Group's involvement, fearing political implications and questioning their motives. Ghana's 2008 election is seen as close to the NPP, with the NDC fearing that the E.O. Group may support the NPP in the 2012 election using oil proceeds. Tensions exist between Kosmos and the Ghanaian government, particularly the GNPC. Kosmos Energy LLC, based in Dallas, owns Kosmos Energy Ghana HC, with major ownership by U.S. private equity firms. Loans from the IFC and AFC support Kosmos Energy's activities in Ghana. Kosmos Energy LLC planned to remain active in Ghana despite a failed attempt to sell its oil rights in 2010. The firm received $350 million in debt to fund activities in the Jubilee field. Controversy surrounded allegations of political connections facilitating favorable terms for Kosmos in the Ghanaian oil sector. Ghanaian oil officials sought more favorable terms for themselves and Kosmos through a deal with the E.O. Group. The E.O. Group secured a 3.5% share of a block worth $200 million by allowing Kosmos to finance exploration costs. The group's principals, George Yaw Owusu and Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei, have ties to the NPP and former President Kufuor. Investigations have focused on how the E.O. Group obtained its share and its relationship with Kosmos. Investigations into the relationship between Kosmos and the E.O. Group have raised concerns about possible violations of corporate and anti-corruption laws in Ghana. The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice are looking into financial loss to the state, money laundering, and false declarations. Questions have been raised about the preferential fiscal terms secured by Kosmos compared to other companies in the oil industry. Additionally, a due diligence report by the Risk Advisory Group commissioned by Anadarko is also part of the probe. An intelligence, investigations, and security company commissioned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation to investigate Kosmos's operations in Ghana and the E.O. Group for potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The U.S. Department of Justice conducted its own investigation and found no evidence of breaches. Both Kosmos and the E.O. Group maintain they have always complied with the law. Kosmos has faced controversies including fines for oil drilling pollution incidents, issues with contracting for production operations, and a failed attempt to sell its stake in Ghana to Exxon Mobil. The firm has been accused of misconduct and character assassination, but maintains its innocence. The Kosmos-Exxon Mobil deal in Ghana faced challenges due to GNPC's refusal to recognize the sale agreement, attracting attention from Chinese investors and other major oil firms interested in Ghana's oil resources. Up to 50 firms may be interested in buying stakes in Ghana's oil sector. Several firms entered bid talks with the GNPC in Ghana's oil sector, despite warnings from ExxonMobil's lawyers. CNOOC was in advanced talks to challenge ExxonMobil's offer for the Kosmos stake, potentially involving amounts between $3 and $5 billion plus a $2 billion concessionary loan to the government. The CNOOC talks followed an agreement to provide financial and technical support to the GNPC. In late October 2009, Sinopec made an offer to jointly bid with GNPC for Kosmos's oil stake, but the bid was not accepted. In December 2009, GNPC secured a $3 billion loan from China Development Bank to finance its share of Jubilee field development costs. CNOOC later joined with GNPC in October 2010 to submit a $5 billion bid for Ghana's oil sector. In October 2010, CNOOC partnered with GNPC to bid $5 billion for Kosmos's Ghanaian assets, which was rejected. Speculation arose that Kosmos's assets could be worth more than $5 billion based on research reports. Ongoing evaluations by Tullow and other firms suggest that the value of Kosmos's assets may increase. Kosmos is considering selling its assets before Jubilee production starts to avoid capital gains tax losses. They are also exploring an initial public offering to attract higher bids and satisfy private equity backers. GNPC has incentives for a lower price to reduce liabilities for additional petroleum tax and make a potential buyout less costly for Ghana. The Ghanaian government's public spending has increased in anticipation of oil revenues, with a large wage hike for the public sector and pay raises for members of parliament. Foreign debt borrowing has also risen, raising concerns after a lower projection for future oil earnings by the IMF. Deals with South Korea and China for housing and loans have been agreed upon, sparking some warnings. The Ghanaian government has secured a $15 billion loan package from Chinese enterprises. However, caution is advised against overestimating the potential value of oil and gas revenues. The Revenue Watch Institute highlights that oil revenues are expected to average $1 billion per year from 2011 to 2029, representing less than the current annual budget deficit and less than $50 per capita. It is emphasized that oil revenue should not be the sole source of financing for Ghana's public investment strategy. Ghana's accountability and efficacy in managing public benefits from revenue streams is a key issue. The country is an EITI signatory, with the GHEITI overseeing the implementation. Initially focused on the mining sector, Ghana's EITI program has faced criticism for its limited scope. In 2003, Ghana's EITI program was limited to the mining sector. Critics questioned this, as 'extractive industries' commonly refer to oil/gas and mining. Positive reforms in mining led to calls for expansion to oil/gas sectors. In 2010, the GHEITI NSC was restructured to include oil/gas representatives. Ghana's parliament is considering oil sector bills. The Ghanaian government is fast-tracking the passage of two oil sector bills, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, 2010, and the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, 2010. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of environmental oversight and oil spill response capacity in Ghana, which may not be in place before 2012. The Ghanaian government asserts it has capabilities in place to address environmental threats from oil production, despite concerns raised about lack of oversight and spill response capacity. Public sector bribery is common, with weak anti-corruption law enforcement. Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2009 shows high levels of corruption reported by Ghanaian respondents. According to Transparency International, Ghana ranks 62nd out of 178 countries in corruption. President Mills aims to reduce corruption by strengthening anti-corruption agencies and imposing harsh penalties. Petty corruption is widespread in the police force, with over 90% of Ghanaians reporting being asked for bribes. The Ghanaian government is making efforts to improve anti-corruption agencies, enforce the Whistleblower's Act, prosecute corruption, and conduct an education campaign against corruption. Despite previous initiatives, corruption remains a problem in Ghana. Ghana faces challenges in business environment, education, and healthcare. Drug trafficking poses a threat to stability in West Africa, with Ghana being used as a transshipment point for cocaine from Latin America to Europe. President Obama highlighted this issue during his visit in 2009. Several large cocaine shipments have been intercepted in Ghana since 2003. Since 2003, there have been numerous cocaine shipments intercepted in Ghana, with a decline in seizures in recent years. The decrease in drug interceptions may suggest a reduction in trafficking threats, possibly due to traffickers using alternative routes or improved law enforcement efforts. Ghana's ties to international drug trafficking have been indicated by periodic incidents beyond just cocaine seizures. There have been indications of Ghanaian ties to international drug trafficking, with periodic arrests of Ghanaians in other countries. An incident involved the death of suspected Ghanaian smugglers in Benin before a cocaine seizure in 2007. There were reports of wealthy Latin Americans with drug ties entering Ghana. South American traffickers rely on local partners to avoid arrest in Ghana. Several high-profile cocaine-corruption cases involving government officials in Ghana have occurred, with suspected large-scale cocaine shipments disappearing with alleged official connivance. Ghana has been a departure point for human drug couriers, known as mules, who transport drugs on commercial flights. Despite being a transit point, there have been fewer drug arrests, and airport screening has improved with U.S. and UK assistance. President Mills acknowledged the drug threat in February 2010. In February 2010, President Mills recognized the threat of drug trafficking in Ghana. The country collaborates with the United States and other international partners on counternarcotics efforts. However, corruption and limited resources hinder interdiction operations. While low-level traffickers are arrested, high-level drug barons remain elusive. Ghana-U.S. law enforcement cooperation was strong in 2009, with the DEA opening an office in Accra. Challenges persist in coordinating Ghanaian law enforcement agencies. The United States has provided airport scanners to combat air courier smuggling. The U.S. military's Africa Command and State Department have funded the construction of facilities and provided training in Ghana to combat drug trafficking. The DEA opened a regional office in Ghana and established a vetted police unit to tackle narcotics. The program has received strong support from the government. The DEA in Ghana has strong support from the government and works closely with the Narcotics Control Board. U.S.-Ghanaian cooperation led to the extradition of three West Africans on narco-terrorism charges, involving Al Qaeda associates transporting cocaine for FARC with Al Qaeda's assistance. The indictment alleges that the indictees' actions would benefit Al Qaeda and AQIM, designated as FTOs by the State Department. This is the first known use of U.S. Statute 21 U.S.C. 960a to prosecute drug trafficking in support of terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigerian and Ghanaian trafficking organizations smuggle heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan to the United States. DEA investigations disrupted an Afghanistan-based drug trafficking organization's heroin smuggling route through West Africa. Ghana assisted in extraditing drug trafficking suspects to the United States and is actively involved in continental and sub-regional affairs, with former president Jerry Rawlings appointed as the African Union envoy for Somalia in October 2010. Ghana's involvement in continental and sub-regional affairs includes former president Jerry Rawlings serving as the African Union envoy for Somalia. The country has also played a role in extraditing drug trafficking suspects to the United States. Ghana has pursued economic cooperation with China, increasing exports of manganese and cocoa. Ghana has increased exports to China, particularly manganese and cocoa, and maintains trade ties with European countries. It is also strengthening relations with Korea and Brazil, securing naval vessels from China, Germany, and Korea. Ghana has mediated in crises in Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, and Togo, and contributed to regional peacekeeping missions. Relations with Gambia improved after compensation was agreed upon for Ghanaian victims. Ghana's close ties with former Togolese president may have influenced its stance on Togo's leadership succession crisis. Ghana contributes troops to U.N. peacekeeping operations and hosts the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre. The country has close relations with the United States and has a professional military. Ghana has also mediated in regional crises and maintains trade ties with various countries. The Obama Administration views Ghana as a model for good governance and development in Africa, a trusted partner of the United States, and a leader in promoting peaceful conflict resolution. The strong partnership is due to Ghana's stable democracy, active civil society, apolitical military, and good human rights record. The United States and Ghana have signed three bilateral trade and investment agreements. Ghana and the United States have signed three bilateral trade and investment agreements, including an OPIC Investment Incentive Agreement, a TIFA, and an Open Skies aviation agreement. Ghana is a significant buyer of U.S. goods in Africa, eligible for AGOA benefits, but AGOA exports have declined from 32% to 1% of total exports to the U.S. Major U.S. investors in Ghana include Chevron West Africa Gas Ltd. Major U.S. investors in Ghana include Chevron West Africa Gas Ltd., Kosmos Energy, Anadarko, Hess, Vanco, Newmont Mining, Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, and Affiliated Computer Services. The Obama Administration sees Ghana as an important regional ally but acknowledges challenges such as weak institutions, corruption, narcotics trafficking, and healthcare struggles. HIV infects almost 20,000 people in Ghana. There has been no improvement in maternal and infant mortality rates in Ghana. HIV infects almost 20,000 people annually. U.S. assistance aims to address challenges in education, transparency in elections, decentralization efforts, citizen participation in governance, anti-corruption reform, and civil society capacity building in Ghana. The government in Ghana has supported anti-corruption reform and efforts to strengthen governance institutions. Despite some progress, significant challenges remain, including weak governance institutions and corruption. Local governance challenges include improving service delivery, increasing public participation, and managing natural resources transparently. The appointment of regional and local officials by the president hinders accountability. The appointment of regional and local government officials by the president exacerbates accountability challenges in Ghana, especially in villages and urban areas where people earn an average of $2 a day. U.S. assistance aims to support decentralization, improve social service delivery, combat corruption, and enhance civil society oversight, with a focus on health sector assistance targeting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Obama Administration's FY2011 CBJ assistance plan for Ghana focuses on increasing health services delivery, particularly in maternal health, child survival, and malnutrition. USAID support will continue in areas such as TB prevention, improved quality health services, and access to family planning services. Despite a 28% decrease in infant and child mortality, FY2011 USAID assistance will target technical and direct project support. USAID assistance in FY2011 for Ghana will focus on improving maternal and child health care through training and supervision, building local management capacity, and promoting accountability in underserved areas. Other key health-related efforts include capacity building for health systems management, public health education, parental child nutrition training, and access to family planning information and services. PMI assistance will also prioritize scaling up efforts in the country. The Obama Administration plans to provide Ghana with significant support for building partnerships in coordination with PEPFAR, focusing on strengthening integrated prevention, care, and treatment programs. U.S. basic education assistance aims to boost junior secondary school enrollment, increase English language instruction, literacy education, and improve education system management. Health and education investments in water and sanitation are also planned. In Ghana, the U.S. plans to provide assistance for improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities for schools, clinics, and households. Key challenges to economic growth include limited access to agricultural markets, low farm production rates, inadequate physical infrastructure, and lack of competitiveness in the agro-processing industry. Key challenges in Ghana include limited access to agricultural markets, low farm production rates, insecurity in land tenure, lack of technical graduates, and over-exploitation of fishery resources. USAID programs focus on boosting agricultural marketing, small business capacity building, and market liberalization reforms to strengthen the private sector and connect small producers with international markets. Policy reforms aim to support macro-economic stability, liberalize agricultural input markets, and enhance policy-making capacities in various sectors. The FY2011 Development Assistance plans in Ghana focus on increasing agricultural productivity through the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI). Key methods include improving trade networks, promoting market-based agricultural practices, increasing participation of the very poor in rural growth, and enhancing the financial sector for agro-enterprises. GHFSI activities are collaborative and aim to coordinate with Ghana's implementation of the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture. The collaboration between Ghana and the U.S. government aims to increase agricultural productivity and production through involvement of various private companies, NGOs, farmer organizations, and research institutions. The focus is on ensuring domestic food security, access, and supplying markets in food insecure countries. Support also includes coastal and fisheries resource management, freshwater fish aquaculture, climate-change adaptation, and alternative energy access. USAID supports Ghana's climate-change adaptation efforts, alternative energy access, business association and trade unions capabilities, horticultural export industry expansion, and land tenure reform. Ghanaians benefit from trade and export-related technical assistance through the AGCI Trade Hub in Ghana. Limited funds support peace, security, and law enforcement capacity-building. In addition to capacity building assistance for peace, security, and law enforcement, U.S. counternarcotics assistance in Ghana focuses on combating cocaine transshipment and ensuring border control to prevent illicit shipments to the United States. DEA is involved in pursuing counternarcotics efforts, with support from the State Department's INL bureau. Assistance in FY2011 aims to enhance counternarcotics efforts and judicial cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. embassy in Accra received funds in FY2010 to support skills-building, mentoring, and training for evidence collection and case presentation in criminal cases like drug trafficking and money laundering. The International Military Education and Training program in Ghana focuses on maritime security, peacekeeping operations, and defense resource management. Ghana also received peacekeeper training under the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program. In FY2010, FMF assistance supports Ghana's efforts to enhance regional stability and peacekeeping roles by purchasing equipment and modernizing rifles. The FY2011 CBJ aims to standardize weapons for Ghana's military to streamline training and maintenance. DoD has also provided AIS equipment and fast patrol support. The DoD has provided AIS equipment and fast patrol boats to Ghana as part of efforts to improve maritime security in West Africa.

Two key energy sector regulatory bills were under consideration by the Ghanaian parliament in late 2010. The Mills government in Ghana received praise for releasing a draft of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act before public consultations. The bill includes detailed controls over oil revenue, authorities for revenue management, and transparency measures. Civil society observers commend these provisions but suggest further strengthening the bill. The Petroleum Revenue Management Act in Ghana is being strengthened by including measures such as requiring additional disclosures, mandating public dissemination of oil and gas agreements, and establishing a detailed development plan aligned with fiscal frameworks. Concerns have been raised about proposed amendments that could impact public oversight by the Public Interest and Accountability Committee. The Danquah Institute reports on a controversial amendment to the Petroleum Revenue Management bill in Ghana, allowing the government to use petroleum reserves as loan collateral. The Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, 2010 has faced criticism for lack of transparency, competitive bidding process, and strong powers delegated to the Minister of Energy. The delegation of strong powers to the Minister of Energy in the Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, 2010 is criticized for lacking transparency and competitive bidding processes. Concerns include the absence of designated no exploration zones to protect livelihoods, the lack of provisions for an oil spill response fund, and calls for a moratorium on new oil exploration licenses. The U.S.-based Revenue Watch Institute has also raised concerns about the bill deviating from international practices. The bill deviates from international practices in ways that could undermine sector management, limit benefits from petroleum, and hinder governance. It lacks clear rules for governmental relationships, gives broad regulatory powers to the Ministry of Energy, and poses risks such as weak oversight, confusion, delays, and corruption according to the Revenue Watch Institute. The Revenue Watch Institute criticizes the bill for granting broad discretion to the Minister of Energy in awarding contracts without competition or transparency, hindering governance and potentially leading to corruption. They call for a system that requires competition in all petroleum contract awards and enhanced transparency measures. The Revenue Watch Institute criticizes the bill for potentially undermining Ghana's reputation for transparency and good governance by granting broad discretion to the Ministry without required reporting. They suggest amending the bill to require public release of extractive industry contracts and revenue flows to advance transparency and prevent corruption. The Revenue Watch Institute criticizes the bill for lacking transparency and oversight in public revenue reporting, potentially leading to instability and unequal treatment of investors. It suggests amending the bill to ensure strong Parliamentary oversight and require public release of extractive industry contracts to prevent corruption. The Revenue Watch Institute criticizes the lack of transparency and oversight in public revenue reporting in the bill, which could lead to instability and unequal treatment of investors. It recommends amending the bill to ensure strong Parliamentary oversight and require public release of extractive industry contracts to prevent corruption. Additionally, it suggests specifying payments in law to minimize sub-optimal long-term deals for the state."
