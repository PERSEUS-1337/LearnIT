    "content": "The \"Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015\" allows for loan repayment for teachers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include sunsets for awarding funds under certain sections starting from the enactment of the Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015. The Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to include sunsets for loan forgiveness and repayment agreements for teachers. The Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015 includes provisions for loan repayment for teachers under PART J. The purpose of this section is to encourage qualified individuals to enter and continue in teaching, especially in high-need schools. Definitions include terms like 'child with a disability' and 'student loan'. The Department of Education offers a program where they repay student loans for full-time teachers in public elementary or secondary schools who are not in default on their loans. The Secretary determines a school with at least 40% of children in poverty and in a district eligible for assistance under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 specifies that a school must have at least 40% of children in poverty to be eligible for assistance under Title I. The Secretary may use the previous year's list of schools for teacher service determination if the current year's list is not available before May 1. Teachers can continue teaching in a school and remain eligible for loan cancellation even if they no longer meet the service requirements in subsequent years. On the date of enactment of the Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015, individuals in a loan repayment program may choose to continue or enter into a new program under certain conditions. The terms of loan repayment include an agreement to remain employed in the school or location for eligibility and specifying the student loan payment amount. The Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015 allows for student loan payments of $250-$400 per month for the first to sixth year of teaching, with a maximum total amount of $23,400. Individuals must remain employed in the school for eligibility. The Teacher Loan Repayment Act of 2015 allows for student loan payments by the Secretary after reaching the maximum total amount. The Secretary cannot reimburse borrowers for payments made before entering into an agreement."
