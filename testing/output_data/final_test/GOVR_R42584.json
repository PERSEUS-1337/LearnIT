President Obama prioritized HSR, with an additional $2.5 billion provided in the 2010 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act. However, no further funding has been allocated since then. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $8 billion for high speed intercity passenger rail projects, with additional funding provided in the 2010 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act. However, a recent act rescinded $400 million from prior year unobligated balances for HSR projects, with most funding being used to upgrade existing rail lines for faster passenger train speeds. Some states shelved HSR plans due to opposition to the high costs involved. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for high speed rail projects, with some projects being stopped and funds redirected to other states. Debate continues on the merits of HSR and the prospects for its development without further federal funding. Congress has long been interested in the benefits of high speed rail, with the establishment of the Metroliner in the 1960s and the transfer of ownership of the Northeast Corridor to Amtrak in the 1970s. Congress has provided significant funding for high-speed rail projects, including the Northeast Corridor Improvement Program and the purchase of new Acela trains for Amtrak. The Federal Railroad Administration reported a total of $4.17 billion allocated to high-speed rail projects between 1990 and 2007, with most funds going towards improvements on the NEC. Additionally, state and private sector efforts have been made to develop dedicated high-speed rail lines. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 further supported high-speed rail projects. In February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) allocating $8 billion for intercity passenger rail projects, including high-speed rail. Additional funding was provided for highways and discretionary grants for surface transportation projects. In March 2009, the Obama Administration proposed $1 billion annually for high-speed rail. The Obama Administration proposed $1 billion annually for high speed and intercity passenger rail projects to Congress. Congress approved $2.5 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger rail in FY2010, but no funding has been provided since then. Various congressional initiatives have supported high speed rail, including making $90 million available for maglev projects and passing the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The Obama Administration proposed $1 billion annually for high speed and intercity passenger rail projects to Congress. Congress approved $2.5 billion for high speed rail and intercity passenger rail in FY2010, but no funding has been provided since then. The Division B of P.L. 110-432 created a high speed rail development grant program with a total authorization of $1.5 billion over FY2009-FY2013. It also authorized additional funding for Amtrak to address maintenance backlog on the Northeast Corridor. The act included a provision for the U.S. Department of Transportation to seek private companies to build and operate high speed lines. The definition of high speed rail varies between the European Union and the U.S. government. The U.S. government has defined high speed rail as service competitive with air and/or auto for travel markets in the range of 100 to 500 miles. Congress has established funding programs with different speed-based definitions. FRA categorized high speed rail corridors based on top speeds, track characteristics, and service frequency. In the United States, high speed rail can range from trains reaching 90 mph on shared tracks to trains traveling over 200 mph on dedicated tracks. The term \"higher speed rail\" refers to speeds up to 150 mph on shared tracks, while \"very high speed rail\" refers to speeds over 150 mph on dedicated tracks. FRA received 45 applications from 24 states requesting $50 billion in funding for high speed and intercity passenger rail projects, with initial awards announced in January 2010. The awards for high-speed rail projects were announced on January 28, 2010, with California, Florida, Illinois, and Wisconsin receiving the largest amounts. A total of 132 applications were submitted to the FRA for the $2.5 billion allocated in FY2010, totaling $8.8 billion. Some newly elected governors decided not to pursue the rail improvements, leading to reallocation of funds to other projects. Investments in high-speed rail projects are concentrated in six corridors, with plans to upgrade existing lines in five of them. The sixth corridor, Los Angeles-San Francisco, will have a new very high-speed rail line. The remaining funding is allocated to various smaller projects nationwide. Some corridors have received discretionary grants from the TIGER program, which funds a range of transportation projects. The TIGER program, initially part of ARRA, has been funded in subsequent appropriations bills. As of December 2013, 99% of high-speed rail funding since FY2009 had been obligated, with only 17% spent. Progress on HSR projects in Chicago-St. Louis and Los Angeles-San Francisco corridors shows challenges in upgrading existing lines for faster service. The Chicago-St. Louis route, owned by four freight railroads, is being upgraded to increase passenger train speeds from 79 mph to 110 mph. Illinois secured $1.1 billion in ARRA funding to improve 220 miles of the line from St. Louis to Dwight, IL, and buy new locomotives and rail cars. Trip times are estimated to reduce to between 4 and 5 hours. An additional $186 million was received in FY2010 to improve 40 miles of track, saving another 9 minutes in trip time. The goal is to reduce trip times to 3 hours and 50 minutes by upgrading the entire route to 110 mph. Missouri also received $13.5 million for rail improvements near St. Louis. The Chicago-St. Louis corridor has received $46 million in TIGER grant funding for intermodal projects, aiming to improve travel time reliability, safety, and capacity. Construction began in 2010, with 110-mph service operational between Dwight and Pontiac, IL since November 2012. Speeds of 110 mph are expected on 75% of the 240-mile stretch between Joliet and Alton, IL by 2015. California High Speed Rail Authority plans a line for speeds up to 220 mph, funded partly by $9 billion in voter-approved bonds. Phase one is the Los Angeles to San Francisco line, with phase two extending to San Diego and Sacramento. The California High Speed Rail project has received nearly $4 billion in federal funds but remains controversial due to cost and financing issues. The estimated cost for phase one in 2010 dollars ranged from $36.4 billion to $74.5 billion, with the majority of cost increases attributed to additional infrastructure needs. The estimated cost for the California High-Speed Rail project increased due to the need for additional infrastructure and higher construction costs. A revised business plan in 2012 dropped the full high-speed rail system scenario as too costly, providing a new estimate for the blended system. The plan proposed that nearly two-thirds of the construction funding would come from the federal government. The California High-Speed Rail project's financial plan is uncertain, relying on federal funding and revenue from emissions auctions. The choice of building the first segment between Merced and Bakersfield is controversial, as it may face fewer challenges and help meet funding deadlines. The California High-Speed Rail project faces criticism for its segment between Merced and Bakersfield, with concerns about its utility without the rest of the system. The project received setbacks in late 2013, including a ruling that the state's approval to issue bonds did not comply with administrative law requirements. The California High-Speed Rail project faces challenges in completing the initial operating segment from Merced to the San Fernando Valley by 2021, with uncertainties in funding sources and completion deadlines. The project also faces complications from a decision by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. The Surface Transportation Board's decision complicates the California High-Speed Rail project. CHSRA requested approval for a 29-mile construction segment, including 5 miles outside the previously approved 65-mile portion. STB declined the exemption, requiring environmental review before construction can begin on the additional stretch. Two options exist for high-speed rail development: upgrading existing infrastructure or building new tracks for faster service. Upgrading existing rail infrastructure can enable faster train travel at a lower cost, with an average of $7 million per mile for upgrades. For example, Amtrak spent $2 billion in the 1990s to upgrade the Northeast Corridor, reducing travel time between Boston and New York City. However, track upgrades have limitations. Upgrades to existing rail infrastructure can lead to faster train travel at a lower cost, averaging $7 million per mile. However, limitations such as curves, at-grade road crossings, and freight traffic can constrain speed improvements. Building new rail lines, including the train, track, and signal network, allows for much higher speeds but comes at a higher cost of around $35 million per mile. Prohibiting freight trains on new lines means freight operators do not contribute to construction or maintenance costs. New high-speed rail lines can use conventional steel wheel on steel rail technology or magnetic levitation (maglev). Electric trains powered by overhead wires allow for lighter-weight trains that can operate at very high speeds, reaching up to 357 mph in some cases. High speed trains typically operate at around 210 mph due to cost and benefits. In the United States, limited electrified rail networks and safety regulations result in slower passenger trains compared to other countries. Very high speed operation requires flat, straight tracks with gentle curves. High speed rail tracks must be flat and straight, with no at-grade crossings to ensure safety. Dedicated tracks allow for multiple trains to operate at high speeds without compromising safety, similar to the Japanese high speed rail network which has operated for almost 50 years without any fatalities due to train crashes. The U.S. rail network relies on dispatchers to track train locations and signal operators, similar to air traffic control. In contrast, high-speed rail networks like the Japanese system use electronic train control systems for improved safety and efficiency. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control implementation by December 31, 2015, on certain rail lines. Maglev train technology, developed in the 1960s, uses electromagnets for high-speed travel with minimal wear and tear. Maglev trains are expected to have low maintenance costs, but the costs of constructing intercity maglev lines are unclear due to expensive land acquisition and tunneling. Japan and Germany have operated maglev test tracks since the 1970s and 1980s, but commercial maglev lines have not been built. The United States established a program to promote maglev in the 1990s, but no projects have been completed. In the 1990s, the United States established a program to promote maglev technology, but no projects advanced beyond the planning stage. The high costs of maglev implementation and the availability of comparable conventional train technology have hindered its adoption. China built a maglev line in Shanghai for research purposes but ultimately chose conventional train technology for its high-speed rail network. Japan's Central Japan Railway Company plans to build a maglev line parallel to its existing high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka to address capacity limitations. Japan's Central Japan Railway Company plans to build a maglev line parallel to its existing high-speed line between Tokyo and Osaka. The estimated cost for the Tokyo-Nagoya segment is 5.1 trillion yen, with the full line projected to cost 9 trillion yen. The Japanese government has approved the project, but uncertainties remain due to rising costs and Japan's population decline. High speed rail projects require significant upfront capital for infrastructure development and ongoing operating costs. Only a few high speed routes worldwide generate enough revenue to cover both costs. Factors influencing costs include the need for new right-of-ways, speed requirements, and infrastructure specifications for achieving high speeds. Building high-speed rail routes involves grade-separated corridors, limited curvature, and modest gradients to ensure passenger comfort at high speeds. As speed increases, more advanced signaling and communication systems are needed, driving up costs. Construction in mountainous or urban areas is more expensive than in rural areas. For example, a proposed route from Los Angeles to Las Vegas using maglev technology would cost nearly $12 billion, while an alternative route with conventional steel rail would cost less. The estimated cost of a high-speed rail alternative starting in Victorville, CA is nearly $4 billion, with a cost of $22 million per route mile. This cost reduction is due to avoiding bringing the line through the mountains into the Los Angeles area. In contrast, a project to increase train speeds between Chicago and other Midwest cities would cost $7.7 billion for improvements to existing track, at a cost of about $2.5 million per route mile. The Government Accountability Office found per-mile costs for incremental track improvements ranging from $4.1 million to $11.4 million. The DOT Inspector General has estimated costs for reducing travel time between Washington, DC, and New York City. Reducing travel time between Washington, DC, and New York City and between New York City and Boston by half an hour would cost $14 billion for corridor improvements. Comparing rail project costs with alternative methods like highway or airport expansion is important for assessing passenger mobility. Cost comparisons should be based on per passenger-mile basis or reductions in total travel time across different projects to determine the most efficient option, although this approach is not commonly used due to institutional obstacles. Transportation project costs are often underestimated, with rail projects being the most severely underestimated. Improving railroad track quality for higher speeds is a challenge due to private ownership. Improving track quality for higher speed passenger trains involves rebuilding track substructure, upgrading signaling systems, and increasing capacity on shared corridors to avoid delays from other trains. Freight railroads may be hesitant to fund these improvements as they may not benefit significantly from higher speeds. Amtrak's on-time performance on routes with multiple tracks was around 86% in FY2013. Amtrak's on-time performance was 86% in FY2013, but outside the NEC, it was 82% for short-distance trains and 72% for long-distance trains due to delays from freight and commuter trains. Adding sidings can increase capacity, but significant improvements may require a second track with high-speed crossovers. Operating costs for high-speed infrastructure can be a public expense if revenue from passenger fares is insufficient. Operating costs for passenger rail services include labor, fuel, equipment maintenance, and track access charges. In the United States, most intercity passenger operations are subsidized by federal and state governments due to insufficient ticket sales revenue. High-speed rail projects may operate without subsidies once construction is complete, with some proponents suggesting that profit-driven private companies could run rail services without public funding. The organizational structure of passenger rail is not conducive to a competitive market environment like airlines and buses. Most passenger rail tracks in the US are controlled by freight railroads, which are not obligated to accommodate passenger operations. Railroads are not required to carry passenger trains other than Amtrak, making it difficult for state governments or private companies to operate high-speed passenger trains. The profitability of high-speed rail depends on fare revenue and achieving high ridership levels. The justification for the cost of a high-speed rail line is based on attracting 6-9 million riders in the first year. High-speed rail can compete with airplanes for distances under 400-500 miles due to shorter wait times. Business travelers are the target market willing to pay premium fares for faster service. Amtrak competes well with airlines on the Northeast Corridor, capturing 77% of the air/rail market share between Washington, DC, and New York City, and 54% between New York City and Boston. However, it only captures about 5% between Washington, DC, and Boston. Driving may be more convenient and cost-effective for travelers making multiple stops or traveling with others. High speed trains may struggle to compete with intercity buses due to price sensitivity of travelers. Recent improvements in bus service quality may further reduce demand for high speed rail. Trains require high population density and frequent departures to compete with airlines. The concentration of economic activity near train stations is a key factor in the viability of high-speed rail for business travelers. New York City, with its high population density and businesses near train stations, accounted for 30% of Amtrak's ridership in 2012. Despite criticisms, conventional high-speed rail is a proven technology for convenient travel between major urban centers. High-speed rail (HSR) has faced criticism regarding its cost-effectiveness compared to air or highway travel. Assessments depend on HSR's ability to provide social benefits like relieving traffic congestion in heavily traveled corridors. Studies suggest HSR may have limited impact on highway congestion due to the small diversion of intercity trips to rail. In some cases, rail improvements may only divert 3%-6% of intercity automobile trips. The Inspector General's analysis of High-speed rail (HSR) in the Northeast Corridor found that reducing trip times by one hour would have minimal impact on automobile ridership. A high-speed rail link in Florida between Orlando and Tampa was estimated to shift 11% of drivers to the train, but would only reduce traffic on the busiest sections of Interstate 4 by less than 2%. HSR is seen as a viable alternative to air travel, with potential for a significant share of air travelers to switch to rail. The Inspector General's study of High-speed rail (HSR) in the Northeast Corridor estimated that 11%-20% of air travelers would switch to HSR, potentially providing congestion relief at airports and in airspace. However, the diversion to HSR may not necessarily reduce airport congestion as airlines could adjust their operations. HSR may be a more costly way to relieve air traffic congestion compared to other measures like expanding airport capacity or implementing congestion pricing. High-speed rail (HSR) offers benefits such as energy efficiency and lower pollution compared to other modes of transportation. However, these claims rely on high passenger loads and clean energy sources. The analysis of building a high-speed rail system in the UK connecting London with Glasgow and Edinburgh was part of a broader transportation policy review. The analysis of building a high-speed rail system connecting London with Glasgow and Edinburgh concluded that the carbon benefits would be small relative to the high cost of construction. It is unlikely to be a cost-effective policy for reducing carbon emissions compared to other measures due to capturing a small share of total passenger trips. The analysis of high-speed rail (HSR) in Sweden found that investing in rail networks is less cost-effective for climate policy than general policies like increased fuel taxes. HSR projects create jobs in planning, design, and construction, with the California High Speed Rail Authority claiming it will create 100,000 construction-related jobs annually. The long-term economic impact and job creation potential of HSR are debated, with CHSRA suggesting 450,000 permanent jobs could be created in California. The economic benefits of high-speed rail (HSR) in California are disputed. CHSRA claims it will create 450,000 permanent jobs, but studies suggest this may not be realized. GAO noted in 2009 that benefits like economic development and employment could be a transfer of benefits rather than new creations. Studies also indicate limited broader economic benefits in mature economies with well-developed infrastructure. High-speed rail (HSR) in mature economies with well-developed infrastructure has limited safety benefits. Despite a good safety record in other countries, HSR is unlikely to significantly reduce transportation-related deaths in the United States. Autos are the most dangerous form of passenger travel, and the ability of HSR to divert highway travelers to rail is limited. The diversion of flyers to trains would also have little impact on passenger safety. However, providing travelers with a choice of modes, especially for those unable or unwilling to fly or drive, could still hold value. High-speed rail (HSR) offers travelers an attractive alternative to traffic and airline delays, providing comfort and convenience. While individual benefits are clear, the social benefits that would justify public subsidies are not apparent. Events like floods, snowstorms, and terrorism can disrupt transportation systems, highlighting the value of having extra capacity or alternative means of travel. Redundancy in any system incurs added costs. The demand for HSR funding is high, with potential projects in the pipeline. Current projects may lead to increased train usage, prompting proposals for additional projects. For example, there are plans to improve service between Chicago and St. Louis, with future studies for a high-speed line between the two cities at an estimated cost of $12.6 billion. The cost estimate for Phase 1 of the California HSR is now around $60 billion. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee proposed $50 billion for surface transportation authorization in 2009. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee proposed $50 billion over six years for high-speed rail development, but did not include a dedicated revenue source. Without a funding source, projects may face challenges due to changing political priorities and competition for limited discretionary funding. Additional funding from the general fund would require a significant increase in DOT's appropriation. Various options have been suggested to fund high-speed intercity passenger rail development. Various funding options have been proposed for high-speed intercity passenger rail development, including dedicating a portion of the highway trust fund's revenues, adding a tax on intercity rail passengers' tickets, and using revenues from greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs. However, these proposals may not generate significant revenue and could potentially raise the price of rail travel. High-speed rail development funding options include using bonds, tax-exempt bonds, and tax-credit bonds. Repayment of bonds may fall on federal or state governments. Private sector funding for high-speed rail projects is limited, with a notable proposal reliant on a federal loan. Proponents of high-speed rail often reference successful networks in other countries, but the feasibility of implementing similar systems in the United States is uncertain. The desirability of building HSR lines in the United States is uncertain, as motives for implementing high-speed rail vary among countries. HSR has successfully captured market share from commercial aviation in Europe and Japan, with efficiency as a transportation investment depending on various factors. Countries with high-speed rail (HSR) have higher population densities, smaller land areas, lower car ownership levels, higher gasoline prices, lower car use, and greater public transportation availability compared to the United States. HSR in these countries is typically implemented and operated by state-owned companies focused on passenger transportation, unlike the U.S. where the rail network is mostly owned by private freight companies. The rail network in countries with high-speed rail (HSR) is usually owned by state-owned companies focused on passenger transportation. There is a tension between economic analysis and political pressure in HSR development, with initial lines built based on economic viability but subsequent lines driven by political pressure. Japan's experience with HSR shows that while the first line was successful, subsequent lines had lower passenger numbers and weaker financial performance. The development of high-speed rail (HSR) in other countries has shown varying levels of success, with some lines carrying fewer passengers and experiencing weaker financial performance. When considering further initiatives regarding HSR, Congress may need to examine the rationale for building HSR and the potential benefits it could provide to travelers and the general public. Ridership levels play a crucial role in determining the extent of these benefits, which can be influenced by policies that either encourage or discourage the use of high-speed rail. Other countries support HSR through a combination of incentives and disincentives to promote its use. The development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the United States may not meet expectations without similar policies in place as in other countries. Very high speed rail lines are expensive and risky investments, competing with commercial aviation. Congress is supporting aviation system capacity improvements, which may impact the potential success of very high speed rail. Congress may need to address issues related to program financing for high-speed rail (HSR) development, including the allocation of costs among federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private sector. Questions arise about whether transportation funding should be increased for HSR or if funds should be redirected from existing highway and transit programs. The federal share of grants for HSR projects should not exceed 80%, as specified in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. Decisions need to be made on how federal funds should be allocated among different types of HSR projects. The allocation of federal funds for high-speed rail (HSR) projects is a key issue. Congress must decide how to distribute funds among various types of HSR projects. One or two successful HSR projects could showcase the potential of HSR but may require significant funding. Incremental improvements to passenger routes could enhance rail service for more people, although they may not achieve the high speed operations associated with HSR. The selection process for funding HSR projects is not always clear, as projects must be part of a state or national rail plan to receive funding. The federal government faces challenges in funding and maintaining high-speed rail (HSR) projects. It is uncertain if the national rail plan will align with state priorities, and there are concerns about covering operating costs through passenger revenues. Adequate funding for infrastructure maintenance and train operations is crucial to protect the federal investment in HSR. Japan has a successful high-speed rail network with lines operating at speeds of 186 mph or more. The first line between Tokyo and Osaka opened in 1964 and quickly covered its operating and construction costs. The government continues to support the expansion of the network through public-private partnerships. France opened its first high-speed rail line in 1981, between Paris and Lyon, with approximately 1,185 miles of high-speed rail line as of 2013. The French high-speed trains are known as TGVs (Trains \u00e0 Grande Vitesse), and the network is expanding with more lines under construction. France's high-speed rail network is influenced by the low population density and the central role of Paris as the nation's capital and largest population center. The French high-speed rail network, centered around Paris, has spokes radiating outward. Regional governments share construction costs. SNCF's TGVs dominate the air-rail travel market, with over 90% in the Paris-Lyon corridor. Germany's high-speed rail, operated by InterCityExpress (ICE), is a government responsibility. Germany's network differs from France's due to its federal system and denser population distribution. Germany's high-speed rail system has been developed to connect multiple hubs due to political demands and a denser population. Unlike France, Germany's system focuses on upgrading existing rail lines rather than building new ones, resulting in longer average trip times. Spain, with a low population density, opened its first high-speed rail line in 1992, with most of its population concentrated near the coasts. Spain's high-speed rail network, with over 1,900 miles of track in service as of 2013, operates on a wider gauge than the international standard. The government aims to expand the network to 6,200 miles by 2020, but economic challenges have led to project reconsideration. China is developing an extensive high-speed rail system to relieve pressure on its existing rail network, improve transportation connections between regions, and boost the economy of less developed areas. Plans include upgrading existing lines for speeds of 120-150 mph and building new electrified lines for speeds of 180 mph or more. The government aims to have 10,000 miles of high-speed lines in operation by 2020, with construction accelerated in 2008-2010 to stimulate the economy. However, a high-profile train collision in 2011 led to a reevaluation of some projects. China acknowledged the need to slow down high-speed rail construction after a deadly train collision in 2011. Taiwan, a small island nation, completed a 214-mile high-speed line in 2007, cutting travel times significantly. The project cost around $15 billion and was developed by a private consortium. Initial ridership projections were high, but economic difficulties led to lower than expected passenger numbers. In 2005, airline ridership dropped to 9 million due to the opening of a new highway, making highway travel more attractive. In 2009, the Taiwanese government took control of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation, which was near bankruptcy. By 2012, the corporation reported a profit with 44.5 million passengers. South Korea constructed a 255-mile high-speed line connecting Seoul and Busan, reducing travel time from 4 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes. Ridership increased significantly after the project was completed in 2010. The Taiwan High Speed Rail project reduced travel time from 4 hours to around 2 hours and 20 minutes, with 140,000 passengers daily in 2011. Initial cost estimates were $5 billion, but the final cost was $20 billion due to challenging terrain. Nearly half the line is in tunnels, a quarter on viaducts, and a quarter at grade."
