    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Manufacturers' Renewal and Training Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the importance of a productive manufacturing sector, especially small businesses for job creation. Small manufacturers play a critical role but face barriers in adopting modern technology, such as lack of information, cost perception, and difficulty in attracting engineers. Engineering students often lack exposure to current industrial practices, especially those of small manufacturers. The purpose of this Act is to allow engineering students to work with small manufacturing companies to bring modern engineering practices, expose students to the needs of small manufacturers, encourage colleges to focus on small manufacturers, and promote technological entrepreneurship in the small manufacturing sector. The Act defines key terms such as \"cooperative education program,\" \"Director,\" \"engineering student,\" \"host company,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Commerce, \"small manufacturer\" as a company with 500 or fewer employees in various industries, \"underrepresented group\" as historically marginalized individuals in engineering professions, and \"United States\" as including various territories and states. Establishment of the SMART Program. The SMART Program is established to award grants to manufacturing outreach centers for internship activities. Eligible entities include organizations engaged in technology or manufacturing extension activities. Grant duration and renewal are also specified. The SMART Program awards grants to manufacturing outreach centers for internships, with a focus on small manufacturers. Grants are awarded for up to 3 years initially and can be renewed for up to 5 years. Priority is given to proposals placing engineering students with small manufacturers. Funding limitations restrict outreach spending to 35% in the first 3 years. The SMART Program awards grants to manufacturing outreach centers for internships, focusing on small manufacturers. Grants can be renewed for up to 5 years, with funding restrictions. The Director must ensure each state's center receives a grant equal to 1% of the appropriated amount or $200,000, whichever is less. The federal role in the SMART Program is outlined in Section 6. The Director of the SMART Program is responsible for soliciting and evaluating grant proposals, collecting performance information, and coordinating activities with other federal programs. The Director can hire staff as needed and allocate up to $500,000 or 5 percent for administrative purposes. The Secretary establishes grant proposal criteria for the SMART Program, giving preference to programs that involve outreach to small manufacturers and cooperative education, especially in regions with low economic growth or weak manufacturing sectors. Administrative expenses are limited to $500,000 or 5 percent of funds appropriated. The SMART Program gives preference to programs that involve outreach to small manufacturers in regions with weak manufacturing sectors. The Secretary will evaluate the program every 3 years after enactment of the Act. The role of manufacturing outreach centers is outlined in Section 7. Manufacturing outreach centers use grant funds to support outreach activities, select engineering students for the SMART Program, place students as interns with host companies, and sponsor internships with funding for host companies. The grant funds are used to supplement the wages of interns, with the Federal share not exceeding the amount paid to an employee earning the Federal minimum wage for 3 to 6 months. The total amount of the grant cannot exceed the amount paid to an employee earning the Federal minimum wage in the 24-month period prior to receiving the grant. This supplementation is for interns who have completed 3 years of study in a bachelor's standard curriculum. The manufacturing outreach center must prioritize placing interns with host companies employing 100 or fewer employees. Each center seeking a grant must submit a proposal. Manufacturing outreach centers seeking a grant must submit a proposal to the Secretary, detailing activities and services for assistance. The centers can collaborate with cooperative education programs to provide engineering students with work experience, including outreach activities, internships, and technology extension services. The role of host companies is outlined in Section 8. Host companies hosting interns in manufacturing operations in the United States must provide employment-related benefits, use funds from a manufacturing outreach center for intern wages, not have participated in a cooperative education program, and share wage and benefit information with the outreach center. The SMART Program requires host companies to provide benefits to interns, use funds from a manufacturing outreach center for wages, designate a supervisor for each intern, and evaluate the intern's performance and the value of the host company's participation. The SMART Program requires interns to work as employees for host companies and provide evaluations to the manufacturing outreach center. The Director must make efforts to involve underrepresented groups in the program by soliciting participation from minority and women's engineering colleges. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with increasing amounts for the following years."
