    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to include provisions for the rate paid to providers for care and supervision of children living with parents receiving AFDC-FC or Kin-GAP benefits. The department will establish uniform rates for different types of licensed community care facilities to cover these costs, with a 6 percent increase effective July 1, 1998. The uniform rate for the cost of care and supervision of a child will be adjusted based on the California Necessities Index and increased by 2.36 percent starting in 2000. Rates will also be adjusted annually for cost of living. Starting January 1, 2008, the uniform rate for child care will increase by 5 percent and be rounded to the nearest dollar. From July 1, 2016, an additional monthly supplement of $489 will be provided if funding is available. Payments for children living with teen parents will equal the basic rate for children in licensed homes. Starting January 1, 2017, the amount paid for care and supervision of a dependent infant living with a dependent teenage parent receiving AFDC-FC benefits in a group home placement or short-term residential treatment center shall equal the infant supplement rate established by the department. The caregiver must provide the county agency with a shared responsibility plan and inform them of any changes. An additional $200 per month will be added to the payment for increased care in a whole family foster home. A nonminor dependent parent in a supervised independent living placement must develop a parenting support plan, provide it to the county agency, and inform them of any changes. An additional $200 per month will be added to the payment after the plan is completed, approved, and the responsible adult meets specified criteria. (4) Payments under this section will be adjusted for cost of living increases, with additional increases following the same procedures. (5) Kin-GAP relatives previously designated as whole family foster homes will receive the same payment amounts for caring for a child living with a teen parent. (6) Starting January 1, 2012, the rate paid for a child living with a teen parent in a whole family foster home will also apply to a child living with a nonminor dependent parent eligible for AFDC-FC or Kin-GAP. The rate paid for a pregnant minor or nonminor dependent includes the amount for care of the child, if born, to meet specialized needs and prepare for the infant. Verification of pregnancy is required for aid eligibility. The department shall adopt regulations to set uniform rates for licensed community care facilities to cover the cost of care and supervision of children. The rates will be increased by 6 percent on July 1, 1998, and adjusted annually based on the California Necessities Index starting July 1, 1999. On and after January 1, 2000, the uniform rate for child care and supervision will increase by 2.36 percent, rounded to the nearest dollar. From 2000-01 fiscal year onwards, rates will be adjusted annually for cost of living. Starting January 1, 2008, the rate will increase by 5 percent. Starting July 1, 2016, the uniform rate for child care will increase by $489 per month if funding is available. Payments for children living with teen parents in foster homes will be equal to rates for children in licensed homes. Dependent infants with teen parents in group homes will receive the infant supplement rate. Starting January 1, 2017, the payment for care of a dependent infant with a dependent teenage parent in a short-term residential therapeutic program will be the infant supplement rate. The caregiver must provide a shared responsibility plan and notify the county agency of any changes. An additional $200 per month will be added to the payment for care in a whole family foster home. A nonminor dependent parent in a supervised independent living placement must create a parenting support plan, provide it to the county agency, and notify them of any changes. Upon approval of the plan and meeting specific criteria, an additional $200 per month will be added to the payment. (4) Payments under this section will be adjusted for cost of living increases, with the same procedures applying to payments in this subdivision.\n(5) Kin-GAP relatives previously designated as whole family foster homes will receive the same payment amounts for caring for a child living with a teen parent as they did in foster care.\n(6) Starting January 1, 2012, the rate paid for a child living with a teen parent in a whole family foster home will also apply to a child living with a nonminor dependent parent eligible for AFDC-FC or Kin-GAP. The rate paid for a pregnant minor or nonminor dependent includes the amount for the care of the expected child. This amount is to meet specialized needs and prepare for the infant. Verification of pregnancy is required for eligibility. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1997 before January 1, 2017. The act applies to local agencies only if the state provides annual funding for cost increases related to programs mandated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation. Any new program or higher level of service above funded levels does not require state funding."
