    "content": "Apprenticeship is a workforce development strategy that combines on-the-job training with classroom instruction. Registered Apprenticeships are certified programs that meet specified standards and are overseen by either the federal Office of Apprenticeship or state apprenticeship agencies. State agencies must be recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor to approve and register apprenticeships. State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) require approval from the U.S. Department of Labor to register apprenticeships. SAAs must align with state economic development strategies and partner with a State Apprenticeship Council (SAC) consisting of employer and employee representatives. Apprenticeable occupations involve practical on-the-job learning and the progressive development of skills. The Department of Labor (DOL) publishes a list of over 1,000 occupations eligible for apprenticeships, with skilled trades and construction being popular choices. The most common duration for Registered Apprenticeships is four years, leading to a nationally recognized Certificate of Completion. In FY2014, there were approximately 410,000 active apprentices in various occupations. In FY2014, DOL reported around 410,000 active apprentices in about 19,000 Registered Apprenticeship programs, including 95,000 in the United Services Military Apprenticeship Program. These data are limited to registered apprenticeships meeting federal standards. Regulations establish standards for apprenticeships to be registered, with sponsors ensuring compliance through a written plan. Standards for apprenticeships include a written plan with provisions for on-the-job training, supervised work experience, related technical instruction, performance reviews, increasing wages, probationary period, safety training, and equipment assurance. The registration process for apprenticeship programs involves submitting a description of the program to a registration agency for approval. If the program meets regulatory standards, it receives provisional approval for one year, which can be made permanent or extended based on compliance. The Office of Apprenticeship (OA) within the Department of Labor (DOL) is the primary federal entity overseeing apprenticeship programs. The Office of Apprenticeship (OA) within the Department of Labor (DOL) is the primary federal entity overseeing apprenticeship programs. OA's responsibilities include approving new apprenticeships, ensuring compliance, outreach to sponsors, and providing technical support. OA receives annual appropriations, with FY2016 funding at about $34 million. Dedicated federal funds have been made available in recent years to support apprenticeship program development and expansion. In December 2014, the Department of Labor (DOL) solicited applications for American Apprenticeship Grants funded by immigration visa fees. Approximately $175 million in grants were awarded in September 2015 to support the development and expansion of apprenticeship programs, with emphasis on industries like information technology and healthcare. In FY2016, $90 million was appropriated to expand opportunities for apprenticeship programs under the National Apprenticeship Act. Federal programs support apprenticeship through funding related instruction, with workforce development funds granted to states and local boards. These funds can cover related instruction, reimburse employers for on-the-job training wages, and provide placement assistance for apprentices. Federal student aid offers financial assistance for postsecondary education costs. Federal programs, including Pell grants, Federal Work Study, and Veterans Education benefits, support apprentices in covering costs for postsecondary education. Veterans enrolled in a registered apprenticeship can also receive G.I. Bill tuition benefits and housing allowance. Funding from various government departments may also support apprenticeship programs. Employers with Registered Apprenticeships may receive special treatment in federal contracts, such as exemption from full prevailing wage requirements on federal construction projects. The apprenticeship sponsor must still comply with all apprenticeship requirements."
