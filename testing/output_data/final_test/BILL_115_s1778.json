    "content": "The \"Patriot Employer Tax Credit Act\" is introduced as a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a tax credit for employers. The Patriot employer credit under section 38 allows a 10% credit on qualified wages paid by Patriot employers, with a limit of $15,000 per employee. A Patriot employer is defined as a taxpayer maintaining its headquarters in the United States. The Patriot employer credit under section 38 provides a 10% credit on qualified wages paid by employers headquartered in the United States, with a limit of $15,000 per employee. To qualify, the employer must not be an expatriated entity, have no assessable payments under section 4980H, and provide paid sick leave or family and medical leave to employees. A taxpayer with over 50 employees must provide compensation to 90% of its employees at a rate not less than 218% of the Federal poverty level for an individual, and meet retirement plan requirements. The text chunk discusses the requirements for large employers regarding employee compensation and retirement plans. The requirements for United States employment state that if a taxpayer increases the number of employees working outside the US, they must also increase the number of employees working inside the US by a similar amount or have a percentage increase in employees. The taxpayer must have a percentage increase in employees inside the United States that is not less than the increase in employees outside the United States. If the taxpayer decreases the number of employees working inside the US, they must also decrease the number of employees working outside the US by a similar amount. The taxpayer must ensure that any decrease in the number of employees working inside the United States is matched by a decrease in the number of employees working outside the United States. Additionally, there should not be a decrease in the number of employees providing services within the US due to outsourcing to non-employee entities. The taxpayer must provide wage payments to non-employee individuals in the uniformed services or disabled, ensuring they receive the difference between their regular wages and service pay. The taxpayer must have a written policy for recruiting employees who have served in the uniformed services or are disabled. Special rules apply for meeting minimum wage requirements, allowing exclusion of apprentices or learners from the determination. An employer may exclude certain differential wage payments under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The hourly rate for such payments is based on the wages that would have been paid if the employee had not been serving in the uniformed services. This also applies to retirement plan determinations. The retirement plan requirements allow a taxpayer to exclude certain employees from the determination if they do not meet age or service requirements or are described in section 410(b)(3). This is to ensure compliance with the subsection for non-highly compensated employees. The taxpayer can exclude certain employees from the retirement plan requirements if they are not highly compensated and eligible to participate in applicable eligible retirement plans. An applicable eligible retirement plan is defined as a plan that requires the employer to make nonelective contributions of at least 5 percent of the employee's compensation or includes an eligible automatic contribution arrangement. An automatic contribution arrangement requires a minimum 5 percent contribution from the employee, with matching contributions from the employer. A defined benefit plan must provide an annual retirement benefit not less than 2 percent multiplied by the employee's years of service with the employer or 20 percent, multiplied by the employee's final average pay. An eligible defined benefit plan must meet specific interest credit and pay credit requirements for the plan year, with the employee receiving a pay credit of at least 5 percent of compensation. The term 'eligible retirement plan' is defined in accordance with section 402(c)(8)(B), with certain exceptions. The term 'eligible retirement plan' is defined in section 402(c)(8)(B), with exceptions for certain accounts or annuities. Final average pay is determined based on the employee's highest compensation over a period of up to five years. The Secretary may allow taxpayers to combine defined contribution and defined benefit plans to meet the requirements. Plans must meet requirements without considering social security and similar contributions and benefits. Qualified wages refer to wages paid by the Patriot employer to employees who work mainly in the United States. The Patriot employer must meet specific requirements based on the number of employees. Special rules apply for agricultural and railway labor. Compensation is defined as qualified wages excluding certain provisions. The aggregation rules state that all persons treated as a single employer under certain sections shall be treated as a single taxpayer. Special rules apply for certain requirements, and the determination for these rules should be made without regard to certain exclusions. If a person is considered an expatriated entity after March 4, 2003, then all individuals treated as a single taxpayer with that person will also be treated as expatriated entities. Taxpayers have the option to elect to not apply this section for any taxable year, with the election period lasting up to 3 years from the filing deadline. The election must be made in the prescribed manner. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to Patriot employer credits and the denial of double benefits, with an effective date for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017."
