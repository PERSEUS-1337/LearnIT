    "content": "Libya's political transition has been disrupted by armed non-state groups and interim leaders' indecision and infighting. The country's public finances, security issues, and governance have been major challenges since the end of Muammar al Qadhafi's rule in 2011. Armed militia groups and local political leaders hold significant power, leading to persistent lawlessness and enabling criminal and terrorist activities. Insecurity has deepened due to various rivalries, both domestic and transnational. The political transition in Libya has faced challenges such as declining participation in elections, threats to candidates, and disputes over governance and military control. U.S. Africa Command has warned of the risk of civil war, while some leaders endorsed a U.N.-brokered agreement to establish a Government of National Accord in 2015. Prime Minister-designate Fayez al Sarraj has worked to implement the agreement amidst competition for influence with other political figures and armed forces. The United Nations Security Council and the United States have recognized the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya, but it has struggled to overcome political and geographical divisions. International efforts have been made to promote inclusive governance and negotiation over armed dominance. Financial and travel sanctions have been authorized by the U.N. Security Council for those threatening Libya's peace and stability. The U.N. arms embargo and U.S. sanctions aim to support Libya's political transition. A U.N.-sponsored Action Plan is in place to complete the transition in 2018, with debates on implementation. Past mediation efforts have struggled, and outside involvement complicates negotiations. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli remains closed due to security concerns. U.S. diplomats monitor programs in Libya through the Libya External Office in Tunisia. U.S. military supported Libyan forces in Operation Odyssey Lightning to eliminate ISIS supporters in Sirte. Periodic U.S. strikes target terrorists. Congress has funded transition support and security assistance programs for Libya since 2011. Threats from ISIS and Al Qaeda have been degraded but remain dangerous. Additional assistance funds for FY2019 are being considered by Congress. Congress shapes U.S. policy towards Libya through oversight of diplomatic, foreign assistance, and defense activities. Limited U.S. influence due to resource investment and lack of physical presence. Discussions focus on supporting a unified national government and reducing transnational threats in Libya. Policymakers face complex choices regarding partnership with Libyans, assistance, and potential costs. Libya's 2011 uprising ended Muammar al Qadhafi's rule, leading to factional struggles for power. Libyans are working to overcome political divisions hindering the country's transition. These issues will shape future U.S. policy debates on Libya. Libya's transition has been hindered by internal divisions, insecurity, and competition following Qadhafi's downfall. Various factors interact to shape local and national dynamics, leading to competing claims of legitimacy among transitional leaders. Rates of participation in governing arrangements have declined over time, resulting in an inconclusive situation. After Qadhafi's downfall, Libya has been plagued by internal divisions and insecurity, leading to a political struggle among transitional leaders with competing claims of legitimacy. Despite avoiding a sustained national civil war, violent clashes persist in many areas, with the threat of wider conflict looming. Key post-Qadhafi political issues include the powers of local, regional, and national government, weak national institutions and security forces, the role of Islam in society, involvement of former regime officials in politics, and managing the country's energy reserves and infrastructure. The relative degree of conflict among Libyan factions since 2014 is influenced by factors such as the ability to assert dominance, access to government funds, U.N. arms embargo, and threats from extremist groups. The United States and other external actors have intervened to protect their national security interests in Libya. The United States and other external parties support multilateral initiatives for Libya's transition. Foreign observers praise the role of the United Nations in promoting national reconciliation. Continuous efforts are needed to engage all Libyan actors for stability. Accusations of unwarranted interference by the U.N. and third parties have been made by some Libyans. Key issues for outsiders include transnational threats from Libya and the security of oil and natural resources. The current chunk discusses the various challenges facing Libya, including criminal threats, security of oil and natural gas exports, refugee transit, weapons stockpiles, and political competitions. It also outlines the three phases of post-Qadhafi Libya's development. The confrontation and mediation in Libya since May 2014 have been marked by tension, violence, and efforts for reconciliation among political-military coalitions. The initial phase saw the formation of an Interim Constitutional Declaration and the country's first general election in July 2012. However, disagreements over leadership and governance hindered progress in government reform and security establishment. The July 2012 national election for the General National Congress (GNC) in Libya heightened political competition, but the government's tenure was marred by gridlock, suspicion, and intimidation by armed groups. The September 2012 attacks in Benghazi and subsequent incidents disrupted the national government's workings. By late 2013, GNC members were polarized over disputes about the remaining term of office and the passage of laws. By mid-2014, disputes within the GNC over governance, laws excluding former regime officials, and the status of Islamic law had escalated. The transition process outlined in 2011 had collapsed, leading to violence between rival political-military coalitions. The June 2014 election for a new House of Representatives was contested, resulting in a year of stalemate and failed mediation attempts. In eastern Libya, the Tobruk-based HOR and Benghazi-focused forces aligned with the \"Libyan National Army.\" In Libya, rival political-military coalitions clashed over governance and legitimacy. U.S. diplomats were evacuated as violence escalated. Cease-fire agreements were reached, but attempts to broker a lasting agreement failed. In December 2015, a U.N.-facilitated Libyan Political Agreement was signed to establish a new Government of National Accord. The Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya was created to include members of opposing groups and rival elected bodies under new institutional arrangements. The agreement called for a nine-member GNA Presidency Council to assume national security and economic decision-making power, with the House of Representatives (HOR) retaining legislative power. Libyan politics have been shaped by evolving views of the agreement since late 2015, with local political councils and militias responding to GNA leaders' implementation attempts. The HOR accepted the GNA agreement in principle in January 2016, but leaders prevented the wider body from endorsing the proposed cabinet. The House of Representatives (HOR) in Libya prevented the endorsement of the GNA's proposed cabinet and the incorporation of the LPA into the interim constitutional declaration. Khalifa Haftar and the LNA opposed the terms of the LPA annex regarding military command. Haftar was appointed as military commander by the HOR in 2015. Pro-Haftar forces have consolidated security control in northeastern Libya since 2015 and took control of oil infrastructure sites in the eastern Sirte basin in 2016. In September 2016, the House of Representatives promoted Haftar to Field Marshal, increasing his insistence on being recognized as the legitimate leader of Libya's national armed forces. GNA Prime Minister Sarraj gained administrative control in Tripoli but faced challenges in establishing national security control. The GNA Presidency Council struggled with legitimacy due to boycotts and resignations, hindering decision-making and limiting the effectiveness of GNA-led ministries. The power and effectiveness of GNA-led ministries have been limited, with third parties balancing efforts to build capacity at the national level and engage with local communities. Security arrangements are divisive, with LNA leaders refusing to recognize GNA authority over LNA forces. LNA leaders oppose the inclusion of militias or extremists in national security bodies, while some GNA supporters in western Libya call for excluding Field Marshal Haftar from any future security role. Critics question the GNA Presidency Council's legitimacy and mandate to create new security forces without resolving broader political issues. Global concern over trafficking and detention of migrants in western Libya has led to increased international attention on the region's political economy and security since 2017. The GNA in Tripoli is supported by local militia groups, some involved in human rights abuses and illegal detentions. Pro-GNA militia forces may seek formal security roles in the future, while the prospect of military confrontation looms as political negotiations continue. LNA forces declared victory over opposing militia groups in Benghazi in 2017. The LNA forces in Benghazi declared victory over opposing militia groups in 2017 after a costly three-year battle. However, they have not been able to achieve a military victory against rivals in western Libya. Clashes between forces aligned with the GNA and LNA have been ongoing in central and southern Libya since mid-2017. Efforts to unify and reorganize Libya's national military forces have been made through talks between LNA and GNA-affiliated military officers in Cairo. LNA forces have surrounded militia forces in Derna, including armed Islamist groups. Meetings between GNA Prime Minister-designate Sarraj and Field Marshal Haftar have raised hopes for a modified GNA arrangement. The U.N. launched a new Action Plan in September to reduce the size of the GNA Presidency Council and modify roles of legislative and executive entities. Despite some progress, agreement was not reached on national security leadership, constitutional referendum sequencing, or planned elections by the end of 2017. Field Marshal Haftar claimed the LPA and associated institutions had expired, leading to a confrontational atmosphere. Haftar questioned Libya's readiness for democracy despite expressing desire for elections. The U.N. Action Plan aims for constitutional referendum and elections, but key decisions are pending. The draft constitution faces challenges, and timing of referendum and elections is uncertain. In March 2018, the High Council of State replaced Abderrahman al Swehli with Khalid al Meshri. Discussions between Al Meshri and HOR leaders in Morocco did not result in agreement on legislation for planned elections. Electoral laws, candidate eligibility criteria, and campaign finance regulations are still pending. The Islamic State claimed a deadly attack on the High National Election Commission headquarters, but the director assured that voter data was secure. The attack may impact the commission's ability to carry out elections and recruit personnel. HNEC is preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections, awaiting legislation and support. The U.N. Action Plan's goal for 2018 has not seen breakthroughs. Political differences may hinder democratic preparations. The U.N. Action Plan aims to address security risks during elections in Libya. Coordination among factions and militias is expected to be challenging. International organizations support the plan for conducive political and security environments for elections. Libyans' experiences since 2011 suggest key policy areas likely to remain politically sensitive and potentially divisive, including the composition and leadership of security forces, efforts to combat extremist groups, international security assistance, demobilization of militias, control of financial institutions, and security of energy infrastructure. Sanctions were adopted by the UN, US, and other actors before and after the conflict in 2011 to pressure the Qadhafi government to end its military campaign. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 imposed sanctions on the Qadhafi government to end the military campaign against opposition forces and civilians, including a travel ban, arms embargo, and asset freeze. Post-conflict, sanctions were adjusted to prevent former government figures from accessing state funds and support Libya's transition. US Treasury issued licenses for transitional leaders to access some resources while ensuring transparent and legitimate administration. The U.S. Treasury issued licenses to unblock Libyan state property and allow transactions with the Libyan Central Bank and National Oil Company. UN arms embargo provisions were adjusted to ensure authorized weapons transfers. Security Council Resolution 2174 in 2014 expanded sanctions to target actors fueling conflict in Libya. Resolution 2174 strengthened the arms embargo provisions by requiring advance approval for arms transfers. Resolution 2213 expanded sanctionable activities related to Resolution 2174. The UN Security Council recognized the GNA as Libya's governing authority and endorsed the LPA in December 2015. Resolutions 2259, 2278, and 2362 call on Member States to support the GNA and comply with Security Council measures. Resolution 2259, 2278, and 2362 call on member states to support the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Libya by providing security assistance, addressing threats to Libyan security, and extending the mandate for maritime enforcement of oil shipments. The Security Council adopted Resolutions 2357 and 2362, extending the mandate for maritime enforcement of oil shipment monitoring and reaffirming arms embargo measures. In December 2017, the Council endorsed the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA) and the Government of National Accord (GNA) as key references for Libya's transition to a permanent government structure. In February 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13566, blocking assets of the Libyan government and designated individuals. Sanctions enforcement measures were modified in April 2016 to support the LPA. The modified executive order, based on President Obama's findings, blocks property and prohibits entry to the US for individuals and entities engaging in actions threatening Libya's peace, stability, and security. The US government has imposed sanctions on individuals obstructing the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement. President Trump extended the national emergency with respect to Libya in February 2018. The EU has also imposed sanctions on key Libyan figures. Arms transfers to Libya are allowed under current UN Security Council resolutions. Under current U.N. Security Council resolutions, arms transfers to Libya may occur with GNA approval and notification to the UN panel. Unauthorized arms transfers to Libya persist, as reported by the Resolution 1970 committee. The Panel of Experts documented foreign support violations of the arms embargo for armed groups in eastern Libya and Misrata, including air force capabilities expansion. Resolution 2292 and 2357 authorized member states to assist in maritime enforcement of the arms embargo. The EU's naval mission in the Mediterranean is also involved in arms embargo enforcement. The naval mission in the Mediterranean is assisting in arms embargo enforcement. Concerns have been raised about potential foreign military assistance in Libya's oil-rich areas. The US and EU are urging armed groups to refrain from violence and respect ceasefire arrangements. Conflict and instability in Libya have severely impacted the country's economy and oil reserves. Libya, with the largest proven crude oil reserves in Africa and ninth globally, heavily relies on oil and gas for revenue. However, disruptions and market forces caused a significant drop in production and revenue from 2014 to 2016, leading to financial devastation. Despite declining revenue, state financial obligations have increased, with a large number of state employees and high salary expenses. Government payments to civilians and militia members have continued amidst internal conflicts, leading to deficits and financial challenges. Libyan officials have been using state financial reserves to manage deficits and pay salaries and subsidies, but there have been reports of delays in salary payments. Foreign exchange reserves have decreased from $124 billion in 2012 to an estimated $69 billion in 2017. Despite facing a budget deficit, an increase in oil production since mid-2017 has provided new financial resources. Libya's oil production has rebounded, leading to calls to participate in OPEC's production cut agreement. Despite producing over 1 million barrels a day, the country's finances remain precarious, with warnings of a looming monetary and fiscal crisis due to underinvestment and bloated government expenditure. Libya's oil revenues are at risk due to sabotage, with bloated government expenditure not translating into better services. Challenges persist in budget execution, exacerbated by rivalries among key national institutions like the Central Bank, National Oil Company, and Libya Investment Authority. Political competition has fueled opaque rivalries, with the Central Bank officials in Tripoli and Bayda caught in the crossfire between the GNA Presidency Council and the HOR government. In May 2016, the Bayda-based bank attempted to issue its own currency and access secured assets. In 2016, the Bayda-based bank attempted to issue its own currency and access secured assets, leading to warnings from the U.S. government. In December 2017, the HOR nominated a replacement for the Tripoli-based Central Bank chairman, causing protests from the GNA State Council. The HOR nominee, Mohammed Shukri, was confirmed as head of the Bayda-based bank in January 2018. The Tripoli Central Bank invalidated Bayda-issued dinar coins in late 2017. In August 2016, the GNA Presidency Council named an interim steering committee for the LIA after disputes between rival board members. The leadership of the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) is in dispute, with assets exceeding $60 billion frozen. The GNA authorized a steering committee for legal proceedings, but court rulings invalidated the appointment. Questions about the value and status of LIA assets persist, with reports of assets being redirected in other countries. Disputes over assets held by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) have persisted, with conflicting reports and denials from LIA officials. The National Oil Company has also faced disputes, including sanctions on an oil tanker in 2016 and disagreements between Tripoli and Benghazi branches. Benghazi-based NOC officials lifted force majeure orders on oil terminals seized by LNA forces, leading to further complications. The Tripoli-based NOC Chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, emphasized the need for depoliticizing the NOC and maintaining neutrality until a single legitimate government is established. The UN Security Council Resolution 2362 (2017) highlighted the importance of the Government of National Accord overseeing key institutions urgently. Despite efforts to unify the country, transnational terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb remain active in Libya. The Islamic State established a branch in Libya in 2014, with three provinces and control of Sirte. By early 2016, they had around 6,000 personnel in the country. The U.S. designated them as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in May 2016. IS supporters in Libya faced resistance from local armed groups, including Islamists, who do not recognize IS leader Baghdadi. They failed to control Darnah and were defeated in Benghazi by LNA-affiliated forces. IS fighters also sought control over national oil and water infrastructure in 2016. In 2016, pro-GNA militia forces, supported by U.S. military airstrikes, confronted IS fighters in Sirte, Libya. U.S.-backed Libyan forces regained control of the city but suffered casualties. The U.S. sanctioned IS financiers in Libya in April 2017. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Manchester in May 2017. The U.N. Secretary-General noted that IS no longer controlled territory in Libya by August. In September 2017, U.S. strikes targeted IS personnel and equipment south of Sirte. The United States aims to track, hunt, and degrade IS capabilities through precision strikes and partnering with Libyan forces. IS forces claimed an attack in Misrata in October 2017. Additional U.S. strikes on IS targets were reported in November 2017. AFRICOM expects IS to prioritize restructuring security forces and infrastructure in January 2018. The Islamic State in Libya is dispersed and disorganized, capable of localized attacks. U.S. military support for anti-IS fighters will continue, emphasizing political reconciliation for lasting security. IS claimed responsibility for attacks on the Libyan High National Election Commission. Islamic State leaders have called for attacks on election sites in multiple countries. Since the 1990s, Islamist militant activity in Libya has been concentrated in the eastern part of the country, with groups like the Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade forming new coalitions post-2011 revolution. Ansar al Sharia emerged in 2012, showcasing transnational appeal. Islamic State leaders have urged attacks on election sites in various countries, encouraging supporters in Libya to regroup for new strikes. Ansar al Sharia, a Salafist-jihadist organization in Libya, emerged in 2012 and was part of the Benghazi Revolutionaries' Shura Council. The group was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the U.S. State Department in 2014. In May 2017, Ansar al Sharia announced its dissolution. Supporters in Darnah helped expel the Islamic State from the city. Militia members from Benghazi, including Islamists, have sought refuge in Darnah and are facing attacks from the Libyan National Army (LNA). The Islamic State supporters in Benghazi have moved to Darnah and are being targeted by LNA operations. The relationship between IS supporters and other jihadist groups in Libya is unclear. Some IS fighters fled Sirte for southwestern Libya, where Al Qaeda members are active. Remote areas in the region serve as safe havens for terrorist activities. The AQIM-affiliated Al Murabitoun group is active in the area and poses a significant threat to U.S. and international interests. In June 2015, a U.S. airstrike targeted Al Murabitoun leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar, linked to the 2013 Algeria gas facility attack. His death remains unconfirmed. In 2016, a French airstrike also targeted Belmokhtar. In early 2017, Al Murabitoun merged with other jihadist networks in Mali. In March 2018, AQIM senior figure Musa Abu Dawud was killed in a U.S. airstrike in southwest Libya. Libyan citizens have faced economic and security challenges since 2011. Since 2011, Libyan citizens have faced economic challenges due to unreliable state support, inflation, and hard currency shortages. SRSG Salam\u00e9 highlighted the increasing kidnapping for profit and described an economic system of predation. He urged action against organized groups involved in smuggling and called for an end to the plundering of public money by armed groups like the LNA and militias aligned with the GNA. The GNA and militias in Libya are involved in illicit activities and operate informal detention centers where human rights abuses occur. A report by the UN and UNSMIL highlighted arbitrary detention based on tribal or political affiliations, with little recourse to justice for victims. The 2017 State Department report noted the GNA's limited control over security forces and widespread impunity for human rights abuses. Limited steps were taken to investigate these abuses, but constraints on resources hindered prosecution of perpetrators. The judicial system in Libya is paralyzed due to intimidation by armed actors, hindering the investigation and prosecution of human rights abuses. The country's interim Constitutional Declaration protects the rights of non-Muslims, but religious minorities have been abused by the Islamic State organization. LNA forces have targeted opponents they consider to be Islamists. The report highlights the enforcement of Islamic law by armed non-state actors in Libya, with limited government control leading to condemnations of violence against minority religious groups. Conflict and weak governance have turned Libya into a hub for migrants seeking to reach Europe. In March 2018, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that over 662,000 migrants were in Libya, with more than 165,000 internally displaced persons and over 48,400 refugees and asylum seekers. In 2016, over 181,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea, with the majority departing from western Libya. The central Mediterranean route saw at least 4,581 deaths in transit, making 2016 the deadliest year for migrants in the Mediterranean. In 2017, at least 119,310 migrants arrived in Italy by sea. In 2017, 119,310 migrants arrived in Italy by sea, with 2,824 deaths on the central Mediterranean route. This marked a 34% decrease in sea arrivals and a 38% decrease in deaths compared to 2016. Efforts by Italian and EU authorities in Libya contributed to the decline, but critics argue that these policies empower local militia groups, posing risks to migrants' rights and security. Reports indicate that migrants transiting Libya face difficult living conditions, human rights violations, and violence from armed groups, smugglers, and authorities. Instances of abuse and \"slave markets\" have been reported, highlighting the challenges in providing assistance and improving coordination in the region. Reports indicate that migrants in Libya face difficult living conditions, human rights violations, and violence from armed groups, smugglers, and authorities. Some migrants are subject to extortion, exploitative detention, and grave abuses, including sexual violence. The humanitarian situation in Libya has deteriorated, with refugees and migrants experiencing violence, forced labor, and other grave violations. Libya has been designated as a \"special case\" for weak governance and ongoing conflict, hindering efforts to address trafficking. The GNA in Libya struggled to address trafficking due to a focus on territorial control and countering extremist violence. The country serves as a destination and transit point for forced labor and sex trafficking from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Libyan children are recruited by armed groups within the country. Human trafficking persists due to instability and lack of government oversight, proving profitable for traffickers. European countries have long worked to limit trafficking from Libya to southern Europe and save migrants at sea. The European Union established a naval force in 2015, known as EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia, to combat smugglers and traffickers in the Southern Central Mediterranean. The force was authorized to inspect and seize vessels suspected of involvement in migrant smuggling or human trafficking off the coast of Libya. In 2016, the force was tasked with training the Libyan coast guard and navy, as well as enforcing the United Nations arms embargo. The EU established EUNAVFOR MED Operation Sophia in 2015 to combat smugglers in the Southern Central Mediterranean. The mission has saved over 42,000 lives at sea and supports the arms embargo. In 2017 and 2018, the EU Trust Fund allocated \u20ac90 million and \u20ac115 million for migrant protection programs. Additionally, the EU provided \u20ac46 million for border security in Libya and \u20ac50 million for Libyan municipalities hosting migrants. A Task Force was created by the EU, African Union, and United Nations to address migrant detention and slavery concerns. The Task Force established by the EU, African Union, and United Nations aims to improve migrant protection along migration routes to, from, and in Libya. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has facilitated the voluntary return of over 15,000 migrants to their home countries from Libya since December 2017. The Task Force has also supported UNHCR-led evacuations of more than 1,300 refugees from Libya as of March 2018. Concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of some evacuees, and the presence of terrorist organizations in Libya poses a security risk. U.S. policy in Libya has shifted from intervention in 2011 to efforts to contain the effects of state collapse and support transition. Efforts to contain and mitigate the negative effects of state collapse in Libya have been successful in ending the Islamic State organization's control over territory. However, little progress has been made towards achieving durable political reconciliation. Armed groups empowered under counterterrorism arrangements may complicate efforts to achieve negotiated agreements. U.S. and Libyan officials share concerns about remaining extremists, weak state institutions, and un-policed borders. Current U.S. efforts focus on supporting the implementation of the U.N. Action Plan in Libya. The Trump Administration has maintained U.S. recognition of the GNA and signaled continuing interest in providing U.S. foreign aid and security assistance to support Libya's transition. Key visits by U.S. officials and Libyan Prime Minister have taken place, but a Special Envoy for Libya has not been appointed to replace Jonathan Winer. The State Department suspended operations at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli in July 2014. U.S. diplomats engage with Libyans via the Libya External Office in Tunisia. U.S. Ambassador to Libya retired in December 2017, and a new Ambassador-designate had not been nominated as of May 2018. The Trump Administration imposed conditional restrictions on the entry of Libyan nationals to the United States. U.S. officials support U.N.-facilitated reconciliation efforts in Libya. The U.N. Security Council, along with the U.S., supports the 2015 LPA as the key framework for ending the Libyan political crisis and transitioning to elections. They reject any attempts to undermine the U.N.-facilitated political process and oppose a military solution to the crisis. The U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on Libyan leaders for obstructing the implementation of the LPA and smuggling oil. The U.N. Security Council extended the maritime arms embargo in June 2017. Libyan parties are urged to engage with the U.N. to strengthen the Libyan Political Agreement and prepare for free and fair elections. In June 2017, the U.N. Security Council extended maritime arms embargo enforcement provisions for one year in Resolution 2357. Resolution 2362 reaffirmed existing arms embargo measures and U.S. naval forces interdicted an unauthorized oil shipment in 2014. The EU's EUNAVFOR MED mission monitors oil shipments to and from Libya. U.S. officials acknowledge security risks in post-Qadhafi Libya and have worked with Libyan security figures to assess security assistance needs. In 2014, plans for U.S. assistance in creating a General Purpose Force in Libya were shelved due to conflict. By early 2016, U.S. officials expressed increased security concerns about the Islamic State in Libya, hinting at potential military action. Despite downplaying intervention publicly, U.S. military personnel were deployed to liaise with partner forces. U.N. Security Council resolutions urged Member States to assist the Government of National Accord (GNA) in combating security threats and extremist groups. In August 2016, GNA Prime Minister-designate Sarraj requested U.S. military assistance to combat the Islamic State in Sirte. U.S. strikes began in August 2016, leading to the degradation and eviction of IS forces from the city by December 2016. Some IS fighters regrouped in rural areas and launched attacks on Libyan forces in 2017. In January 2018, AFRICOM projected IS would focus on restructuring security forces and infrastructure, potentially targeting the Libyan oil crescent. General Waldhauser described IS forces in Libya as dispersed and disorganized, capable of localized attacks. He emphasized the importance of political reconciliation for lasting security, stating that stability in Libya will require strategic patience. AFRICOM's objectives for Libya include degrading terrorist groups. Waldhauser warned of the risk of a full-scale civil war in his March 2018 testimony. AFRICOM's objectives for Libya include degrading terrorist groups, averting civil war, supporting political reconciliation for a unified central government, and helping curb illegal migration into Europe. U.S. airstrikes targeted Islamic State positions in 2017, killing fighters and destroying arms. In October 2017, U.S. forces seized a suspect in the 2012 Benghazi attacks. In March 2018, AFRICOM announced the death of an AQIM senior figure. In March 2018, AFRICOM announced the death of AQIM senior figure Musa Abu Dawud in a U.S. airstrike near Ubari in southwest Libya. President Trump's letter to Congress acknowledged U.S. strikes against terrorist targets in Libya, authorized by the 2001 AUMF. In April 2018, Libya joined the TSCTP program for counterterrorism efforts. AFRICOM is involved in security assistance programs for the Government of National Accord in Libya. The US Defense Department's FY2019 request includes funding for security assistance in the AFRICOM area of responsibility, benefiting Libyan entities and addressing threats from Libya. Congress has authorized border security assistance to Tunisia and Egypt. The US is also providing stabilization and transition assistance in Libya using foreign assistance funding. Since the 2014 withdrawal of US personnel, programs have continued in Libya. The US continues to provide stabilization and transition support to Libya through programs administered from outside the country. Administration officials have notified Congress of planned aid obligations for 2017 and 2018, including funding for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives, civil society support programs, and UN stabilization efforts in Libya. The US has allocated funding for various programs in Libya, including civil society support, UN stabilization efforts, governance programs, monitoring, reconciliation, and training for the GNA Ministry of Interior. The Trump Administration has requested $34.5 million for Libya programming in FY2019. The United States has provided over $90 million in humanitarian assistance to Libya since 2011, with funding fluctuating based on needs. In FY2016 and FY2017, $28.325 million was allocated, including contributions to UN humanitarian plans and programs overseen by the State Department and USAID. The 2018 UN plan for Libya sought $312.7 million, with only 11.3% funded by May 2018. Libya is subject to restrictions on entry for certain nationals under Executive Order 13780. The Trump Administration issued further guidance on entry restrictions for Libyan nationals in various visa classes due to challenges in information sharing and terrorism presence in Libya. Entry restrictions for Libyan nationals in various visa classes have been imposed by the United States due to a substantial terrorist presence in Libya. The Trump Administration suspended the entry of Libyan nationals as immigrants and nonimmigrants on business, tourist, and business/tourist visas. This decision was met with criticism from authorities in eastern Libya, who viewed it as a dangerous escalation. The 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the emergence of terrorist threats in Libya have influenced these restrictions. The conflict and instability in Libya have led to concerns in Washington about U.S. policy towards the country. Congressional debates have focused on security issues, weapons proliferation, and the challenges of political transition. The emergence of Islamic State supporters in Libya has heightened apprehension about continued instability. As of 2018, there seems to be some consensus between the executive branch and Congress on the situation. As of 2018, there is consensus between the executive branch and Congress on limited security and transition support programs in Libya, addressing U.S. concerns about unsecured weapons, terrorist safe havens, and border security. Congress has allocated funding for these programs for FY2018 and is considering additional funds for FY2019. Legislation requires Libyan cooperation in investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks and detailed spending plans for appropriated funds. U.S. assistance to Libya for infrastructure projects is prohibited except on a loan basis with favorable terms. The foreign operations appropriations act for FY2018 carries forward some past terms and conditions on U.S. assistance to Libya, including a requirement for notice to Congress in cases of aid diversion or destruction. Terrorist threats and political competition in Libya have hindered the development of robust partnerships and assistance programs. The desire to empower an inclusive government and rebuild state security forces has been challenged by armed non-state groups and weak institutions in post-Qadhafi Libya. The strength of armed non-state groups, weak institutions, and lack of political consensus among Libya's interim leaders continue to complicate governance and economic viability. Control over national institutions, territory, and energy infrastructure remains a key factor in Libya's power balance. Some Libyans questioned the need for foreign support for security reform, while others rejected international assistance during the conflict. Accusations of disloyalty and treason have been exchanged among factions in response to reports of foreign involvement. The U.S. partnership approach in Libya faces challenges as Libyan actors trade accusations of disloyalty and treason over foreign partnerships. Questions arise about the effectiveness of external assistance and sanctions in achieving shared objectives. U.S. officials weigh options for building Libyan capacity quickly and cheaply, considering the reliability of interim leaders. U.S. officials are debating the effectiveness of interim leaders in Libya and the impact of U.S. action on Libyan politics. Questions remain about when U.S. intervention is necessary, especially in light of the threat from the Islamic State. Efforts are ongoing to implement the U.N.-backed Action Plan, with potential steps including a constitutional referendum and national elections in 2018 or later. The success of U.N.-backed reconciliation could lead to improved stability in Libya. The potential failure of U.N.-promoted reconciliation efforts in Libya may force U.S. decisionmakers to make tough choices regarding security and economic partnerships. Questions arise about the return of U.S. personnel, assistance for stabilization, human rights violations, sanctions, and coercive measures against obstructing parties. The U.N.-sponsored Action Plan in Libya is facing obstacles, including debates on military intervention against terrorist groups, responding to actions of third parties like Russia, amending U.N. arms embargo provisions, supporting national security forces, and addressing potential military clashes between rival factions. Congressional debates and oversight can influence U.S. policy and engagement with Libyan actors. The U.S. administration is refining programs to support the Government of National Accord in Libya, planning for potential third-party interventions, expanding partnerships if reconciliation measures succeed, and considering the possibility of prolonged instability despite negotiations and elections. Libya has a rich history as a center of various civilizations, with three distinct regions. In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire struggled to control Libya's coastal cities and interior. Italy invaded in 1911, leading to decades of colonial abuses. Libya was a key battleground in WWII and gained independence in 1951. A constitution established a federal system with King Idris Al Sanussi as central authority. After gaining independence in 1951, Libya established a parliamentary system with a Council of Ministers and a bicameral legislature. The first election took place in February 1952. King Idris centralized royal authority in 1963 to streamline the development of oil resources. Before the discovery of oil in 1959, Libya relied on economic aid and military agreements with the US and UK. The Wheelus field air base in Tripoli was crucial for military operations in the 1950s. Libya's strategic importance as a military intelligence hub in the 1950s and 1960s led to rapid economic growth fueled by oil wealth. The monarchy faced criticism over U.S. and British basing agreements, culminating in King Idris' departure in 1969 and a military coup led by Muammar al Qadhafi. The coup initially presented an anti-Soviet and reformist agenda, focusing on the withdrawal of foreign forces. Qadhafi focused on securing the withdrawal of British and U.S. forces from Libya, pressured foreign oil companies to renegotiate contracts, and supported anti-Western movements. This led to strained U.S.-Libyan relations, marked by military confrontations, terrorism, and sanctions. Qadhafi's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and policy reversals on WMD and terrorism led to the lifting of international sanctions in 2003 and 2004. Economic liberalization, oil sales, and foreign investment brought new wealth to some Libyans. U.S. sanctions were lifted, leading to reengagement of the U.S. business community amid tension over terrorism concerns that were resolved in 2008. Political change in Libya remained elusive, but there were signs of softening suppression of political opposition. The Qadhafi government released imprisoned Islamist militants and exiled opposition figures before the revolution. The Qadhafi government released imprisoned Islamist militants and exiled opposition figures before the revolution, as part of a political reconciliation program. Despite international rehabilitation and minor reform proposals, inaction on guarantees of political rights and constitution drafting set the stage for the 2011 revolution that ended Qadhafi's rule. The 2011 revolution in Libya led to the overthrow of Qadhafi's four-decade rule and his demise in October 2011. Triggered by events in Benghazi and other eastern cities, the government lost control as military officers and civilian officials abandoned Qadhafi. Despite maintaining control over Tripoli and western cities until August 2011, NATO airstrikes and rebel offensives eventually led to his downfall. The 2011 revolution in Libya resulted in the overthrow of Qadhafi's rule and his death in October 2011. Rebel offensives in Tripoli and western Libya forced Qadhafi into retreat and exile. NATO airstrikes continued as rebel fighters battled Qadhafi loyalists. Qadhafi was killed by rebels in Sirte on October 20, 2011, ending the revolt abruptly. The Transitional National Council (TNC) took steps to improve security and reform institutions, leading to the election of the General National Congress (GNC) in July 2012. The GNC assumed power in August 2012 but failed to demobilize militia groups or launch reforms. Libya's post-Qadhafi transition unraveled in late 2013 with assassinations, kidnappings, and clashes within the GNC. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan faced no confidence votes amid militia demands and oil infrastructure seizures. The post-Qadhafi transition in Libya was marked by the failure to demobilize militias, delays in elections, and the ousting of Prime Minister Zeidan by a coalition of Islamist and independent forces. This led to the replacement of the General National Congress with a new House of Representatives, amidst tensions over the roles of armed militias and local communities. The post-Qadhafi transition in Libya faced challenges such as the failure to demobilize militias, delays in elections, and the ousting of Prime Minister Zeidan. Disagreements between Islamist and secular figures, clashes between ethnic groups, and violence against security officers contributed to the collapse of consensus over the transition's direction. The unspoken code of refraining from shedding Libyan blood deteriorated under pressure from violent confrontations and ruthless networks in Benghazi. In May 2014, forces loyal to Qadhafi-era retired General Khalifah Haftar launched an armed campaign dubbed \"Operation Dignity\" to evict Islamist militia groups from eastern Libya. Haftar aimed to cleanse Libya of Islamists, including supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, amidst fears of civil strife and chaos following Qadhafi's downfall. In May 2014, General Khalifah Haftar launched \"Operation Dignity\" to remove Islamist militia groups from eastern Libya. Haftar's actions intensified the regional struggle between pro- and anti-Islamist forces, leading to polarization along ideological and community lines in Libya. This polarization was evident during a 2014 political struggle between Prime Minister Abdullah Al Thinni's supporters and the leading coalition of Islamists and independents within the GNC. Haftar faced challenges from armed extremist military opponents and more moderate political adversaries, resulting in setbacks for the Operation Dignity military campaign by late 2014. Haftar's forces faced setbacks from Ansar al Sharia and allies in Benghazi, but made progress in early 2016. Fighting in Benghazi caused mass displacement and shortages. In western Libya, clashes erupted in mid-2014 between coalitions for control of Tripoli. Tensions between militia groups in western Libya predated Haftar's operations in the east. Fighting in the two theaters became intertwined, with some western-based forces supporting Haftar's campaign while others mobilized against his allies. The Fajr Libya coalition, including militias from Misrata, launched an offensive in July 2014 to take control of Tripoli's main airport. The international airport in Libya was held by rival militias from different brigades. Control over national infrastructure was a key factor in the fighting, which decreased in intensity in 2015 due to localized cease-fire agreements. The United Nations-facilitated dialogue process in 2015 led to the Government of National Accord agreement, building on improved security conditions and trust between conflicting coalitions. Between 2011 and 2014, the U.S. provided over $25 million in assistance to Libya, focusing on transition and security sector support. Some U.S. personnel were temporarily withdrawn after the 2012 Benghazi attacks, affecting the implementation of assistance programs. Security assistance programs were disrupted but reinstated by late 2013. After the 2012 Benghazi attacks, some U.S. personnel were temporarily withdrawn, disrupting security assistance programs, which were reinstated by late 2013."
