    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established the renewable fuel standard (RFS), requiring the use of biofuels like ethanol in the nation's fuel supply. The RFS mandate has driven the growth of U.S. biofuels industries, with ethanol production increasing from 3.9 billion gallons in 2005 to 14 billion gallons in 2013. Obligated parties meet their RFS obligations by surrendering Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to the EPA. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels like ethanol in the nation's fuel supply. Obligated parties meet their RFS obligations by surrendering Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to the EPA. RINs are produced and traded like commodities, but recent fraud cases have raised concerns about market integrity. The RFS required blending 16.55 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2013, increasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Policy considerations are being discussed to address RIN fraud going forward. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels, with an increasing share from advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuel and BBD fuels. The mandate was mostly met with U.S. corn ethanol in 2013, but by 2015 corn ethanol's share is capped at 15 billion gallons per year. The EISA amendments specifically require the use of cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel fuel, but production has been slow to develop. Sub-mandates exist for specific types of fuel within the overall RFS mandate. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels, with an increasing share from advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuel and BBD fuels. In 2013, 16.55 billion gallons of biofuels were required, with 2.75 billion for advanced biofuels. The advanced biofuel carve-out included 1.28 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel and 6 million gallons for cellulosic biofuels. The EPA sets percentage standards based on expected total U.S. gasoline and diesel demand. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels, with increasing shares from advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuel and BBD fuels. Different types of biofuels qualify for specific mandates within the RFS, with each gallon assigned a RIN for compliance measurement. RINs are detached once biofuels are sold or blended into conventional fuels, allowing them to be bought and sold as commodities. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels, with each gallon assigned a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) for compliance measurement. RINs are detached when biofuels are sold or blended into conventional fuels, allowing them to be bought and sold as commodities. Fuel suppliers calculate their renewable volume obligations (RVO) at the end of each year based on percentage standards and must submit the required RINs to the EPA. Excess RINs can be sold to others or saved for future use. Each RIN is a unique 38-character number issued by biofuel producers or importers, indicating the type of biofuel it represents. The RFS mandates the use of biofuels, with each gallon assigned a RIN for compliance. RINs represent the type of biofuel and are detached when sold or blended. The RIN block indicates the ethanol-equivalent gallons of renewable fuel for compliance. Parties must register with the EPA and follow record-keeping guidelines. Traders must register with the EPA and follow RIN guidelines for renewable biomass fuel. RIN transactions must be cleared through the EMTS, with RINs transferred when biofuels change ownership. The EPA views the EMTS as a screening system for RINs, with obligated parties responsible for due diligence. RINs can be bought and sold in spot markets, but their values may not be completely fungible due to different fuel mandates. Biodiesel RINs can be used to meet various fuel mandates, but their value diminishes over time. Corn ethanol RINs historically traded at lower prices compared to other RINs. Advanced biofuel RIN prices typically follow BBD RIN prices. The advanced biofuel RIN price generally follows the BBD RIN price, with spikes and drops in prices observed in 2011 and 2012. Ethanol RIN prices also saw a significant increase in 2013 due to concerns over corn production. Stakeholders have identified various factors for the price fluctuations. Many stakeholders are concerned about the fuel supply approaching a \"blend wall\" due to factors limiting ethanol content in gasoline to 10%. To meet RFS mandates, obligated parties may need to blend ethanol at higher concentrations, sell it as an alternative fuel for FFVs, or supply non-ethanol biofuels. The rise in corn ethanol RIN prices in 2013 reflects a scarcity in RINs not seen before. In 2013, there is a concern about a scarcity of RINs not seen in previous years. Some stakeholders worry that non-fuel traders may be speculating in RIN markets, leading to price increases. The market for RINs is potentially large, but the amount of trading is unclear. EPA reports total RINs registered by month, but does not provide detailed data. Limited publicly available data shows total RINs registered for 2012 and 2013. In late 2011 and early 2012, EPA issued Notices of Violations to companies for fraudulently generating biodiesel RINs. In late 2011 and early 2012, EPA issued Notices of Violations to companies for fraudulently generating 140 million biodiesel RINs. Subsequently, individuals from two of these companies faced criminal prosecution. Limited information is available due to potentially criminal actions, with uncertainty about future NOVs. The fraudulent RINs represent roughly 11% of biodiesel RINs generated between mid-2010 and 2011. The EPA issued Notices of Violations in late 2011 and early 2012 to companies for fraudulently generating 140 million biodiesel RINs, representing 11% of biodiesel RINs generated between mid-2010 and 2011. Obligated parties who purchased fraudulent RINs must pay fines and submit valid RINs to offset the fraudulent ones, incurring economic costs including the original cost of the RINs, penalties to EPA, and the cost of make-up RINs. EPA and companies typically settle fines at around $0.10 per RIN. The EPA is considering establishing a quality assurance program for RINs to prevent fraud. This program would involve third-party certification of RINs, providing an \"affirmative defense\" for obligated parties using certified RINs. This would protect parties from civil penalties under the Clean Air Act. A key component of this program would be a quality assurance plan (QAP). The EPA is considering establishing a quality assurance program for RINs to prevent fraud, involving third-party certification and an affirmative defense for obligated parties. Key questions include whether this defense would eliminate the need to purchase make-up RINs, with biofuel producers arguing it could undermine the legitimate RIN market. EPA's proposed rule requires replacement of invalid RINs by the generator, verifier, or obligated party to address RIN fraud issues. The EPA is considering policy options to address RIN fraud, including establishing a Quality Assurance Program and certification procedures. Currently, market participants are independently determining the validity of RINs. After RIN fraud came to light, obligated parties now only trust biodiesel and biodiesel RINs from large producers. Small producers struggle with verification costs. Some believe RIN fraud prosecutions have improved market integrity, but new cases have emerged. Two cases of RIN fraud (one civil, one criminal) have been uncovered, dating back to 2009 or 2010. The National Biodiesel Board (NBB) is working on a formal RIN certification process to address market integrity concerns. Biodiesel producers have set up a RIN Integrity Network for obligated parties to subscribe to, providing information on participating producers. The industry is exploring various approaches, including third-party audits and an affirmative defense for users of certified RINs to avoid penalties under the Clean Air Act. The proposal suggests that certified RINs would not face penalties under the Clean Air Act, but if found fraudulent, additional RINs would need to be purchased. This could increase compliance costs for obligated parties. There are concerns that waiving this requirement could harm legitimate biofuel producers. Legislation has been introduced to establish a RIN certification system to prevent invalidation of certified RINs. The bill proposed to prevent the agency from invalidating certified RINs, even if found to be fraudulent, which would impact compliance for obligated parties. Biofuel producers were unlikely to support this blanket protection. Concerns about RIN fraud in the future and its effects on stakeholders remain, with questions about unreported instances and potential future fraud types. In the first three cases of RIN fraud reported by EPA, fraudulent RINs were generated for non-existent fuel. Other potential fraud opportunities include double counting, improper splitting of RIN batches, improper reporting of RIN data, and failure to report exports. EPA alleges these issues occurred under the January 2014 criminal case. The EPA alleges that errors in the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) system, such as generating fraudulent RINs for non-existent fuel, have occurred. The Electronic Matching Transaction System (EMTS) was created to address these errors, but it is uncertain if it completely screens them out. Real-time reporting requirements may lead to errors if entities feel rushed, although it could also help catch irregularities more easily. Stakeholders have raised concerns about fuel being exported without the necessary RINs. The EPA has raised concerns about errors in the RIN system, including the potential for fraudulent RINs. There have been instances of fuel being exported without the required RINs, leading to a possible oversupply of RINs and lower prices. This could result in lower domestic renewable fuel use than mandated by the act. The biodiesel market has seen cases of fraud due to the high value of RINs and limited verification procedures. Industry actions, EPA regulations, and potential congressional action may address some reasons for fraud, but the high price of RINs may persist. The RFS requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. The RFS mandates 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, with 16 billion from cellulosic biofuels. Limited production and high costs of cellulosic fuels may lead to a higher market value, potentially attracting those seeking to bypass the law. Obligated parties seek an affirmative defense in new certification systems to avoid penalties for acting in good faith. Biofuel producers benefit from policy changes that require obligated parties to purchase make-up RINs, preventing the market from shrinking due to fraudulent RINs. Third-party certification procedures add costs, which may be passed on to consumers by obligated parties or absorbed by larger biofuel producers through economies of scale. Smaller producers may struggle to spread the additional costs. The Renewable Fuel Standard has created a market for RINs that has grown in volume and value over time, benefiting biofuel producers. Smaller producers may face increased per-gallon production costs compared to larger competitors. Fraud cases in the biodiesel RIN market raise concerns about market integrity and EPA oversight. Corn ethanol RINs saw a significant increase in 2013, raising further questions about the RIN system. The dramatic increase in corn ethanol RINs in 2013 has raised questions about the RIN system and the overall RFS. Proposed policies will impact RIN markets and market players."
