    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a key agricultural trading partner and competitor of the United States in global markets. In the 2008-2010 period, the EU accounted for 20% of total U.S. merchandise exports and 8% of U.S. agricultural-product exports. It was the fifth most important destination for U.S. agricultural products, but the top source for U.S. agricultural-product imports. Both the U.S. and the EU provide significant government support to their agricultural sectors, with the OECD reporting that they accounted for 60% of all government support to agriculture in 2009. The EU and the United States provide significant government support to their agricultural sectors, accounting for 60% of all government support among major developed economies. While the U.S. focuses on price and income support programs for row crops, dairy, and sugar, the EU offers more extensive support for a wider range of farm and food products including fruits, vegetables, and livestock. EU's total agricultural support is generally higher than the U.S., but actual levels vary based on the definition of \"agricultural support.\" The EU and the United States provide significant government support to their agricultural sectors, with the EU generally offering more extensive support for a wider range of farm and food products. Actual support levels vary based on the definition of \"agricultural support.\" In 2006-2007, the EU spent an average of $119.7 billion per year compared to $86.2 billion by the United States, with different ratios depending on the type of support considered. The OECD estimates that in 2009, the EU accounted for nearly half of all government support for agriculture among major developed economies, compared to the U.S. The U.S. has more farmland but fewer farms than the EU, leading to differences in agricultural support levels. The EU has higher outlays per unit of land compared to the US, while the US has larger outlays per farm than the EU. The technological scale of agricultural production varies greatly across the EU's 27 member nations, making it challenging to generalize EU farm policy effects compared to the US. Eastern European countries in the EU have been slow to adopt Western technology due to small agricultural holdings. For example, the US has 2.2 million farms with an average size of 418 acres per farm, while Romania has nearly 4 million farm holdings with an average of 9.4 acres each. The country of Italy has 1.7 million farms with an average size of 23 acres, limiting benefits from economies of scale. The EU has a larger commercial animal population compared to the US, with smaller average animal numbers per farm. The small size of EU farm holdings and larger rural population have influenced EU farm policy towards rural development and exemptions for small farming units. Comparing EU and US farm policies is crucial on a global level. The EU and U.S. farm support programs are compared using data from WTO notifications and the OECD's policy database. Both regions use similar policy instruments like price and income supports, direct payments, supply controls, and border measures to support their agricultural sectors. The comparison is important as the U.S. prepares for farm bill negotiations and WTO Doha negotiations progress. The origins and evolution of U.S. and EU farm policies differ, with the U.S. policy dating back to the 1930s Great Depression and the EU policy emerging after World War II. The initial focus of U.S. farm policy was on supporting commodity prices and rural incomes, while the EU's policy aimed at addressing food shortages in the post-war era. The EU's initial policy focus was on ensuring internal food supplies, leading to large agricultural imports from the United States. Technological advances in the late 1950s resulted in the accumulation of U.S. stocks of grains and cotton. In response, the U.S. implemented supply management provisions in the 1960s. The economic crisis of the early 1970s raised global commodity prices, prompting both the U.S. and the EU to increase support for their agricultural sectors. The U.S. established commodity-price targets linked to production costs. In the mid-1980s, generous price and income supports in the US and EU led to over-production and large stock accumulations, causing global stocks to reach record levels and putting pressure on budgets for reform. Both nations hesitated to make unilateral changes for fear of losing market share in the competitive international marketplace. The US began to gradually reduce direct farm support levels with the 1985 farm bill. The 1985 farm bill (P.L. 99-198) in the US lowered price-support loan rates, froze income support target prices, and introduced special marketing loan provisions for rice and cotton. The 1990 farm bill (P.L. 101-624) reduced acreage eligible for income support payments and tied acreage set-asides to end-of-season stocks. The EU also initiated agricultural policy reforms in 1992 with the MacSharry Reforms. The drive to reform farm policy towards a more liberalized market and trade environment was further solidified in the legal texts of the World Trade Organization in 1994. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, concluded in 1994, marked a significant shift in global trade by applying similar rules to agricultural trade as those for industrial goods. WTO members committed to reducing domestic support, limiting export subsidies, and improving market access. The US followed suit with the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127), which aimed for a more market-oriented agricultural policy by eliminating acreage reduction programs and government-owned grain reserves. The 1996 farm bill replaced target-price deficiency payments with direct payments and extended marketing loan repayment provisions to major program crops, reducing USDA's role in commodity storage. The EU also shifted towards a more market-oriented farm policy with Agenda 2000 reforms, lowering support prices and introducing production-based direct payments. Subsequent reforms in 2003 continued this trend. Since the mid-1980s, the United States and the EU have been reforming their farm programs to shift towards less market-distorting support programs like rural development and farmland conservation. Non-commodity support now makes up the majority of agricultural support in both regions, with the US at 88% and the EU at 69%. Congressional support for US farm programs has historically been strong. The EU holds a 69% share in agricultural support programs, similar to the US. Critics question the necessity of government intervention in farm programs, which has hindered WTO trade negotiations. Current US farm support includes direct and indirect assistance to producers and consumers. The omnibus farm bill (P.L. 110-246) provides comprehensive support for agriculture, including commodity price and income support, trade, marketing, rural development, conservation, and consumer food assistance. This legislation covers various areas such as commodity crops, livestock, conservation, nutrition, trade, research, farm credit, rural development, energy, and forestry. Policymakers use this bill every five or six years to address agricultural and food issues comprehensively. Traditional farm programs provide price and income support to producers of select commodities like grains, oilseeds, and cotton through direct payments, counter-cyclical assistance payments, commodity marketing loans, and loan-related subsidies. The dairy sector also receives price support through government purchases of surplus dairy products and income support via the Milk Income Loss Contract program. Payments are linked to market prices, decreasing as prices rise and increasing as prices fall below support targets. The government provides price and income support to dairy farmers when market prices fall below target levels. Sugar is also supported through a minimum pricing system. Support levels vary yearly based on market conditions, with average commodity support levels remaining consistent. The cost of commodity price and income support programs was estimated at $8.3 billion per year under the 2008 farm bill, decreasing to $6.9 billion per year in recent projections for the FY2011 to FY2015 period. During the FY2011 to FY2015 period, U.S. farmers may be eligible for federally subsidized crop insurance and disaster assistance payments, with federal crop insurance outlays estimated to average about $7.8 billion per year. Conservation programs introduced by Congress aim to help producers adopt farming practices that preserve or enhance the environment, with programs focusing on land retirement and easement as well as \"working lands\" programs. Land retirement and easement programs involve taking land out of crop production and providing rental payments and cost-sharing for longer-term conservation coverage. The 2008 farm bill introduced new rural development programs for infrastructure improvements, community services, and business development. It also expanded farm conservation and rural development programs, particularly in the bioenergy sector. The average cost of mandatory conservation and rural development programs under this bill was estimated to be $4.8 billion per year. The largest component of U.S. agricultural support is domestic food assistance authorized under Title IV of the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill introduced new rural development programs and expanded farm conservation efforts, particularly in the bioenergy sector. The largest component of U.S. agricultural support is domestic food assistance, mainly the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP). Actual participation in SNAP and other nutrition programs has exceeded expectations due to economic conditions and changes in eligible participants. Rural development, conservation, and nutrition programs have not received the same emphasis on reform or downsizing compared to commodity-specific programs in recent years. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) governs agricultural policies and programs for the EU's 27 member countries, established in 1962 with principles of a unified market, product preference for domestic production, and financial solidarity. The CAP aimed to increase agricultural productivity, ensure fair living standards for farmers, stabilize markets, ensure food availability, and provide food at reasonable prices through interventions in commodity markets. The EU implemented variable tariffs on imported agricultural products to prevent undercutting of high internal prices from intervention buying. Export subsidies were used to eliminate surpluses. This system was carried out in various common market organizations for a wide range of agricultural products. Unintended consequences of the CAP included high consumer prices and budget expenditures, with the CAP accounting for up to 70% of the total EU budget in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the CAP accounted for 70% of the EU budget, criticized for distorting world markets. As the EU expanded, budget outlays increased, leading to reforms in the early 1990s to reduce liabilities. Policy changes since 1992 have made the CAP more market-oriented, reducing costs and aligning with WTO. The evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been influenced by objectives such as maintaining rural life quality, improving the environment, and protecting animal welfare. Reforms in 1992 and 2000 reduced EU commodity support prices towards market levels and required farmland to be taken out of production. Budget disciplines in 2002 aimed to reduce community spending growth on the CAP. In 2003, the Midterm Review established two pillars in the EU's agricultural budget: Pillar I for direct payments and market support, and Pillar II for rural development policies. In 2003, reforms imposed a spending ceiling on Pillar I of the EU's agricultural budget, limiting increases to 1 percent per year from 2007-2013. Budget restrictions have substantially limited Pillar II spending for rural development. Farm income support is now contingent on meeting agricultural and environmental norms introduced in 2003. Reforms were also undertaken for programs supporting hops, Mediterranean commodities, sugar, and wine sectors in subsequent years. The 2008 CAP Health Check further simplified the direct aid system. The 2003 reforms simplified the CAP's direct aid system, shifted funding to rural development, increased milk quotas leading to their abolition in 2015, and introduced the decoupled single farm payment (SFP). The SFP replaced production-based payments and largely decoupled support from prices or production. Partial decoupling was eliminated by the 2008 CAP Health Check for all but a few commodities by 2012. Total reported spending for the EU's farm budget was constrained by spending ceilings imposed in 2003. The EU's farm programs, including direct aid and support for conservation and rural development, amount to nearly $79.2 billion for 2011, representing 45% of the EU's budget. Direct aids, such as the Single Farm Payment (SFP), require farmers to comply with environmental and agricultural measures known as \"cross-compliance.\" These measures include maintaining farmland, managing water pollution, pesticide use, and protecting habitats. These practices are referred to as \"good agricultural practices\" (GAPs). The EU's rural development policy focuses on competitiveness, environment, and quality of life. Member states co-finance activities, with the EU funding up to 75% of costs. Modulation reduces direct payments to larger farmers to finance rural development. Spending on rural development programs is estimated at about $19 billion (\u20ac13.5 billion). CAP spending for rural development, including agri-environmental programs, is around $19 billion (\u20ac13.5 billion) for 2011, representing about 24% of total EU agricultural spending. Direct farm spending, such as the SFP, makes up 70% of the CAP budget, with the rest allocated to other farm programs and administration. A financial discipline mechanism ensures that spending on direct aid and market support stays within budget limits. In the EU and the United States, agricultural support has decreased as a percentage of total gross farm receipts since the mid-1980s. In the EU and United States, agricultural support has shifted towards non-commodity programs like conservation, rural development, and nutrition, which now make up the majority of total farm support. WTO member countries report their agricultural support to encourage a move away from market-distorting programs. The notification data monitors countries' compliance with WTO limits on domestic agricultural support. Reduction commitments are based on an annual dollar limit to minimize market distortion. The \"aggregate measurement of support\" (AMS) includes all types of support for the agriculture sector, categorized into colored boxes and \"de minimis\" exclusions. The curr_chunk discusses the two main categories of domestic agricultural support programs: Amber box and Blue box programs. Amber box programs include market-distorting payments contingent on agricultural production, while Blue box programs are direct payments made under production-limiting programs. Amber box payments are subject to WTO reduction commitments, while Blue box programs are considered less market-distorting. Green box programs are minimally market-distorting payments, such as research programs, environmental payments, and disaster assistance. They do not require WTO disciplines or count against subsidy ceilings. De minimis exemptions exclude small levels of domestic support that are not likely to distort trade, including commodity-specific and non-product-specific subsidies like irrigation and crop insurance. The AMS data provides a comprehensive account of farm program support, including all program areas and commodities. It includes non-product-specific subsidies below 5% (10% for developing countries) of total agricultural production and product-specific support limited to 5% (10% for developing countries) of annual output. This calculation also considers indirect price supports like import quotas and tariffs. For example, U.S. dairy and sugar programs primarily use non-price mechanisms such as government purchases and marketing quotas, which are captured in the AMS estimate by measuring price differences between domestic and international prices. The AMS data provides a comprehensive account of farm program support by measuring price differences between domestic and international prices and applying it to annual production. The main limitation is the lag in reporting from WTO members, with the most recent U.S. notification reflecting support through 2008 and the EU through 2007. Data for the United States and the European Union is available for the period 1995-2007, but differences in policy priorities and reporting methods between the two entities limit comparability. The U.S. \"green box\" payments include domestic food aid like food stamps and child nutrition programs. Changes in classification of programs can distort historical trends, understating U.S. spending on conservation programs. From 1995 to 2005, the U.S. averaged $10.7 billion annually in commodity-type support, with dairy, grains, pulses, oilseeds, sugar, and cotton receiving the majority of support. During the 2006-2007 period, U.S. domestic support for commodities decreased by 38%, with dairy and sugar programs receiving the largest shares. The U.S. also reduced its use of exemptions, resulting in a decline in Overall Total Domestic Support (OTDS) from $16.5 billion to $10.1 billion. This reduction in support aligns with limits proposed in current Doha negotiating texts. EU amber box support averaged $45.4 billion annually from 1995 to 2005. EU amber box support averaged $45.4 billion annually from 1995 to 2005, significantly higher than the U.S. counterpart's $10.7 billion average. EU commodity payments were spread across various sectors including dairy, sugar, grains, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, olive oil, and wine. Despite this, the EU has reduced commodity-oriented support by 42% to an annual average of $26.4 billion following reforms in the 1990s and early 2000s. The EU decreased commodity-oriented support by 42% to an annual average of $26.4 billion during 2006-2007, with sugar, grain, and oilseeds, and dairy sectors receiving larger shares of support. The EU also saw a significant decline in the use of the blue box exemption, while spending under de minimis exemptions more than doubled. As a result of policy reforms, the EU's annual average Overall Trade-Distorting Support (OTDS) decreased by 48% to $36.9 billion. In 2007, EU amber box support was $18.1 billion. The EU has significantly reduced its domestic support, with a notable decline in market-distorting types of support. Comparing green-box spending between the EU and the United States, the EU has surpassed the US as the top user of green-box programs. EU's green-box spending has more than tripled to $82.8 billion annually, while the US saw a 37% increase to $76.1 billion during the 2006-2007 period. The EU has surpassed the US as the top user of green-box programs, with green-box spending more than tripling to $82.8 billion annually. In the US, green-box outlays increased by 37% to $76.1 billion. The bulk of agricultural support in both regions is now Green-Box programs, with domestic food aid in the US rising by 42% to $54.3 billion. The EU has seen a significant increase in decoupled income support, growing from $1.9 billion to $43 billion, while the US provides less support for environmental and rural development programs but more for domestic food aid. The US reclassified the Conservation Reserve Program as an environmental payment, leading to an increase in environmental payments. The EU's combined value of $5.9 billion is higher than the US's $2.2 billion. In the recent period of 2006-2007, US environmental payments averaged $3.8 billion per year, compared to the EU's $8.2 billion. EU rural development outlays were $9.8 billion and $14.3 billion, while the US had lower outlays of $0.1 billion for both periods. EU rural development spending is substantially larger than US outlays. The EU's development spending is substantially larger than the US's outlays. WTO member-notification data allows countries to categorize their support programs based on their own interpretation of criteria. The OECD's policy data base evaluates agricultural policies in developed countries consistently. OECD data provides a longer time series from 1986 to 2009 and aggregates support levels based on various criteria. The OECD aggregates agricultural policy support levels using the producer support estimate (PSE) and general services support estimates (GSSE) for cross-country comparisons. The PSE reflects the value of policy measures supporting agriculture, including production-based support and payments not tied to production. The PSE measure includes conservation payments, the EU's SFP, and U.S. direct payments, but excludes domestic food assistance and nutrition program payments. PSE is expressed as a percentage of gross farm output value to facilitate cross-country comparisons. The concept of \"non-commodity outputs\" in PSE is linked to the idea of \"multi-functionality\" in agriculture. Agriculture has various functions beyond food and fiber production, including environmental protection, biodiversity preservation, rural viability, and animal welfare. The General Services Support Estimates (GSSE) measure the value of support for the agricultural sector, encompassing areas like research, infrastructure, and food assistance programs. This support is akin to the WTO Green Box. The GSSE support for the agricultural sector is similar to the WTO Green Box, excluding decoupled payments included in the PSE. The OECD report provides historical perspectives on policy reforms and EU enlargement effects. The 2010 OECD report highlights an increase in producer farm support index in 2009 due to a reduction in agricultural production value after high commodity prices in 2008. The OECD report discusses a shift away from market-distorting supports towards new policy measures to strengthen rural areas and improve environmental performance. Reforms in farm policy have been uneven across OECD countries, with the PSE percentage index expressing the PSE value as a percent of total gross agricultural output. The OECD report highlights a decline in producer support for agriculture in the United States and the EU. Despite the decrease in support as a share of gross farm output, the EU still provides more than double the support compared to the United States. Figures compare producer support estimates in domestic currencies and U.S. dollars since the mid-1980s. The OECD report shows a decline in agricultural producer support in the US and EU. Support levels are disaggregated into market-distorting and less-market distorting categories. Market-distorting categories encourage over-production, while less-distorting categories provide support without encouraging over-production. Total agricultural support in the United States has shifted away from market price support programs towards decoupled support payments. The share of market distorting categories has decreased, while decoupled support payments have increased significantly. U.S. agricultural support has grown from under $60 billion in 1986 to over $90 billion in 2009, driven by growth in GSSE support. The surge in GSSE payments in 2009 was due to increased use of the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the economic recession and ARRA. In the EU, total agricultural support has shifted towards decoupled support, with market price support and coupled payments decreasing. Market price support declined from \u20ac78.5 billion in 1987 to under \u20ac21 billion in 2009. Coupled payments peaked at \u20ac107 billion in 2004. In the EU, total agricultural support has shifted towards decoupled payments, with market price support and coupled payments decreasing. Payments peaked at \u20ac107 billion in 2004 and have since declined to \u20ac51 billion in 2009. Decoupled support has increased from \u20ac8 billion in 1986 to nearly \u20ac48 billion in 2009, with the SFP being the largest component. The drop in coupled, market-distorting support is evident in both euro and dollar charts, reflecting reforms enacted before 2004. The EU and the United States have modified their farm programs since the 1980s, shifting towards greater market orientation and decoupling support from production or prices. Both heavily support their agricultural sectors, with the EU's total agricultural support shifting towards decoupled payments. The United States defends its farm support programs as crucial for ensuring access to abundant, safe, and affordable food supplies. However, some argue for deeper and faster reforms in both regions. The failure of the United States and EU to enact deeper, more rapid reforms of their farm support programs has caused delays in the Doha Round of trade negotiations at the WTO. Information comparing the EU and U.S. farm support programs remains relevant as negotiations progress."
