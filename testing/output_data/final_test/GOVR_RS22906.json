    "content": "ESA section 9 prohibits the \"take\" of endangered animals, including harm to their habitat. This could potentially apply to significant greenhouse gas emitters contributing to climate change, impacting species like polar bears. However, obtaining an \"incidental take permit\" would be required, with a conservation plan to minimize impacts. The argument has some flaws, as section 9 only applies to endangered species. The FWS extended the \"take\" prohibition to threatened species, but special rules apply to those with atypical management needs. The polar bear, listed as threatened, has a controversial 4(d) rule that narrows the \"take\" prohibition. The 4(d) rule narrows the \"take\" prohibition for threatened species like the polar bear. An exemption allows incidental taking of polar bears during lawful activities in the US, except Alaska. Using the polar bear listing to reduce GHG emissions through a \"take\" argument is unlikely to succeed due to legal constraints and causal proximity issues. The indirect effects of GHG emissions on polar bears are debated in relation to the ESA's \"take\" prohibition. Legal constraints and causal proximity issues make using the polar bear listing to reduce emissions unlikely to succeed. The 2007 court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA established EPA's authority to regulate GHGs from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The court found that Massachusetts had standing to bring the suit based on the potential benefits of reducing automobile GHG emissions, similar to the loss of shorelands to sea level rise. The impact of GHG emissions on polar bear habitat is also a key consideration, with different legal implications for persons and federal agencies under the ESA. Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to ensure that their actions do not harm endangered or threatened species or their habitats. This involves a consultation process where the agency identifies affected species and consults with the Fish and Wildlife Service to assess potential impacts. If harm is found, alternative solutions must be proposed. The FWS must propose \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" to eliminate jeopardy or adverse modification. A federal action authorizing substantial GHG emissions may trigger section 7 consultation. Section 7 consultation includes a habitat modification component for designated critical habitat. Case law supports consultation even for remote effects. This argument would require agencies to adopt FWS alternatives, potentially reducing GHG emissions. The FWS regulations require section 7 consultation to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of proposed actions. However, there is a lack of causal connection between GHG emissions and the impact on polar bears according to the listing preamble. Proposed amendments to the consultation regulations may further reduce the likelihood of considering climate change-related impacts on polar bears as an indirect effect of federal actions. The FWS regulations require section 7 consultation to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of proposed actions, but there is a lack of causal connection between GHG emissions and the impact on polar bears. The preamble acknowledges the need for new scientific information to establish this connection. Additionally, while some federal actions may increase GHG emissions from multiple sources, making the linkage clearer, the FWS cannot narrow the circumstances triggering consultation. Court deference may be given to FWS views on the causal nexus. Massachusetts v. EPA may also influence this issue. The Center for Biological Diversity has filed listing petitions for animals endangered by climate change, including the polar bear. Challenges have been made regarding the lack of critical habitat designation for the bear and the need to prove a \"jeopardy\" trigger for consultation based on GHG emissions. The Center for Biological Diversity has filed listing petitions for animals endangered by climate change, including the polar bear. Only one petition, for the elkhorn and staghorn coral in 2006, has reached a final listing determination. Seven other petitions are pending, with procedural stages in the ESA listing process to be reviewed. The 90-day finding determines if the petition presents substantial information within 90 days, while the 12-month finding decides if listing is warranted within 12 months. If listing is warranted, a proposed rule must be promptly published. The Secretary must publish a final listing determination within one year of publishing a proposed rule, either listing or withdrawing the proposal. Seven pending listing petitions related to climate change are being challenged in court for not making expeditious progress in adding or deleting species from the endangered list. Several species are facing legal challenges regarding their listing status under the Endangered Species Act. The American pika, ashy storm petrel, ribbon seal, Pacific walrus, and various seal species have all had 90-day findings or petitions filed, with some resulting in positive outcomes and others leading to potential citizen suits. The Center for Biological Diversity is actively using the ESA to address climate change, part of a broader effort by states, interest groups, and individuals to utilize existing laws for environmental protection. Climate change-related litigation has increased in recent years, utilizing various laws such as the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and others. These lawsuits are likely aimed at pressuring Congress or international negotiators to adopt comprehensive solutions for climate change, as existing laws may not provide broad schemes for addressing the issue."
