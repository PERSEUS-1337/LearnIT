    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Care for Working Families Act\". Congress finds that every industrialized country guarantees the right to health care, except the United States. 41,000,000 Americans lack health insurance, with the number growing annually. Most uninsured individuals are workers or their dependents. Congress has a history of enacting laws to ensure fair compensation for work. As the United States approaches the 21st century, there is a need to ensure that jobs come with affordable health insurance benefits. Title II of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 introduces health benefits for employees and their families. Title II of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 mandates large employers to offer qualifying health benefit plans to employees and their families. These plans must provide coverage equivalent to or better than the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan as of January 1, 1998, and comply with the requirements of the Public Health Service Act. Large employers must contribute to the cost of qualifying health benefit plans for employees and withhold the employee's share of the premium. The employer's contribution should be at least equal to the portion the Federal Government contributes under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan. The Standard Plan provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program requires employer contributions based on the number of hours worked per week, with a limitation for employees working less than 10 hours. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program have certain obligations. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program must accept an offer of health insurance coverage and agree to payroll withholdings or provide payment for premiums, with exceptions for those already covered under an employment-based health plan. Employees covered under a Federal health insurance program can request the Federal administrator to pay their share of premiums for a qualifying health benefit plan, which includes Medicare or Medicaid programs. The provisions of this title apply to large employers, defined as those with at least 50 full-time employees on average during the preceding calendar year and not less than 50 employees on the first day of the plan year. The provisions of this title apply to large employers with at least 50 full-time employees on average during the preceding calendar year. An exception applies if the majority of services are performed on behalf of a single large employer. Contract workers are considered employees of the employer. SEC. 202 requires coverage under a qualifying health benefit plan for employees of large employers to begin within 30 days of their first hour of service. Employers can withhold premiums from employee payroll. SEC. 203 addresses enforcement. SEC. 203 addresses enforcement, including civil money penalties for non-compliance by large employers and injunctive relief for violations. SEC. 204 discusses preemption. SEC. 204 states that states can enforce their own standards on employer health insurance as long as they don't conflict with federal requirements. SEC. 205 defines 'family' and 'family member' for employees as spouse and children, effective January 1, 1999 for employers. Amendments are made to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to replace \"this Act\" with \"this title\" and include violations of title II. The Public Health Service Act is amended to require health insurance coverage. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires health insurance issuers to provide coverage that complies with title II of the Act."
