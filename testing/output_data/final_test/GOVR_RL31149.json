    "content": "In the 1990s, snowmobiles were allowed access to 43 units of the National Park System, including major parks like Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, Acadia, Zion, Mount Rainier, and Sequoia. However, only a few park units allowed snowmobile access, with the majority of the 391 units administered by the National Park Service not open to snowmobiles due to unsuitable climates or size. Outside of Alaska, snowmobile use in the park system is mainly concentrated in Yellowstone, Voyageurs, Rocky Mountain, Pictured Rocks, and John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Yellowstone National Park accounted for 40% of snowmobile visitors at five parks in the 1999-2000 winter season, with a total of 76,571 visitors. Snowmobile visits to Yellowstone peaked at 87,206 in the 2001-2002 winter season but declined to 24,049 in 2004-2005 due to changes in access policy, drought, and low snow pack. Rocky Mountain National Park closed all but one snowmobile route since 2004. In the late 1990s, the Park Service found that snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park violated Executive Orders 11644 and 11989, issued by Presidents Nixon and Carter. Snowmobile visits to Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park, and Rockefeller Memorial Parkway declined sharply from 35,000 in 2000-2001 to 7,500 in 2004-2005. Despite a partial rebound, snowmobile visits in 2007-2008 were only at about 35% of peak years. The Park Service found that snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park violated Executive Orders 11644 and 11989. A rulemaking petition sought a ban on snowmobiles from all National Park Service units. The Service was not complying with its mandates, leading to a decline in snowmobile visits. The Department of the Interior and the National Park Service announced a prohibition on snowmobiling for general recreational purposes in the Park System, with some exceptions. However, a clarification was made later that there would be no snowmobile ban in park units pending a formal rulemaking and public comment period. Snowmobile practices prior to the announcement would continue through the 2000-2001 winter season. The focus has been on Denali National Park in Alaska and the Yellowstone/Grand Teton area. Access to snowmobiles in Alaska and the Yellowstone/Grand Teton area has been a topic of public interest. In Alaska, snowmobile use is common due to vast distances, lack of roads, and abundant snow cover. While national parks in Alaska generally allow snowmobile access under ANILCA, access to the core of Denali National Park has been a contentious issue, with snowmobiles being temporarily and later permanently banned. Litigation over snowmobile access to Denali National Park was initially brought by user groups but later withdrawn in anticipation of legislative action. Bills were introduced in 2002 to allow access to certain areas while maintaining a ban elsewhere, but no further action was taken. The National Park Service's 2006 Backcountry Management Plan for Denali noted increasing conflicts between snowmobile users and other park visitors. The National Park Service faced concerns about the effects of snowmachine use on park resources, with few guidelines for managing use. Litigation over snowmobile access to Denali National Park was initially brought by user groups but later withdrawn in anticipation of legislative action. Bills were introduced in 2002 to allow access to certain areas while maintaining a ban elsewhere, but no further action was taken. The Clinton Administration banned snowmobiles from Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Rockefeller Parkway in winter 2003-2004, allowing \"snowcoaches\" instead. Snowmobile manufacturers proposed cleaner, quieter snowmobiles be allowed, which the Bush Administration considered. A suit led to the decision being reopened, with a new deadline set for November 15, 2002. The Park Service reversed the ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park in favor of daily limits on entrants, emission standards, and an adaptive management strategy to protect park resources. Despite receiving over 100,000 comments opposing the decision, the final rule was implemented in December 2003. The Park Service implemented daily limits on snowmobile entrance passes for Yellowstone Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Rockefeller Memorial Parkway to manage the number of entrants, especially on weekends and holidays. Snowmobile users were required to be accompanied by trained guides, with strict limits on alcohol use. The machines had to meet emission standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The Yellowstone Park Superintendent released a list of approved snowmobile models for the 2003-2004 winter season, with emissions and noise reduction requirements. A hearing in December 2003 resulted in the rules being vacated and remanded due to lack of evidence supporting the Bush Administration's decision. The court ruled the snowmobile decision was politically driven and inadequate under NEPA. Judge Sullivan reinstated the Clinton Administration rule, reducing snowmobile numbers in Yellowstone by half for 2003-2004 and preparing for a complete ban in 2004-2005. ISMA and Wyoming appealed the ruling but were denied a stay. In February 2004, a Federal District Court in Wyoming issued a temporary restraining order against Clinton-era rules on snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park. The National Park Service then developed temporary rules allowing increased snowmobile access for the 2004 winter season. Despite appeals, the court decisions led to a significant reduction in snowmobile use in Yellowstone, Grand Teton Park, and the Rockefeller Parkway. In response to a court decision in February 2004, the National Park Service implemented temporary winter use plans for Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and the Rockefeller Parkway. These plans allowed for limited snowmobile access, with 720 snowmobiles per day in Yellowstone and 140 in Grand Teton National Park and the Rockefeller Parkway. Snowcoaches also had to meet NPS best available technology requirements. The National Park Service implemented temporary winter use plans for Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and the Rockefeller Parkway in response to a court decision. The plans allowed limited snowmobile access and required snowcoaches to meet NPS best available technology requirements. Despite the allowable limits, snowmobile visits decreased significantly in the 2004-2008 winter seasons. In the winter seasons of 2004-2008, snowmobile visits to Teton, Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail, and Rockefeller Parkway significantly declined. This led to an increase in visitors using other modes of travel such as snowcoaches and cross country skis. The Park Service conducted additional studies to develop a final winter use plan, which was finalized on November 20, 2007. The Winter Use Plan finalized in 2007 evaluated seven alternatives and set access limits for snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. It included data on the effects of snowmobiles on air quality, noise, and wildlife, as well as economic impacts on surrounding communities. The plan allowed 540 snowmobiles per day in Yellowstone and a combined 65 in Grand Teton National Park and Rockefeller Memorial Parkway, with stricter emissions and noise requirements. The Winter Use Plan finalized in 2007 set access limits for snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park, with technology requirements for emissions and noise. Judge Emmett Sullivan vacated the plan due to environmental concerns, including increased air pollution and adverse impacts on wildlife and natural soundscape. NPS announced a new temporary Winter Use Plan for public comment. The National Park Service announced a new temporary Winter Use Plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park, setting limits on emissions and noise from snowmobiles. The Environmental Protection Agency also developed emission limits for new snowmobiles nationwide starting in 2006 and 2007. EPA regulations on snowmobile emissions are discussed in the report. Snowmobiles, except those in Yellowstone since 2004, are not regulated for emissions or noise. EPA has authority to regulate noise from transportation equipment but has not done so since 1982. Two-stroke engines used in snowmobiles cause poor fuel economy and high emissions. Snowmobile emissions, particularly hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, are a significant concern due to their impact on air quality and human health. A typical snowmobile emits as much hydrocarbon in one hour as a 2008 model automobile does in 54,000 miles of driving. Additionally, snowmobiles meeting EPA regulations emit as much carbon monoxide in an hour as a 2008 model auto does in 1,050 miles of driving. These emissions contain harmful substances like benzene and formaldehyde, posing risks to human health, especially for those with cardiovascular disease. The National Park Service measured emissions from snowmobiles in Yellowstone and found that they accounted for 97.9% of carbon monoxide at the West Yellowstone entrance during winter, exceeding air quality standards by nearly 70%. Noise pollution is also a concern for opponents of allowing snowmobile access. Opponents of allowing snowmobiles in Yellowstone and other national parks argue that the noise and emissions from snowmobiles disrupt the solitude and quiet that these parks are known for. They believe that snowmobile use is incompatible with the peaceful atmosphere that visitors seek in these natural landscapes. On the other hand, snowmobile enthusiasts argue that snowmobiles are limited to specific roads and are essential for promoting visitor enjoyment of park resources. The noise and emissions from snowmobiles in Yellowstone disrupt the peaceful atmosphere sought by visitors. Regulations require a reduction in emissions from new snowmobiles starting in 2006. The EPA implemented regulations in 2006 to reduce emissions from snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park. Manufacturers can meet these standards by offering a range of models with varying emission controls, with an estimated cost of $73 per snowmobile. The EPA implemented regulations in 2006 to reduce emissions from snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park, costing $73 per snowmobile. The 2010 and 2012 standards can be met without eliminating two-stroke engines, with a potential scenario of 50% direct injection, 20% four-stroke engines, and 30% engine modifications. The cost of these changes would average an additional $131 per snowmobile in 2010, offset by $286 in fuel savings. The EPA implemented regulations in 2006 to reduce emissions from snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park, costing $73 per snowmobile. The 2010 and 2012 standards can be met without eliminating two-stroke engines, with a potential scenario of 50% direct injection, 20% four-stroke engines, and 30% engine modifications. The costs of the 2010 and 2012 standards are offset by fuel savings and improved performance, resulting in net savings per vehicle. The standards would decrease total costs by $241 per snowmobile when fully implemented and do not include noise limits. The Agency proposed noise standards for nonroad equipment without existing requirements, with minimal impact on noise. Despite calls for noise standards, the Agency stated it would not address the issue without Congressional appropriations. The National Park Service implemented noise standards for snowmobiles in Yellowstone, requiring a 50% reduction in noise emissions compared to conventional snowmobiles. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated EPA's standards for nitrogen oxides and remanded the 2012 standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. EPA has not responded to the remand and does not expect to do so until 2010 at the earliest. The International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association argued that EPA underestimated compliance costs. The International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association (ISMA) criticized EPA for underestimating compliance costs, stating that cleaner machines are possible but more expensive and limited in where they can be ridden. ISMA estimated that the cleanest engines cost an additional $1,700, while even modest improvements to two-stroke engines would cost $350-$400 per machine. Bluewater Network, an environmental group, believes EPA standards should be stronger, advocating for four-stroke engines with particle traps and three-way catalysts. They also want mandatory emission labels for snowmobiles. Bluewater Network and snowmobile manufacturers are disappointed with EPA's lack of noise standards for machines. They point to the Clean Snowmobile Challenge as proof that cleaner machines are feasible, with significant reductions in emissions and noise at a low cost. Bluewater argues that the billion-dollar snowmobile industry can achieve similar results. Both parties believe EPA has misinterpreted legal authority for the new standards. Bluewater and other environmental groups argue that EPA's new emission standards for snowmobiles are not as strict as required by the Clean Air Act. They believe that four-stroke engine technology, which is already available and more effective at reducing emissions, should be mandated. Cost, noise, and energy factors should not be used as reasons against adopting this technology, as it would actually be more cost-effective in the long run. The EPA's emission standards for snowmobiles are being criticized by environmental groups for not being strict enough as required by the Clean Air Act. They argue that the use of four-stroke engine technology, which is more effective at reducing emissions, should be mandated. Nonroad-vehicle manufacturers, on the other hand, focus on the Agency's authority to regulate engines tied to emissions contributing to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in nonattainment areas. EPA made an affirmative determination in 1994 that emissions from nonroad engines are significant contributors to pollution. The EPA identified snowmobiles as contributors to pollution in nonattainment areas, particularly in Alaska, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Montana. Despite improvements in carbon monoxide levels, concerns remain about air quality standards in these areas. Members of Congress have shown interest in snowmobile access to national parks, with multiple hearings held since the 106th Congress. Appropriations bills have required NPS Temporary Winter Use Rules allowing snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks to remain in effect. The FY2008 Interior appropriations bill proposed continuing this temporary solution for Yellowstone's winter management rule. The FY2008 Interior appropriations bill proposed continuing the temporary solution for Yellowstone's winter management rule, despite lawsuits challenging the NPS Final Winter Use Plan. Representative Holt attempted to amend bills to prohibit spending on recreational snowmobile use in Yellowstone, but both attempts were defeated in Congress. The snowmobile access issue in national parks, particularly Yellowstone, has been ongoing despite efforts by Congress, EPA, and the National Park Service. Public interest in the issue remains high, with the NPS's preferred alternatives for snowmobile access being unpopular. A federal district court has vacated final regulations for Yellowstone access for the third time, highlighting the unresolved nature of the issue. Public opposition to the NPS preference for snowmobile access in Yellowstone National Park is strong, with only 0.1% of public comments supporting it. Environmental groups, individuals, and former NPS directors are against the preference. The EPA criticized the preferred alternative for its high emissions and recommended modifications. This opposition is likely to lead to continued interest from Congress and potential legal action. The National Park Service is expected to face further legal action in response to the latest court decision."
