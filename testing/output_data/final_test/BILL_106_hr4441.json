    "content": "The Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act of 2000 may be cited as the \"Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act\". It includes a mandatory fuel surcharge provision. The Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act of 2000 includes a mandatory fuel surcharge provision for motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders providing truck-load transportation services. The surcharge is assessed when the price of fuel surpasses a certain benchmark, and is calculated based on mileage. The fuel surcharge for motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders is calculated based on mileage or percentage of revenue. It compensates for the difference in fuel prices between the Current Fuel Price and the Fuel Price Norm. The benchmark for the surcharge is the difference exceeding $0.05 between the two fuel prices. The Fuel Price Norm for calculating the fuel surcharge is based on the latest 52-week average of the Average Retail On-Highway Diesel Prices. The surcharge must be calculated when the shipment is tendered, itemized separately on invoices, and paid by the payor of transportation charges. The surcharge under this section is calculated based on factors like average fuel economy and mileage. Enforcement of this section can only be done by the motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder against the payor of transportation charges. The court can only determine fuel surcharge payments in legal actions against transportation providers, with no authority to review other charges. The Secretary of Transportation and Surface Transportation Board have no regulatory power over this section. Effective from 60 days after enactment until September 30, 2003, negotiated fuel adjustments are not affected by this section. The Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act of 2000 allows for fuel cost adjustments in transportation contracts. This provision does not restrict the inclusion of privately negotiated fuel cost adjustment clauses. Additionally, contracts entered into after the enactment of the Act can still include fuel adjustments during periods without required fuel surcharges. The Motor Carrier Fuel Cost Equity Act of 2000 allows for fuel cost adjustments in transportation contracts, including negotiated fuel surcharges. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. Section 14102 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require motor carriers, brokers, or freight forwarders using fuel not paid for by them to pass through fuel surcharges to the responsible party and disclose all freight rates, charges, and fuel surcharges. The text chunk discusses limitations on intentionally adjusting compensatory transportation costs and imposing fuel cost adjustments to avoid passing through fuel surcharges. The text chunk limits the authority of the person paying for fuel to enforce fuel cost adjustments against transportation providers using vehicles not owned by them. The Secretary of Transportation and Surface Transportation Board have no regulatory authority over this provision. The effective period is from the 60th day after enactment until September 30, 2003. Passed by the House of Representatives on October 10, 2000. Clerk attests."
