    "content": "The \"Education Infrastructure Act of 1994\" aims to improve the quality of public elementary and secondary school libraries, media centers, and facilities to meet National Education Goals. Funding for these purposes at Federal, State, and local levels has not adequately reflected the need, requiring collaborative efforts from all sectors of the community. The purpose of the \"Education Infrastructure Act of 1994\" is to enhance public school libraries and facilities to support academic and vocational instruction. It aims to help achieve National Education Goals through repair, renovation, and construction projects. The \"Education Infrastructure Act of 1994\" defines terms like \"alteration\" as any change to existing property for a different purpose, \"construction\" as the erection of new buildings or facilities, and \"eligible local educational agency\" as a local educational agency as defined in section. The \"Education Infrastructure Act of 1994\" defines terms like \"alteration\" as any change to existing property for a different purpose, \"construction\" as the erection of new buildings or facilities, and \"eligible local educational agency\" as a local educational agency defined in section 1471 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This agency must demonstrate urgent repair, renovation, alteration, and construction needs for its public elementary or secondary school libraries, media centers, and facilities used for academic or vocational instruction, serving large numbers or percentages of disadvantaged students. \"Renovation\" refers to changes for more efficient use within the property's designated purpose, while \"repair\" refers to restoring failed or failing real property facilities. The term \"repair\" refers to restoring a failed or failing real property facility, component, or building system to a condition where it can be effectively used for its designated purpose, if the deterioration or damage cannot be corrected through normal maintenance. The term \"Secretary\" typically refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 5 authorizes grants for improving public elementary and secondary education facilities. $600,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 1995, with additional funds for 1996 through 2004. SEC. 6 outlines the application process. Each eligible local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act. The application must include a description of deficiencies to be corrected, the corrective action to be taken, a cost estimate, and the total amount needed. The application for a grant under this Act must include details on the budget used for school libraries, plans for maintenance, and how the construction will support the goals of the Secretary. Additional information may be required by the Secretary. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications for school facilities based on age, health and safety hazards, and serving areas with high unemployment rates. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES. Each eligible local educational agency receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds for repairing, renovating, and constructing public school libraries or facilities to meet National Education Goals. This includes inspection, repairing health or safety risks, upgrading for new technology, meeting disability requirements, and removing hazardous materials like asbestos, lead, and radon. The funds can be used for various purposes such as upgrading school security systems, energy conservation, meeting codes related to fire and building regulations, and replacing old facilities that are more cost-effective to tear down than renovate. SEC. 8. REQUIREMENTS. An eligible local educational agency must meet certain requirements to receive a grant under this Act, including maintaining a certain level of fiscal effort per student and using funds only to supplement, not replace, non-Federal funds for school facility repair and construction. The grant funds under this Act are for repairing and constructing school facilities for educational purposes, not for acquiring real property or paying maintenance costs. Projects must comply with environmental laws and regulations, as well as laws regarding individuals with disabilities. Federal funds provided under this Act must comply with Sections 504 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities. SEC. 9. CONTRACTS. Under this Act, projects carried out under contracts must adhere to limitations including goals for small business participation exceeding governmentwide goals and an evaluation process emphasizing these goals. Laborers and mechanics must also adhere to Davis-Bacon regulations. Laborers and mechanics working on projects financed by grants under this Act must be paid wages determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The Secretary of Labor also has authority under the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act. SEC. 10. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. Comprehensive regional centers can help with school library construction for eligible educational agencies. SEC. 11. FEDERAL ASSESSMENT. The Secretary will reserve up to 1% of funds for data collection, studies, and evaluations to monitor project progress and assess public school libraries. A report on findings must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 1997."
