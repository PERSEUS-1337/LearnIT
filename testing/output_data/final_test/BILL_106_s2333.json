    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tobacco Regulatory Fairness Act of 2000\". Congress finds that cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause 450,000 deaths and $65 billion in costs annually in the US. Despite known dangers, there is no federal agency regulating tobacco products. The tobacco industry spends $4 billion yearly on promotion, and 3,000 children start smoking daily with no minimum age requirement to buy tobacco products. The Food and Drug Administration is deemed the most suitable agency to regulate tobacco products, including nicotine-containing substitutes for smoking. The definition of 'tobacco product' and 'tobacco additive' is clarified in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term 'constituent' refers to elements in cigarette smoke that pose health risks. Enforcement of regulations is outlined in the Act. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include tobacco products in regulations. SEC. 5. REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS. Adds a new chapter for the regulation of tobacco products in the Act. The Secretary must promulgate regulations for tobacco product manufacturing, sales, and distribution within a year. The FDA will regulate these activities. Regulations cannot ban products solely for causing disease, and selling to those under 18 is prohibited. The regulations for tobacco product manufacturing, sales, and distribution include prohibiting selling to individuals under 18, ensuring safe additives, and classifying nicotine-containing products as drugs if they do not meet the definition of a tobacco product. \"SEC. 1001. ADULTERATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\" Tobacco products are considered adulterated if they contain filthy, putrid, or contaminated substances that may harm health, if they are prepared in unsanitary conditions, or if the container is made of harmful substances. The Secretary may establish manufacturing regulations for tobacco products. Manufacturing regulations for tobacco products may be based on good manufacturing practice regulations for other products regulated under this Act. \"SEC. 1002. MISBRANDED TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\" \"A tobacco product is considered misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading, does not include the manufacturer's information and quantity of contents, or if required information is not prominently displayed on the label.\" The labeling of a product must be prominently placed and easily understood by the ordinary individual. If the product has an established name, it must be prominently printed on the label. The labeling must also comply with regulations for adequate directions for use or warnings against use by children. If a product is manufactured in an unregistered establishment, it violates section 1004. SEC. 1003. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee is established in the Food and Drug Administration to assist the Secretary in developing regulations for tobacco products. The committee consists of 10 qualified individuals appointed by the Secretary, including experts in the field of nicotine. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee consists of experts in nicotine addiction, pharmacology, food and drug law, public education, toxicology, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and consumer representatives. Ex officio members include the Directors of the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee includes experts in nicotine addiction, pharmacology, food and drug law, public education, toxicology, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and consumer representatives. Ex officio members are the Directors of the National Cancer Institute, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service. The chairperson is appointed by the Secretary with the advice and consent of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The committee reviews scientific evidence on tobacco products' effects on human health, manufacturing processes, additives, nicotine's role in smoking. The Tobacco and Nicotine Products Advisory Committee reviews the role of nicotine in smoking habits, its addictive properties, and health effects. They also review current laws on tobacco product manufacturing, distribution, sale, labeling, and advertising. The committee has the authority to hold hearings and receive testimony. Within a year of appointing all members, they must submit recommendations on regulations to the Secretary. Within 120 days of enactment, tobacco product manufacturers must register with the Secretary. The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Secretary, will regulate advertising for all tobacco products. They may also modify warning labels under certain conditions and increase their size and placement. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include tobacco products in the regulations for records and factory inspections."
