    "content": "The FBI is the lead agency for investigating terrorism, defined as acts intended to influence government conduct. The Bureau has shifted to a more proactive approach post-9/11, focusing on predicting and preventing threats. The FBI has shifted to a proactive approach post-9/11, focusing on predicting and preventing threats by dismantling barriers between intelligence and criminal investigation, expanding monitoring abilities, and increasing counterterrorism operations and collaboration with other agencies. The FBI has expanded its Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) from 26 in 1999 to over 100 in January 2014, combining resources of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. FBI's counterterrorism operations have grown with increased allocation of agents, now split 50-50 between national security and criminal activity. Since 9/11, the FBI has increased its agent count by 4,000, with a focus split 50-50 between terrorism and other criminal activities like mortgage fraud. The agency has also expanded its intelligence analyst workforce and established a National Security Branch and Directorate of Intelligence. The FBI has adopted a more proactive, intelligence-driven approach to counterterrorism, aiming to prevent or disrupt terrorist acts rather than just investigate them after they occur. The FBI has transformed post-9/11 with a focus on preventing the next attack. The Department of Justice is proactive in identifying security risks early and using preventative prosecutions. The FBI's changes include additional authorities from the USA PATRIOT Act and revised guidelines for investigating terrorism. The FBI underwent significant changes post-9/11, focusing on preventing future attacks by expanding its operational reach through JTTFs and increasing cooperation with other agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act provided the FBI with additional investigative tools and authority to monitor suspects in terrorism-related investigations. After 9/11, the FBI underwent changes to prevent future attacks by expanding its reach through JTTFs and increasing cooperation with other agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act provided the FBI with additional tools like roving wiretaps, \"Sneak and Peek\" warrants, and National Security Letters to monitor suspects in terrorism-related investigations. The Act also aimed to dismantle barriers hindering information sharing between intelligence and criminal investigators. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) regulates intelligence wiretaps targeting foreign powers and agents in the US, including those involved in terrorism. Before the USA PATRIOT Act, a \"Wall\" separated intelligence and law enforcement, limiting coordination between them. Intelligence wiretaps can target any representative of a foreign government, unlike law enforcement taps which require specific types of crime. The government must certify that the purpose of surveillance is for gathering foreign intelligence information. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow surveillance for a \"significant purpose\" rather than just \"the purpose.\" This change was made to facilitate the collection of foreign intelligence information. In today's world, surveillance often serves dual purposes of gathering foreign intelligence and evidence for criminal prosecution, making it challenging to determine the primary purpose of an investigation. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow surveillance for a \"significant purpose\" rather than just \"the purpose,\" facilitating the exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement personnel to combat terrorism. Other provisions aimed to increase intelligence sharing and coordination efforts in investigating or protecting against sabotage or international terrorism by foreign powers or their agents. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow surveillance for a \"significant purpose\" to combat terrorism. Section 203 amended the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow disclosure of grand jury information related to sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power. Law enforcement officers have the authority to conduct wiretaps and electronic surveillance on suspects of federal crimes, including using \"roving\" wiretaps to intercept communications with a single court order. The USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to allow roving wiretaps, enabling surveillance on multiple telephones used by a subject without the need for separate orders. This prevented missed conversations related to criminal activities. Additionally, trap and trace devices and pen registers were used to collect incoming and outgoing phone numbers prior to 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded surveillance laws to include various forms of communication like the Internet and electronic mail. It also allowed federal law enforcement officers to request delayed-notice search warrants for \"sneak and peek\" searches without immediately notifying the owner. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded surveillance laws to include Internet and electronic mail communication. It authorized the FBI to seek FISA Court orders for tangible things in terrorism or counterintelligence investigations, excluding First Amendment activities. National Security Letters (NSLs) are used in FBI counterterrorism investigations to collect non-content consumer records from various entities. NSLs are crucial investigative tools used by the FBI in counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the use of NSLs by allowing the FBI to request full consumer credit reports and broadening the circumstances under which the letters could be issued. In 2012, the FBI made 15,299 NSL requests for information related to 6,223 individuals. The implementation of NSLs at the FBI post-USA PATRIOT Act has faced challenges, including unease from telecommunications companies and revelations by Edward Snowden. In a 2013 case, a federal judge ruled that the government must stop using NSLs due to concerns about indefinite nondisclosure orders infringing on free speech. The judge ruled that the federal government must stop enforcing indefinite nondisclosure orders with existing NSLs, which infringe on free speech. The order was stayed for 90 days to allow for a possible appeal. Edward Snowden's actions have prompted changes in NSL procedures, as he leaked top secret documents about U.S. intelligence efforts in 2013. President Obama addressed these surveillance programs in a speech in January 2014, suggesting some modifications. President Obama suggested changes to U.S. intelligence surveillance programs, including loosening nondisclosure stipulations for communications providers. This was in response to a report on intelligence and communications technologies following Snowden's disclosures. Issues with NSLs, including violations in 2007, have been highlighted. The FBI and DOJ have made progress in addressing compliance issues with NSLs, but concerns remain about eliminating problems. Some FBI personnel circumvented the NSL process by using exigent letters during crisis conditions between 2003 and 2006. The FBI used exigent letters instead of NSLs between 2003 and 2006, without describing specific crises. The FBI General Counsel attributed this to a misunderstanding of the USA PATRIOT Act. Despite guidance in 2005, employees continued using exigent letters until they were discontinued in 2007. The FBI ended the use of exigent letters in March 2007, which had sparked congressional debate on extending key provisions of the PATRIOT Act. The Act was intended to empower law enforcement with new tools to combat terrorism, although some expressed concerns about its constitutional implications. The FBI Director testified that the Act had changed the way the FBI operates and contributed to counterterrorism successes. The USA PATRIOT Act raised concerns about constitutional implications and civil liberties. Law Professor Susan Herman highlighted provisions allowing deviation from Fourth Amendment requirements. The Electronic Freedom Foundation and the Rutherford Institute expressed worries about privacy rights and unintended consequences threatening constitutional rights. The USA PATRIOT Act has been criticized for expanding government powers and diminishing liberty, particularly in regards to wiretapping and intelligence provisions. In 2005, Congress debated extending certain provisions of the act, eventually passing an extension in 2006 that provided the FBI with additional authorities. In 2011, Congress considered extending three expiring amendments to FISA, including the \"roving wiretap\" and \"business records\" provisions from the USA PATRIOT Act. The reauthorizing legislation also provided greater protections for library, medical, and educational records, and allowed the party forced to disclose business information to seek legal advice. Additionally, the \"lone wolf\" provision from the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act permits surveillance of non-U.S. persons. The \"lone wolf\" provision (P.L. 108-458) allows surveillance of non-U.S. persons involved in international terrorism without evidence linking them to a foreign power or terrorist organization. Law professor Nathan Sales and Acting Assistant Attorney General Todd Hinnen testified in favor of extending these provisions, emphasizing the importance of safeguards for privacy and civil liberties. Congress passed legislation (S. 990) to extend the provisions until June 1, 2015, which was signed by President Barack H. Obama. The FBI and DOJ emphasized their forward-leaning approach with the revision of the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations in 2008, known as the \"Mukasey Guidelines.\" These guidelines, effective from December 1, 2008, aimed to make FBI operations in the United States more effective by providing clearer standards and procedures in the post-9/11 national security context. The 2008 revision of the FBI's guidelines aimed to make the organization more proactive in addressing criminal, counterintelligence, and terrorist threats. It consolidated previous documents and introduced new techniques to assess risks and vulnerabilities. The FBI's 2011 modifications to the Mukasey Guidelines and the DIOG allow for the use of assessments outside of traditional investigations, with assessments serving five specific purposes. Preliminary and full investigations require factual predication, while assessments do not. The FBI's 2011 modifications to the Mukasey Guidelines and the DIOG allow for the use of assessments for specific purposes related to national security and federal criminal activities, without requiring factual predication. The FBI utilizes assessments for terrorism investigations, using techniques like public surveillance and informants. Between 2008 and 2011, the Bureau initiated thousands of assessments, leading to hundreds of investigations. About one-third of assessments were based on vague tips, with a focus on identifying spies or terrorists. Critics have raised concerns about the Mukasey Guidelines, stating they give too much unchecked power to the FBI and pose threats to civil liberties. Farhad Khera of Muslim Advocates criticized the invasive nature of the Attorney General Guidelines, based on generalized suspicion. The ACLU also criticized the large number of FBI assessments being initiated. The FBI's policy counsel and General Counsel have differing views on the large number of assessments initiated by the FBI. The guidelines allow for the collection of information on ethnic or racial communities for proactive purposes. JTTFs are multi-agency teams focused on intelligence analysis and threat assessment. The Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) are multi-agency teams consisting of investigators, analysts, linguists, SWAT experts, and other specialists who investigate terrorism and terrorism-related crimes. There are over 100 JTTFs operated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI, with more than 4,400 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and agents working in them. The FBI considers JTTFs as the nation's front line on terrorism, focusing on tactical operations, investigations, developing human sources, and gathering intelligence to thwart terrorist plots. The Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) play a crucial role in sharing intelligence from FBI-led counterterrorism investigations with outside agencies and law enforcement. The number of top-secret security clearances issued to local police working on JTTFs has significantly increased. The National JTTF, established in 2002, coordinates with FBI partners and manages information sharing among 40 agencies. In response to criticisms post-9/11, the FBI has implemented reforms to enhance its intelligence capabilities. Robert Mueller, FBI Director from just before 9/11 until September 2013, implemented reforms to make the Bureau more proactive and intelligence-driven, focusing on preventing terrorism. He centralized control over intelligence capabilities to improve the FBI's intelligence program, emphasizing that intelligence is a core competency essential to the FBI's investigative mission. Mueller reformed the FBI by centralizing intelligence capabilities, creating the Directorate of Intelligence and Field Intelligence Groups at field offices to enhance intelligence and investigative capabilities. The Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) consist of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists with the mission to identify intelligence gaps, analyze raw intelligence, and disseminate intelligence products to guide investigations and counterterrorism efforts. They distribute Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs) containing raw intelligence to the law enforcement and intelligence communities. The FBI produces Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs) from a single source, containing raw intelligence that has not been fully evaluated or analyzed. In 2010, over 25,000 IIRs were produced, covering counterintelligence, counterterrorism, cyber issues, and weapons of mass destruction. Mueller established a Strategic Execution Team (SET) to drive organizational changes and support intelligence priorities. The FBI established a Strategic Execution Team (SET) to assess and improve its intelligence program, standardize practices, and drive a change in mindsets. The SET recommendations led to restructuring of FIGs in field offices, improving coordination and enabling easier transitions for agents and analysts. This transformation has turned the FBI into an intelligence-driven agency. The FBI's transformation into an intelligence-driven agency is still a work in progress, with a need for a structural, organizational, and cultural shift. Post-9/11 intelligence reform at the FBI has faced criticism, particularly in integrating intelligence with investigative operations. The FBI's progress in counterterrorism post-9/11 under Mueller's leadership is evident, but questions remain about its transformation into an intelligence-driven organization. The integration of intelligence with investigative operations is still a work in progress, with doubts about whether the Bureau has fully embraced the intelligence aspects of its mission. Some observers doubt the FBI's focus on intelligence over arrests and convictions. Critics argue that a culture favoring agents over analysts hinders innovation and prevention efforts. The Bureau's emphasis on catching criminals rather than connecting dots is seen as a barrier to intelligence-driven operations. The FBI has been criticized for not fully establishing intelligence analysis as a core mission, with intelligence still being viewed as an enabler to law enforcement rather than a driver of operational activity. The FBI has faced criticism for not prioritizing intelligence analysis as a core mission, with analysts being seen as support rather than equal partners in intelligence-driven operations. Calls for professional parity between analysts and special agents have been made to reform the FBI's institutional culture. The FBI's transformation is incomplete, with the need to accelerate efforts in light of the growing homegrown terrorist threat. The committee highlighted issues such as division among field offices, lack of intelligence analysis, outdated tradecraft, and poor coordination within JTTFs. However, the successful coordination in thwarting the Najibullah Zazi terrorist plot was also noted as a positive example. The FBI's Fusion Cell Concept enhances coordination between federal, state, and local departments to combat terrorism. It combines intelligence and investigative activities to identify and mitigate priority threats. The concept emphasizes a target-centric approach and uses intelligence to strategically select high-threat targets. The FBI's proactive stance with Fusion Cells aims to improve threat response. The concept of \"Fusion Cells\" in the FBI aims to enhance coordination between different departments to combat terrorism. It is unclear how this differs from task force settings like JTTFs and whether it truly blends intelligence and investigative efforts. Recent changes in the Bureau's culture may undergo scrutiny, with a review required by Congress to assess the implementation of recommendations from the 9/11 commission. The FBI is examining the state of intelligence analysis and its role in the Bureau's culture, following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission to establish a specialized national security workforce. Intelligence gathering post-9/11 is focused on preventive policing to anticipate terror attacks. This approach was evident in a domestic intelligence operation related to events in Libya in 2011. In 2011, the FBI interviewed over 800 Libyans in the US to assess terror threats due to military action in Libya. Law enforcement faces challenges in identifying when radicalized individuals become real threats and the importance of accurate intelligence to preemptively stop terrorists. The FBI receives information about terrorist threats from various sources, including the public. The FBI receives information about terrorist threats from various sources, including the public, government agencies, and law enforcement. Investigations are often initiated based on leads from existing cases or collaboration with other agencies. U.S. law enforcement uses tactics like the \"Al Capone\" approach and \"agent provocateurs\" to counter violent plots. The \"Al Capone\" approach involves apprehending individuals linked to terrorist plots on lesser offenses like immigration violations. This tactic, along with sting operations and informant cultivation, is effective in preventing terrorist plots but has raised concerns within U.S. Muslim communities. After 9/11, the DOJ used lesser charges to preemptively disrupt potential terrorist attacks, such as driver's license fraud and immigration violations. However, there has been a shift towards trying suspected terrorists on terrorism charges instead of relying on lesser offenses. Between September 11, 2009, and September 11, 2010, 77% of cases carried terrorism or national security charges, a 50% increase compared to the previous eight years. The Capone approach is still used in terrorism cases, like in the case of Paul Rockwood, Jr., who pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI in 2010. He had developed a list of people to kill and researched explosives, but prosecutors did not pursue more substantive terrorism charges. Prosecutors opted to use a false statement charge to neutralize a threat of terrorism, as seen in the case of Najibullah Zazi who planned to detonate bombs in New York's subway system. The FBI monitored his activities and arrested him in Aurora, CO on September 19, 2009. The FBI arrested Najibullah Zazi in Aurora, CO for lying to them, fearing he might flee. A grand jury later indicted him on weapons of mass destruction charges. Sting operations aim to catch suspects in criminal acts to gather solid evidence. Only two terrorist plots were disrupted between 9/11 and Zazi's plot to bomb the NYC subway. Between 9/11 and the September 2009 Zazi plot to bomb the NYC subway, only two plotters were able to move forward without government informants or U.S. officials. From 2009 to early 2011, the FBI arrested 41 people on terrorism charges through sting operations. An example is the case of Mohamed Osman Mohamud, who was arrested in 2010 for attempting to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, OR. Mohamud believed he was working with terrorists, but it was actually FBI undercover operatives who provided the fake bomb. The FBI began a sting operation against Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a 19-year-old Somali-born U.S. citizen, after receiving alerts from the local Muslim community. Mohamud was arrested in 2010 for attempting to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, OR. Defense attorneys have alleged entrapment in FBI terrorism sting operations, but this defense has been unsuccessful in federal courts since 9/11. Former FBI Director Mueller and Attorney General Holder have deemed sting operations as \"essential\" to counter terrorism. The FBI uses sting operations, deemed \"essential\" by former FBI Director Mueller and Attorney General Holder, for terrorism prevention. The FBI carefully oversees undercover work and tests suspects to gauge their intent. In the case of Mohamed Osman Mohamud, he expressed a desire to become \"operational\" and discussed targeting a Christmas tree lighting ceremony with an undercover FBI employee. Mohamud expressed a desire to target a Christmas tree lighting ceremony with a large crowd, including children, during a meeting with an undercover FBI employee. The FBI's DIOG emphasizes the importance of gathering intelligence in counterterrorism investigations. Balancing civil liberties with the need for preventative policing in terrorism cases is a significant policy challenge, as noted by the Church Committee in 1976. The tension between civil liberties and security in domestic intelligence work has led to abuses in the past. While intelligence efforts have prevented dangerous acts like bombings and foreign spying, they have also exceeded constitutional restraints. The balance between civil liberties and security, particularly in terrorism prevention, is a significant policy challenge. The FBI's history of intrusive domestic intelligence collection measures and counter-radical operations serves as a historical example. During the late 1930s through the 1960s, the FBI focused on domestic security concerns during World War II and the Cold War, working to prevent espionage and communist infiltration. With broad authority granted by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, the FBI engaged in preventive, covert, intelligence-based efforts to target internal threats. The FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) targeted individuals and groups deemed as threats without requiring evidence of criminal activity. The Bureau used illegal means to suppress constitutionally protected activities seen as national security risks. In the 1970s, the balance shifted towards prioritizing civil liberties over prevention, leading to the development of Attorney General guidelines in 1976. The 1976 Attorney General guidelines, known as the Domestic Security Investigation Guidelines, were created in response to FBI abuses like COINTELPRO. These guidelines aimed to restrict the FBI's monitoring of groups with controversial views, limiting domestic intelligence gathering. However, post-9/11, the focus shifted towards security and terrorism prevention, with subsequent guidelines like the Mukasey Guidelines and FBI DIOG providing more investigative flexibility. Critics argue that these newer guidelines have relaxed constraints on FBI intelligence collection, prioritizing security over concerns of investigator abuse. Since 9/11, the FBI has prioritized counterterrorism efforts over concerns of investigator abuse, leading to increased resources and reforms to enhance intelligence operations. The Mukasey Guidelines and FBI DIOG address the balance between preventing terrorism and criticism of investigative techniques, sparking worries among civil liberties groups. The FBI has undergone intelligence reforms post-9/11 to become a more proactive and intelligence-driven organization. Congress should examine the integration of intelligence into FBI operations, collaboration with other agencies, and the use of strategic intelligence for understanding evolving security threats. The FBI has developed effective predictive capacity through intelligence reforms post-9/11, including the creation of a Directorate of Intelligence and Field Intelligence Groups in each field office. FBI Director Mueller testified about the restructuring of FIGs to better identify and address emerging threats. The Senate HSGAC's investigation into the Fort Hood shootings raised concerns about the FBI's integration of intelligence into investigative operations. The FBI's inquiry into Hasan focused narrowly on terrorist activity, overlooking the potential threat of radicalization to violent extremism and counterintelligence risks. Congress may need to assess the access of intelligence analysts to case information within the FIGs. The FBI Intelligence Analysts Association raised concerns about analysts being relegated to support roles rather than full partners in investigations. They argued for professional parity with special agents to reform the FBI's culture. The FBI asserts that intelligence is integral to its investigative mission. The FBI has developed a concept of operations to institutionalize how intelligence analysts influence investigations. Congress may want to explore the impact of intelligence analysts outside the FIGs on JTTF investigations, including those at FBI headquarters. The recent adoption of the \"fusion cell\" concept for headquarters intelligence elements is of interest, as seen in the Hasan case where two JTTFs disputed the significance of Hasan's communications with a Suspected Terrorist. The FBI's headquarters units were not informed of a dispute, indicating a lack of communication and potential autonomy issues between field offices and headquarters. There is no written plan outlining the division of labor and hierarchy of command among different units. The FBI has increased its intelligence production significantly, with over 25,000 reports in 2010 covering various topics. The FBI has increased intelligence production significantly, generating over 25,000 reports in 2010 on various topics, including criminal and cyber issues, and weapons of mass destruction. Congress may want to assess the value and accessibility of these reports within the intelligence and law enforcement communities."
