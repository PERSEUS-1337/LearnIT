Sec. 301. Economic development assistance for cellulosic biomass ethanol projects and coal-to-liquids facilities on BRAC property and Indian land. Sec. 401. Alternative hydrocarbon and renewable reserves disclosures classification system. Sec. 501. Authorization of appropriations. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA. \"Coal-to-liquid\" involves using coal to produce synthetic fuel for transportation. \"Domestic fuels facility\" is a facility that primarily uses domestic coal for the Fischer-Tropsch process. A domestic fuels facility includes coal liquification, renewable fuel production, and crude oil refining for transportation fuel. The curr_chunk defines terms related to domestic fuels facility expansion, permitting agreements, producers, and Indian land. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to Indian land, Indian tribe, permit, and Secretary of Energy. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy and \"State\" as including states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. TITLE I--COLLABORATIVE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR DOMESTIC FUELS FACILITIES\n\nSEC. 101. COLLABORATIVE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR DOMESTIC FUELS FACILITIES. The Administrator shall enter into a domestic fuels facility permitting agreement with a State or Indian tribe to improve the process for obtaining permits necessary for construction and operation. The agreement grants the Administrator authority to accept consolidated permit applications from refiners and establish a permitting schedule. The Administrator will establish a permitting schedule for Federal, State, or Indian tribal government agencies to concurrently consider and complete permit determinations. A consolidated permit combining all required permits for domestic fuels producers will be issued. Financial assistance will be provided to State and Indian tribal government agencies as needed for additional hiring. Under a domestic fuels facility permitting agreement, government agencies may hire additional personnel to comply with the schedule and receive technical assistance. States or Indian tribes must agree to grant the Administrator authorities and make necessary changes for project-wide permit reviews. The Administrator and State or Indian tribe must conduct project-wide permit reviews in coordination with EPA and other agencies, incorporating an interdisciplinary approach and meeting established schedules. This may involve using environmental management practices and third-party contractors. The Administrator and State or Indian tribe must approve or disapprove consolidated permits for new domestic fuels facilities within 360 days of receiving the application, or within 90 days after the initial deadline if agreed upon. For the expansion of existing facilities, a similar process for consolidated permits must be followed. For the expansion of an existing domestic fuels facility, the Administrator and the State or governing body of an Indian tribe must approve or disapprove the consolidated permit within 120 days of receiving the complete application, or within 30 days after the initial deadline if agreed upon. Federal agencies must comply with the schedule for permit issuance determinations. Judicial review is available for civil actions. (g) Judicial Review.--Civil actions for review of determinations in permitting processes under a domestic fuels facility permit agreement must be filed in the district where the facility is located. (h) Efficient Permit Review.--The Administrator can use State procedures to meet Federal requirements. (i) Severability.--If permits are not approved by a deadline, a consolidated permit may be issued. The Administrator may issue a consolidated permit combining all required permits for a domestic fuels producer, except those not approved. This section does not affect existing laws on permits for domestic fuels facilities. Consultation with local governments is encouraged, and local authority on permit issuance is not affected. SEC. 201. EVALUATION OF FISCHER-TROPSCH DIESEL AND JET FUEL AS AN EMISSION CONTROL STRATEGY. The Administrator, in cooperation with various agencies and industry representatives, will conduct a research program to evaluate the air quality benefits of ultra-clean Fischer-Tropsch transportation fuel and submit recommendations to Congress on its effective use for reducing exhaust emissions. Additionally, the Administrator will provide guidance and technical support as needed. The Administrator will conduct a research program to evaluate the benefits of Fischer-Tropsch fuel for reducing emissions. The program will consider the use of neat Fischer-Tropsch fuel and blends with conventional fuel for diesel engines and aviation. A report on actions taken will be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will conduct a research program to evaluate the benefits of Fischer-Tropsch fuel for reducing emissions. A report on actions taken will be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, interim and final reports on actions taken to carry out this section will be submitted within specified timeframes. SEC. 301. Economic development assistance for commercial-scale cellulosic biomass ethanol projects and coal-to-liquids facilities on BRAC property and Indian land. Priority will be given to projects supporting commercial-scale cellulosic biomass ethanol and coal-to-liquids facilities when awarding funds for section 209(c)(1) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. The Federal share for these projects will be 80% of the project cost, or 100% if carried out on Indian land. The Secretary will provide an additional award of 10% of the grant amount for projects supporting commercial-scale biomass ethanol or coal-to-liquid facilities. This award can be used for eligible purposes under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, including covering up to 100% of project costs. The Secretary will use funds from economic development assistance programs or under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to meet non-Federal share requirements for eligible projects. An additional award will be considered as funds from a non-Federal source for this purpose. TITLE IV--ALTERNATIVE HYDROCARBON AND RENEWABLE RESERVES DISCLOSURES CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. SEC. 401. ALTERNATIVE HYDROCARBON AND RENEWABLE RESERVES DISCLOSURES CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. The Securities and Exchange Commission will appoint a task force to analyze and report to Congress on modernizing hydrocarbon reserves disclosures and creating a renewable reserves classification system for cellulosic biofuels feedstocks. The report is due within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act and its amendments."
