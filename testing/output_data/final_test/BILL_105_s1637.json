    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assistance Act of 1998\". Congress acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by bounty hunters in recovering fugitives, highlights the importance of bail as an alternative to pretrial detention, and emphasizes the public safety aspect of returning fugitives to custody. Bail bond agents are regulated by the States. Bounty hunters are largely unregulated, while bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States. Public safety requires qualified and well-trained bounty hunters who often affect interstate commerce in their duties. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"bail bond agent\" and \"bounty hunter\" in relation to securing the release of a criminal defendant and recovering fugitives. The curr_chunk defines a \"bounty hunter employer\" as a person who employs or provides the services of bounty hunters for consideration. The term \"law enforcement officer\" refers to a public officer authorized to engage in criminal prevention, investigation, prosecution, or adjudication, including those involved in corrections, parole, probation, or fugitive recovery. SEC. 4. MODEL GUIDELINES. The Attorney General must develop model guidelines for state control and regulation of bounty hunters within 180 days of this Act. Consultation with various organizations is required, and recommendations will include whether fingerprint-based criminal background checks should be mandatory for bounty hunter applicants. The proposed regulations for bounty hunters include mandatory criminal background checks, liability insurance requirements, and restrictions on entering private dwellings without prior announcement. The Attorney General shall publish model guidelines in the Federal Register regarding the official recognition of bounty hunters from other States, the effect on bail cost and availability, and the bail bond agent industry. No Federal regulation authority is granted for bounty hunters, bounty hunter employers, or bail bond agents. Passed the Senate on October 7, 1998. Attest: GARY SISCO, Secretary."
