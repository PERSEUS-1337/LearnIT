    "content": "In August 2003, a political accord ended armed civil conflict in Liberia. The country has since made progress in peace consolidation, post-war resettlement, and socio-economic reconstruction. Despite obstacles, such as credible elections and effective governance, international donors, including the US, have pledged over $522 million for relief and reconstruction. At a donor conference in February 2004, over $522 million was pledged for Liberia's relief and reconstruction, with $200 million from the United States. The conference reviewed the National Transitional Government's plans for post-conflict transition and progress on the peace accord. The focus was on a \"Results-Focused Transition Framework\" for reconstruction and rehabilitation activities in 2004 and 2005, including security maintenance and demobilization efforts. At a donor conference in February 2004, over $522 million was pledged for Liberia's relief and reconstruction, with $200 million from the United States. The conference focused on security maintenance, demobilization, reintegration, democratic governance, rule of law, police training, elections, protection of refugees and IDPs, advocacy for human and gender-based rights, combating HIV/AIDS, provision of basic services, economic development, and infrastructure reconstruction. The U.S. Supplemental Appropriation provided $245 million for UN peacekeeping operations in Liberia. The U.S. provided funding for UN peacekeeping operations in Liberia and humanitarian assistance. The National Transitional Government of Liberia was established following the deployment of UNMIL in 2003, led by Gyude Bryant. The CPA, signed on August 18, 2003, followed negotiations mediated by ECOWAS and ICGL. Signatories included armed parties and political groups in Liberia, providing for DDRR programs. Wesley Johnson, vice-chairman of the NTGL, heads the Liberian United Peoples' Party. The CPA signed in August 2003 in Liberia mandates the implementation of DDRR programs, peace-building processes, and the coordination of various political and reconstruction programs. Key provisions include the establishment of political processes, military and police restructuring, release of prisoners, and apportionment of government leadership positions. The peace accord signed in Liberia in August 2003 included provisions for DDRR programs, political processes, military restructuring, release of prisoners, and the apportionment of government leadership positions. Key events leading to the accord were the departure of Charles Taylor and the deployment of the ECOWAS Mission in Liberia. Additionally, new institutions such as the Contracts and Monopolies Commission, Governance Reform Commission, and Truth and Reconciliation Commission were established. The departure of Charles Taylor from Liberia in 2003 was facilitated by international pressure and the offer of asylum in Nigeria. His exit led to the assumption of the presidency by Moses Blah and paved the way for the establishment of the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL). Taylor's departure was influenced by the threat of extradition to face war crimes charges in Sierra Leone, military advances by rebel groups LURD and MODEL, and their refusal to engage in peace talks while he remained in power. The ECOWAS Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL) intervened to end the conflict. The ECOWAS intervention aimed to end heavy fighting and address a humanitarian crisis following a failed cease-fire. ECOMIL, with support from various West African forces, deployed to Liberia starting in August 2003, reaching a full force of over 3,560 members by mid-September. The United States provided logistical and transport assistance. The United States provided $26 million in logistical and transport services, communications equipment, and supplies to Liberia through PAE Government Services, Inc. The assistance was delivered in liaison with elements of the U.S. military Joint Task Force Liberia. The conflict in Liberia began when Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) launched cross-border raids from bases in Guinea in mid-year 2000. LURD, initially comprised of Liberian exiles living in Sierra Leone and Guinea, started to coalesce in mid-1999. LURD was formed by Liberians living in Sierra Leone and Guinea as exiles and refugees. The group's leader, Sekou Damate Conneh, is a former Liberian tax collector of Mandingo heritage who fled to Guinea in 1990. He later became an autotrader and businessman, and was imprisoned in Liberia in 1997 before fleeing to Guinea again. Conneh has close relations with authorities in Conakry, mediated by his wife Aisha Keita-Conneh, who advises Cont\u00c3\u00a9. Internal rifts within LURD were fueled by differences between the couple. The group was motivated by opposition to ethnic bias, political exclusion, human rights abuses, and corruption under Taylor. In early 2003, some Krahn members departed LURD to form MODEL, a group that emerged from a merger between LURD members in Cote d'Ivoire and Force Lima, a militia created to counter Liberian militias supported by the Taylor government. Many of Force Lima's recruits were anti-Taylor Liberian Krahn refugees. Force Lima and later MODEL, reportedly backed by the Gbagbo government, had linkages and shared financial support. Despite being a LURD splinter group, MODEL did not militarily oppose Force Lima. Both groups faced internal divisions and were susceptible to further fissures due to resentment towards leaders' access to state resources. The armed rebel campaign by LURD grew in geographic extent and military intensity after the first attacks in 2000, spreading south and to central Liberia. By late 2002, many Liberian towns experienced combat and insecurity, with rebel forces gradually seizing more territory in 2003. Belligerents' territorial control was limited and transitory. In early 2003, MODEL moved into eastern Liberia from areas near the border with Cote d'Ivoire, making significant military gains by seizing territory and towns. The armed groups recruited many children and adolescents, often using drugs and alcohol. In the next few months, rebel groups expanded their operations in Liberia, seizing territory and towns in eastern counties and along the coast. By April 2003, LURD and MODEL controlled about 60% of Liberian territory. Rebel gains continued with intense assaults on the capital, leading to high civilian casualties. Conflict gradually declined after the deployment of peacekeepers, but periodic fighting persisted due to looting opportunities in contested zones. The CPA was motivated by looting opportunities in contested zones and the belligerents' desire to consolidate control over territory. Armed groups' leaders were reluctant to disarm until their political demands, such as government positions, were met. Political conditions deteriorated as the LURD insurgency grew, leading to a state of emergency and a ban on political activities by the Taylor government. Under Taylor's leadership, opposition parties in Liberia were harassed and their activities curtailed, leading to concerns about electoral competition in the upcoming general elections. The Electoral Commission was accused of being controlled by Taylor's ruling party, prompting calls for election postponement. The Taylor government faced international calls to postpone elections, but insisted on holding them in mid-October 2003. As rebel gains continued, the government considered a 12 to 18 month election deferral. Human rights abuses increased with restrictions on political activities, leading to detentions and harassment of dissidents and rebel supporters. Many detainees were released after beatings or bribes, while others were held for longer periods. Reports of widespread human rights abuses in war-affected areas include theft, extortion, impressment of youths into military service, executions, beatings, torture, rape, and abduction for forced labor by both government and rebel forces. Looting, burning of towns and IDP camps, and internal dislocation were also common. During LURD assaults on Monrovia in 2003, government military forces were particularly abusive and exploitative. The military forces in Liberia were reportedly abusive and exploitative, with widespread abuses continuing in combat zones even after the signing of the CPA. Humanitarian conditions deteriorated sharply in late 2002 and 2003, with IDP camps being overcrowded and lacking in basic necessities. Humanitarian assistance became a target for armed groups. Humanitarian assistance in Liberia became a target for armed groups, leading to violent raids on IDP camps and forcing residents to flee. By April/May 2003, humanitarian relief agencies were unable to provide emergency assistance in 11 of Liberia's 15 counties due to combat and insecurity. This resulted in a significant worsening of humanitarian conditions, with over 300,000 displaced persons living in or near Monrovia by August. Food stocks ran low, food prices rose sharply, and cases of malnutrition, especially among children, increased. Access to clean water decreased due to contamination and overcrowding. Conditions in Liberia deteriorated significantly due to contamination, overcrowding, and outbreaks of diseases like cholera. Violence during fighting in Monrovia led to robbery, abuse of civilians, and numerous casualties. By mid-September 2003, around 500,000 Liberians were internally displaced, with 311,000 refugees in neighboring countries by October/November. Relief efforts were hindered by belligerents stealing vehicles and looting supply warehouses. Thousands of IDPs and refugees remained in inaccessible areas until after a peace accord. Prior to the 2003 peace accord in Liberia, cycles of conflict had negative effects on national security, political stability, and economic prosperity in the region. These effects included the spread of small arms, violence-based social norms, mercenary activity, rebel groups along borders, human rights abuses, and displaced populations. Fighters from various factions were involved in conflicts in Sierra Leone. During the Sierra Leonean civil war (1991-2002), the Liberian government was involved in conflicts in southern Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. Poor relations between Liberia and Guinea led to accusations of sponsoring aggression. Many factional opponents of Taylor sought refuge in Guinea, leading to the formation of LURD with alleged support from Guinea. LURD fighters assisted Guinea in defeating attacks in southern Guinea between 2000 and 2001. During the Sierra Leonean civil war, conflicts in southern Guinea involved a mix of forces including RUF fighters, Liberian militias, Guinean rebels, and mercenaries. Guinea reportedly supported LURD with arms and military assistance, despite denying such reports. The influence of Guinea in Liberia was evident through visits and ongoing support to LURD leaders even after the peace accord. In late 2003, Conneh announced LURD's intention to end combat in Liberia with support from Guinea. Aisha Keita-Conneh also traveled to Monrovia in 2004 with Guinean military bodyguards. In late 2002, Liberians were involved in clashes and human rights abuses in western Cote d'Ivoire after a rebellion in northern Cote d'Ivoire. The Ivorian government was accused of supporting armed rebel groups in Liberia, leading to tensions along the border. Despite a decrease in violence in western Cote d'Ivoire, periodic reports of conflicts between local Ivorian citizens and foreign immigrants persist. Peace efforts in both Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire are addressing the cross-border dynamics of the conflict. Cote d'Ivoire is aware of conflict dynamics along the Liberian-Ivorian frontier. UNMIL and UNOCI share intelligence on cross-border flows of refugees and armed groups. Former Presidents Taylor and Gbagbo discussed deploying a joint military force along the border, but the plans were never carried out. International relief assistance continues to support Liberia and its neighbors due to poor economic conditions and conflict-related humanitarian needs. The region has been a focus of international conflict resolution efforts, with Liberia facing sanctions for supporting rebel groups in exchange for diamonds. U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 2001 demanding an end to support for rebels and arms trafficking for diamonds. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Liberia in 2001 to stop support for rebels and arms trafficking for diamonds. The sanctions were extended in 2002 and 2003 due to Liberia's non-compliance. Critics suggested expanding sanctions to limit the Taylor government's access to national resources diverted for private use and regional conflicts. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Liberia in 2001 to stop support for rebels and arms trafficking for diamonds. The sanctions were extended in 2002 and 2003. On December 22, 2003, the Security Council terminated the sanctions and replaced them with new ones due to concerns about the cease-fire not being universally implemented, illegal exploitation of natural resources, and proliferation of arms in Liberia and West Africa. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Liberia in 2001 to stop support for rebels and arms trafficking for diamonds. The sanctions were extended in 2002 and 2003. On December 22, 2003, the Security Council terminated the sanctions and replaced them with new ones due to concerns about the cease-fire not being universally implemented, illegal exploitation of natural resources, and proliferation of arms in Liberia and West Africa. S/RES/1521 banned the export of arms to Liberia, foreign travel of individuals posing a threat to peace, import of rough diamonds, and import of Liberian logs and timber products. The Security Council imposed sanctions on Liberia in 2001 to stop support for rebels and arms trafficking for diamonds. S/RES/1521 banned the export of arms to Liberia, foreign travel of individuals posing a threat to peace, and the import of Liberian logs and timber products. It urged the NTGL to establish control over timber harvesting areas and revenues, implement a Certificate of Origin regime for rough diamonds, oversee public revenues, and form a sanctions monitoring Committee. The Security Council declined to lift the sanctions in 2004 despite a request from the NTGL. The Security Council decided to re-establish a panel of experts to assess compliance with sanctions on Liberia's timber and diamonds. Assets of former president Charles Taylor and his associates were frozen, and funds were traced and frozen. President Bush's Executive Order 13348 implemented the ban in the United States. The transitional government of Liberia implemented the ban in mid-October 2004. The establishment and deployment of UNMIL was authorized by the Security Council before the CPA. The Security Council authorized a Multinational Force (MNF) in Liberia to support the cease-fire agreement and establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief. Resolution 1497 labeled President Taylor's departure as \"critical\" and mandated the installation of a transitional government by October 1, 2003. The MNF was granted a waiver of U.N. sanctions and authorized to use military force under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The Security Council authorized a Multinational Force (MNF) in Liberia to support the cease-fire agreement and establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief. Resolution 1497 exempted MNF personnel from ICC prosecution and allowed UNAMSIL to provide logistical support to ECOWAS for 30 days to field the ECOMIL force. Despite expectations of other nations contributing troops, ECOMIL was the sole contributor to the MNF. The UNMIL mission in Liberia was authorized by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. It commenced operations on October 1, 2003, absorbing the ECOMIL troops and becoming its core force. UNMIL was allowed up to 15,000 military personnel, including observers and civilian police officers. Upon its establishment, the existing UNOL office was dissolved and its assets transferred to UNMIL. The UN Office in Liberia (UNOL) was dissolved and its assets folded into UNMIL, which was given a 12-month initial mandate by the Security Council. UNMIL's key duties include monitoring and implementing the CPA and June cease-fire accord, creating an action plan for a DDRR program, disengaging and cantoning military forces, supporting the Joint Monitoring Committee, implementing a voluntary disarmament program, providing security for government installations and infrastructure, facilitating humanitarian aid, promoting human rights, and protecting civilians under threat of violence. The UNMIL resolution mandated assistance to Liberia in various areas such as restructuring police and military forces, restoring national authority, and preparing for national elections. UNMIL is led by Jacques Paul Klein, a retired U.S. Air Force General and senior diplomat. The top UNMIL officials include Lieutenant-General Daniel IshmaelOpande, Souren Seraydarian, Abou Moussa, and Mark A. Kroeker. Liberia faces challenges in transitioning from a humanitarian crisis to economic recovery, re-establishing state authority, and rebuilding government institutions. The current challenges facing Liberia include capacity building in various ministries and agencies, socio-economic recovery, peace and security issues, humanitarian conditions improving in urban areas, and ongoing efforts related to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, DDRR, elections preparation, and the status of Charles Taylor. Emergency operations were reinitiated in Liberia after the deployment of ECOMIL and the signing of the peace accord. The socio-economic situation began to stabilize with renewed food and fuel imports, reopening of businesses, and key transport corridors. U.N. agencies, NGOs, and NTGL ministries have implemented projects targeting nutrition, water, sanitation, healthcare, and transportation infrastructure. Quick-impact projects and disease immunization campaigns have been undertaken, but high levels of humanitarian need persist in Liberia. Despite progress, high levels of humanitarian need persist in Liberia. In August 2004, there were 300,000 internally displaced persons in camps and 350,000 Liberian refugees in neighboring countries. Access to relief supplies is available in IDP camps and urban areas, but overcrowding is a challenge. Over 418,000 individuals rely on monthly food distributions from the World Food Program. In August 2004, the World Food Program announced a decrease in rations due to shortages, leading to a 27% reduction in daily caloric nutrition levels. Severe malnutrition was reported in some areas, attributed to illnesses like malaria and cholera during the rainy season. Relief agency activities and assessments of medical and humanitarian needs have been ongoing, with a focus on providing adequate potable water for emergency relief and resettlement programs. Relief agencies are planning resettlement operations for displaced populations, stockpiling resources like seeds and tools. Formal resettlement programs will start once areas are declared safe by the Security Assessment Committee for Resettlement. The UNHCR and NTGL, along with NGOs, are working on declarations for targeted areas, requiring UNMIL peacekeepers, disarmament programs, functioning police services, access for humanitarian agencies, and assessment of spontaneous resettlements. The NTGL Education Ministry is reinitiating education efforts with assistance from UNICEF to address the limited access to schooling and high illiteracy rates among young Liberians. UNICEF has assisted NTGL in rebuilding the education sector in Liberia by providing school supply kits, teacher training programs, and access to clean water. Efforts include assessments, teacher training, vocational programs, support for girls' education, school rehabilitation, and healthcare/nutrition delivery. WFP programs reach over 395,000 pupils. WFP programs in Liberia reach over 395,000 pupils with plans to expand aid to 65,000 more children by late 2004. Progress in reopening schools has been made, but only 20% of University of Liberia students are fully registered. Commerce is growing nationwide, with key transport routes free of factional checkpoints, and imported goods are available in urban areas. Public infrastructure remains devastated, with Monrovia lacking piped water. Monrovia, with a population of about 1 million, lacks piped water and public electricity mains; most electricity is produced by private generators. Donor-aided rehabilitation is targeting these sectors. Concerns exist that the economic upswing in Liberia is driven by donor-financed expenditures, rather than fundamental economic recovery. $354 million of $520 million in donor pledges made in February 2004 had been received as of mid-October 2004. Re-establishment of State Institutions is ongoing. The re-establishment of State Institutions in Liberia is ongoing, with a phased extension of state authority being undertaken by the NTGL and NTLA with the assistance of UNMIL. However, progress has been hindered by a lack of basic facilities and resources, insecurity in rural areas, and friction among local authorities. This includes a mix of individuals affiliated with armed factions, traditional leaders, and officials from previous regimes. Objections to unilateral nominations of local officials by the NTGL executive have led to increased cooperation between branches of the transitional government. The NTGL committee vets candidates for NTGL nominees, focusing on key areas outside the capital. Local officials coordinate with NTGL, U.N., and NGOs for reintegration programs, infrastructure assessments, and natural resource regulation to comply with U.N. sanctions on Liberia. The government deployed revenue collectors to Liberia's main towns to comply with U.N. sanctions. UNMIL worked with NTGL to deploy immigration and customs officials at key border crossings. UNMIL is also assisting with housing and property disputes in Monrovia. The NTGL ministry headquarters lack basic equipment and resources, but donor-funded projects are working to address this. The government has taken steps to re-establish basic processes, including directing state revenues to the central bank and submitting a $23.5 million interim budget for government wage bills. The NTGL announced bi-monthly payments of salary arrears starting in late July 2004 after an audit to remove ghost workers. Despite this, government workers went on strike in late May demanding immediate payment. NTGL reiterated its commitment to begin arrears payments in late July. The NTGL announced bi-monthly payments of salary arrears starting in late July 2004 after an audit to remove ghost workers. Despite this, government workers went on strike in late May demanding immediate payment. NTGL reiterated its commitment to beginning arrears payments. Some observers worry about transparency and accountability in government operations, citing concerns about self-enrichment of office holders and questionable financial transactions. The NTGL in Liberia faced criticism for slow progress in various areas, including elections and fiscal management. UNMIL head Jacques Klein highlighted the lack of urgency among officials and called for increased transparency and accountability to lift U.N. sanctions. The NTGL in Liberia is working towards the removal of U.N. sanctions by implementing reforms, including auditing government agencies with foreign assistance and replacing the former Central Bank governor. Despite criticisms, donors are optimistic about granting foreign debt relief to Liberia. Saleeby, the former Central Bank governor, faced criticism for printing $12.3 million of currency without approval during Taylor's regime. He was linked to public sector corruption and fiscal chaos. In May 2004, the IMF threatened to refuse cooperation until Saleeby resigned. Reforms in the Security and Legal Sectors include the formation of a Rule of Law Implementation Committee to coordinate police, judicial, and prison reforms in Liberia. The National Police Academy has reopened, with training of cadets ongoing. Limited courts are functioning, with UNMIL aiding in training and vetting judges. Police recruitments are ongoing, and law enforcement personnel are being enrolled in a nationwide registry. The reform and rehabilitation of Liberia's national justice system is underway with support from UNMIL and donor countries. Plans for reforming the armed forces are still in progress, with $35 million allocated for U.S. assistance. An estimated $118-200 million may be needed to rebuild a 3,000-4,000 person military. The U.S. is planning for a 4,000-6,000 person military in Liberia, with $118 million allocated for regional peacekeeping and military financing. UNMIL troops are deployed throughout Liberia, with a total strength of 14,363 troops, 201 military observers, and 1,089 civilian police personnel. Deployment of a communications group is also underway. UNMIL had a total strength of 14,363 troops, 201 military observers, and 1,089 civilian police personnel from 60 countries. The security situation in Liberia has improved due to UNMIL's deployment and disarmament programs, although periodic unrest still occurs. In 2004, UNMIL troops monitored roads and borders, conducted search and seizure operations to stop illicit arms trafficking, and reported no significant cease-fire violations among armed factions. However, intra-factional rivalries occasionally turned violent, posing threats to public security in Monrovia and other areas with disarmed ex-combatants. Limited discord within MODEL and former government forces also contributed to tensions. In late 2003 and 2004, intra-factional tensions within LURD arose between two groups, one led by Sekou Conneh and the other by military commanders supporting Conneh's wife, Aisha Keita-Conneh, and Kabineh Janneh. Keita-Conneh, a founding leader of LURD, held significant influence despite not having a formal position. Internal discord within LURD has been ongoing, with disagreements among leaders during the conflict and peace talks. In January 2004, tensions arose within LURD due to disagreements over leadership positions and allegations of favoritism and bribery. Some members called for Aisha Keita-Conneh to take over as chairman from Sekou Conneh. These tensions were further fueled by a marital dispute between Conneh and Keita-Conneh. In April, LURD fighters rioted in Gbargna due to inadequate disarmament assistance. In early June, a group of LURD leaders suspended Conneh as chairman and appointed Chayee Doe, who later died. Janneh was then chosen as the new LURD Chairman. In August, the two factions engaged in vehicle theft, abductions, fistfights, and shootings, threatening public security. UNMIL intervened to halt the violence. Conneh continues to claim his position as chairman despite the disputes. During key events, Conneh's absence from Liberia led some to believe he was chosen as a figurehead leader with little direct influence over LURD's military. He has struggled to assert his authority and form alliances with politicians, leading to intra-LURD violence in early August. The spate of intra-LURD violence in early August was spurred by Conneh's return to Monrovia and the prospect of him re-asserting control. Conneh's position has since strengthened as some military leaders have distanced themselves from Keita-Conneh. The ongoing tensions within LURD are concerning due to its key position within the NTGL and history of using force for political ends. LURD has announced it will officially dissolve as an armed force on October 31, but observers fear a split into opposing factions could lead to renewed armed conflict and destabilize Liberia. Observers anticipate that the armed group LURD will transform into a political party after announcing its dissolution as an armed force on October 31. Progress has been made towards key challenges in implementing the CPA, such as disagreements over NTGL appointments and disarmament. Job-related political demands by LURD have threatened demobilization efforts and the formation of the NTGL. In mid-December 2003, the armed factions demanded control over top government posts, including ministries and agencies allocated to political parties and civil society under the peace accord. This demand caused tension and threats of resignation from civilian groups, including the Deputy Chairman of the NTGL. In early September 2004, ongoing disputes over government posts within the NTGL made it difficult for the Transitional Government to function cohesively. Disagreements also arose over the selection of NTLA seats, which have mostly been resolved except for one seat requiring a special election. The peace accord in Liberia mandates the cantonment and DDRR of armed parties, supervised by UNMIL. The UNMIL-supervised disarmament process in Liberia faced immediate problems due to misinformation about payment protocols for disarming combatants. Plans for a two-stage payment of $300 led to riots when combatants realized they wouldn't receive immediate payment. UNMIL later announced $75 payment for weapons upon entrance to cantonment sites, halting the DDRR process for further planning. The DDRR process in Liberia faced initial challenges, including public criticisms, opposition from LURD, and the need for more preparations. After delays, the process restarted in April 2004 and has been successful, with over 95,000 combatants demobilized, including women, children, and foreign combatants. Over 21,000 weapons have been collected. The disarmament process in Liberia has successfully demobilized over 95,000 combatants, including women, children, and at least 530 foreign combatants. Over 21,000 weapons have been turned in, along with ammunition and unexploded ordnance. However, challenges remain as not all ex-combatants have surrendered their weapons, raising concerns about potential caches of weapons that could reignite conflict if political institutions fail to mediate competing interests. UNMIL has seized multiple weapons, fueling these concerns. Several concerns have been raised regarding the disarmament process in Liberia, including the lower-than-anticipated number of heavy weapons surrendered and reports of former Taylor loyalists recruiting fighters in southern Guinea. There are worries about weapons being smuggled out of Liberia into neighboring countries, particularly into Cote d'Ivoire where the political situation is unstable. Additionally, not all disarmed ex-combatants surrendered their weapons during the DDRR process. In August 2004, UNMIL officials began rejecting prospective inductees into disarmament camps who lacked a weapon, causing concern among those affected. The National Commission on DDRR received a complaint from a former government commander claiming that 2,000 of his men had been rejected for DDRR. The completion date for disarmament was extended to December 2004, causing further contention. The disarmament process in Liberia faced challenges as the planned end-date of October 30 was rejected by the NCDDRR, citing the need for more time to open disarmament sites and reach remote areas. Despite initial disagreements, Chairman Bryant eventually accepted the October 30 date, and UNMIL opened its final disarmament site in late September. Funding for ex-combatant reintegration programs was reported to be inadequate, posing another obstacle to the disarmament process. The inadequate funding for ex-combatant reintegration programs in Liberia is a major concern, with donors withholding support until the disarmament process is complete. UN and NTGL officials fear that not all ex-combatants will receive assistance, jeopardizing the sustainability of the DDRR program. Additionally, there are over 15,000 child soldiers in Liberia, with special provisions in disarmament plans to address their needs. UNICEF leads a Child Protection Working Group to support these efforts. In late August 2004, UNICEF reported that only half of the funding for reintegration projects for child ex-combatants had been received. An independent National Elections Commission was appointed by the NTGL in January 2004 to ensure credible elections by October 2005. The UN is working on a potential elections assistance program to support this goal. The program aims to conduct credible elections and establish a sustainable national electoral administration capacity. An assessment in April 2004 highlighted key tasks such as establishing electoral systems, boundaries, voting eligibility, political candidacy, party registration, and election administration procedures. The United Nations assessment in April 2004 found that the National Electoral Commission (NEC) in need of extensive international assistance due to limited capacity for voter education, registration, and polling. The UN projects a one-year deployment of international and national experts, General Service staff, and UN Volunteers to support the electoral unit. The UNMIL CIVPOL unit is preparing for the elections by deploying 220 U.N. Volunteers and hiring 4,080 temporary registration staff for six months. The cost of these workers and funding for registration materials are proposed to be included in UNMIL's budget submission. The NEC chair estimated $12.4 million for the election, with one third likely covered by UNMIL's support. A nationwide voter registration exercise is projected to start in April 2005 for five weeks. The cost of the elections is estimated to be around $16 million, with in-kind support from UNMIL. The NEC is preparing for the 2005 election, favoring direct, constituency-based elections over proportional party elections. They have submitted an Electoral Reform Bill to the NTLA for ratification. The Electoral Reform Bill has been submitted to the NTLA for ratification, proposing measures such as suspending certain articles of the constitution for the 2005 elections. This includes changing the election process for the president, vice president, House representatives, and senators. The Electoral Reform Bill proposes fixed House seats at sixty four, multi-member constituencies for each county, and equal voter representation for winning candidates. It also suggests suspending Article 78, changing party membership requirements, allowing inter-party coalitions, and funding the NEC through the public treasury with oversight on spending. The Electoral Reform Bill proposes various amendments to the New Elections Law of 1986, including provisions to prevent electoral malfeasance and set campaign spending limits. It also addresses population displacements by suspending residency requirements for presidential and vice presidential candidates, legislative candidates, and allowing the NEC to assist displaced persons and refugees with registration and voting. The indictment against Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone led to his departure from power, weakening his stature and bargaining power. An arrest warrant was issued for him, but Ghana claimed non-receipt of the request to detain and transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Taylor abruptly returned to Liberia, reportedly on a Ghanaian state aircraft. The indictment against Taylor was controversial, seen as hindering a quick political settlement for his departure from power in Liberia. In response, LURD launched an attack on Monrovia to gain military advantage. Talks were temporarily delayed as Taylor and LURD exchanged threats, but eventually led to a ceasefire accord on June 17. Nigeria offered asylum to Taylor, criticizing the indictment as counterproductive to peace efforts. Nigeria offered asylum to Taylor, with strong U.S. encouragement, after he initially rejected it due to extradition fears. Taylor accepted the offer in exchange for resigning and withdrawing from Liberian politics. Despite conditions, he continued to communicate with allies in Liberia, prompting a warning from the Nigerian government. Taylor's influence in Liberia is declining, but allegations of his involvement in political activities persist. His asylum in Nigeria has sparked controversy due to his past actions, with some Nigerians calling for his surrender to the International Criminal Court. Several Nigerian legislators have called for Nigeria to surrender Taylor to Interpol in response to a Red Notice issued by the Special Court. A coalition of Nigerian, Liberian, and Nigerian NGOs, along with Open Society, urged the Nigerian government to revoke Taylor's asylum. In July 2004, Liberia's transitional parliament rejected a petition to extradite Taylor to face trial before the SCSL. Two Nigerian plaintiffs are also seeking transfer of Taylor to the SCSL through a court case. The plaintiffs, former businessmen whose limbs were amputated by Sierra Leonean RUF rebels in 1999, are pursuing a court case to have Nigeria reconsider and rescind its asylum provision to Taylor. They argue that the asylum is illegitimate as it was granted by the executive branch instead of the National Refugee Commission. They claim this breaches their rights under Nigerian law and international law, hindering Taylor's trial at the SCSL. The Nigerian government argues that the Federal High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs lack standing in the case as they are not parties to the SCSL and filed their case after relevant statutes of limitation had expired. Amnesty International applied to submit an amicus curiae brief focusing on whether war crimes indictees of the SCSL are entitled to refugee status and if Nigeria must surrender such indictees. Taylor is seeking to have the SCSL indictment lifted. Taylor's efforts to have the SCSL indictment lifted have failed despite challenging the court's jurisdiction and claiming immunity as a former head of state. The ICJ and Special Court have rejected his arguments. In late May 2004, the SCSL Appeals Chamber rejected Taylor's claim of immunity from prosecution. The prosecution team is now awaiting Taylor's appearance before the SCSL. Additionally, in March 2004, SCSL prosecution agents searched Taylor's former residences in Liberia and those of his associates. Taylor could also face legal charges before the ECOWAS court. The possibility of asylum providing Taylor with indemnity from prosecution sparked debate. The debate surrounding Taylor's extradition from Liberia to face prosecution raised concerns about prioritizing political negotiations over justice. Some policymakers believed peace in Liberia was more urgent than Taylor's prosecution in Sierra Leone. The Bush Administration and others saw Taylor's asylum as a temporary solution, leaving his case subject to legal decisions. However, some, including Members of Congress, insisted that Taylor must face the charges against him to maintain deterrence. The debate over Taylor's extradition raised concerns about prioritizing peace over justice. Some advocate pressuring Nigeria to extradite Taylor, citing U.S. laws supporting this goal. However, others fear this may unfairly target Nigeria and damage relations, potentially undermining peace efforts in Liberia. The Nigerian government increased security for Taylor after the enactment of P.L. 108-106, which includes a provision for rewards for indictees of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. State Department officials oppose actions that infringe on sovereignty and believe apprehending indictees with U.S. rewards should be done by appropriate governments. The U.S. rewards for indictees are given in exchange for credible information leading to their apprehension. In Taylor's case, no reward is necessary as he is under the control of the Nigerian government. Legislation provides funding for emergencies in the diplomatic service, transferring funds for rewards to the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The U.S. legislation requires Nigeria to surrender Taylor to the Special Court for Sierra Leone or face consequences such as denial of assistance. Bush Administration's policy towards Liberia focused on human rights, humanitarian aid, and development assistance through USAID. The USAID focused on local NGO projects to improve health care, food security, income generation, and infrastructure building in Liberia. They also worked on capacity building for civil society groups and media to support electoral change. In response to increasing conflict, the Administration shifted towards protecting Americans and facilitating peace negotiations in Liberia. Military teams were dispatched to bolster security for the U.S. embassy. The U.S. embassy in Monrovia was attacked by mortar fire and stray bullets during heavy fighting, leading to the evacuation of Americans. On June 25, 2003, a U.S. embassy storage compound was hit by two explosions, resulting in casualties. The State Department condemned the attack, and on July 20, a team of U.S. Marines was sent to bolster security. U.S. Marines from the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team were deployed to Monrovia amidst heavy fighting and mortar fire near the embassy. They were supported by U.S. air transport teams for evacuations. The U.S. played an active role in peace negotiations in Ghana to improve security, resume relief operations, and facilitate a transition of power after a cease-fire agreement was signed on June 17. After a cease-fire agreement was signed on June 17, the United States urged Liberian belligerents to adhere to it and prevent civilian casualties. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Pamela Bridgewater and Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter Kansteiner visited Guinea to emphasize the need for an end to the conflict and Guinean support of LURD. The United States assisted in deploying ECOMIL to Liberia in July and August 2003, following public debate about potential military intervention. The United States pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Liberia after deploying ECOMIL. Calls for international intervention, including a U.S.-led one, grew as fighting in Monrovia escalated. Proponents argued that the U.S. had historical ties to Liberia and should intervene to stop the civil war. Opponents argued that U.S. ties with Liberia had weakened since the 1980s, and that intervening in Liberia's conflict was not in U.S. interests due to potential dangers to troops. Proponents believed Liberia's situation was different from Somalia and that intervention was necessary to address political and economic instability. Liberia had become a failed state, with porous borderzones plagued by cross-border crime and arms flows. Reports suggested the Taylor government aided international terrorist financing. U.S. officials were assessing the situation but made no commitments to deploy troops, suggesting African militaries could intervene effectively. The U.S. officials suggested African militaries could intervene effectively in Liberia, with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld noting their training and equipment for peacekeeping. Prior to establishing an intervention force, the U.S. required Taylor to give up power, a finalized political agreement among Liberian parties, and international support for a peace process. In July 2003, a U.S. Humanitarian Assessment and Security Team (HAST) was dispatched to Monrovia, consisting of experts in various fields and a security component. The U.S. dispatched a Humanitarian Assessment and Security Team (HAST) to Liberia, which was extended beyond its initial week-long assessment. Some observers saw the HAST as a temporary measure to show U.S. engagement with Liberia before President Bush's visit to Africa. Another U.S. military team was sent to assess the readiness of ECOWAS member states for a joint intervention force in Liberia, with a private contractor deployed as part of a monitoring body under a cease-fire accord. The U.S. deployed a contractor to assist with liaison functions for the monitoring body created under a cease-fire accord in Liberia. In July 2003, a U.S. Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) arrived off the Liberian coast, forming Joint Task Force Liberia to provide military support to ECOMIL. Personnel from the U.S. Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) in Liberia provided coordination support for PAE's delivery of goods and logistics services to ECOMIL. Three types of U.S. assistance were given to Liberia: long-term development aid (DA), emergency humanitarian assistance, and post-conflict-focused International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) aid. USAID's DA program aided NGOs in health care, agriculture, and peace-building activities during the Taylor presidency. In FY2004, most of USAID's programs in Liberia were funded under IDFA. In FY2004, USAID's programs in Liberia were mainly funded under IDFA. The assistance included $2.4 million in Child Survival and Health programs, $100,000 in Nonproliferation and Anti-terrorism funds, a $1.5 million Displaced Children and Orphans Fund program, and support for HIV/AIDS information projects. The Bush Administration's FY2005 request for Liberia aimed to complement and extend core IDFA program goals with integrated CSH programs. In FY2004, USAID's programs in Liberia were mainly funded under IDFA, including $2.4 million in Child Survival and Health programs. The Bush Administration's FY2005 request aimed to complement core IDFA goals with integrated CSH programs, improving access, quality, and demand for health services. Additionally, USAID's Community Revitalization and Reintegration program would resettle refugees and promote good governance, reconstruction, and economic development. State Department funds would be used to extend IDFA programs for the national police force and judicial institutions, as well as anti-corruption measures. Emergency humanitarian assistance from USAID's OFDA and FFP offices flowed to Liberia during the conflict. Total U.S. humanitarian assistance to Liberia in FY2004 totaled $72.96 million, supporting shelter, camp management, food assistance, health programs, and access to water for internally displaced persons and returning refugees. In addition to supporting UNMIL, USAID helped create the Humanitarian Information Center for Liberia, conducted evaluation missions, and prepared for emergency aid programs and post-conflict recovery assistance. The U.S. Liberia-related assistance funds various programs to support peace consolidation, predominantly funded by $200 million in IDFA funds. Key considerations include the capacity of local organizations to use external resources efficiently, ensuring sustainable results, and incorporating audit functions for monitoring by USAID. The IDFA aid for Liberia is divided into two phases, with the first phase worth $144 million and the second phase worth $86 million. The need for audit functions and monitoring by the USAID Inspector General is emphasized to ensure public accountability due to Liberia's history of corruption. Other aspects of U.S. policy towards Liberia include support from the U.S. Forest Service and international programs. President Bush waived \"Brooke Amendment\" requirements for U.S. assistance to Liberia in 2003, citing national interest. The U.S. has a bilateral \"Article 98 agreement\" with Liberia for military assistance and is assessing Liberia's progress to lift U.N. sanctions. The investigation into the 2004 murder of a Defense Department civilian in Monrovia has shown no recent progress. A civilian employee, part of a U.S. mission in Liberia, was fatally stabbed during a robbery in his hotel room. Suspects were identified, rewards offered, and some suspects charged with murder. The main suspect remains at large. Congressional attention on potential U.S. intervention in Liberia varied widely from June 2003 to September 2004. U.S. intervention in Liberia was a topic of varied opinions among Members of Congress. Some urged immediate action to resolve the conflict and provide humanitarian assistance, while others expressed caution or opposition to direct military intervention. Representative Ron Paul introduced a resolution against U.S. military involvement in the Liberian civil war. Congressional debate included calls for close consultation with Congress and transparency in policy decisions. The House Committee on International Relations Subcommittee on Africa held a hearing on U.S. Policy Toward Liberia in October 2003. Liberia was also discussed in hearings by various other committees in 2003. H.R. 4818 (Kolbe) Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2005, was passed by the House and Senate in September 2004. The Senate passed H.R. 4818 with provisions for Liberia, including $25 million in ESF assistance, $5 million for sexual and gender-based violence, and $30 million in Foreign Military Financing aid. The key source of U.S. assistance for Liberia is P.L. 108-106, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004 allocated funds for Liberia, including $200 million for peace and humanitarian intervention operations, $245 million for U.N. peacekeeping, and other Liberia-related bills passed into law during the 108th Congress. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, FY2004 (H.R. 2673) prohibits the use of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funds for Liberia and requires notification to the Committees on Appropriations for any funds appropriated for Liberia. It also includes measures that could restrict U.S. assistance to Nigeria due to Charles Taylor's presence in the country. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, FY2004 prohibits the use of FMF funds for Liberia and requires notification to the Committees on Appropriations for any funds appropriated for Liberia. The country can receive U.S. assistance if it cooperates with the SCSL, with the president able to waive stipulations in the interest of national security. Other Liberia-specific bills introduced in the 108th Congress address the humanitarian situation and peace efforts in Liberia. Several bills were introduced in the 108th Congress regarding Liberia, including H.Con.Res. 255, H.R. 1930, S. 656, and H.R. 3918, addressing issues such as military involvement, refugee immigration protection, and fairness. Several bills were introduced in the 108th Congress regarding Liberia, including H.R. 3918 (Jackson-Lee) and H.R. 4885 (Jackson-Lee) on comprehensive immigration fairness reform, and H.R. 4511 (Waters) and H.R. 4793 (Waters) on justice and understanding through IMF loan elimination and equity. Appropriations bills with Liberia-specific provisions include S. 1426 (McConnell) on foreign operations and export financing. Liberia-specific provisions in S. 1426 (McConnell) seek to prohibit Foreign Military Financing for Liberia and restrict assistance to governments involved in diamond mining in Liberia. H.R. 2673 also includes similar measures, limiting funds for countries not participating in the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds. H.R. 4818 (Kolbe) includes provisions for Liberia, with Senator Leahy offering an amendment for $25 million in assistance for Liberia during Senate consideration. In P.L. 108-106, Congress authorized significant funding for Liberia, including $5 million for addressing sexual and gender-based violence and at least $30 million in Foreign Military Financing aid. Congressional engagement with Liberia may focus on oversight of these funds, with key issues including peace consolidation, Charles Taylor's war crimes trial, UN Mission operations, governance rebuilding, and US assistance. Peace consolidation and reconstruction efforts, such as disarmament and reintegration, are crucial areas of concern. The curr_chunk discusses the demobilization, reintegration, and resettlement process in Liberia, the functioning of the transitional government, nation-wide governmental authority re-establishment, socio-economic rebuilding, security sector reform, and the trial of Charles Taylor. It also mentions the importance of the operational efficiency of UNMIL and cooperation with other U.N. missions in the region. Progress towards democratization and the rule of law in Liberia includes the protection of human rights, promotion of civic freedoms, and implementation of institutional reforms for transparency and accountability in government operations. Monitoring and evaluating U.S. assistance focuses on the sequencing of emergency, transitional, and development aid, as well as the delivery model employed. The assistance delivery model in Liberia includes direct use of U.S. government staff and resources or contractors/grantees. U.S. assistance for Liberia declined after the 1989-1997 war, with aid focused on health, food security, and civil society in rural communities. The decreasing assistance to Liberia was due to concerns about its negative role in regional security, supporting conflict in neighboring countries. U.S. emergency aid to Liberia increased during the second civil war as humanitarian conditions worsened. During the second civil war in Liberia, humanitarian conditions deteriorated, leading to increased U.S. emergency aid. The assistance to Liberia decreased due to concerns about its negative impact on regional security and support for conflict in neighboring countries. The U.S. provided assistance to Liberia during the civil war, with allocations for various programs like Child Survival and Health, Development Assistance, Economic Support, Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, and Food for Peace. Some funds may support multilateral programs for Liberia. The U.S. provided assistance to Liberia during the civil war, with allocations for various programs.
