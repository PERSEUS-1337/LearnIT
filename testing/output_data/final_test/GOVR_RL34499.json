    "content": "Children and adolescents can enter state child welfare systems due to abuse, neglect, or other reasons like parental death or behavioral issues. They may receive family support services or be placed in foster care, with some staying in care beyond age 18, up to age 21 in states that extend foster care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services collects data on children in foster care, with approximately 122,000 youth ages 13 and older in care as of FY2017. Approximately 122,000 youth ages 13 through 20 were in foster care on the last day of FY2017, comprising 27% of the national caseload. Most of these youth were reunified with family, adopted, or placed with relatives, but 19,945 aged out that year. Youth in foster care face challenges transitioning to adulthood, lacking support networks and independent living skills. Older foster youth returning to family may still encounter obstacles like poor dynamics or lack of support. The Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study and the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth have tracked outcomes for youth who spent time in foster care during their teenage years, showing difficulties as they entered adulthood and beyond. The Midwest Evaluation study found that young adults who had been in foster care were more likely to face mental health and financial challenges, less likely to obtain a bachelor's degree, and had poorer outcomes in education and employment compared to their peers. Despite these challenges, many former foster youth have overcome obstacles and achieved their goals. The Northwest study showed that youth in foster care achieved high school diplomas or GEDs at rates similar to their peers. States report on foster youth through the National Youth in Transition Database, with positive outcomes by age 21 but challenges like homelessness and substance abuse referrals. Less than a quarter of foster youth who received transition services in FY2015 got support for employment, education, or housing. The Children's Bureau administers programs for foster youth under Title IV-E, including the federal foster care program and the Chafee program. States can seek reimbursement for youth in care up to age 18 or 21. The Title IV-E entitlement funding for foster care is authorized on a permanent basis with protections in place for older youth. The Chafee program provides funding for services and supports to help foster youth transition to adulthood, available up to age 21. The Chafee program provides discretionary funding for Chafee-eligible youth to attend higher education until age 26, with no year limit. The ETV program is also funded through discretionary appropriations with no year limit. States must have a federally approved Title IV-E plan to receive funding for older youth in foster care. Other federal programs provide support for transitioning youth in foster care, including workforce support, housing, and Medicaid coverage for those aging out. States must provide Medicaid coverage to youth aging out of foster care until age 26, with federal support available for higher education. State child welfare agencies act as parents for children in foster care, making decisions for their safety and well-being. Federal funds under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act shape state child welfare systems. Title IV-E requires states to follow specific case planning and management practices for children in foster care. The federal foster care program reimburses states for providing care to eligible children removed due to abuse or neglect. States may seek federal reimbursement for various expenses related to foster care. Federal reimbursement under Title IV-E is available for eligible children in foster care, covering expenses such as supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, liability insurance, and travel costs. Eligibility criteria include the child's age and placement setting, with states also able to seek reimbursement for administration, case planning, training, and data collection. Starting in FY2020, states can seek federal support for in-home parent skills-based programs and substance abuse and mental health services for up to 12 months. As of FY2020, states can receive federal funding for up to 12 months of in-home parent skills-based programs and substance abuse and mental health treatment services for children at risk of entering foster care. States can also seek reimbursement for providing foster care to eligible youth until age 19, 20, or 21 if they meet certain criteria. HHS guidance allows states to extend foster care for youth aged 18 and older based on specific eligibility criteria, such as participation in post-secondary education. Youth can remain in care even if married or enlisted in the military. HHS approved Title IV-E state plans for 28 states, DC, and nine tribal nations to extend foster care until age 21. A survey by Child Trends found that eligible youth often leave care earlier than the maximum age. Youth can leave and return before reaching the maximum age of eligibility in their state. State and tribal child welfare agencies can extend foster care until age 21, allowing youth to leave and return before reaching the maximum age of eligibility. When young people turn 18 or re-enter foster care between 18 and 21, the original child abuse and neglect case can be closed and reopened as a \"voluntary placement agreement.\" Federal reimbursement for foster care costs is available for children placed in foster family homes or child care institutions. As of FY2020, Title IV-E will define a \"foster family home\" as the residence of a licensed foster parent providing care for up to six children in foster care. Child care institutions can accommodate up to 25 children and may include settings for independent living for foster youth over 18. These institutions must meet standards set by the HHS Secretary. In FY2020, Title IV-E defines a \"foster family home\" as a residence for up to six foster children, while child care institutions can house up to 25 children and provide independent living settings for foster youth over 18. HHS instructions state that states have discretion in developing supervised independent living settings for youth, which can include licensed foster homes, group homes, college dorms, shared housing, or apartments. Federal child welfare provisions require state agencies to provide case management services to children in foster care, including monthly worker visits, written case plans, and regular case reviews for permanency considerations. Approved housing options for foster youth include licensed foster homes, group homes, college dorms, shared housing, and apartments. The annual hearing conducted by a judge or administrative body reviews the child's permanency plan, including options for return to parents, adoption, legal guardianship, or another permanent living arrangement. The court must consult with the child on the proposed plan. The John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood provides services to older youth in foster care and those transitioning out of care. It includes information on program eligibility, youth participation, administration, funding, data collection, and training. The program was established under the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, replacing the prior Independent Living Program. The 1999 law established the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence program, doubling annual funds for independent living services. It has been amended five times to add programs for higher education, expand eligibility, inform foster youth about health care decisions, increase funding, and change data collection requirements. The Chafee program, established by the 1999 law and amended multiple times, aims to support youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older in their transition to adulthood through various services such as education, career exploration, job placement, life skills training, substance abuse prevention, and health activities. It also helps them establish meaningful connections with caring adults and engage in age-appropriate activities. The Chafee program supports youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older by providing a range of services to help them transition to adulthood. This includes financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other support services for former foster care youth between 18 and 21 years old. Additionally, education and training vouchers are available for those who have aged out of foster care, and Chafee-funded services are provided to youth who have left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption after turning 16. The Chafee program provides support for youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older, offering services to help them transition to adulthood. States can use Chafee funding for various purposes, including providing room and board for youth ages 18 to 21. Room and board typically include food, shelter, rental deposits, rent payments, utilities, and household startup purchases. Chafee funds cannot be used to acquire property for housing current or former foster youth. The Chafee program provides financial support for eligible youth transitioning from foster care, offering up to $5,000 annually for the cost of attendance at higher education institutions. Youth can receive support for five years until age 26, regardless of attendance continuity, and must show satisfactory progress. Funding received does not affect the student's expected family contribution. The Chafee ETV program provides financial assistance to eligible youth transitioning from foster care for higher education costs. The state child welfare agency ensures no duplication of benefits with other federal programs and coordinates with education and training programs. ETV funds cannot be used for educational loans incurred before the current fiscal year. States must submit a five-year plan to HHS to be eligible for Chafee and ETV funds. The Chafee program requires states to submit a plan outlining how they will implement their Chafee-funded program, including the ETV program, for youth in foster care aged 14-21. Amendments to the plan can be made with notification to HHS within 30 days. The Chafee program provides services for youth in foster care aged 14-21 who left foster care for reasons other than aging out, kinship guardianship, or adoption. Eligibility is determined by objective criteria, and former foster youth remain eligible for services until age 21 (or 23 in some cases). The state where the youth resides is responsible for providing independent living services. The Chafee program provides independent living services for youth in foster care aged 14-21 who did not age out, have kinship guardianship, or adoption. Approximately 111,700 youth received independent living services in FY2017. States also provided ETV vouchers to thousands of youth in various program years. The program requires states to consult with federally recognized Indian tribes and coordinate programs with them. The Chafee program requires states to provide services equitably to Indian children in state and tribal custody. Youth in the program participate in designing activities for independent living and accept personal responsibility. This approach views youth as assets and promotes their engagement in decision-making. States have different approaches to involving young people in service decisions. States have various approaches to involving young people in decisions about the services they receive, including formal youth advisory boards and youth-serving organizations like Foster Club. Some states use life skills assessments and personal responsibility contracts to assist youth in transitioning to adulthood. Chafee-funded programs are administered in different ways, with some overseen by state programs for older and former foster youth. The independent living programs in different states are administered in various ways, such as oversight by state coordinators, county administration with statewide support, or contracted service providers. Private organizations may also partner with jurisdictions to fund and administer aspects of these programs. For example, the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative provides funding and training to youth exiting care. States are responsible for providing vouchers to youth in foster care for their placement and ongoing support. The Extended Foster Care (ETV) program provides vouchers to youth in foster care for higher education. States administer the program through various entities, including state programs, financial aid offices, or nonprofit service providers. ETV funds cover the vouchers and program administration costs. States may use ETV dollars for vouchers and program administration costs, including salaries, expenses, and staff training. Title IV-E funds cannot be used for ETV program administration. States can supplement ETV funds with state or other sources, or expand existing postsecondary funding programs. Chafee and ETV funds are distributed based on each state's proportion of children in foster care, with a 20% match required to receive full federal allotment. Some states have scholarship programs and grants for foster youth funded through other sources. States can use Chafee and ETV funds to supplement other available funds for authorized activities. Territories with approved Title IV-E plans, like Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, can also apply for Chafee funding. Tribal entities receiving Title IV-E funds can apply for direct federal allotment of Chafee and/or ETV funds. Successful tribal applicants receive funds from the state's allotment. Successful tribal applicants receive Chafee and ETV funds based on the share of children in foster care under tribal custody. Four tribes receive these funds: Prairie Band of Potawatomi, Santee Sioux Nation, Confederated Tribe of Warm Springs, and Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe. States must negotiate with tribal entities for administering Chafee and ETV programs for eligible Indian children. Appendix B provides allotments for states, tribes, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. B provides Chafee and ETV allotments for states, tribes, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands in FY2018 and FY2019. Chafee funds can be combined with other funding sources. States and tribes have two years to spend their funds, with any remaining funds redistributed by HHS. HHS can reallocate unspent funds to states and tribes that apply for them. HHS will redistribute any unused funds among states and tribes that apply, based on the share of children in foster care. Unspent funds can be accessed in the second fiscal year after the initial award. Training grants for Chafee and ETV programs were competitively awarded every five years. The Child Welfare Capacity Building Collaborative, operated by HHS since FY2015, provides training and technical assistance on child welfare issues. The Chafee program requires consultation with various stakeholders to develop outcome measures for independent living programs. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was created by HHS in response to requirements to track data on children receiving services and state performance. States report data on youth receiving independent living services, regardless of their foster care status or service provider. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks outcomes of foster youth at key ages. States must comply with data collection procedures or face penalties of 1% to 5% of their Chafee fund allotment. HHS evaluates state data files against compliance standards and must report new information to Congress. HHS conducts evaluations of state programs funded by the Chafee program deemed innovative or of national significance, reserving 1.5% of funding annually for evaluations. An evaluation of independent living programs was conducted from 2007 to 2012, with ongoing research to identify new evaluation methods. The Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs assessed the effects of Chafee-funded programs on key outcomes related to the transition to adulthood. The evaluation team identified state and local programs in California and Massachusetts for rigorous evaluation through random assignment to treatment and control groups. The programs included employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring. While programs in Los Angeles and Kern County showed no significant impacts, the Outreach program in Massachusetts had positive effects on education outcomes for youth preparing for independent living. The Outreach program in Massachusetts had positive effects on education outcomes for youth preparing for independent living, including increased college enrollment and staying enrolled. Outreach youth also received more help in areas such as educational assistance, employment assistance, money management, and financial assistance for housing. Additional research on the Chafee program is being conducted by the Urban Institute and Chapin Hall. The research team at Chapin Hall is conducting additional research on the Chafee program to better understand promising approaches for older youth in care transitioning into adulthood. They have identified a conceptual framework considering individual characteristics and experiences that influence successful transitions. Various types of programs for foster youth are being classified for evaluation, with published briefs discussing outcomes in education, employment, and financial literacy. Few programs have significant impacts in these areas for foster youth. The briefs address issues in designing and evaluating programs for youth in care, including funding for the Chafee and ETV programs, as well as other federal support for older foster youth such as Medicaid pathways, educational, workforce, and housing supports. Medicaid provides mandatory and optional pathways for youth who have aged out of foster care. Former foster youth are eligible for Medicaid under a mandatory pathway created in the Affordable Care Act if they were in foster care upon reaching age 18, were enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care, and are not eligible for other mandatory Medicaid coverage groups. Income and assets are not considered for eligibility, but foster youth with higher incomes may share in healthcare costs. The final rule specifies that former foster youth are eligible for Medicaid regardless of Title IV-E foster care payments. States cannot provide Medicaid to those who left foster care before age 18 through this pathway. States may not provide Medicaid to former foster youth who move from another state, but can apply for a waiver. The Medicaid statute was amended to allow states to use state plan authority to provide coverage to former foster youth starting in January 2023. The final rule allows states to use state plan authority to provide Medicaid coverage to former foster youth who move across state lines starting in January 2023. HHS will issue guidance to states on best practices for ensuring timely coverage and conducting outreach. The pathway for former foster youth supersedes an optional Medicaid eligibility pathway created in 1999. The \"Chafee option\" under the program allows Medicaid eligibility for independent foster care adolescents under 21 who were in foster care at 18. States can restrict eligibility based on income, resources, and Title IV-E funding. Over half of states have extended this option, with some setting income limits and allowing eligibility for youth in foster care in another state. In some states, youth are not directly involved in the enrollment process. The Chafee option allows Medicaid eligibility for independent foster care adolescents under 21 who were in foster care at 18. Most states require an annual review for eligibility verification. Federal funding and support programs aim to help foster youth aspire to, pay for, and graduate from college. Federal Financial Aid is available for students with an expected family contribution towards their education costs. Independent student status can be granted to individuals under 24 who were in foster care or wards of the court at age 13 or older. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) may require additional documentation for current and former foster youth. The Department of Education modified the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they were in foster care. Youth in foster care are eligible for federal TRIO programs designed to support disadvantaged postsecondary students. The TRIO programs aim to support disadvantaged postsecondary students by providing services like mentoring, tutoring, and temporary housing. Congress allocated $1.1 billion to TRIO programs in FY2019. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) received $6 million in FY2018 and $5 million in FY2019 for demonstration projects supporting students who were in foster care or homeless at age 13 or older. FIPSE aims to implement innovative educational reform ideas and provide housing to youth when needed. The Youth Activities and Job Corps programs under the Department of Labor provide job training and services to low-income vulnerable populations, including foster youth. Job Corps offers educational and vocational training to help students learn a trade and secure employment. Foster youth aged 14 to 24 are eligible for these programs. In FY2018, Congress allocated $903 million to Youth Activities and $1.7 billion to Job Corps. Additionally, current and former foster youth may qualify for housing subsidies through the Family Unification Vouchers Program. The Family Unification Vouchers program (FUP vouchers) provides housing subsidies for current and former foster youth aged 18 to 24 who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Amendments in 2000 and the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act extended eligibility for the vouchers. The Family Unification Vouchers program (FUP vouchers) has extended eligibility from 21 to 24 for youth who emancipated from foster care. Assistance under the program has been extended from 18 to 36 months, with voucher assistance starting 90 days before youth age out. HUD is required to issue guidance to improve coordination between public housing agencies and child welfare agencies, but as of now, no guidance has been issued. HUD is studying how youth and families are served by FUP until funding for this work can be secured. HUD and HHS staff are studying how youth and families are served by the Family Unification Vouchers program (FUP). Approximately 39,000 FUP vouchers were distributed from 1992 to 2001, each with five years of funding. After the five-year use restrictions expired, some public housing authorities (PHAs) continued to use original FUP vouchers for eligible families. Congress allocated funds for new FUP vouchers in various fiscal years. Congress allocated funds for new Family Unification Vouchers (FUP) in various fiscal years, including $15 million in FY2010, $10 million in FY2017, and $20 million in FY2018 and FY2019. A 2014 report on the FUP program examined the use of FUP vouchers for foster youth, showing that nearly half of PHAs operating FUP had awarded vouchers to former foster youth. Youth were able to obtain leases within the allotted time, with 14% of total FUP program participants qualifying due to their foster care status. Program participants qualified due to their foster care status, with less than half of PHAs serving youth and allocating less than one-third of vouchers to them. Older foster youth may also be eligible for housing services through the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, which includes the Basic Center program, Transitional Living program, and Street Outreach program. Additionally, youth transitioning out of foster care may qualify for select transitional living programs administered by HUD. The Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 allows owners of LIHTC properties to claim units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. The law does not specify the length of time students must have spent in foster care or require that they are emancipated."
