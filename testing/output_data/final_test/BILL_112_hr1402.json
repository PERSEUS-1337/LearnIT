    "content": "The Act defines \"covered employee\" as those whose pay is disbursed by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives or individuals authorized to park in House parking areas. Funds from the Capitol Power Plant can be used to construct battery recharging stations in House parking areas on Capitol Grounds. The Architect of the Capitol may construct battery recharging stations for privately owned vehicles used by Members of the House of Representatives or covered employees. Vendors may be used on a commission basis, and approval from the Committee on House Administration is required. Fees and charges are subject to approval. The Architect of the Capitol can charge fees for electricity at battery recharging stations for Members and employees, with approval from the Committee on House Administration. Fees collected will be deposited for use as needed. Fees collected for electricity at battery recharging stations by the Architect of the Capitol are deposited into the Treasury account for appropriations. The funds can be used without further appropriation in the fiscal year collected and the following fiscal year. The Architect must submit a financial report annually to the Committee on House Administration, and every 3 years must report on cost recovery to avoid subsidies. The Architect of the Capitol must report to the Committee on House Administration to determine if Members and employees using battery charging stations are receiving a taxpayer subsidy. If a subsidy is found, a plan must be submitted to update the program. If no action is taken within 60 days, rates or fees may be increased to ensure program costs are reimbursed. The Act requires reimbursement for program costs from users of charging stations, effective from fiscal year 2011 onwards. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
