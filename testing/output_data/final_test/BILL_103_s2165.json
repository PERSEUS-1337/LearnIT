    "content": "The \"Fairness for Adopting Families Act\" allows for a deduction for adoption expenses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Fairness for Adopting Families Act\" allows individuals to deduct qualified adoption expenses paid during the taxable year, with limitations on the deduction amount based on the type of adoption and the taxpayer's income. The taxpayer can deduct adoption expenses based on their taxable income exceeding $60,000, limited to $10,000. No double benefit is allowed for expenses covered by other tax provisions, grants, or employer programs. The taxpayer can deduct qualified adoption expenses, including fees and court costs, under section 137(a). Qualified adoption expenses are those directly related to the legal adoption of a child and arranged through specific agencies or private placements. Qualified adoption expenses do not include costs related to adopting a spouse's child or travel outside the US, unless required for legal adoption, assessing the child's health, or escorting the child to the US. The term 'child' in adoption refers to an individual under 18 years old. A clerical amendment was made to the table of sections for part VII. The text discusses adoption expenses, deductions allowed in computing adjusted gross income, and adoption assistance programs under the Internal Revenue Code.

The exclusion amount is capped at $5,000 per child, or $7,000 for international adoptions. The paragraph discusses the calculation of taxable income exceeding $60,000 in relation to adoption assistance programs provided by employers. It defines qualified adoption expenses and references section 220(c) for further clarification. In part III, the item related to section 137 is replaced with new information. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.
