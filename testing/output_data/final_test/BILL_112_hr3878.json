The Chemawa Indian School Trust Transfer and Self-Determination Act of 2012 recognizes the historical significance of the Chemawa Indian School, the oldest off-reservation boarding school for Indian children in the United States. The school's land was purchased by students and staff in 1885, but it was deeded to the Federal Government and has never been converted to trust status. The Chemawa Indian School property, managed by the General Services Administration, has seen one-third sold or transferred by the Federal Government without input from Oregon tribes. Decisions regarding the school's operation should be under the control of the Oregon tribes. Resolutions supporting the transfer of Chemawa Indian School into trust status for Oregon tribes have been passed by various federally recognized Indian tribes and organizations. Resolutions have been passed supporting the transfer of Chemawa Indian School and Chemawa Cemetery land into trust for the benefit of Oregon tribes. The Administrator of the General Services Administration transfers administrative jurisdiction over specified land to the Secretary, who will hold it in trust for the benefit of Oregon tribes. The land to be held in trust for Oregon tribes includes the land and improvements of the Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon, excluding certain sections. The removal of encumbrances mentioned in paragraph (2) can still occur in the future. The Secretary will conduct a survey of trust land in a specific township, provide a public comment period for any adjustments, and make the completed survey available to the Board of Trustees.
