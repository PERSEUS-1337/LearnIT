Programs focus on rural housing, infrastructure, and business. Congress reauthorizes and amends these programs in periodic farm bills. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions for rural development, focusing on housing, infrastructure, economic development, and business creation. Rural areas with economies reliant on agriculture may benefit from programs authorized in the bill. Issues such as decreasing populations and limited employment opportunities in rural communities influenced the development of these provisions. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions for rural development, focusing on housing, infrastructure, economic development, and business creation. It addresses challenges such as the opioid crisis, rural hospital closures, aging infrastructure, and the digital divide in rural areas. Policymakers are exploring regional approaches to rural economic development. The bill also includes new programs for rural broadband deployment, health care, and community development. The 2018 farm bill amends existing rural development programs, including broadband deployment and community development. It also repeals some programs, makes technical corrections, and introduces new rural development entities. The bill addresses challenges such as the opioid crisis, rural hospital closures, aging infrastructure, and the digital divide in rural areas. The 2018 farm bill aligns the rural development provision with prior law, designating USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development. The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 established RD within USDA, consisting of three agencies: the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the Rural Housing Service, and the Rural Utilities Service. RD programs offer loan and grant assistance for rural infrastructure and economic development projects, with funding from annual appropriations and mandatory allocations in omnibus farm bills like the 2018 legislation. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes and amends rural development programs under USDA, as well as authorizes new programs. It also extends to entities like the FCC and regional commissions. Key rural policy issues influencing the bill include population decline, underemployment, health crises, aging infrastructure, and lack of broadband access. Population decline in rural areas is attributed to out-migration, declining birth rates, and increased mortality. Factors contributing to rural out-migration include lack of employment opportunities, limited access to education and healthcare, and cultural amenities. Between 2010 and 2017, nonmetropolitan counties saw a decline of approximately 223,000 people, with over 1,300 counties experiencing population loss. While some rural areas dependent on agriculture and manufacturing saw declines, others dependent on recreation experienced population growth. This trend has led to closures in rural areas and highlighted the need for improved infrastructure and broadband internet access. Scholars and policymakers are increasingly supporting regional approaches to rural economic development. In the 2018 farm bill, Congress aimed to address rural population decline by focusing on rural infrastructure, business development, and community development. The link between agriculture and rural policy has weakened as rural employment has shifted away from agriculture. Manufacturing has also been a significant source of employment in rural areas, but its share of jobs has declined. Congress sought to address rural employment issues in the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill aimed to address rural employment, entrepreneurship, broadband deployment, and access to credit. Rural health issues, including the opioid epidemic, influenced the bill's provisions. Drug overdose death rates in rural areas increased faster than in urban areas between 1990 and 2015. Scholars suggest different strategies for addressing the opioid crisis in rural areas. Concerns about access to healthcare in rural areas have grown due to the rise in rural hospital closures. The closure of rural hospitals has raised concerns about healthcare access in rural areas. Between 2013 and 2017, 64 rural hospitals closed, more than double the previous five-year period. This will force rural residents to travel further for emergency care. The 2018 farm bill included provisions for refinancing rural hospital debt, funding for opioid abuse prevention, and addressing aging infrastructure challenges in rural communities. Aging and obsolete drinking water and wastewater infrastructure pose significant financing challenges for many rural areas. The 2018 farm bill addresses challenges in rural infrastructure, including financing for major construction and upgrades. It includes provisions for rural housing, electricity, and water infrastructure, as well as broadband internet access. Data shows that a significant percentage of Americans in rural and tribal areas lack broadband access, highlighting the importance of improving connectivity for economic and community development. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions for broadband deployment in rural areas, supporting a regional approach to economic development. It emphasizes coordination across communities and prioritizing projects that align with strategic community development plans. The 2018 farm bill outlines new rural development provisions, reauthorizes existing programs, and authorizes funding for programs. Congress controls discretionary funding levels through annual appropriations, while mandatory funding is based on statutory requirements. Section 6101 allocates funds for telemedicine projects for substance use disorder treatment and prioritizes funding for Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants and Rural Health programs. The USDA will prioritize funding for projects related to substance use disorder treatment, education, and prevention, as well as rural health and safety education grants. Additionally, a new rural broadband deployment program will be established to fund middle mile infrastructure, with $10 million per year allocated for loans and grants from FY2019-FY2023. This program aims to connect local networks to the larger internet backbone. The new language authorizes USDA to obligate loan or grant funds before completing environmental reviews for rural broadband programs. Section 6212 establishes federal broadband program coordination procedures, directing NTIA to assist USDA with applicant eligibility verification and coordinating with FCC to prevent duplication. Section 6214 of the farm bill establishes a Broadband Integration Working Group to survey federal assistance for broadband deployment and make recommendations to address regulatory barriers. The working group includes various federal agencies and is co-chaired by key officials. Section 12511 directs the FCC to establish a task force on precision agriculture. The task force on precision agriculture is established to identify gaps in broadband internet access on agricultural land and make policy recommendations. USDA is authorized to provide grants for technical assistance and training to support Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs. Additionally, USDA is directed to provide technical assistance to tribal entities to improve their access to RD programs. Section 12510 of the 2018 farm bill directs USDA to establish Tribal Promise Zones to address challenges faced by tribal governments, businesses, and housing entities. These zones will receive priority consideration for federal grant programs based on criteria such as unemployment rates and household income. The Secretary of Agriculture is also directed to re-designate any previously designated Tribal Promise Zones. Additionally, Section 6424 establishes a Rural Innovation Stronger Economy Grant Program to create job accelerators in rural areas. A new Rural Innovation Stronger Economy Grant Program is established to create job accelerators in rural regions, with grant awards ranging from $500,000 to $2 million. Applicants must provide 20% of project funds and can use the funds for various purposes like connecting rural communities to markets and repatriating high-wage jobs. The program authorizes annual appropriations of $10 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. Additionally, a Council on Rural Community Innovation and Economic Development is created to coordinate federal engagement with rural stakeholders and streamline federal investments in rural areas. The USDA is authorized to use loans or loan guarantees to refinance rural hospital debt to preserve access to health services in rural communities.
