    "content": "International Social Security agreements are bilateral agreements aimed at eliminating dual Social Security taxation and providing benefit protection for workers who work in both the United States and a foreign country. These agreements reduce the cost of doing business abroad, impact the competitiveness and profitability of U.S. companies with foreign operations, and promote investment in the United States by foreign companies. They also affect certain provisions of the Social Security Act, such as the alien nonpayment provision. Since 1977, the President has had the authority to negotiate these agreements with foreign countries. Social Security agreements with foreign countries aim to eliminate dual Social Security taxation. Currently, there are 24 agreements in force, with one pending with Mexico. These agreements impact selected provisions of the Social Security Act and address concerns raised by policymakers. In the United States, Social Security-covered workers and their employers pay 6.2% of earnings up to $106,800 in Social Security payroll taxes. Self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income up to the same limit. Most jobs in the U.S. are covered by Social Security, with 94% of workers estimated to be included. Workers not covered include certain government employees, election workers earning less than $1,500, non-covered ministers, and some federal government workers hired before 1984. The Social Security Act extends coverage to various groups, including elected officials, college students, household workers, self-employed individuals with low earnings, foreign students and agricultural workers. Additionally, U.S. citizens and residents employed abroad by U.S. companies are also covered. When a U.S. worker is employed in a foreign country, they may be required to contribute to both the U.S. Social Security system and the foreign country's system. U.S. citizens working for a foreign affiliate of a U.S. company may face dual taxation if the company has an agreement with the IRS for Social Security coverage. In some cases, the employer may pay both the employee's and employer's shares of the foreign country's Social Security tax, which could be considered taxable compensation to the employee. When a U.S. worker is employed in a foreign country, they may face dual taxation if the employer pays both the employee's and employer's shares of the foreign country's Social Security tax. This can increase the employee's income tax liability. International agreements aim to eliminate dual taxation by requiring contributions to only one Social Security system based on coverage provisions. The international agreements on Social Security coverage rules determine whether a person's work is covered under the sending country or the foreign country's system. The basic rule is the territoriality rule, where a worker is covered under the system of the country where the work is performed, with exceptions to ensure a direct connection to a specific system. The detached worker rule allows a person sent to work in a foreign country for five years or less to remain covered under the sending country's system. If the assignment is longer than five years, they would be covered under the foreign system. This rule ensures a direct connection to a specific system based on the duration of the assignment. The detached worker rule allows workers sent abroad to be covered under the Social Security system of their home country for assignments lasting five years or less. If the assignment exceeds five years, they would be covered under the foreign system. This rule minimizes disruptions in Social Security coverage and allows workers to avoid paying payroll taxes under two systems. When a worker is sent abroad by an employer to work in the United States, they would remain covered under the Italian Social Security system, regardless of the period of employment in the U.S. Different coverage rules apply to self-employed workers, depending on the country. For example, a Swiss citizen residing in the U.S. and self-employed is covered under the U.S. system and exempt from coverage under the Swiss system. Agreements with countries like Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan have specific rules for self-employment coverage. Under international Social Security agreements, workers can benefit from the territoriality rule if they work in one country and the residence rule if they work in both countries. The agreement with Germany follows the territoriality rule, allowing workers to combine work credits from the United States and a foreign country to qualify for benefits. Workers in the U.S. must have at least 6 quarters of coverage to combine work credits. This feature helps workers who do not meet the minimum coverage requirements. Under international Social Security agreements, workers can combine work credits from different countries to qualify for benefits. For example, a U.S. worker with coverage from both the U.S. and Canada can meet the minimum requirements for a U.S. Social Security retirement benefit. The benefit would be prorated based on the actual period of coverage under each system. Under international Social Security agreements, workers can combine work credits from different countries to qualify for benefits. For example, a U.S. worker with coverage from both the U.S. and Canada can meet the minimum requirements for a U.S. Social Security retirement benefit. The benefit would be prorated to reflect the worker's contributions to the U.S. system for only five years. Without an agreement between the United States and Canada, the worker would not qualify for a U.S. retirement benefit. Workers may also qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits based on work credits, disability definition, recent work test, and duration of work test. A worker's eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits is determined by their work history. The duration of work test requires a certain number of work credits, which vary based on the age at which the worker became disabled. For example, a worker disabled before age 24 needs 1\u00bd years of Social Security-covered employment, while a worker disabled at age 60 needs 9\u00bd years. Regardless, a minimum of 6 work credits is needed to qualify for SSDI benefits. International agreements allow workers to combine U.S. and foreign work credits to qualify for benefits under both systems, preventing contributions from being \"lost.\" These agreements also reduce dual Social Security taxation, promoting business competitiveness and investment in the United States. International Social Security agreements allow workers to combine U.S. and foreign work credits to qualify for benefits under both systems, reducing dual Social Security taxation and promoting business competitiveness and investment in the United States. The alien nonpayment provision places restrictions on the payment of U.S. Social Security benefits to noncitizens residing outside the country, with exceptions that can be waived for residents of countries with Social Security agreements with the U.S. These agreements are conducted through executive agreements rather than treaties. International Social Security agreements, including totalization agreements, are authorized by Congress and fall under congressional-executive agreements. These agreements allow workers to combine U.S. and foreign work credits for benefits under both systems. Congress has a role in reviewing these agreements, and the approval method for totalization agreements was discussed in a 1976 hearing. Congressional-executive agreements, such as Social Security agreements, require ex ante authorization by Congress and an ex post approval mechanism. Section 233 of the Social Security Act authorizes the President to enter into these agreements with foreign countries, with specific terms established by Congress. Approval or rejection of the agreements involves both houses of Congress, not just the Senate, with an effective period of 60 days specified in Section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act requires a 60-day period for congressional approval of agreements with foreign countries to prevent gaps in social security coverage. Initial efforts towards totalization agreements can be traced back to a 1948 treaty between the US and Italy, which became effective in 1961. The Supplementary Agreement between the United States and Italy in 1951 allowed for the negotiation of a totalization agreement. In 1973, a totalization agreement was signed by both countries, followed by Senate approval of legislation authorizing totalization agreements. In 1973, a Social Security bill passed by the House included a provision for totalization agreements with foreign countries. However, the final version of the bill did not include this provision as a conference to resolve differences was not held. The Senate provision for totalization agreements had some differences from current law, such as a longer period of congressional review. The Senate provision in 1976 did not specify Congress's required action to stop an agreement from taking effect. H.R. 14429 proposed only notifying Congress of international Social Security agreements after they entered into force, differing from the Senate's 1973 provision. The discussion during the hearing also considered an alternative \"report and wait\" provision. The Commissioner of Social Security proposed a \"report and wait\" provision for congressional review of Social Security agreements. Congress would have 60 days to advise the Administration on their position before the agreement becomes effective. Commissioner Cardwell stated that objections to agreements would need to come from Congress, not a subcommittee or committee. He offered to seek clarification on the Administration's position regarding the review process. The Commissioner of Social Security proposed a \"report and wait\" provision for congressional review of Social Security agreements. The Administration supported a provision where a totalization agreement would become effective after 60 days of continuous session of Congress following transmittal by the President. If Congress approved the agreement, no further action would be needed, but if they disapproved or wanted changes, a statute would be required. In 1977, the statutory authority for totalization agreements was established under the Social Security Amendments of 1977. This law allowed individuals to qualify for benefits from both the United States and a foreign country. The agreement could supplement the total benefit amount for U.S. residents to match what they would receive under the U.S. system. The 1977 law established statutory authority for totalization agreements, allowing individuals to qualify for benefits from both the United States and a foreign country. It provided for a longer period of congressional review and specified that agreements could not go into effect until after at least one House of Congress had been in session for 90 days. The 1977 law established statutory authority for totalization agreements, allowing individuals to qualify for benefits from both the United States and a foreign country. Agreements had to be transmitted to Congress with a report on cost and individuals affected, be consistent with the Social Security Act, and wait 90 days for congressional review before going into effect. In 1981, a provision allowing the United States to supplement a U.S. resident's total benefit amount under an agreement was struck. In 1983, the period for congressional review of Social Security agreements was shortened under the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) from 90 days to 60 days. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study in 2005 on countries with which the United States has agreements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in a 2005 study that the selection of countries for Social Security agreements with the United States lacks formal guidelines. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has used consistent criteria since 1978, including factors like the other country's Social Security system, costs, benefits to U.S. employers and workers, negotiation interest, administrative ability, and input from other U.S. government agencies. The 2005 GAO Report highlighted SSA's efforts to identify suitable partner countries for future agreements, with input from the Department of State and Commerce. SSA developed a matrix based on economic and administrative factors to assess countries' eligibility for agreements and potential impact on Social Security benefits. SSA has made progress in identifying potential partner countries for totalization agreements since 2005 by developing a standardized questionnaire to assess internal controls and information security policies. This includes requiring a successful review by SSA experts before entering formal negotiations. SSA has been working on identifying potential partner countries for totalization agreements since 2005, using a standardized questionnaire to assess internal controls and information security policies. The selection process follows specific criteria and is governed by the Circular 175 Procedure to ensure compliance with legal and foreign policy considerations. The U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual outlines the process for negotiating Social Security agreements with foreign countries, emphasizing the need for State Department authorization before negotiations can begin. SSA officials can negotiate but not finalize agreements, with reviews conducted by SSA's General Counsel and the State Department to ensure compliance with U.S. law and policy. The State Department reviews and signs Social Security agreements with foreign countries, ensuring compliance with U.S. policy. Implementation issues are addressed by SSA and the foreign agency, followed by reviews at the State Department and by the President before transmission to Congress for a 60-day review period. After signing a Social Security agreement with a foreign country, the President must transmit it to Congress for review before implementation. There is no set time limit for this process, with agreements typically being transmitted within a year of signing. For example, the agreement with Denmark was signed in June 2007 and sent to Congress in February 2008. Canada signed an additional protocol for Qu\u00e9bec in March 1981, transmitted to Congress in January 1984. The pending agreement with Mexico, signed in June 2004, has not been sent to Congress yet. Section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act states that an agreement goes into effect unless Congress adopts a resolution of disapproval within 60 session days. This provision is similar to the legislative veto ruled unconstitutional in INS v. Chadha. The Supreme Court invalidated the legislative veto provision, stating that Congress can only exercise its legislative authority through bicameral passage and presentation to the President. The Court's decision would impact other similar laws delegating authority to executive and independent agencies. The Supreme Court has disapproved of the legislative veto in statutes delegating authority to executive agencies. The Court's decision in Chadha invalidated the legislative veto provision, emphasizing the need for bicameral passage and presentation to the President. This ruling applies to the current context, where Section 233(e)(2) allows congressional invalidation of executive action outside of these requirements. Congress has never rejected a Social Security agreement, so the constitutionality of Section 233(e)(2) remains unchallenged. The potential constitutional issue with Section 233(e)(2) regarding congressional rejection of a Social Security agreement could lead to a judicial challenge. The court would assess if the rest of Section 233 is valid or if the entire statute must be invalidated. The Supreme Court's stance on severability allows for removal of invalid parts if the remaining law is still functional. The presence of a broad severability clause in the Social Security Act indicates Congress's intent for judicial interpretation of the law. The Social Security Act includes a severability clause to preserve the statute intact. The likelihood of invalidating the disapproval mechanism in Section 233(e)(2) is high, following the INS v. Chadha Supreme Court decision. Other acts replaced legislative veto provisions with joint resolutions for approval or disapproval. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 allows international fisheries agreements to enter into force after a 60-day waiting period unless Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval. The Social Security Administration is responsible for implementing international Social Security agreements through rules, regulations, and procedures. Administrative Arrangements accompany these agreements and outline guidelines for implementation, including cooperation between partner countries such as exchanging statistics on beneficiaries and benefits paid. International Social Security agreements allow for the exchange of information to adjudicate claims and can be amended as needed. Parties must communicate changes in their laws that could affect the agreement. Supplementary agreements may be signed to update and clarify provisions, as seen in the 2004 agreement between the United States and Sweden. The 2004 supplementary agreement between the United States and Sweden updated and clarified provisions of the original agreement to reflect changes in laws. Social Security agreements can be terminated by either country, with benefits retained for 12 months after termination. The United States has agreements with 24 countries and a pending agreement with Mexico. The agreement with Mexico, signed in 2004, is still under review at SSA as of January 2010. The terms of Social Security agreements must align with the Social Security Act. In December 2007, $28 million was paid in monthly benefits to 146,200 recipients under U.S. Social Security. $28 million in monthly benefits was paid to about 146,200 recipients under U.S. Social Security agreements. Individuals in the U.S. can apply for totalization benefits at SSA field offices, while those outside the U.S. can apply at a Foreign Service Post. Initial processing is done by SSA staff or Foreign Service Nationals, who review supporting documents. Application packages are then sent to SSA's Office of International Operations for final adjudication of claims. The Office of International Operations (OIO) reviews supporting documents and makes final decisions on U.S. totalization benefit claims filed at SSA field offices. OIO also determines disability for totalization disability benefits claims, with assistance from Disability Determination Services if needed. Each office involved in the process maintains specific responsibilities. The Office of International Operations (OIO) handles U.S. totalization benefit claims and liaises with foreign countries for coverage records. Foreign Service Posts (FSPs) assist with benefit claims outside the U.S. Workers meeting coverage requirements from both U.S. and foreign work credits can receive totalization benefits. The totalization benefit is prorated based on the worker's years covered by the U.S. system. The worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is calculated using the Social Security benefit formula applied to their Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). AIME is determined by dividing the worker's 35 highest years of earnings, adjusted for wage growth, by the computation period. If a worker has less than 35 years of earnings, zero years are included in the calculation, resulting in a lower benefit amount. The benefit formula for workers aged 62, disabled, or deceased in 2010 is: 90% of the first $761 of AIME, plus 32% of AIME over $761 through $4,586, plus 15% of AIME over $4,586. The U.S. totalization benefit is calculated based on the worker's coverage duration and earnings level. The computation process involves creating a theoretical full-career earnings record, calculating a theoretical PIA, determining a pro rata PIA, and establishing the monthly benefit amount. Adjustments may apply, such as a reduction for early retirement. Totalization benefits are calculated based on the worker's coverage duration and earnings level, prorated to reflect the worker's period of coverage under the U.S. system. These benefits are typically lower than regular benefits, with an average monthly benefit for retired workers under U.S. totalization agreements being $227.54 in December 2007. The average monthly benefit for retired workers under U.S. totalization agreements was $227.54 in December 2007. Workers can qualify for Social Security benefits under one or both countries' systems based on combined work credits. Totalization benefits are paid independently by each country, and a U.S. totalization benefit may be converted to a regular benefit if the beneficiary continues to work in Social Security-covered employment in the United States. The Social Security Administration monitors the eligibility of beneficiaries living in the United States. Social Security beneficiaries in the United States and abroad are monitored for eligibility through data matching and questionnaires. Foreign Enforcement Questionnaires are sent annually or biennially to beneficiaries living outside the U.S. to verify their eligibility. The Social Security Administration sends questionnaires to foreign beneficiaries annually or biennially to verify their eligibility for benefits. The completed questionnaire must be returned within 60 days to provide necessary information for verifying eligibility and benefit amount. The agency relies on self-reporting from foreign beneficiaries to ensure accuracy. The Social Security Administration relies on self-reporting from foreign beneficiaries to verify their eligibility for benefits, as they do not conduct independent verification. However, they are developing pilot computer match projects with Italy and Germany to establish a third-party mechanism for verification. Since 2005, SSA has initiated data matching projects under totalization agreements to support stewardship initiatives and automated death data exchanges with partner countries to prevent overpayment. The Social Security Administration has implemented death data exchanges with totalization partner countries to prevent overpayment of benefits. Savings from exchanges with Germany and Australia totaled $1,792,546 and $128,878.70 respectively. Plans are in place to expand exchanges to more countries and conduct automated exchanges with all totalization agreement partners. Additionally, validation surveys are conducted in foreign countries where beneficiaries reside. The Social Security Administration conducts validation surveys in foreign countries where beneficiaries reside to verify identity and eligibility. The surveys do not verify work activity or other information affecting benefit payments. The frequency of surveys varies by country, with some countries surveyed every five years and others every 30 years. Noncitizens in the United States must be lawfully present to receive Social Security benefits. Benefits may be suspended if this requirement is not met, but exceptions exist under the alien nonpayment provision. This provision allows noncitizens to receive benefits while residing outside the US if certain conditions are met. Noncitizens in the United States must be lawfully present to receive Social Security benefits. Benefits may be suspended if this requirement is not met, but exceptions exist under the alien nonpayment provision. Exceptions include citizens of countries with social insurance systems or totalization agreements with the US. Benefits for alien dependents and survivors outside the US require previous US residency of at least five years. Alien dependents and survivors are exempt from the U.S. residency requirement if they are citizens of a treaty obligation country or a country with a totalization agreement with the U.S. Complex rules and exceptions apply to the payment of benefits to noncitizens living outside the U.S., as outlined in Tables 4 through 6. Totalization agreements allow workers and their family members residing in foreign countries to receive benefits. Totalization agreements waive the U.S. residency requirement for workers and their family members residing in foreign countries, allowing them to receive benefits outside the United States indefinitely. This provision also applies to family members who are citizens or residents of the foreign country, exempting them from the five-year U.S. residency requirement. These benefits are not limited to those who qualify for U.S. Social Security based on work performed in the United States under a formal totalization agreement. Social Security benefits for noncitizens residing outside the United States, including dependents and survivors, may be exempt from payment restrictions. This exemption applies to noncitizen workers' dependents and survivors who have never resided in the United States. Additionally, citizens of third-party countries residing in certain countries are also exempt from these payment restrictions. The U.S. residency requirement for dependents and survivors may be exempt if they live in a country with a totalization agreement. Restrictions apply to benefit payments for individuals residing outside the U.S., with exceptions for certain eligible beneficiaries in countries with Social Security restrictions. Benefits are prohibited for individuals in Cuba, North Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, or former Soviet Union areas. Deported individuals are also ineligible for benefits. Initially, there were no restrictions on benefit payments to noncitizens, but in 1956, limitations were introduced. In 1956, restrictions were placed on benefit payments to noncitizens living abroad, requiring them to reside in the United States to receive benefits. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 extended these restrictions to alien dependents and survivors outside the U.S. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) extended payment restrictions to alien dependents and survivors living outside the United States. To receive benefits abroad, they must have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, with exceptions. Tighter restrictions were enacted due to fraudulent additions to benefit rolls and difficulties in monitoring eligibility of recipients abroad. In 1981, 56,000 dependents living abroad were added to benefit rolls after the worker became entitled to benefits, with 91% being noncitizens. Some recipients were found to be faking marriages, adoptions, and not reporting deaths to cheat the system, especially in Greece, Italy, Mexico, and the Philippines. Congress enacted tighter restrictions on Social Security benefits for aliens in 1996. Tighter restrictions on Social Security benefits for aliens residing in the United States were implemented in 1996 through the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. This act prohibited the payment of benefits to aliens who are not lawfully present, with exceptions for certain agreements and provisions. Additionally, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act added further restrictions, stating that no monthly benefits shall be payable to aliens not meeting specific criteria. Under the Social Security Act, aliens must be lawfully present in the United States to receive benefits. The windfall elimination provision reduces benefits for those with noncovered pensions and less than 30 years of Social Security coverage. However, the WEP does not apply to U.S. totalization benefits starting from January 1995. Foreign pensions under a totalization agreement with the U.S. do not trigger the WEP for regular U.S. benefits starting from January 1995. Social Security beneficiaries are subject to limitations on earnings until reaching full retirement age. There are two types of work tests: Retirement Earnings Test (RET) for work in the U.S. and Foreign Work Test for work outside the U.S. Under RET, benefits are withheld $1 for every $2 of earnings above $14,160 for those below full retirement age. For Social Security beneficiaries reaching the FRA in 2010, benefits are subject to withholding based on earnings. The Foreign Work Test applies to work outside the U.S., with benefits withheld if working more than 45 hours in a job not covered by U.S. Social Security taxes. Totalization agreements determine coverage for work done abroad by U.S. citizens and residents. Totalization agreements impact Social Security beneficiaries working abroad regarding Retirement Earnings Test or Foreign Work Test. Medicare eligibility is at age 65, or earlier for certain disabilities or End Stage Renal Disease. Disability beneficiaries qualify after 24 months of benefits. ESRD patients qualify with kidney failure. Totalization beneficiaries are not entitled to Medicare premium-free Hospital Insurance benefits under Section 233(c)(3) of the Social Security Act. A person entitled to U.S. totalization benefits may qualify for Medicare premium-free Hospital Insurance (HI) independently of an agreement. This includes scenarios where a totalization beneficiary may be entitled to Medicare premium-free HI if they receive regular benefits on a different Social Security Number (SSN) or if their regular benefit is lower than the totalization benefit. If not eligible for premium-free Medicare HI, the beneficiary can pay a monthly premium for coverage. Many agree that international Social Security agreements benefit U.S. companies and workers, but policymakers have concerns. These include SSA's procedures for assessing foreign data, verifying initial eligibility for benefits, monitoring beneficiaries outside the U.S., Congress's role in approving agreements, and the need for enhanced reporting and evaluation. In 2005, GAO raised concerns about the Social Security trust funds' potential exposure. In 2005, GAO reported concerns about the Social Security trust funds being exposed to improper payments due to inaccurate foreign data. SSA was criticized for limited reviews and focusing on broad policy issues rather than the integrity of earnings data. However, SSA was developing new initiatives to identify risks related to totalization agreements, including a standardized questionnaire to assess earnings data reliability in countries under consideration for agreements. SSA is considering countries for future totalization agreements and has initiated discussions with other U.S. government agencies to assess suitable countries. They are developing a matrix to compare factors for potential agreements and conducting vulnerability assessments to improve procedures. GAO cautioned in 2005 about potential risks associated with future agreements despite these initiatives. SSA has recently started implementing totalization agreements but lacks formal procedures to integrate these initiatives. The expected retirement of key staff may lead to the loss of institutional knowledge, hindering the agency's ability to assess risks. GAO raised concerns in 2005 about SSA's ability to determine initial eligibility for benefits and monitor beneficiaries under agreements. There are potential vulnerabilities in SSA's policies for verifying eligibility once an agreement is in force. SSA accepts critical documentation from foreign countries for initial eligibility without independent verification. Tools for determining continuing eligibility may be insufficient. SSA maintains that totalization agreements do not introduce new risks. Detailed procedures are used for evaluating foreign evidence. The GAO warned in 2005 about the need for thorough verification of individuals' eligibility for benefits under totalization agreements. SSA's current verification procedures may not be sufficient to prevent improper payments to foreign beneficiaries, leading to potential risks for the trust funds as the number of foreign beneficiaries, including totalized beneficiaries, is expected to increase. The GAO warned in 2005 about the need for improved verification procedures for totalized beneficiaries to prevent improper payments to foreign beneficiaries. SSA lacks authority to conduct computer matches with foreign countries, posing challenges for independent verification. Additional steps are needed to address these concerns raised by GAO. The 2005 GAO Report highlighted the need for improved verification procedures for totalized beneficiaries on Social Security. While recommendations had not been implemented, SSA was making progress by developing standardized questionnaires and exploring computer matches for data verification. Opportunities for further progress in program integrity were identified, with plans for enhancements to protect against errors, fraud, and abuse. The 2005 GAO Report emphasized the importance of improving verification procedures for totalized beneficiaries on Social Security to prevent errors, fraud, and abuse. SSA is working on developing standardized questionnaires and exploring computer matches for data verification. Challenges remain in identifying eligible noncitizens due to changes in immigration laws and enforcement shortcomings. Continued attention from SSA and Congress is crucial to ensure noncitizens receive entitled benefits and protect the integrity of the Social Security program. In 2006, an SSA official testified about foreign data in totalization agreements. These agreements allow SSA and the other country's agency to use each other's verification of certain eligibility factors, like date of birth. This helps avoid duplication of effort, but SSA remains the final judge of evidence accuracy. They can verify by obtaining original documents or contacting the claimant directly. SSA conducts validation surveys in selected countries to prevent document fraud, training staff to verify documents from primary and secondary sources. Standardized protocols have been developed for verifying foreign data in totalization agreements. In 2009, SSA updated key initiatives to the Congressional Research Service. SSA has initiated data exchanges with foreign countries to improve stewardship and reduce improper payments. They have successfully exchanged death data with Australia and plan to expand to other totalization partner countries. Automated exchanges are only possible with countries that have agreements with the United States. SSA aims to pilot two more automated death data exchanges by the end of 2009 and expand the project to all totalization agreement partner countries. GAO reported that SSA developed a questionnaire to assess earnings data reliability. SSA developed a standardized questionnaire to assess earnings data reliability in countries for potential totalization agreements. Totalization agreements have been established with Japan, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Foreign officials must meet SSA's data security requirements before formal negotiations can begin. SSA requires foreign nations to meet data security standards before negotiating totalization agreements. They are reviewing questionnaire responses to ensure reliability and integrity of earnings data. SSA is enhancing the EaE program to prevent errors, fraud, and abuse. SSA has expanded the EaE program to protect the integrity of the Social Security Number for all lawful permanent residents entering the country, regardless of age. The program collects and verifies information from federal agencies responsible for conferring immigrant status, improving the enumeration process. Some policymakers are concerned about Congress's role in approving international Social Security agreements. The current law does not allow Congress to amend the text of an agreement during the review process. Attempting to stop an agreement through the disapproval mechanism could lead to a judicial challenge and potential invalidation of the mechanism. The disapproval mechanism for international Social Security agreements may be invalidated, and the agreement deemed effective. Reporting requirements under the Social Security Act specify that the President must transmit the agreement to Congress with a report on its impact. Recommendations have been made to enhance reports on proposed agreements and reassess actuarial estimates. Proposed legislation aims to establish new reporting requirements and mandate periodic evaluation of agreements. In recent years, legislation has been introduced to change the congressional review process for international Social Security agreements. For example, S. 42 (STAR Act) in the 111th Congress would require approval from both Houses of Congress before an agreement could take effect. It would also establish new reporting requirements, including assessments of the other country's retirement data integrity and ability to monitor benefit recipients. The Commissioner of Social Security would also need to report to Congress. The Commissioner of Social Security would report to Congress and the Comptroller General every two years on the impact of a totalization agreement. Legislation like H.R. 132 in the 111th Congress aims to transfer Social Security contributions between the US and agreement countries instead of allowing individuals to establish entitlement based on work credits. The proposed measure aims to transfer Social Security contributions between the US and agreement countries for individuals entitled to benefits under each country's system based on work credits. If an individual meets certain criteria, funds would be transferred accordingly. Under an agreement country's Social Security system, payments would be made to the United States equal to contributions from the individual's covered employment. H.R. 132 would exclude earnings from non-U.S. citizens or permanent residents from Social Security benefit calculations. The Commissioner of Social Security would need to adjust benefits accordingly, affecting benefits after the bill's enactment. International Social Security agreements have benefits, including eliminating dual Social Security coverage. Social Security agreements offer advantages such as eliminating dual taxes, protecting benefits for workers with careers in multiple countries, and increasing benefit portability. Supporters believe these agreements can also promote international commerce and diplomatic relations. The SSA has improved its process for assessing the reliability of foreign data used in these agreements since 2005. The SSA has established procedures to review and ensure the reliability of foreign data used in social security agreements since 2005. Policymakers emphasize the importance of accurate data to protect the Social Security trust funds from improper payments and suggest changes to the congressional review process for totalization agreements. The current legislative proposals aim to enhance reporting requirements and ongoing evaluation of totalization agreements. The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is the base monthly benefit under Social Security, calculated based on the worker's average lifetime covered earnings. The worker's earnings are indexed to reflect wage growth for benefit computation. The 35 highest years of indexed earnings are averaged to determine the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The benefit formula is then applied based on the AIME, with specific percentages for different income ranges. Years of zero earnings are counted if the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings. The PIA calculation is based on a percentage of the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), with specific percentages for different income ranges. The worker's PIA is determined by adding 90% of the first $761 of AIME, 32% of AIME over $761 through $4,586, and 15% of AIME over $4,586. The PIA is adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases. If a worker becomes eligible for retired-worker benefits at age 62 in 2010 and chooses to receive benefits at the normal retirement age of 66 in 2014, their Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) would be calculated based on the benefit formula for 2010, adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases. The bend points in the benefit formula ($761 and $4,586) separate different income ranges, and are indexed to wage growth annually to maintain stable replacement rates over time. For example, the projected replacement rate for a scaled low earner retiring at age 67 in 2030 or later is 55%. The Social Security benefit formula factors are fixed under current law and provide different replacement rates for low, medium, and maximum earners. The formula is structured to replace a higher share of pre-retirement earnings for lower-wage workers. The list of countries subject to change is available in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations and the Social Security Administration's Program Operations Manual System. Under the alien nonpayment provision, noncitizens' benefits are suspended if they stay outside the US for more than 6 consecutive months, unless exceptions apply. One exception is for citizens of countries with social insurance or pension systems that pay benefits to eligible US citizens residing outside that country. Countries meeting this exception include Albania, Argentina, Austria, Canada, Chile, France, and others. Countries with treaty obligations for receiving benefits outside the United States include Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, and others. Alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the US for at least five years and have a family relationship with the worker. Alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the US for at least five years, with a family relationship to the worker during that time. Exceptions to the residency requirement include being a citizen of a treaty obligation country like Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. Treaty obligations prevent nonpayment of benefits to citizens of these countries. The alien nonpayment provision applies to citizens of treaty obligation countries for monthly survivor benefits only."
