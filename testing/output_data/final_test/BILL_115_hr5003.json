Section 149(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include provisions for certain private activity bonds and other bonds in an issue. The `refunding bond' is issued to advance refund a bond under specific conditions, including limitations on the number of advance refundings allowed and redemption requirements for refunded bonds issued before 1986. The `refunding bond' is issued to advance refund a bond under specific conditions, including limitations on the number of advance refundings allowed and redemption requirements for refunded bonds issued after 1985. The refunding bond must adhere to restrictions on the amount of proceeds from the refunded bond that can be invested in higher yielding nonpurpose investments. The issuer must redeem the refunded bond if present value debt service savings can be realized in connection with the issue, subject to specific restrictions on the amount of proceeds that can be invested in higher yielding nonpurpose investments. For purposes of advance refunding bonds, redemptions are not required before the 90th day after issuance to prevent abusive transactions aimed at obtaining financial advantages through arbitrage. Special rules apply to bonds issued before a certain date. For advance refunding bonds, bonds issued before a certain date are subject to specific rules, including limitations on the timing of refunding and the number of times a bond can be advance refunded. Amendments have been made to the tax code to address these issues. The amendments made by this section apply to advance refunding bonds issued after the enactment of this Act."
