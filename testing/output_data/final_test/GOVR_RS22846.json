    "content": "The economic substance doctrine is a judicial tax doctrine used by the IRS and courts to disallow transactions that comply with the tax code but go against Congress's intentions. There are proposals to codify the definition of \"economic substance\" for uniform application by the courts, with similar language in bills during the 110th Congress. The Abusive Tax Shelter Shutdown and Taxpayer Accountability Act of 2007, along with other bills, includes a provision clarifying the Economic Substance Doctrine. The Senate passed version of H.R. 2419 contains a section defining economic substance in the Internal Revenue Code. H.R. 2419 adds a subsection to the Internal Revenue Code to define when a transaction has economic substance. It requires a meaningful change in the taxpayer's economic position and a substantial non-tax purpose. Profit expectations must be reasonable and compared to the expected tax benefit. If the main purpose is to reduce non-Federal taxes, there is no economic substance. The bill clarifies economic substance in non-Federal taxes, penalizing transactions lacking substance with a 30% penalty on tax understatement. This penalty can be reduced to 20% if relevant facts are disclosed in the tax return. The proposed penalty for tax understatement is calculated separately from underpayment, imposed by the Chief Counsel or delegate, with limited authority to compromise. Notification and response from the taxpayer are required before imposing the penalty, which can be reduced if the understatement is corrected. Following litigation where a court deems the economic substance doctrine relevant and a transaction lacking economic substance, the Chief Counsel can assert a penalty without further litigation. The penalty may be revoked if a court determines the economic substance doctrine was not relevant. Taxpayers must pay interest on underpaid taxes, even if due to disallowed positions on tax returns. Section 163(m) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits deduction of interest on understatements from undisclosed reportable transactions. The proposed bill aims to prohibit deduction of interest on underpayments due to transactions lacking economic substance, with no exception for disclosed facts on tax returns. It provides a definition of \"economic substance\" for courts to use, settling differences in interpretation. The Court of Federal Claims in Coltec Industries v. United States supports codifying this definition to clarify tax liabilities. The court supports codifying the definition of economic substance to provide clear and understandable rules for taxpayers in determining their tax liabilities. However, there are phrases and concepts in the proposed definition that may cause uncertainty rather than clarification. The current bill proposes a 30% penalty on transactions lacking economic substance if undisclosed, reduced to 20% if disclosed, with no provision for penalty abatement based on reasonable cause. Taxpayer reliance on professional advice is irrelevant, and the penalty is imposed by the Chief Counsel or delegate, leaving taxpayers in need of guidance on the economic substance doctrine. Taxpayers may need professional guidance on the economic substance doctrine but cannot rely on it to avoid penalties if the doctrine applies. The Joint Committee on Taxation asserts that tax benefits should not be disallowed solely based on the doctrine. Taxpayers, professionals, and courts still struggle to determine Congress's intent behind tax provisions, leading to uncertainty. Some believe clarifying the economic substance doctrine through codification can lead to positive results, causing taxpayers to avoid tax-motivated transactions. This proposal aims to increase revenue and reduce government costs by eliminating abusive tax shelter schemes. Some tax professionals and experts are skeptical about codifying the definition of economic substance, fearing it may inadvertently create new tax shelter loopholes. There are concerns about the effectiveness and potential drawbacks of the proposed legislation, with doubts about its ability to curb abusive tax shelters and generate revenue. IRS Chief Counsel Donald L. Korb has raised questions about the strict liability penalty associated with the proposal. IRS Chief Counsel Donald L. Korb doubts the enforcement of the strict liability penalty, citing concerns about increased litigation complexity and reduced taxpayer cooperation with the IRS."
