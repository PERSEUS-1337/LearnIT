    "content": "On October 25, 2012, Hurricane Sandy strengthened from Tropical Storm Sandy. FEMA increased preparedness efforts, sending teams to states from North Carolina to Vermont. Public and private sectors ramped up storm preparations. The President signed emergency declarations for eight states and the District of Columbia as the storm approached land. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on October 29, 2012, causing at least 131 deaths in the United States. Hurricane Sandy caused at least 131 deaths in the United States and resulted in estimated economic losses of $30 billion to $50 billion. The President declared major disasters for 12 states and the District of Columbia. A request for $60.41 billion in supplemental funding was submitted to Congress to address immediate losses and future disaster mitigation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a draft amendment for $60.41 billion in supplemental appropriations. The Senate introduced an amendment, S.Amdt. 3338, for $60.41 billion in supplemental appropriations, including disaster assistance provisions. It was later withdrawn and replaced by S.Amdt. 3395, which was passed by the Senate along with H.R. 1 on December 28, 2012. The House did not act on the legislation, but a provision to increase the bond limit for the Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund became law during the 112th Congress. The Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund saw an increase in the bond limit to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million with certification from a federal contracting officer under P.L. 112-239. Additionally, H.R. 41 provided $9.7 billion in borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program, signed into law as P.L. 113-1 on January 6, 2013. H.R. 152 included $17 billion for immediate needs, with an amendment adding $33 billion. The House passed legislation on January 15, 2013, including $17 billion for immediate needs and $33 billion for long-term recovery efforts and infrastructure improvements. The bill was sent to the Senate as a single package, which passed unchanged on January 28, 2013. The Senate passed H.R. 152 on January 28, 2013 by a vote of 62-36, signed into law as P.L. 113-2 the next day. P.L. 113-2 has two divisions - Division A provides supplemental funding for disaster relief, while Division B contains the text of H.R. 219 amending disaster assistance programs. The Administration's request for funding after Hurricane Sandy is outlined in Table 1, with a breakdown in the Appendix. The Appendix includes a table showing appropriations for various departments and agencies, comparing the Administration's request with the funding provided in H.R. 152. The table also reflects transfers between accounts, with an analysis of the supplemental appropriations bill in the context of the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act changed how Congress accounted for federal funding for disaster response and recovery, separating disaster relief from emergency funding. Future spending bills could adjust discretionary spending caps to pay for designated disaster relief funds. The Budget Control Act allows for adjusting discretionary spending caps to pay for designated disaster relief funds. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is limited to a 10-year rolling average of federal spending on relief efforts. The Administration proposed using the remaining allowable adjustment for disaster relief in its supplemental request, with emergency funding designation to avoid exceeding FY2013 budget caps. The Administration requested emergency funding for disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. Senate-passed H.R. 1 designated $5,379 million for disaster relief and $3,461 million for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities as emergency funding. P.L. 113-2 includes $41,669 million in emergency funding, with $5,379 million for disaster relief and $3,461 million for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities counting against discretionary budget caps. The report is organized alphabetically by subcommittee of jurisdiction, with numbers in budget authority rounded to the nearest million. Both the President's request and H.R. 152 included $224 million for programs under the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. Three of the four funded programs are for emergency land assistance, typically funded through supplemental appropriations bills. The fourth program is for nutrition assistance. The President's request and H.R. 152 are similar but not identical, with a $150 million difference in funding. The President's proposal and P.L. 113-2 differed in allocating $150 million for watershed protection mitigation efforts. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) assist landowners in restoring agricultural and private forestland damaged by natural disasters. Both proposals allocated $15 million for ECP and $23 million for EFRP, while the Senate bill proposed approximately $25 million and $59 million for these programs. The USDA made $15.5 million in previously appropriated ECP funds available to producers in counties affected by Hurricane Sandy. Producers in counties without a disaster declaration were encouraged to sign up for future funding. No funding is currently available under EFRP, but producers were advised to apply if funding becomes available. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and EWP floodplain easement program are administered by USDA's NRCS and USFS to assist with emergency recovery measures for runoff reduction and erosion prevention. The EWP floodplain easement program is a mitigation program that pays for permanent easements on private land to safeguard lives and property from floods, drought, and erosion. The President's proposal included $30 million for EWP recovery and $150 million for EWP floodplain easements. However, P.L. 113-2 did not fund EWP floodplain easements but added $150 million to the general EWP program. Senate-passed H.R. 1 also did not fund EWP floodplain easements but allocated $125 million for general EWP and other USDA programs for response and recovery efforts. After Hurricane Sandy, USDA released $5.3 million. The EWP floodplain easement program has not received funding since FY2009 and has no current funding available for mitigation. Emergency agricultural land assistance programs are funded through supplemental appropriations, resulting in funding variations from year to year. Recent changes in appropriations and budget law have altered how disaster funding for the programs may be used, with funding appropriated in FY2012 intended for major disasters declared pursuant to the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act requirement for funding related to Hurricane Sandy was present in P.L. 113-2, with additional requirements for land assistance programs. The Senate bill included the Stafford Act requirement for a portion of the appropriation but did not limit funds to Hurricane Sandy expenses. The President requested $6 million for the Commodity Assistance Program, specifically for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), while the Senate bill proposed $15 million for TEFAP. TEFAP funding provides USDA commodity foods to food banks. The Senate bill did not extend the availability of TEFAP funds through FY2014 as proposed in Senate-passed H.R. 1. P.L. 113-2 granted USDA flexibility to allocate foods and funds for administrative expenses to Sandy-affected areas. The Administration's request included $513.3 million for CJS agencies, while P.L. 113-2 provided $363.3 million for these accounts. The Administration's request for CJS agencies included funding for NOAA, DOJ, NASA, and LSC. Senate-passed H.R. 1 differed in funding amounts for NOAA and NASA. P.L. 113-2 provided less for NOAA but more for DOJ and NASA. Specific differences in funding allocations were noted for NASA's Construction and Environmental Compliance and Protection account. The Administration requested $393.0 million for NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account, with a focus on coastal community resiliency. P.L. 113-2 allocated $15.0 million to this account, prioritizing repairs and equipment enhancement. Specifically, $360.0 million was requested for storm and flood risk assessment, technical assistance, forecast capabilities, and ecosystem stabilization. The Administration requested $13.0 million for repairing weather observation and ocean observing assets. Additionally, $20.0 million was requested for evaluating impacts on natural resources and conducting marine debris assessments. Senate-passed H.R. 1 allocated $373.0 million for various purposes including repairing coastal monitoring assets, improving weather forecasting capabilities, and restoring coastal ecosystems damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The ORF account received $140.0 million from P.L. 113-2, with allocations for mapping, charting, geodesy services, marine debris surveys, repairing ocean observing assets, technical assistance for state assessments, weather forecasting improvements, research activities, and fishery disaster expenses from 2012. The Administration requested $100.0 million for NOAA to support state and local acquisition of land for coastal resiliency after Hurricane Sandy. Senate-passed H.R. 1 allocated $109.0 million for various purposes including repairing NOAA facilities, upgrading hurricane reconnaissance aircraft, and improving weather forecasting equipment. The Administration requested $186.0 million for improvements to weather forecasting equipment and supercomputer infrastructure, repair of NOAA facilities, upgrades to hurricane reconnaissance aircraft, and National Weather Service ground readiness project. Both Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 provided $88 million for the Department of Defense for repair and replacement of damaged equipment and facilities. The bills and the President's request had a slight reduction in Navy Operations and Maintenance funding. They all included $5.35 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. The distribution of funds across Corps accounts and eligible uses differed among the proposals. The Senate bill and P.L. 113-2 designated Corps funding as an emergency requirement. The Senate bill and P.L. 113-2 designated Corps funding as an emergency requirement, with exceptions for the Corps Construction Account. The President requested $30 million for the Investigations account, while both the Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 provided $50 million. Funds were allocated for storm damage reduction studies in Hurricane Sandy-impacted areas, with Senate-passed H.R. 1 expanding the study area to include Gulf Coast areas impacted by Hurricane Isaac. Additionally, Senate-passed H.R. 1 allocated funds for an interagency planning process. H.R. 1 allocated $15 million for an interagency planning process to address coastal flooding risks and $20 million for a comprehensive coastal flood risk study in Hurricane Sandy-impacted areas. The Administration requested $3.83 billion for the Construction Account, including $9 million for project repairs and $3.82 billion for storm damage mitigation projects. The Administration proposed allowing the Corps to transfer funds to other agencies for plan implementation. The Administration requested $9 million for repair of existing projects and $3.46 billion for other construction needs. P.L. 113-2 allocated funds for rehabilitation, repair, and construction of Corps projects, while Senate-passed H.R. 1 focused on natural disaster consequences. Both bills designated $2.90 billion for specific construction purposes. The enacted bill allocated funding for projects in coastal areas affected by Sandy to reduce flood risk and support sustainability. Projects deemed feasible by the Secretary and approved by appropriations committees are eligible for funding. Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have also funded projects in Gulf Coast areas affected by Hurricane Isaac based on cost-effectiveness and environmental acceptability. The three proposals differed in construction cost sharing for flood control and coastal storm damage reduction projects. Senate-passed H.R. 1 required nonfederal sponsors to provide 10% of project costs plus LEERD costs, while P.L. 113-2 included a waiver for ongoing construction activities to be funded 100% federally. Both bills allowed nonfederal costs to be repaid over a 30-year period. Both P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 provided funding for Corps Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) accounts, with differences in allocated amounts. P.L. 113-2 limited O&M funds to Hurricane Sandy-related expenses, while Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have made funds available nationally. Both bills allocated $1.01 billion for the FCCE account, exceeding the Administration's request by $409 million. The FCCE account in both P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 allocated $1.01 billion, $409 million more than requested. Senate-passed H.R. 1 specified $430 million to restore projects impacted by Hurricane Sandy to their design profiles, with remaining funds available for nationwide Corps emergency expenditures. Both bills waived FCCE project cost limits under WRDA 1986. The proposed provisions for the Construction Account in WRDA 1986 and P.L. 113-2 allocated $10 million for oversight of emergency response and recovery activities by the Corps and Assistant Secretary of the Army. The President requested $7 million for repairs to GSA properties damaged by Hurricane Sandy. P.L. 113-2 provides $7 million to GSA for repairs to properties damaged by Sandy and other real property activities. It also allocates $804 million in budget authority for the Small Business Administration, with slight differences from the Senate-passed H.R. 1. Additionally, P.L. 113-2 includes $20 million for salaries and expenses, as well as grants for cooperative agreements with organizations for technical assistance related to disaster recovery. P.L. 113-2 allocated funds for repairs to properties damaged by Hurricane Sandy and provided budget authority for the Small Business Administration. It included $20 million for salaries, expenses, and grants for technical assistance related to disaster recovery. The bill did not specify how funds should be disbursed between salaries and expenses and grants for cooperative agreements, but waived matching requirements for cooperative agreements. Recipients of grants and cooperative agreements differed between P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1. P.L. 113-2 and H.R. 1 aimed to expedite assistance for Hurricane Sandy recovery. H.R. 1 proposed using previously submitted documentation for assistance delivery, while P.L. 113-2 did not mention this method. P.L. 113-2 allocated $5 million to the SBA's Office of Inspector General and $520 million for direct loans to small businesses. It also provided $260 million for administrative expenses, including $250 million for direct administrative expenses and $10 million for indirect expenses. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have allocated $500 million for the Disaster Loan Program Account and $260 million for administrative expenses. The Administration's request for Hurricane Sandy funding included a provision for surety bond guarantees, which was not included in the enacted P.L. 113-2. The proposed amendment to the Small Business Act aimed to prohibit the SBA from requiring small business owners to use their primary residence as collateral for disaster loans up to $200,000. The President's request did not address the issue of using collateral for small business loans in P.L. 113-2, which allocated $12,072 million for DHS. The legislation also provided $11,488 million for the Disaster Relief Fund, slightly less than the requested amount. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received approximately $12 million less than the requested amount in P.L. 113-2. $5,379 million was designated for \"disaster relief\" under the Budget Control Act, with the remainder designated as an emergency requirement. The legislation also included adjustments for Customs and Border Protection equipment and the Coast Guard's Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements function. The Administration requested $300 million in subsidy loan authority for the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program account, which funds the Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program. Senate-passed H.R. 1 included $300 million for the account to subsidize no more than $400 million in direct loan obligations. P.L. 113-2 also repurposed approximately $146 million in unused subsidy loan authority for CDLs from the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005. The Disaster Loan Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-88) allowed for the repurposing of unobligated subsidy loan authority for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs) in response to Hurricane Sandy. Senate-passed H.R. 1 did not include this provision but included additional borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program. The House passed similar provisions in H.R. 219, which was appended to House-passed H.R. 152. The House and Senate passed legislation to increase borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program in response to Hurricane Sandy. This additional $9.7 billion in borrowing authority was provided through separate legislation, H.R. 41, signed by the President. The National Flood Insurance Program received $9.7 billion in additional borrowing authority through legislation signed by the President on January 6, 2013. This was in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to previous increases in borrowing authority. The NFIP is currently $18 billion in debt largely due to claims from Hurricane Katrina. The National Flood Insurance Program faces financial challenges as it relies on policyholder premiums to cover losses and expenses, leading to borrowing from the Treasury in catastrophic loss years. The program received additional borrowing authority in response to Hurricane Katrina, resulting in a current debt of $18 billion. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 included provisions beyond the scope of this report. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 included provisions similar to the \"Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013,\" amending disaster assistance programs authorized in the Stafford Act. Senate-passed H.R. 1 also included provisions not requested by the Administration. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 included provisions amending disaster assistance programs authorized in the Stafford Act, including broadening eligibility for reimbursement and establishing a pilot program for state facility relocation from disaster-prone areas. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 included provisions amending disaster assistance programs authorized in the Stafford Act, broadening eligibility for reimbursement and establishing a pilot program for state facility relocation from disaster-prone areas. Additionally, P.L. 113-2 allocated $1.44 billion for accounts within agencies funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, with specific amounts designated for agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 included provisions amending disaster assistance programs authorized in the Stafford Act and allocated $1.44 billion for accounts within agencies funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The total funding in the law was $210.0 million less than the Senate-passed H.R. 1, with $6.4 million designated for \"related agencies\" like the Forest Service and the Smithsonian Institution. The law, President's request, and Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed the same level of funding for seven accounts, with differences in funding allocation for specific accounts. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 allocated $1.44 billion for accounts within agencies funded by the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The funding was intended for mitigation projects to reduce the risk of future disasters. Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 also included funding for various accounts within agencies like FWS Construction, EPA STAG, and Departmental Operations. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 allocated $1.44 billion for mitigation projects to reduce future disaster risks. Funding in Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 included allocations for FWS Construction, EPA STAG, and Departmental Operations. The $600.0 million in P.L. 113-2 for EPA's STAG account is designated for capitalization grants for the State Revolving Fund programs under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The Administration requested $600.0 million for SRF capitalization grants for mitigation projects, with specific terms and conditions outlined in P.L. 113-2. States were required to allocate 20-30% of the funds for additional subsidization to loan recipients. Senate-passed H.R. 1 had a higher requirement of 50% for this purpose. Funding was designated for eligible projects aimed at reducing flood damage risk and vulnerability. SRF funds in the law are allocated entirely to states in EPA Region 2 for wastewater and drinking water treatment works and facilities impacted by Hurricane Sandy, rather than allocated according to the existing state-by-state allotment formula under the Clean Water Act for the CWSRF or according to needs surveys under the Safe Drinking Act's for the DWSRF. The SRF funds in the law are allocated to states in EPA Region 2 for wastewater and drinking water treatment works impacted by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 waived the 20% match requirement for SRF capitalization funds and allowed the use of CWSRF funds for land purchase. P.L. 113-2 did not include these provisions. Additionally, specific terms and conditions were applied to the NPS Historic Preservation Fund and the DOI, Office of the Secretary account in P.L. 113-2. Funding was limited to expenses related to Hurricane Sandy consequences. The funding in the law and Senate-passed H.R. 1 for Hurricane Sandy consequences had differing provisions for the DOI Office of the Secretary. Grants were limited to areas with a major disaster declaration, with no match required for federal funding. DOI bureaus and offices were to use funds for necessary expenses related to Hurricane Sandy. Under H.R. 1, funds for Hurricane Sandy consequences could be used for various storm-related activities, increasing coastal infrastructure capacity, and restoring public assets. The law specified national entities for funding use, while Senate-passed H.R. 1 allowed for protecting natural and cultural values and assisting state, tribal, and local governments. Both measures authorized the Secretary of the Interior to transfer funds and required a detailed spending plan within 60 days of enactment. The law prohibited the use of funds for acquiring land and repairing seawalls or buildings on islands in the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. Supplemental funding was provided for programs typically funded by the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies' appropriations bill, with a majority going to HHS for health and social services needs in affected states. The President's request, Senate-passed H.R. 1, and P.L. 113-2 allocated funds for various purposes including construction and renovation of health facilities. P.L. 113-2 differed from the President's proposal by consolidating the $800 million into one account and allocating funds to support dislocated workers. The President requested $50 million for Training and Employment Services within the Department of Labor. The President requested $50 million for the Workforce Investment Act Dislocated Worker National Reserve to support National Emergency Grants for job search assistance and training. Senate-passed H.R. 1 differed by not specifying funds solely for NEGs and allowing transfer of funds for Hurricane Sandy recovery. P.L. 113-2 included $25 million for the Department of Labor. P.L. 113-2 allocated $25 million for the Workforce Investment Act Dislocated Worker National Reserve without specifying funds solely for National Emergency Grants (NEGs). The Secretary of Labor was given authority to transfer up to $3.5 million for other reconstruction and recovery needs related to Hurricane Sandy. Additionally, $800 million in supplemental disaster funding for HHS programs was designated in P.L. 113-2, with $500 million for the Social Services Block Grant, $100 million for Head Start, and $200 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The $800 million allocated in P.L. 113-2 for HHS programs was directed to the PHSSEF account, with $500 million going to SSBG, $100 million to Head Start, $5 million to OIG, and the rest to the HHS Secretary for other activities. Unlike the initial request and Senate-passed H.R. 1, P.L. 113-2 made the funds available through FY2015. The PHSSEF funds, allocated by the HHS Secretary and used for emergency management activities, are not authorized in law except through annual appropriations. The President requested $200 million for health-related activities, including NIH grants, substance abuse programs, and environmental support. Senate-passed H.R. 1 and P.L. 113-2 largely supported this allocation, providing $800 million for HHS programs through FY2015. H.R. 1 allocated $800 million to the PHSSEF for health-related activities, with $200 million designated for specific purposes. Additionally, $500 million was provided for the SSBG at the HHS Administration for Children and Families, a flexible funding source for states to support various social services. The $500 million for the SSBG was requested to be directly appropriated, while P.L. 113-2 transferred these funds from an $800 million appropriation to the PHSSEF. Special language in both the request and P.L. 113-2 targeted supplemental SSBG funds for states affected by Hurricane Sandy, allowing for health services and facility renovations. P.L. 113-2 also extended the expenditure period for states to three years and allowed funds to be used for obligations incurred prior to the bill. P.L. 113-2 allows SSBG funds to be used for obligations incurred prior to the bill's enactment and prohibits their use for costs reimbursable by FEMA or covered by insurance. Senate-passed H.R. 1 included similar provisions, such as allowing states to use up to 10% of their allotments for compensating healthcare employees affected by Hurricane Sandy. The President's request and P.L. 113-2 allocated $100 million for the Head Start program, providing early childhood development services to low-income children. The funds were to be directly appropriated to Head Start in the request, while P.L. 113-2 transferred the funds out of a larger appropriation. The money was intended for renovating, repairing, or rebuilding damaged facilities, as well as providing services for affected children and families. P.L. 113-2 allocated $100 million for Head Start programs, specifying funds for disaster response and recovery. The allocation waived the statutory Head Start formula, clarified funds wouldn't be part of base grants, and allowed for pre-enactment obligations. The funds couldn't be used for FEMA-reimbursable costs or insurance-covered expenses. Senate-passed H.R. 1 had similar provisions not enacted in P.L. 113-2. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 included provisions for using funds for renovating, repairing, or rebuilding damaged facilities, supportive and mental health services for affected children and families, and technical assistance for affected Head Start centers. It also sought $259 million for military construction activities and the Department of Veterans Affairs for repair and replacement of damaged equipment and facilities. The request included $24 million for Army National Guard military construction efforts at Sea Girt National Guard Training Center and $236 million for the VA. The largest project was a $207 million request for renovation of Manhattan VA Medical Center due to severe flooding. P.L. 113-2 allocated $260 million for these accounts, with an additional $1 million for the VA's National Cemetery Administration for storm damage repair. Both pieces of legislation allowed funding to be used for otherwise unauthorized purposes. Construction funding and VA Major Construction funding were allocated for projects not typically authorized. P.L. 113-2 provided over $29 billion for agencies usually funded by the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies bill, with $13.07 billion allocated for Department of Transportation accounts, including more funding for public transit. The allocation differed from the President's request and Senate-passed H.R. 1, with more funding for Amtrak and highway repair than initially proposed. The President requested $11.7 billion for transit assistance, divided between repair and mitigation funding. The repair funding would be provided as a 90% federal match and could also be used for highway and bridge repairs. Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have provided $10.78 billion for transit assistance. The President's request for transit assistance included $11.7 billion for repair and mitigation funding, with the repair money also available for highway infrastructure. Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed $10.78 billion for transit assistance, with $5.4 billion allocated for repairs and the rest for mitigation funding. The bill did not address the issue of not supplanting private insurance. The Secretary of Transportation may transfer up to $5.383 billion for transportation projects in areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy. The President requested $30 million for FAA equipment repairs, drawn from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. $308 million was requested for highway repairs, with funding available for highway repairs in Sandy-affected areas at the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary of Transportation may transfer up to $5.383 billion for transportation projects in areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy. P.L. 113-2 provided $2.022 billion for the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, with funding available for highway disaster mitigation projects. Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have provided $921 million for highway repair and $336 million for Amtrak. Amtrak has estimated $60 million in property damage and business interruption losses, with $276 million in mitigation activities for rail tunnels into New York City. The President's request for funding for rail tunnels into New York City included provisions to prevent federal funds from replacing insurance coverage for Amtrak's damages. P.L. 113-2 allocated $118 million for repairs and recovery projects, which was more than the President's request but less than what Senate-passed H.R. 1 would have provided. Some transit agencies are considering using emergency relief funding to upgrade infrastructure instead of just restoring it to its previous state. The new Federal Transit Administration Emergency Relief Program may provide flexibility for transit agencies to install equipment for increased capacity and resilience. Questions may arise on how repair costs with system improvements should be allocated between federal programs and state/local governments. During the last days of the 112th Congress, the President requested $17 billion in supplemental funding for HUD, allocated to the Community Development Fund. During the first weeks of the 113th Congress, $16 billion was allocated to the Community Development Fund (CDF) for the HUD program. P.L. 113-2, signed into law on January 29, 2013, transferred $10 million for Office of the Inspector General (OIG) activities, exceeding the Administration's $4 million request. The proposed set-aside of $2 billion for CDBG disaster aid mitigation activities was not included in P.L. 113-2. The Senate-passed bill included a $10 million set aside for salaries and expenses to fund technical assistance and cover costs incurred by HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development in administering CDBG disaster funds. P.L. 113-2 allowed HUD to distribute CDBG disaster funds to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy and other eligible disaster events in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Additionally, $500 million was recommended in CDBG disaster funds to address unmet needs from other major disasters declared in 2011 or 2012. P.L. 113-2 allowed HUD to distribute CDBG disaster funds for major disasters declared in 2011 or 2012, with specific terms and conditions for submission of disaster plans, allocation of funds, and waiver authority. HUD was directed to establish regulations within 45 days, requiring grantees to submit approved disaster plans before funds could be used, and to certify that proposed activities support long-term recovery efforts. The activities in P.L. 113-2 will support long-term recovery efforts and require HUD to certify state and local government disaster plans to prevent duplication of benefits, fraud, and abuse. HUD is directed to allocate one-third of CDBG disaster appropriations to grantees within 60 days. The bill also sets conditions for fund use, allowing up to 5% for administrative expenses and prohibiting contracting out administration of CDBG disaster programs. The P.L. 113-2 bill sets conditions for the use of disaster funds, including requirements for grantees to maintain a publicly accessible website detailing fund usage. It also ensures that regular CDBG allocations are not affected by disaster-assistance allocations. P.L. 113-2 provides assistance to small businesses and public utilities, granting HUD authority to waive program requirements. It allows for expedited release of funds for certain FEMA matching requirements and reduces the percentage of funds benefiting low-income activities. The President requested legislative language for HUD's tenant-based rental assistance account, ensuring disaster-affected PHAs receive funding no lower than FY2012 levels. P.L. 113-2 allows HUD to reduce the percentage of funds benefiting low-income activities and grants authority to waive program requirements for small businesses and public utilities. P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 included provisions for HUD to adjust PHAs' funding levels to mitigate disaster impacts. The legislation required DOT and HUD to submit implementation plans and notify Congress before awarding grants over $1 million. The Administration indicated a need for legislative language on various issues, but no draft texts were publicly circulated. The President's request included provisions for enhanced grant management protocols for programs receiving supplemental appropriations, such as quarterly monitoring and timely submission of audit reports. The President's request did not include specific provisions for additional resources for federal agencies to implement grants oversight, such as supplemental funds for federal agency inspector general offices or an increase in the allowable management and administration percentage for individual grant programs. The Administration's request also did not identify which programs would be affected by the enhanced protocols. In the 112th Congress, Senate-passed H.R. 1 included a provision that would have required OMB to issue guidance to federal agencies to develop internal control plans for funds provided by the bill. The bill, P.L. 113-2, included funding for oversight of supplemental funding and certain management activities. Federal agencies were required to submit internal control plans for all supplemental funding provided. The President's request aimed to ensure the integrity of federal spending. Both P.L. 113-2 and Senate-passed H.R. 1 designated all programs funded as \"susceptible to significant improper payments.\" The Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires federal agencies to estimate and report annual improper payments. Programs with over $10 million in estimated improper payments must develop reports on causes and corrective actions. Some programs funded under the bill are not identified as prone to significant improper payments, increasing administrative burden. Two provisions in Senate-passed H.R. 1 aimed to prohibit payments from the funds provided. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 included provisions to prohibit payments from funds provided in the bills, such as payments to deceased individuals or those with seriously delinquent tax debts. There were concerns about how agencies would implement the tax provision due to access to IRS records. The President's request recommended withdrawing grant funds if not expended within 24 months, but it was unclear which programs were targeted. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed directing agencies to identify grants funded through the legislation that should be expended within 24 months. Recipients would have to spend the funds within this period, with agencies de-obligating any remaining funds. Agency heads could request a waiver for exceptional circumstances, but it was unclear if the waiver needed approval from the Director of OMB. The Senate provision in P.L. 113-2 required grant recipients to spend funds within 24 months unless a waiver was approved by the OMB Director. Uncertainty around the waiver process could have halted disaster recovery activities while awaiting approval. Grant recipients receiving a waiver must justify it to Congress and return any unspent funds after 24 months. The Administration's request proposed that federal agencies work with State, local, and tribal officials to assess future risks like extreme weather and sea level rise in recovery planning. Senate-passed H.R. 1 aimed to reduce vulnerabilities and build resilience to extreme weather events and coastal flooding. The provision in Senate-passed H.R. 1 aimed to address future extreme weather events, sea level rise, and coastal flooding by requiring project sponsors to consider increased risks and vulnerabilities. Funds would be available for regional projections and assessments of future risks to improve planning. The impact would depend on how federal agencies and project sponsors interpret and implement the directive. The provision in Senate-passed H.R. 1 required consideration of risks like extreme weather events, sea level rise, and coastal flooding for new flood hazard maps and floodplain management standards. It could impact flood protection plans along the eastern seaboard and guidelines for federal funds in reconstruction after Hurricane Sandy. The guidelines for reconstruction funds aim to maximize the use of technologies to prevent power outages and maintain critical services. Recipients may invest in backup generators with funds from programs like FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or HUD's Community Development Block Grant program. The Administration's proposal did not specifically request this provision but aligns with its focus on using funding effectively. The Senate passed H.R. 1 included a provision to transfer $1 billion in unneeded Overseas Contingency Operations funds for increased security at U.S. embassies after the Benghazi attack. The provision required congressional notification before using the funds, but it was not included in P.L. 113-2 or the Administration's formal request. The Administration's proposal for funding included $47.44 billion for response and recovery, and $12.97 billion for mitigation of future storm damage. This division deviates from traditional definitions and funding patterns for mitigation. The request includes provisions for flexible money transfers between programs. The Administration defines \"recovery\" as assisting communities in rebuilding infrastructure, providing housing, restoring services, and promoting economic development. \"Mitigation\" refers to reducing the impact of disasters through risk reduction projects and improving infrastructure resilience. The key difference between recovery funding and mitigation funding lies in the focus on reducing future risks after a disaster has occurred. However, there is confusion as some proposed mitigation activities seem more oriented towards recovery and repair. For example, $400 million in mitigation funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Resource Management account includes restoring and enhancing natural systems on various lands. Notably, FEMA's Hazard Mitigation program was not included in the Administration's proposal for mitigation funds. The FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, but there was confusion in Congress regarding the distinction between funding for \"mitigation\" and \"repair and recovery\" in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The House Appropriations Committee identified $17.1 billion for \"immediate needs\" in H.R. 152, with an additional $33 billion in funds, but the separation between \"repair and recovery\" and \"mitigation\" was not clearly defined. The purpose of the funds included \"mitigation\" without a clear separation. The House included \"mitigation\" as part of the purpose of the funds, without clearly separating it from recovery. Provisions in Senate-passed H.R. 1 identified a subset of funds for \"mitigation.\" Sections 1104 and 1105 of Senate-passed H.R. 1 encouraged funds to be used in a way that mitigates future risks. Requested funding levels are provided by appropriations account in Table A-1, summarizing the Administration's budget request. The table provides a breakdown of requested appropriations for disaster assistance, including details on the percentage of the total request each category represents. Requests for appropriations of $10 million or less are combined for brevity, accounting for less than 0.2% of the total request. The appropriations are intended for either damaged federal government property or other disaster assistance."
