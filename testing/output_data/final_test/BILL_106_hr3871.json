The Attorney General establishes the \"Innocent Images Online Training Center\" within the FBI to train law enforcement officers investigating online crimes against children. Located in Calverton, Maryland, it is managed by the FBI and includes staff from various federal agencies with authority in this area. The FBI, under the Attorney General's direction, is responsible for the duties of the Innocent Images Online Training Center (IIOTC). This includes educating and training law enforcement officers on investigating online crimes against children, utilizing the Innocent Images national initiative techniques. Training may also extend to international officers on a limited basis. The FBI provides training to law enforcement officers on investigating online crimes against children, including teaching, advising, and conducting research on current and emerging technology and investigative techniques. They also offer consultation on multifaceted Internet crimes against children investigations. The IIOTC works with the Department of Justice to train officers on FBI investigative techniques for Internet crimes against children, encouraging adoption of protocols at the state and local levels. The FBI Director appoints staff to the IIOTC. The IIOTC is staffed by experienced investigators and specialists from various agencies, with additional support personnel authorized by the FBI Director. Each agency is responsible for the costs of providing staff to the center. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is authorized to employ 33 additional support personnel for a 24-hour operation, staff a toll-free number, and assist in processing casework for the Innocent Images National Initiative. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2001 and beyond. The FBI Director must submit an implementation plan for the IIOTC to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment."
