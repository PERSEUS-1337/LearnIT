    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the USDA, FDA, and CFTC. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with a focus on discretionary amounts. Jurisdiction lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Agriculture appropriations bill focuses on discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending receiving more attention during the appropriations process. Discretionary appropriations totaled 15% ($21.75 billion) in FY2016. Mandatory spending is controlled by budget enforcement rules during the authorization process. The Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 114-113) totaled $21.75 billion, with mandatory spending making up 85% of the total. Key discretionary spending items include WIC, agricultural research, FDA, and farm assistance programs. Mandatory spending items include SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP requires an annual appropriation and is considered an \"appropriated entitlement.\" The FY2016 Agriculture Appropriation bill (P.L. 114-113) was enacted as part of an omnibus bill on December 18, 2015. Separate Agriculture bills were reported in both chambers but did not go to the floor. The last time an Agriculture appropriations bill was enacted as a stand-alone measure was for FY2010. The FY2016 Agriculture Appropriation bill was enacted as part of an omnibus bill on December 18, 2015. Separate Agriculture bills were reported in both chambers but did not go to the floor. The last time an Agriculture appropriations bill was enacted as a stand-alone measure was for FY2010. Committee action for FY2016 was somewhat later than in recent years, with the White House releasing its budget request on February 2, 2015. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their bills based on the released budget summaries and justifications from USDA, FDA, and CFTC. The House Budget Committee developed a FY2016 budget (H.Con.Res. 27) and the full House and Senate agreed on a joint budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 11) on May 5, 2015. The House Appropriations Committee divided the budget's \"302(a)\" allocation for discretionary spending on April 29, 2015, into \"302(b)\" allocations for each of its 12 subcommittees. The House Agriculture appropriations subcommittee approved a draft bill on June 18, 2015, and the full House Appropriations Committee reported the bill on July 8, 2015. The bill was not considered on the floor. The Senate Appropriations Committee divided the \"302(a)\" allocation into \"302(b)\" allocations for its subcommittees on May 21, 2015. The Senate Agriculture appropriations subcommittee approved a draft bill on July 14, 2015, which was reported by the full committee on July 16, 2015. The bill was not considered on the floor and its text was later included in a minibus appropriation bill. The fiscal year began under three continuing resolutions until December 11, 2015. The FY2016 Agriculture Appropriation was enacted as Division A of an omnibus appropriations bill on December 18, 2015 (P.L. 114-113). The final Agriculture appropriation provides $21.750 billion for discretionary amounts. The FY2016 Agriculture Appropriation provides $21.750 billion for discretionary amounts, with initial allocations set in the budget resolution. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $20.650 billion to its Agriculture subcommittee, slightly less than the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee's initial allocation for its agriculture bill was $20.510 billion, $110 million more than the House allocation if CFTC were held constant. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the FY2016 discretionary allocation for all 12 appropriations bills by $50 billion. The Agriculture subcommittees were allocated $21.75 billion, $1.1 billion more than the original House-reported allocation. The final FY2016 Agriculture appropriation included a $925 million increase over FY2015, with CFTC funding in the Agriculture bill. Continuing resolutions were used due to the absence of an FY2016 appropriation, maintaining program levels with exceptions for emergency funding and a small across-the-board reduction. Anomalies included increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and higher apportionment for the Rural Housing Rental Assistance Program. The enacted FY2016 Agriculture appropriations act provides $21.75 billion of discretionary spending, with notable increases in funding for the Rural Housing Service, Food for Peace grants, and the Agricultural Research Service. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriations act allocates $250 million in funding, with increases for the Agricultural Research Service, Food and Drug Administration, emergency conservation programs, Rural Utilities Service, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Reductions include $273 million less for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The FY2015 Environmental Quality Incentives Program sees a $73 million reduction in funding compared to the previous year. The appropriation includes policy changes such as repealing some country-of-origin labeling laws, continuing the prohibition on horse slaughter facility inspection, and forbidding imports of processed poultry from China for certain nutrition programs. Additionally, whole grain and sodium requirements in child nutrition programs are to be implemented with flexibility, and terms for dietary guidelines formation are directed. The use of commodity certificates for the marketing loan program is restored. The enacted appropriation restores the use of commodity certificates for the marketing loan program without payment limits. Conservation compliance requirements and certain tobacco regulations for e-cigarettes remain unchanged. The explanatory statement clarifies that report language from House- or Senate-reported bills still applies unless contradicted. The discretionary spending authorized for each title in the past 10 years exceeds the \"302(b)\" limit due to scorekeeping adjustments. The General Provisions title includes scorekeeping adjustments, such as limits on mandatory programs scored as savings. The use of CHIMPS and other tools has helped offset reductions in budget authority since FY2010. The discretionary total for the bill decreased by 6.7% from FY2010 to FY2016, while Titles I-VI only declined by 4.6% over the same period. The offset in FY2016 was smaller due to additional spending in the General Provisions title for foreign programs. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriations have decreased by 16% from their peak in FY2010. In constant dollars, the FY2016 appropriation has risen 7.2% above the recent low of FY2013. Changes in the total Agricultural appropriation have been relatively constant since FY2014. Some agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and CFTC, have seen sustained real increases since FY2007. Since FY2007, there have been increases in funding for the Food and Drug Administration and CFTC, as well as foreign assistance. However, discretionary conservation programs and general agricultural programs have seen decreases. Rural development funding decreased through FY2015, but the trend may have been reversed in FY2016. Domestic nutrition programs in FY2016 are higher than in FY2007, but lower than in other years. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions to prevent exceeding statutory budget goals, as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 prevented sequestration of discretionary accounts in FY2016 and FY2017, but mandatory accounts are still subject to sequestration through FY2025. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) receives 95% of its funding through the Agriculture appropriations bill and employs nearly 100,000 staff across 17 agencies. Funding for two-thirds of USDA employees is provided in Agriculture appropriations, while the remaining third in the Forest Service is funded by the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the USDA, with accounts for general administration and agricultural research. The enacted appropriation for FY2016 increased the administrative account subtotal by $8.7 million. Most of the increase is for buildings and facilities, below the requested amount for structural improvements to the USDA headquarters complex. The USDA's research, education, and economics mission is carried out by four agencies: The Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Economic Research Service (ERS). ARS conducts research on food and agriculture issues, NIFA provides funding to land grant colleges for research and education, NASS collects agricultural statistics, and ERS offers economic analysis. The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis of agriculture, natural resources, and food. The USDA research mission area receives $2.936 billion for FY2016, with increases for ARS buildings, NIFA competitive grants, and other accounts remaining constant. The Agricultural Research Service operates 90 laboratories nationwide with 7,400 employees and the National Agricultural Library. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is a key information repository for food, agriculture, and natural resource sciences. In FY2016, the enacted appropriation provides $1.144 billion for ARS salaries and expenses, with a $11 million increase over FY2015. Proposed increases in research projects were rejected by House and Senate committees. The omnibus and committee reports address deficient animal welfare conditions. The omnibus and committee reports address deficient animal welfare conditions at ARS research facilities, instructing compliance with Animal Welfare Act standards, allowing inspections by APHIS, updating animal care policies, and certifying progress with committees. House report language withholds 5% of ARS appropriation until policies are updated and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees are functioning. $212 million is provided for ARS buildings and facilities, an increase of $167 million. The enacted appropriation provides $212 million for ARS buildings and facilities, an increase of $167 million over FY2015. Funding is allocated for priorities identified in the \"USDA ARS Capital Investment Strategy,\" including construction of a biocontainment laboratory in Athens, GA, a foreign disease-weed science facility in Frederick, MD, and an animal science, human nutrition, and bee research center in Beltsville, MD. The enacted appropriation for NIFA in FY2016 is $1.327 billion, an increase of $37 million from FY2015. The President's request was $1.503 billion, but Congress rejected the proposal to merge NIFA's accounts. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) receives $350 million, a $25 million increase. The grants program under NIFA receives $350 million, a $25 million increase. Evans-Allen funding for historically black colleges and universities sees a $1.7 million increase. The appropriation rejects adding a competitive portion to formula-funded programs. The House report highlights the lack of state matching funding for some colleges and universities and directs USDA to address this issue. The proposal for new \"Innovation Institutes\" and consolidating STEM education funding is not included in the enacted appropriation. The USDA funding for STEM education programs is maintained at FY2015 levels, rejecting a proposal to eliminate certain grants. The National Agricultural Statistics Service receives $168 million for FY2016, a decrease of $4 million from FY2015. The Economic Research Service's budget is also reduced. The Research Service supports economic and social science analysis on agriculture, rural development, food, commodity markets, and the environment. It collects and disseminates data on USDA programs and policies. The enacted appropriation for FY2016 provides ERS $85 million, the same as FY2015, while USDA had requested $86 million. APHIS, AMS, and GIPSA carry out USDA's marketing and regulatory programs mission area, with APHIS responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. APHIS administers programs to protect against diseases and pests in agriculture, with an enacted appropriation of $897.6 million for FY2016. This includes funding for controlling outbreaks of insects, plant diseases, and animal diseases, as well as for managing pest animals and birds. The appropriation represents a $23.1 million increase from FY2015 (+2.6%) and a $38.6 million increase from the requested amount. In FY2015, USDA transferred $1 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) response activities. The enacted appropriation includes an additional $3 million for APHIS avian health to implement surveillance and biosecurity measures to stop the spread of HPAI. USDA is required to report to Congress on the emergency funds transferred from CCC to poultry owners and growers, as well as provide updates on HPAI developments. The enacted appropriation includes an additional $3 million for APHIS avian health to implement surveillance and biosecurity measures to stop the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Section 752 of the appropriation directs APHIS to establish a prioritization process for audits and reviews for countries that have been granted animal health status. APHIS is required to conduct audits based on factors defined in regulations for determinations of animal health status and make audit reports publicly available. In early 2015, a New York Times article about activities at the Meat Animal Research Center, an ARS facility, led to a USDA investigation of all ARS facilities using animals in research. The AMS administers programs to market U.S. agricultural products, receiving appropriations in discretionary and mandatory ways. The AMS administers programs to market U.S. agricultural products, receiving appropriations for activities such as market news service, shell egg surveillance, market protection, and transportation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provides funding for AMS salaries and expenses, slightly more than in FY2015 but less than the Administration requested. The AMS ensures egg quality, administers various market protection and promotion programs, including the National Organic Program and commodity research programs. They also monitor the agriculture transportation system and provide grants to explore new market opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural products. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees product quality, process verification, commodity grading, and licensing under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. They expect to collect $233 million in FY2016, with a $61 million limit on user fees for grading cotton and tobacco. The AMS also administers 2014 farm bill programs supporting specialty crops, farmers markets, local foods, and organic certification. The appropriation repeals country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for beef and pork, following a WTO challenge by Canada and Mexico. The WTO found the U.S. violated trade obligations by discriminating against beef and pork imports from Canada and Mexico, leading to almost $1 billion in retaliatory tariffs. Congress repealed COOL for beef and pork, ending the threat of trade retaliation. AMS's mandatory appropriation comes from the Section 32 program, funded by customs receipts and used to purchase various agricultural commodities. Section 32 funds are used to purchase agricultural commodities like meat, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and fish for school lunch and nutrition programs. The 2008 farm bill capped the annual amount at $1.303 billion and increased purchases of fruits and vegetables. The 2014 farm bill expanded the school snack program to include frozen, canned, and dried fruits and vegetables. The FY2016 appropriation provides $1.425 billion of Section 32 funds for AMS, with reductions due to rescission and sequestration. The House- and Senate-reported bills continue a provision prohibiting the use of Section 32 for emergency disaster payments. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) oversees the marketing of U.S. grain, livestock, and other commodities. The Federal Grain Inspection Service sets standards for grain inspection. The Packers and Stockyards Program monitors livestock markets for fair competition. GIPSA received $43.1 million for salaries and expenses in FY2016. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) received $43.1 million for salaries and expenses in FY2016. The agency is authorized to collect up to $55 million in user fees for inspection and weighing services. There is no rider prohibiting USDA from finalizing or implementing parts of GIPSA's proposed rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) ensures the safety and labeling of meat, poultry, and egg products. The agency received $1.015 billion in FY2016, with additional user fees totaling nearly $180 million per year. Appropriations are divided between federal, state, and international inspection, Codex Alimentarius, and public health data. In FY2016, FSIS received $1.015 billion in appropriations, including funds for federal, state, and international inspection, Codex Alimentarius, and public health data. The agency also proposed a user fee of $4 million for additional inspection costs, but it was not enacted. Additionally, FSIS is required to have at least 148 full-time equivalents dedicated to enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and to implement the catfish inspection program with a $2.5 million budget. The final rule on catfish inspection was issued by FSIS on December 2, 2015, to be effective from March 1, 2016, with a phase-in period until September 1, 2017. The appropriation prohibits FSIS from inspecting horse slaughter facilities and using voluntary inspection fees for horse slaughter inspection. USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers farm commodity subsidy programs, disaster assistance programs, farm loan programs, conservation programs, and international food assistance programs. The enacted appropriation for FY2016 provides $1.507 billion. The enacted appropriation for FY2016 provides $1.507 billion to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) for salaries and expenses, including funds for information technology implementation. FSA has faced challenges with the MIDAS plan and has not achieved expected results, as noted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and USDA OIG. The USDA OIG has identified management and schedule issues in recent reports. The FY2016 appropriations act prohibits FSA from closing county offices and relocating employees without approval. This requirement has been in place since FY2015 and includes specific criteria for IT spending. The 2008 farm bill and FY2015/FY2016 appropriations have set conditions for FSA to close or consolidate county offices. The appropriations reject increased funding for beginning farmer programs due to insufficient coordination among USDA agencies. USDA Farm Service Agency provides loans to farmers and guarantees timely repayment. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) provides loans to farmers for farm real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. These loans have a low interest rate and are funded through an annual appropriation for loan subsidies. The loan authority is larger than the subsidy level, and for FY2016, the appropriation amount aligns with the Administration's request. The FSA farm loan program in FY2016 receives $70 million of loan subsidy to support $6.402 billion of direct and guaranteed loans, with the loan authority remaining the same as FY2015 despite a 12% reduction in subsidy. The increase in loan authority since the global financial crisis of 2008 reflects the higher borrowing needs of farmers due to stricter commercial bank lending standards. In FY2010, supplemental appropriations increased regular FSA loan authority by nearly $1 billion each year to meet demand, reaching $6.0 billion in FY2010 from pre-crisis levels of $3.5 billion in 2008. Loan authority decreased from FY2011 to FY2013 due to federal budget pressures and stabilized demand. FY2014 restored loan authority levels closer to FY2009 and FY2010, while FY2015-FY2016 appropriations increased total loan authority to a new high level, especially in the direct farm ownership loan program. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds many agriculture-related mandatory spending programs in the 2014 farm bill. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds various agriculture-related mandatory spending programs in the 2014 farm bill, including farm subsidy, disaster payments, conservation, trade, food aid, research, rural development, and bioenergy. The CCC is a government corporation with the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance program spending. The CCC earns money from activities like buying and selling commodities and receiving interest on loans. Its borrowing authority is replenished through congressional appropriation, as mandatory outlays for commodity programs fluctuate based on economic or weather conditions. Funding needs are hard to estimate, leading to mandatory programs and operation under a Treasury line of credit. The congressional appropriation may not always restore the line of credit to the previous year's level, resulting in discrepancies between the appropriation and current year outlays. The CCC's borrowing authority is replenished through congressional appropriation, with an indefinite appropriation provided in the FY2016 budget. The amount scored for FY2016 is $6.871 billion, down 49% from FY2015, but this reduction does not indicate a decrease in program support. Policy changes in the FY2016 appropriation include restoring the use of \"commodity certificates\" for the marketing loan program, projected to cost $5 million in FY2016. These certificates provide flexibility in repaying marketing loans and can be redeemed for cash. Commodity certificates, used by farmers to avoid payment limitations, were not available after 2009. However, under the 2014 farm bill, payment limits apply to marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments. Restoring the use of certificates allows farmers to benefit from the marketing loan program without payment limitations. This provision was in the House-reported bill but not in the Senate-reported version. Additionally, the enacted appropriation continues a provision that effectively prohibits the use of the CCC for emergency disaster assistance. The omnibus bill continues a provision that prohibits the use of the CCC for emergency disaster payments to farmers and limits USDA's ability to provide marketing assistance loans for mohair. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offering free catastrophic insurance to producers of insurable crops. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, provides catastrophic insurance to producers of insurable crops. Producers can purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The program is funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations, supporting administrative expenses, premium subsidies, and indemnities. The FY2015 appropriation for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund is $74.8 million, with no increase for new staff as requested by the Administration. The omnibus appropriation provides an estimated $7.858 billion for the fund, a decrease of nearly $1.1 billion from FY2015, driven by lower commodity prices affecting premium subsidies. The actual amount needed may change based on crop losses and farmer participation rates. The appropriation does not include a House-reported provision. The enacted appropriation for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund in FY2015 resulted in lower premium subsidies. A provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 set a cap on the rate of return for private crop insurance companies, saving $3.038 billion over 10 years. This provision was not proposed or approved by the authorizing committees of jurisdiction. The provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 set a cap on the rate of return for private crop insurance companies, saving $3.038 billion over 10 years. Despite not being proposed or approved by the authorizing committees, assurances were made that the crop insurance reduction would be reversed in future legislation. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act restored the reductions to the crop insurance program, costing the federal government $3.038 billion over 10 years. USDA offers programs to help producers recover from natural disasters, with most programs receiving mandatory funding and not subject to annual appropriations. The FY2016 enacted appropriation provides funding for three agricultural land rehabilitation programs: Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP), and Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. Funding for these programs is not subject to annual appropriations and can be used for necessary expenses resulting from a major disaster declared under the Stafford Act. The FY2016 appropriation includes disaster relief funding not counted against discretionary spending cap, with limitations on eligible disasters. It repurposes $2.4 million in unobligated balances for disasters in FY2016 or FY2017. The FY2016 appropriation allows funding for disasters in FY2016 or FY2017, administered by USDA for agricultural conservation programs. NRCS provides technical assistance and administers most programs, while FSA administers the CRP. Conservation program funding is mandatory through the CCC and discretionary through annual appropriations. The FY2016 appropriation includes reductions to mandatory conservation programs and a slight increase for discretionary programs administered by NRCS. The largest program, Conservation Operations (CO), receives $851 million, more than FY2015 levels but less than the Senate-reported bill. Funding is directed for various conservation programs. House and Senate committee reports include congressionally directed actions such as program administration and herbicide resistance. The enacted FY2016 appropriation includes funding for various conservation programs, such as the Watershed Rehabilitation program, which received $12 million for FY2016. This program aims to repair aging dams previously built by USDA, with additional mandatory funding provided by the 2014 farm bill. $250 million in mandatory funding for FY2014 remains available until expended. Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) annually since FY2003. The FY2016 enacted CHIMPS are higher than the Administration's proposal and House- and Senate-reported bills, totaling $273 million. Sequestration further reduces funding for mandatory conservation programs in FY2016. In FY2016, mandatory conservation programs faced a total reduction of $562 million, approximately 10% of all funding. Some programs like EQIP have been consistently reduced since FY2003, while others like CRP have not been reduced in over a decade. The mix of programs reduced in FY2016 included EQIP and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. Additional reductions were made to EQIP beyond what was proposed, but proposed reductions to the Conservation Stewardship Program were not included in the enacted appropriation. The enacted appropriation did not include proposed rescissions of mandatory budget authority. Unlike CHIMPS, which apply only to the current fiscal year, a rescission is a permanent cancellation. The 2014 farm bill amended mandatory funding for conservation programs, allowing unobligated funds to be carried forward. This new approach also allows prior year's CHIMPS to be carried forward. The Administration's request included over $320 million in conservation-related rescissions. The enacted FY2016 appropriation did not include any rescissions, allowing FY2016 CHIMPS to be carried forward into FY2017. Three agencies are responsible for USDA's rural development mission area: RHS, RBS, and RUS. The enacted FY2016 appropriation provides $2.77 billion in discretionary budget authority for rural development programs, an increase of $368 million from FY2015. The FY2016 appropriation for rural development programs increased by $368 million from FY2015, totaling $2.77 billion in discretionary budget authority. This supports $36.7 billion in loan authority, with the largest economic activity being the single-family housing loan program. The FY2016 appropriation for rural development programs increased by $368 million from FY2015, totaling $2.77 billion in discretionary budget authority. The largest economic activity is the single-family housing loan program, representing 90.5% of RHS's total loan authority. The enacted bill provides $900 million for direct loans and $24.9 billion for federal loan guarantees. Other housing loan programs received appropriations as well, including $3.4 million for the Section 504 Very Low-Income Housing Repair loan program and $150 million for the Multi-Family Housing loan guarantee program. The Section 515 Rental Housing Program received $28.4 million in loan authority and $8.4 million in subsidies. The FY2016 appropriation for rural development programs increased by $368 million from FY2015, totaling $2.77 billion in discretionary budget authority. The largest budget authority line item in RHS is the Rental Assistance Program grants (Section 521), accounting for about 68% of the total. The FY2016 appropriation provides $1.39 billion in budget authority, an increase of $301.2 million from FY2015 (+27.6%). The Multi-Family Revitalization program receives $37 million in FY2016, $13 million more than for FY2015 (+54%). The Rural Housing Service also administers the Rural Community Facilities program, which provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and grants for \"essential community facilities\" in rural areas with less than 20,000 people. The enacted appropriation provides $42.3 million, of which $3.5 million would support a direct and guaranteed loan authorization level of $2.2 billion and the balance ($38.7 million) for grants. The FY2016 appropriation for the Community Facilities program is $12 million more than FY2015, but nearly $20 million less than requested. The budget continues the historical ratio between loans and grants, with $25 million allocated for facilities grants. Additionally, the program supports various economic development initiatives such as Rural Community Development Initiative grants, Economic Impact Initiative grants, and Tribal College grants. The budget authority for the Rural Business Program account is $62.7 million, which will support $979 million in loan authority for RBS loan programs. The Rural Business Program account has a budget authority of $62.7 million for FY2016, which is $11.3 million less than FY2015. This includes funding for various programs such as the Business and Industry Loan Guarantee program, Rural Business Development Grant program, Delta Regional Authority, Rural Cooperative Development Grants, and Rural Energy for America Program. Funding levels for these programs remain the same as in FY2015. The FY2016 appropriation provides $500,000 in loan subsidies to support $7.6 million in loans, which is $5.2 million less in loan authority than FY2015. The Administration requested funding for two new business programs: the Rural Business Investment Program ($6 million) and the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI, $13 million), but the appropriation provides no funding for these programs. Additionally, the FY2016 appropriation provides $594 million in budget authority for the Rural Utilities Service, $58 million more than FY2015. The FY2016 budget authority for the Rural Utilities Service is $522.4 million, an increase of $57.5 million from FY2015. This funding supports various programs including Water/Waste Water grants, Grants for Colonias, and Alaska and Hawaii Natives, Technical Assistance, Circuit Rider program, High Energy Cost grants, Solid Waste Management grants, Water and Waste Water revolving fund, and Individual Well Water grants. The FY2016 appropriation for the Rural Utilities Service includes $5.5 billion for rural electric loan authority and $690 million for Treasury rate telecommunication loans, with an increase in guaranteed underwriting authorization for electric loans. Funding for distance learning, telemedicine, and broadband remains the same as FY2015, with $36.8 million in budget authority. Grants for distance learning/telemedicine and rural broadband are unchanged at $22.0 million and $10.4 million respectively, while loans receive $4.5 million in budget authority to subsidize $20.6 million in direct loans. The USDA's budget for domestic food assistance in FY2016 is nearly $110 billion, a decrease of approximately $394 million from FY2015. The largest mandatory programs include SNAP and child nutrition programs. Discretionary budget items include WIC, CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. The enacted FY2016 appropriation is approximately $300 million below the proposed amount. The FY2016 budget for domestic food assistance is nearly $110 billion, a decrease of $394 million from FY2015. The enacted appropriation is approximately $300 million below the proposed amount, with reductions in SNAP and WIC accounts. The Under Secretary's office receives $811,000, a $5,000 reduction from FY2015. Directives from the explanatory statement include reports on SNAP's quality control process and school meals error rate measurement. The FY2016 budget for domestic food assistance is nearly $110 billion, with reductions in SNAP and WIC accounts. The statement directs USDA to provide a report on addressing school meals error rate measurement and ensuring contract obligations are fulfilled. Appropriations under the Food and Nutrition Act support SNAP, Nutrition Assistance Block Grants, Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, and Emergency Food Assistance Program. The enacted appropriation for the Food and Nutrition Act in FY2016 is approximately $80.8 billion, which is a decrease from FY2015 due to lower participation in the SNAP program and inflation-related updates. $3 billion is allocated for the SNAP contingency reserve fund, less than the $5 billion requested by the Administration. The appropriation also includes funding for Nutrition Education and Program Information. The Nutrition Education and Program Information line item in the SNAP account does not fund Centers of Excellence not authorized by Congress. The enacted SNAP appropriation reflects funding increases from the 2014 farm bill for TEFAP commodities and Community Food Projects. Child nutrition account appropriations fund programs like the National School Lunch Program and Summer Food Service Program. The FY2016 enacted appropriation provides approximately $22.1 billion for child nutrition programs, which is a $850 million increase from FY2015. This funding supports initiatives to improve meal quality and safety, including transfers from separate budget accounts within USDA and state-federal reviews of school meal operations. The FY2016 enacted appropriation provides $22.1 billion for child nutrition programs, a $850 million increase from FY2015. It includes funding for School Meals Equipment Grants ($30 million) and Summer EBT Demonstration Projects. The FY2016 enacted appropriation includes $23 million for Summer EBT Demonstration Projects, a 44% increase from 2015. The Administration had requested $67 million for these projects. The appropriation also includes exemptions from whole grain rules for school food authorities. USDA allows states to exempt school food authorities from 100% whole grain requirements if they demonstrate hardship in procuring specific whole grain products. Exemptions must maintain a 50% whole grain minimum. The FY2016 appropriation continues exemptions through school year 2016-2017. Additionally, a policy rider prevents USDA from implementing regulations that reduce sodium in school meals below certain limits. The enacted bill includes a policy rider to prevent processed poultry imported from China from being included in school meal programs. The impact of child nutrition policy riders is subject to USDA and state interpretation. The enacted appropriation law provides $6.35 billion for the WIC program, a decrease of $273 million from FY2015. The agreement fully funds all eligible WIC participants in fiscal year 2016, with set-asides for breastfeeding peer counselors and infrastructure. The FY2016 law provides $220 million for management information systems, including WIC EBT. This funding was offset by rescinding FY2015 carryover and recovery funds. The House and Senate reports proposed $55 million for this purpose, but the funding would only have been available for two years. The FY2016 law provides approximately $296 million for discretionary programs and activities, including the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), funding for TEFAP administrative and distribution costs, the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP), and special Pacific Island assistance. This represents an increase of nearly $18 million from the FY2015 appropriation, with increases for CSFP, TEFAP, and WIC FMNP. This budget account funds federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs and special projects for program integrity and quality. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) receives approximately $151 million in FY2016 funding, which is $10 million above the House-reported bill and $1 million below the Senate-reported bill. CNPP provides nutrition education and information to consumers, including dietary guides like the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) that promote health and prevent disease. The DGA form the basis of federal nutrition policy and are used in educational materials and programs for healthy eating and physical activity. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) is funded through the Nutrition Program Administration account and leads the policy development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) in collaboration with the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP). The 2015-2020 DGA were issued on January 7, 2016, with concerns raised by Congress regarding the scientific evidence and extraneous factors included in the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's (DGAC) Scientific Report. Congress included policy riders in the FY2016 appropriation law to limit the scope of the recommendations to matters of diet and nutrition only. The recommendations are limited to diet and nutrition, based on scientific agreement. Section 735(a) mandates a study by the National Academy of Medicine on the DGAC and DGA process. Section 735(b) requires a balanced panel to analyze how DGA can prevent disease, ensure nutrition for all, and improve DGAC selection transparency. The National Academy of Medicine is mandated to study the DGA process, including transparency, bias elimination, and diverse committee members. The study also includes recommendations on improving the DGA development process to reflect balanced and sound science. The USDA provides commodity foods to child nutrition programs using funds from sources other than appropriations, such as Section 32. About $480 million out of $1.1 billion in commodity support in FY2008 came from outside the Child Nutrition account. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program for selected elementary schools is financed with permanent, mandatory funding. Delays in fund availability have been seen in past years' appropriations. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program funding for July 2016 was delayed, allocating total annual spending by fiscal year with no reduction in support. The Food Service Management Institute receives $4 million annually, and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets $21 million per year. The Foreign Agricultural Service administers overseas market promotion programs for U.S. agriculture. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is responsible for improving U.S. agriculture's competitive position in the global market and facilitating export sales. FAS receives nearly $2 billion in discretionary funding annually, with additional mandatory funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation. This funding supports trade policy issues, trade promotion activities, institutional capacity building, and food security initiatives in developing countries with market potential. The FY2016 appropriation for the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is $191.6 million, an increase of $10.2 million from FY2015. The budget includes $6.7 million for export credit guarantee programs, the largest FAS export assistance program. Credit guarantees aim to facilitate the direct export of U.S. agricultural commodities and products, with no budgetary outlays unless a default occurs. The 2014 farm bill authorizes $5.5 billion of credit guarantees annually. The 2014 farm bill authorized $5.4 billion in credit guarantees for U.S. agricultural exports and $100 million for building agricultural facilities in emerging markets. The FY2016 appropriation includes $1 million for reorganizing USDA's international trade functions and creating the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Affairs. The FY2016 appropriation includes funding for the Borlaug Fellows Program and the Cochran Fellowship Program, as recommended by the Senate report for FY2015. The Senate expects FAS to continue funding the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program and the Market Access Program without changing eligibility requirements. The Food for Peace Program consists of four program areas: Title I - economic assistance and food security, Title II - emergency and private assistance programs, Title III - food for development, and Title V - the farmer-to-farmer program. Funding for Title I and Title III activities has not been requested since 2002, with the last concessional commodity shipment occurring in 2006. Title V funding is mandatory and linked to the overall funding under the Food for Peace Act. The Food for Peace Title II program, funded through annual discretionary appropriations, provides primarily in-kind donations of U.S. commodities for international humanitarian and development needs. Despite being funded in agricultural appropriations, Title II programs are administered by USAID. There is ongoing debate between the Administration and Congress over how Title II funds may be used, with the Administration seeking to increase the flexibility of funds for more immediate and cost-effective responses to food crises. The FY2016 appropriation for the Food for Peace Title II program provides $1.716 billion, including a one-time supplement of $250 million, to address ongoing food assistance needs in conflict-affected regions like Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and South Sudan. Congress uses Title II funds to purchase U.S. commodities and ship them to countries with food deficiencies, with a minimum funding requirement of $350 million for nonemergency food aid. The FY2016 appropriation for the Food for Peace Title II program is $1.716 billion, with $20 million allocated to reimburse the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. Congress requires a minimum of $350 million for nonemergency programs. USAID is requested to provide a report on the use of funds under 7 U.S.C. 1736f(e). The Administration had proposed $1.4 billion for FY2015 and FY2016, with $350 million exempt from U.S. purchase requirements for cash-based food assistance in emergencies. The FY2016 appropriation for the Food for Peace Title II program is $1.716 billion, with $20 million allocated to reimburse the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. $270 million of Title II funds will be combined with an additional $80 million from the Development Assistance account to support development food assistance programs addressing chronic food insecurity. LRP projects, administered by USDA in consultation with USAID, received $5 million in FY2016 within the McGovern-Dole program. The McGovern-Dole program provides donations and assistance for school feeding and nutrition projects in developing countries. The FY2016 appropriation increased to $201.6 million, with $10 million more allocated, including $5 million for the LRP program. Industrial hemp is an agricultural commodity used for various products, but it is subject to U.S. drug laws due to its relation to marijuana. The 2014 farm bill allows certain institutions to grow industrial hemp as part of an agricultural pilot program. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation prohibits funds from being used to restrict the transportation, processing, sale, or use of industrial hemp grown in accordance with the bill. The CJS appropriation prevents the Department of Justice from acting against the hemp provision in the farm bill. The FY2015 CJS appropriation includes language to block federal law enforcement from interfering with state agencies, hemp growers, and agricultural research related to industrial hemp as defined in the 2014 farm bill. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) are discussed in the House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, and medical devices under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). FDA's budget falls under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration. The FDA's program level for FY2016 is $4.738 billion, an increase of $238 million from FY2015. Direct appropriations for FY2016 are $2.729 billion, up $132 million from FY2015. The President's budget requested $2.744 billion, the House-reported bill would have provided $2.627 billion, and the Senate-reported bill would have provided $4.616 billion. The enacted FY2016 FDA appropriation includes user fees totaling $2.009 billion. The President requested $1.988 billion in fees from authorized programs and $199 million in unauthorized fees for various agency activities. The enacted FY2016 FDA appropriation includes user fees totaling $2.009 billion for registration, food imports, cosmetics, and food contact notification activities. The President's total user fee request was $2.187 billion, bringing the total program level request to $4.93 billion. The enacted appropriation did not include proposed fees, but included $1 million for fees related to drug compounding regulation. The House-reported bill would provide $1.979 billion in fees, and the Senate-reported bill would provide $1.978 billion in fees. The enacted FY2016 appropriation requires $1.5 million of the budget authority for other activities to be transferred to the HHS Office of Inspector General for FDA oversight. Table 13 displays budget authority and program levels for FDA in previous years and appropriations for FY2016, including the President's request, House and Senate Committee reports, and enacted amounts. User fee revenue is allocated across program areas. The enacted appropriation for FDA includes increased budget authority for medical product safety initiatives such as Combatting Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria and precision medicine. Foreign high-risk inspections are also highlighted in the explanatory statement. The FDA's Drug Development Grants Program received a $5 million increase for foreign high-risk inspections, particularly focusing on imports from China. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for a feasibility study to update the Master Plan for the White Oak campus. Another $5 million was designated for FDASIA implementation to address drug shortages. The agreement directs the FDA Commissioner to prioritize public reporting of manufacturing shortages and prevent conditions leading to drug shortages. It also includes funding for the Center for Tobacco Products to evaluate health effects of e-cigarettes and recommendations for future research. The enacted appropriation includes language related to the use of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) in food. FDA determined PHOs are no longer safe for use in human foods, with a compliance date of June 18, 2018. Food manufacturers can seek approval for specific uses of PHOs. FDA cannot deem a food unsafe solely because it contains a PHO during the compliance period. FDA is encouraged to review a Food Additive Petition for minor use of PHOs in certain foods. The explanatory statement also includes seafood consumption advice for pregnant individuals. The FDA and EPA issued draft advice on fish consumption for pregnant women and young children in June 2014. The enacted appropriation directs the FDA to provide final guidance on safe seafood consumption without progress reports. Additionally, the FDA is directed to finalize all pending draft biosimilar timelines for the committees. The FDA is directed to finalize all pending draft biosimilar guidance documents and regulations, address safety concerns raised at a meeting, and provide recommendations on how to address these concerns. Additionally, the FDA is requested to document its review of bioequivalence standards and patients suffering from ophthalmologic conditions. The FDA's Foods program plays a major role in ensuring food safety and quality. The FDA's Foods program ensures the safety, quality, and labeling of food products, including dietary supplements and cosmetic products. Funding for FDA Food Programs has more than doubled in response to food safety legislation, such as the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The program has adapted to the increasing variety and complexity of the U.S. food supply, including rising import demand and emerging microbial pathogens. The FDA's total budget for food safety programs and activities, including aspects of other FDA program areas, totaled $1.2 billion in FY2015. The enacted FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides for a $104.5 million increase in budget authority for FDA's food safety activities, including FSMA implementation. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides a $109.5 million increase requested by the Administration for FDA's food safety activities, more than double the increases proposed by the House and Senate committees. This includes funding for FSMA implementation, grants for healthier meals in schools, and interagency coordination between FDA and USDA-NIFA. The total budget for FDA's Foods program in FY2016 is $987.3 million, identical to the Administration's request. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides a $109.5 million increase for FDA's food safety activities, including funding for FSMA implementation and interagency coordination. The appropriation also includes provisions requiring FDA to take additional food safety actions and develop labeling guidelines for genetically engineered salmon. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation includes provisions for FDA's Foods program, such as informing consumers about genetically engineered salmon for sale and addressing illnesses related to imported pet food. It also places restrictions on FDA regarding the implementation of dietary guidelines, restaurant menu labeling, whole grain requirements in schools, partially hydrogenated oils, added sugars labeling, and sodium policies in federally reimbursed meals. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees derivatives markets, including futures and swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded CFTC's jurisdiction to regulate previously unregulated swaps markets. Questions remain about whether CFTC has enough resources to handle its new responsibilities, with a FY2016 appropriation of $250 million. The FY2016 appropriation for the CFTC is $250 million, the same as FY2015. $50 million is allocated for information technology. The Senate markup proposed $5 million more than the House markup. The President's budget request was $322 million, a 29% increase from FY2015. The CFTC Chairman criticized the lack of budget increase despite expanded oversight over swaps markets. CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad criticized the lack of budget increase for oversight of derivatives markets, stating it sends a clear message that oversight is not a priority. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) is the federal regulator for the Farm Credit System (FCS), funded by assessments on FCS entities and agency bonds. The Agriculture appropriations bill sets a limitation on FCA administrative expenses as part of congressional oversight. The Agriculture appropriations bill sets a maximum operating level of $65.6 million for FCA administrative expenses in FY2016, allowing for an increase of $5.1 million from FY2015. FCA's request includes additional costs for staffing replacement and training new staff. Despite being lower than the requested amount, the FY2016 level marks a return to higher funding levels compared to previous years. In FY2016, the Agriculture appropriations bill had over $1 billion in net offsets to reduce costs. Reductions were made through limitations on mandatory programs, rescissions from other accounts, and scorekeeping adjustments. Additional spending was authorized for foreign food aid and emergency conservation programs. These reductions help meet the discretionary budget allocation. The General Provisions title in appropriations bills score budgetary savings to meet discretionary budget allocation by offsetting spending elsewhere. It contains policy-related provisions affecting executive branch actions with no budgetary impact. Mandatory programs, set by multi-year authorizing laws, usually do not require appropriations. Appropriators have limited mandatory spending in statutes like the farm bill for over a decade. Limits on mandatory spending, known as CHIMPS, are placed by appropriators through reductions or increases in spending authority. Rescissions can also be made to permanently cancel budget authority. These limits do not change the authorizing law but have a similar effect through CHIMPS for one year. Appropriators use language in appropriations bills to restrict mandatory program spending. Historically, most allocations for budgetary resources in agriculture originated from appropriations committees. The division over funding certain programs has roots dating to the 1930s. Mandatory funding like the Commodity Credit Corporation was created to remove unpredictable funding issues. After the 1996 farm bill, mandatory funds were used for programs that had been discretionary. Appropriators and authorizers had differing funding priorities. Tension arose over funding certain activities, with questions about using the CCC for uncertain outlays. CHIMPS affected conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and some nutrition assistance programs, but not farm commodity or primary nutrition programs like SNAP. The FY2016 appropriation saved $831 million from CHIMPS, with $436 million from programs authorized in the 2014 farm bill. These savings are similar to FY2015, slightly smaller from the farm bill, and slightly greater overall compared to FY2011-FY2014 levels. Budget sequestration has impacted CHIMP amounts in proposed bills for FY2016, with differences in scoring methods across various proposals. Sequestration has reduced the amount available to most mandatory programs since FY2013. For example, the CHIMP for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program was smaller in FY2014 ($153 million) compared to FY2013 ($165 million) due to sequestration, despite no spending being allowed in either year. The scoring of the Administration's request and the Senate bill for FY2016 is before sequestration, while the House bill's scoring is after sequestration. CBO's failure to incorporate sequestration into CHIMP estimates gave the Administration and the Senate more credit for some CHIMPS. Rescissions are a way to permanently cancel funds provided by previous appropriations laws, resulting in budgetary savings and allowing for more spending in appropriations bills. Unlike CHIMPs, rescissions prevent unobligated funds from being reallocated or repurposed in the future. They often relate to unobligated balances of funds appropriated a year or more ago for specific purposes. In FY2016, $34 million was rescinded from enacted appropriations. In FY2016, $34 million was rescinded from enacted appropriations, with typical levels of rescissions for most years. The General Provisions title may include appropriations for activities not part of regular agency appropriations, such as supplemental or disaster appropriations. The FY2016 appropriation also includes $273 million for emergency watershed, conservation, and forestry programs, with $130 million not subject to the discretionary budget cap. The FY2016 appropriation bill includes $283 million for various spending provisions, such as $250 million for the Food for Peace program. Scorekeeping adjustments are crucial for the bill to meet the 302(b) spending limit, with some adjustments not specified in the bill but related to program operations. CBO calculates and reports these adjustments in unpublished tables. The FY2016 appropriation bill includes $283 million for various spending provisions, with negative subsidies from USDA loan programs increasing in recent years. These subsidies have grown to $408 million in FY2015 and moderated slightly to $345 million in FY2016. This appendix provides historical trends in Agricultural appropriations from FY1995 to FY2015. Discretionary agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, while mandatory nutrition spending continued to rise through FY2015. Total agriculture appropriations grew at a compounded annual rate of +2.4% over the past five years, with mandatory spending showing a +2.5% annual increase. In FY2016, 15% of the total agriculture appropriation is discretionary spending, down from 28% in FY1998. Domestic nutrition includes child nutrition programs, SNAP, and WIC, while the \"rest of the bill\" covers other USDA programs, FDA, and CFTC. Total domestic nutrition program spending increased at a +4.1% compounded annual rate over five years, with most of the agriculture appropriation going towards domestic nutrition programs. Mandatory spending in SNAP and child nutrition programs rose at a +4.5% annual rate, while discretionary spending decreased. On the other hand, spending on the rest of the bill decreased at a -2.7% annual rate over five years. Total domestic nutrition program spending increased at a +4.1% compounded annual rate over five years, with most of the agriculture appropriation going towards domestic nutrition programs. Discretionary spending increased at a +2.5% annual rate, while discretionary appropriations decreased at a -6.5% annual rate over five years. Total discretionary Agriculture appropriations grew at +1.6% per year over the past five years. The discretionary portion of the Agriculture bill has seen a +2.8% annual increase over five years, while the nutrition portion has decreased by -0.8% annually (-2.4% adjusted for inflation). The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget declined from over 4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2008, before rising to about 4% from FY2013-FY2015. Nutrition programs' share declined from 2.5% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008, but rose to about 3% through FY2014 due to the recession. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget has declined from 2.2% in FY2000 to 0.8% in FY2016. The mandatory share for nutrition is about 2.6%, while the discretionary share is 0.2%. The mandatory share for other programs fell from 0.6% to 0.4% in FY2016. The discretionary share for these programs remains steady at about 0.37%. This spending on agricultural programs has been variable but generally declining since 2000. Agriculture appropriations as a percentage of GDP have fluctuated over the years, with a slight increase from FY2010 to FY2015 before falling again in FY2016. Nutrition programs have seen a steady rise as a percentage of GDP since FY2000, while non-nutrition agricultural programs have declined. On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have increased slightly over the past decade. In FY2016, per capita nutrition program funding increased to nearly $340, while non-nutrition agricultural programs declined to under $100 per capita. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions to meet statutory goals, as outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 raised spending limits to avoid sequestration in FY2014 and FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 prevented sequestration on discretionary accounts in FY2016 and FY2017, but not on mandatory accounts. Congress extended mandatory sequestration multiple times to offset discretionary spending and other bills. The first farm commodity program payments from the 2014 farm bill were subject to a 6.8% reduction in FY2016. The 6.8% reduction applicable to FY2016 affected some farm bill mandatory programs, with exemptions for nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. OMB has ruled crop insurance as mostly exempt from sequestration since FY2013, while farm commodity programs have been subject to it. OMB has ordered budget sequestration on non-exempt, non-defense discretionary accounts only once in FY2013, and on mandatory accounts annually from FY2013 to FY2016."
