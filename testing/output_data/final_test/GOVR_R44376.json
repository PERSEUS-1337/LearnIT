    "content": "In FY2012, the federal government spent an estimated $15 billion on Graduate Medical Education (GME), the largest federal investment in the health care workforce. Recent data analyzed by GAO in 2015 found that GME programs from HHS and VA spent $14.5 billion, with Medicare payments accounting for 85% of this funding. The federal government spent $15 billion on Graduate Medical Education (GME) in FY2012, with Medicare GME payments accounting for nearly three-quarters of all spending. The government supports GME through various programs and agencies, primarily as a payer with little involvement in the content of training or specialties. The government's role in Graduate Medical Education (GME) has been criticized for its lack of connection to other federal health workforce investments, such as training non-physician providers. Medicare's GME support, which accounts for a significant portion of federal funding, has been particularly scrutinized for capping the number of residents it supports, making it challenging to increase residency positions. Some argue that the Medicare cap on residency positions should be lifted to address physician shortages in certain areas. Recent studies show growth in the number of residents despite the cap, as other funding sources can be utilized to expand training programs. New hospitals can also start training residents and receive Medicare payments. Some argue that expanding Medicare support to address physician shortages should be done in a directive manner, such as allocating positions to specific areas or requiring hospitals to fund residency positions in certain specialties. Despite existing incentives, hospitals often do not take advantage of programs to increase training in rural areas. Workforce data collection and projections are essential for Graduate Medical Education (GME) policy but are not enough on their own. Determining appropriate GME policy is challenging due to the long process of training new physicians and the need for good initial data. Recent projections by the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis show the difficulty of making projections concurrent with policy changes, as seen in their 2013 projections of a potential primary care physician shortage in 2020. The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis projected an 8% growth in primary care physicians between 2010 and 2020, but a 14% increase in demand for their services. These projections were based on assumptions about population aging, insurance coverage, and the Affordable Care Act. However, recent policy changes and stakeholder responses were not accounted for in these projections. Beginning in 2019, individuals no longer need to maintain insurance coverage or pay a penalty (i.e., the ACA's individual mandate), which experts believe will reduce insurance coverage. This could impact HRSA's projected 2020 shortages of primary care physicians. Uncertainty also arises from the role of non-physician providers, with varying projections on the shortage depending on the use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. In projections to 2030, the shortage of primary care physicians ranged between 7,300 and 43,100. Increasing the role of nurse practitioners and physician assistants may help avert shortages. Geographic shortages of specific provider types and specialties are also projected. Little change has been seen in areas where GME training occurs, potentially affecting physician practice locations. Policy changes at federal or state levels could alleviate geographic shortages. The uncertainty in projecting supply and demand under changing policy conditions highlights the need for regular updates in projections. Good data is essential for developing and implementing Graduate Medical Education (GME) policy and aligning GME investments with health workforce goals. Improved data collection is recommended to optimize GME spending and support the physician workforce through federal programs offering loan repayment or scholarships. Medicare is the largest source of Graduate Medical Education (GME) support, providing funding for GME based on factors like full-time equivalent (FTE) residents in teaching hospitals. Multiple residents can occupy one FTE, as not all time is counted for Medicare purposes. In FY2015, Medicare provided approximately $10.3 to $12.5 billion in overall GME payments through direct graduate medical education payments (DGME) and indirect medical education payments (IME). These payments are limited by caps on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents a hospital can receive payment for. CMS does not typically direct hospitals on the types of residents to train or specific geographic areas for training. Medicare's GME support is based on collecting information from hospitals for payment calculation and auditing purposes. In 1997, federal funding for GME positions was limited to align with the number of graduates from accredited U.S. medical schools. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) limited Medicare's GME support to the number of FTE residents a hospital had in 1996. Each hospital was given a cap on the number of positions Medicare would fund, which is not absolute and can be adjusted for new hospitals without residency programs. Residents may occupy slots but are not directly tied to specific hospitals, and they cannot be counted for payment by two government programs simultaneously. Since the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, hospitals have increased residency slots by 27% using non-Medicare funding sources. Subspecialty services have seen the most growth due to higher revenue generation. The ACA included programs to redistribute unused Medicare GME slots, with ongoing redistribution from closed hospitals. In FY2015, Medicare provided $3.68 billion in DGME payments to teaching hospitals, supporting approximately 85,700 FTE residents. Medicare DGME payments reimburse teaching hospitals for approved program costs directly incurred with residency programs. Medicare pays for its share of approved program costs, while non-Medicare payers cover the remaining costs based on their patient share at the teaching hospital. The total approved DGME cost for a teaching hospital is based on the approved weighted FTE count and a per-resident amount. Residents in their initial residency period are weighted as 1.0, while those past their IRP are weighted as 0.5. The hospital's approved FTE count is a rolling average over three years, and the per-resident amount is updated annually. The product of these figures represents Medicare's total approved DGME amount for the hospital in a year. In FY2015, Medicare provided $7.38 billion in IME payments to teaching hospitals, supporting approximately 85,600 FTE residents. Medicare IME payments cover indirect costs related to residency programs, such as higher patient care costs from additional testing ordered by residents during training. This is necessary because Medicare's IPPS payment method does not typically include separate payment for additional testing, potentially putting teaching hospitals at a disadvantage. Medicare provides IME payments to teaching hospitals as a percentage increase to Medicare's IPPS payment for each discharge. The IME payment adjustment is based on an intern and resident-to-bed ratio and includes operating and capital components. The IME capital adjustment formula uses a residents-to-average daily census ratio to increase the teaching hospital's capital payment component. Residents are counted in a similar manner as in the IME operating adjustment formula. Medicaid GME payments are a significant source of support for teaching hospitals, with states having flexibility in designing their own versions of Medicaid within federal guidelines. Unlike Medicare, there is no federal guidance for Medicaid GME payments, leading to substantial variation in state payments made through the fee-for-service delivery system. States make Medicaid GME payments through fee-for-service (FFS) or managed care delivery systems. Data on these payments are limited, with information collected by CMS, AAMC, and GAO. A 50-state survey by AAMC and a GAO report provide varying information on Medicaid GME payments. Table 2 compares data from these sources for federal fiscal year 2015 and state fiscal year 2015, showing differences in reported FFS GME payments. The AAMC and GAO data show discrepancies in the number of states making Medicaid GME payments, with AAMC reporting 43 states and GAO reporting 45 states for SFY2015. CMS-64 data only shows 31 states with Medicaid GME payments, while AAMC and GAO report 41 and 44 states with FFS GME payments. Total Medicaid GME payments are similar between AAMC and GAO, with AAMC reporting $4.3 billion and GAO reporting $4.2 billion for SFY2015. The CMS-64 data for FY2015 shows higher FFS Medicaid GME payments than the AAMC survey for SFY2015. AAMC and GAO provide additional information on how Medicaid GME payments were calculated, including using Medicare methodology or per-resident payments. Most states support training programs for physician residents, while some also support training programs for other health professions. The VA supports training programs for various health professions, including physicians, to ensure an adequate supply of healthcare professionals. In FY2017, the VA spent $1.78 billion on Graduate Medical Education (GME), which accounted for 80% of all VA stipend support for clinical training programs. About 43,000 physician residents receive their training at VA-funded positions annually. The VA spent $1.78 billion on GME in FY2017, accounting for 80% of all VA stipend support for clinical training programs. The VA partners with teaching hospitals for GME programs as accrediting bodies require residents to see a diverse patient population. About 99% of VA's GME programs are sponsored by academic affiliates, partnering with over 2,000 ACGME accredited programs in 80 different specialties or subspecialties. The VA partners with teaching hospitals for GME programs in 80 different specialties or subspecialties. When residents train at a VA facility, the VA shares costs with the teaching hospital for faculty and residents. Residents at VA facilities are not counted towards the Medicare GME cap, allowing hospitals to train additional residents. The VA controls the type and location of residents it trains, based on staffing needs and partnerships with academic affiliates. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 and the Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 expanded VA residency training by up to 1,500 positions in primary care and mental health over a 10-year period. The VA allocated 204.3 new positions in AY 2015 to 82 facilities in 38 states. The VA allocated 204.3 new positions in AY 2015 to 82 facilities in 38 states, with 162.9 positions filled as of July 1, 2015. Additional positions were allocated for residents training in AY2016 and AY2017, totaling 547.41 over three years. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 included a provision for a new pilot program for GME in underserved areas, not yet implemented. The new pilot program under the VA MISSION Act of 2018 will create medical residency positions at various facilities, including those operated by the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes, federally qualified health centers, DOD facilities, or other facilities approved by the VA Secretary. The program aims to place at least 100 residents in underserved areas or facility types specified in the Act. The VA Secretary is authorized to provide stipends and benefits to residents regardless of their assignment location. The VA will cover costs for new residency programs, including curriculum development, faculty salaries, recruitment, and accreditation. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports Graduate Medical Education (GME) through programs like Children's Hospital GME and teaching health center GME. In FY2019, HRSA received appropriations for two GME-related programs, including grants for public institutions in states with provider shortages to expand GME. In FY2019, HRSA received $10 million to support the Rural Residency Development program, which funds rural training tracks for residency programs. This grant program provides start-up funds for entities to develop GME programs. In AY2016-2017, HRSA supported 2,098 primary care residents and 130 preventive medicine residents through programs that allow residency support. Additionally, residents may receive training in community-based settings through the AHEC Program or specialized training in geriatrics. The CHGME payment program, created in 1999 and reauthorized through FY2023, received $325 million in FY2019 to support 58 hospitals. The CHGME program received $325 million in FY2019 to provide financial support to 58 children's hospitals for training pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists. This program was created due to the lack of Medicare GME payments to children's hospitals, which hindered the development of the pediatric workforce. The CHGME program provides financial support to children's hospitals for training pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists. Advocates attribute the increase in the pediatric workforce to the program, while others argue that children's hospitals should be able to support training without subsidies. The program allocates funds for both DGME and IME payments, supporting 7,164 FTE residents during the 2016-2017 academic year. During the 2016-2017 academic year, the CHGME program supported 7,164 FTE residents, including general pediatric, pediatric subspecialty, surgical subspecialty, and pediatric dentistry residents. The program also funded adult medical and surgical specialty residents who train in children's hospitals. As the number of eligible training programs increases, the program may provide lower payment levels per resident unless funding is increased. The CHGME program funding increases, but HRSA cannot use it to influence pediatric trainee distribution. Recipients must report financial and programmatic data, including support from other sources to avoid duplicate payments. Program outcomes are tracked, such as trainees serving Medicaid patients. The 2013 program reauthorization allows HRSA to develop a quality bonus system for CHGME programs. Baseline data is being collected in FY2019 on resident involvement in hospital quality initiatives to establish standards for implementation in FY2021. HRSA administers the THCGME program to support training of primary care residents in outpatient facilities. Experts have raised concerns about physicians' preparedness to treat patients in outpatient settings. Under the THCGME program, HRSA provides funding to outpatient facilities like federal health centers to support residency training costs. The program began in FY2011 and has received funding from various laws, including the ACA and the Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018. The recent extension includes increased funding for training programs and trainees. The THCGME program receives funding from HRSA to support residency training costs at outpatient facilities. Funding amounts have varied over the years, with programs receiving $150,000 per FTE under the ACA and $95,000 per FTE under MACRA. The per resident funding level under BBA 2018 is not yet known, but a 2015 survey indicated that the cost of training a resident at a teaching health center was $157,602. The cost of training a resident at a teaching health center is $157,602, which is higher than in other programs due to smaller size and higher training costs in outpatient facilities. HRSA developed a cost reporting instrument with George Washington University to better reflect THCGME program costs. This instrument provides a more comprehensive accounting of costs and revenues generated by residents. The THCGME program collects data on residents and additional data collection requirements were included in the BBA 2018. The BBA 2018 mandated HRSA to report on the number of patients and visits by THC residents, as well as the outcomes of residents entering primary care practice. The HHS Secretary must submit a report on THC training costs to Congress by March 31, 2019. HRSA's data show that the THCGME program is successful in training residents for primary care practice at safety net facilities. The THCGME program trains residents for primary care practice at safety net facilities. 69% of graduates are practicing in primary care settings, with 55% in medically underserved or rural areas. The Department of Defense offers training programs with service obligations for medical students. The Department of Defense offers training programs for medical students with service obligations. Participants must serve a year of active duty for each year of benefits received, with a two-year minimum obligation. Most participants go on active duty and begin GME in military hospitals, while others are granted deferments for civilian GME. DOD administers residency programs at 26 DOD hospitals, training 1,455 FTE residents in over 100 specialties. Residents rotate between DOD and civilian teaching hospitals for training. The military services determine workforce requirements and coordinate with the DOD Comptroller for funding. The GME Program Office in the Army manages the tri-service GME database and coordinates annual selection boards. The Air Force determines training slots through the Air Force Health Professions Education. The Joint Services GME Selection Board selects trainees for all programs annually. The Air Force Health Professions Education Requirements Board (HPERB) determines specialty training slots annually based on expected attrition and healthcare workforce needs. Collaboration with other services is essential in developing training requests. The Navy Chief of the Navy Medical Corps decides on training slots and specialties during an annual meeting, with input from various stakeholders. Selections are made at the Joint Services Graduate Medical Education Selection Board (JSGMESB) annually. The annual Joint Services Graduate Medical Education Selection Board (JSGMESB) collaborates to ensure the integrity and quality of military GME programs. GME is funded through the annual DOD appropriation, with Congress allocating $692.6 million for FY2018. However, determining the actual cost of GME has been challenging due to data collection variances. The federal government funds various medical residency training programs operated by different departments, each with its own goals. These programs have not been examined together and may have conflicting or duplicative goals. For example, GAO reports found that CMS's GME programs do not align with workforce needs identified by HHS. The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) also examines GME policy. The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) highlighted the lack of alignment and transparency in GME programs. The 2018 GAO report found insufficient data collection in HHS and VA GME programs, leading to a call for a national strategic plan for GME. The GAO found that data collection for VA GME programs was done at the individual program level to determine hospital compliance with program statutes, but was not sufficient to determine program costs. Challenges in quantifying GME costs include faculty teaching salaries and cost variations between training sites. Despite these difficulties, GAO recommended better data collection for GME programs. HRSA THCGME supported the development of a data collection instrument to quantify teaching costs and revenue generated by residents. Overall, most programs can quantify training expenses but struggle with revenue generation data. Efforts to improve data collection are in early stages and lack coordination. CHGME program is collecting baseline data for quality measures. HRSA is seeking public comments on developing standards for residency program quality. Commenters note the absence of accepted measures for program quality assessment. The agency is working on collecting baseline data for measuring residency program quality, including detailed curriculum data and hospital quality initiatives involving residents. The National Academy of Medicine is also exploring ways to develop metrics for evaluating individual residency program outcomes, but participants acknowledge the challenges in developing and collecting these measures. The quality of care provided by graduates is influenced by their training in medical school, residency, or from peers. Research shows that residency training impacts care quality and costs. Limited data hinders policymakers from evaluating GME payments, with some suggesting that Medicare payments should be reduced. Some suggest reducing Medicare payments to address physician shortages, while others argue for expanding payments. Congress may use federal GME support to encourage training in specific specialties by amending payment allocation. Hospitals tend to expand residency training in profitable specialties. Recent research suggests that hospitals may find it more cost-effective to use resident services rather than hiring nonphysician providers. Congress could consider policy options to incentivize training in specific specialties, but past efforts have not always been successful due to the focus on initial specialty choice. Designing policies to influence the future workforce's specialty composition may be beneficial. Designing policies to impact the future workforce's specialty composition is challenging due to residents moving for further training, GME incentives given to hospitals, and changing specialty needs. Federal programs currently pay the same amount for residents across specialties, but speculation exists that training costs may vary by specialty or year. Factors affecting a hospital's cost of operating a residency program include program size, specialty, total number of programs, and availability/cost of alternative providers. Determining the costs of training residents is challenging, as federal GME program payments may not always adequately compensate hospitals. A 2018 report by the GAO found that measuring these costs was difficult and that current data collected were insufficient for comparison across GME programs. The data available are not enough to determine when scenarios of undercompensation or overcompensation occur, nor to identify factors affecting hospital costs. Better data on hospital training costs is needed to target federal GME support effectively. Congress could also consider policy options to influence the geographic distribution of residents, similar to past strategies like the ACA's redistribution of Medicare-funded residency slots. Implementing policies to achieve geographic distribution goals faces challenges, as changes typically target hospitals rather than residents themselves, which may not be effective in determining where residents ultimately choose to practice. The geographic distribution of residents is influenced by where they choose to practice, posing challenges for policies. Medicare GME funding is concentrated in northeastern states, with training locations remaining static despite uneven population growth. Successful policy options would need to address adding total residents to address this issue. Successful policy options for addressing the geographic distribution of residents would involve either increasing total residents or implementing a drawdown in support. Challenges in GME funding are not limited to Medicare, as other federal sources have limited data and lack flexibility in payment usage. Policymakers may benefit from examining these programs together to minimize duplication and maximize alignment.
