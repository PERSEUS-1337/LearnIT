    "content": "The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) was signed into law on December 13, 2016, by President Barack Obama. It consists of three divisions: Division A\u201421st Century Cures; Division B\u2014Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis; and Division C\u2014Increasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans. Division C primarily focuses on Medicare and includes a provision for the small-group market within the private health insurance market. Division C of the 21st Century Cures Act focuses on the small-group market within the private health insurance market and includes provisions related to Medicare Part A, Part B, Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (Prescription). Division C of the 21st Century Cures Act focuses on the small-group health insurance market and includes provisions related to Medicare Parts A, B, C (Medicare Advantage), and D (Prescription Drug Plan). The act also covers MA quality ratings, enrollment data, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, and payments to healthcare providers. The report summarizes each provision of the act by title and section, providing background information and discussions on each provision. Division C of the 21st Century Cures Act focuses on the small-group health insurance market and includes provisions related to Medicare Parts A, B, C (Medicare Advantage), and D (Prescription Drug Plan). The act also covers MA quality ratings, enrollment data, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, and payments to healthcare providers. The report discusses the differences in billing and reimbursement for hospital inpatient and outpatient services under Medicare, highlighting the use of ICD codes for inpatient services and HCPCS codes for outpatient services. Section 15001 of the 21st Century Cures Act requires the development of a crosswalk linking outpatient HCPCS codes to inpatient MS-DRGs for surgical procedures by January 1, 2018. The HHS Secretary must consult with MedPAC and make the crosswalk available to the public for free. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) reduces Medicare reimbursement to hospitals with high readmission rates for certain conditions. The current formula does not consider the impact of socioeconomic status on readmissions. MedPAC suggests evaluating hospitals based on the share of low-income patients served to address this issue. Section 15002 of the Social Security Act amends the HRRP to account for the proportion of low-income Medicare beneficiaries a hospital serves in determining penalties. The transitional methodology must be budget neutral and not impose additional reporting burden on hospitals. The HRRP methodology is being refined based on IMPACT Act information, with certain diagnosis codes considered for exclusion. Conditions related to transplants, ESRD, burns, trauma, psychosis, or substance abuse will be removed from HRRP. MedPAC is required to study the impact of outpatient and emergency services on readmissions by June 2018. The Rural Community Hospital demonstration, established by MMA and ACA, tests the feasibility of RCHs in states with low population densities for Medicare. The Rural Community Hospital (RCH) demonstration program was established to test the feasibility of RCHs in states with low population densities for Medicare hospital inpatient payment purposes. RCHs must meet specific criteria and are paid reasonable costs for providing Medicare-covered inpatient services. The program was extended for an additional five years and expanded to rural areas nationwide, with the HHS Secretary required to issue a solicitation for applications within 120 days of enactment. The Rural Community Hospital (RCH) demonstration program allows up to 30 hospitals to participate, with priority given to hospitals in states with low population densities. Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) treat patients discharged from acute-care hospitals who need prolonged inpatient care. Medicare reimburses LTCHs under the LTCH Prospective Payment System (LTCH PPS), which typically provides higher reimbursement rates than the IPPS. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided exceptions to the moratorium on new LTCH facilities and beds, with specific criteria for eligibility. The moratorium was reinstated in 2013 without exceptions. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 reinstated exceptions for new LTCH facilities but not for new LTCH beds. Section 15004 amends various sections to reinstate the exception to the moratorium on the expansion of LTCH beds, effective from April 1, 2014. This includes a reduction in LTCH PPS outlier payments starting October 1, 2017, with an exception for site neutral case outlier payments. The TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007, as amended by subsequent acts, adjusted hospital IPPS rates for FY2018 through FY2023. MACRA replaced the one-time 2018 payment increase with a phased-in increase of 0.5% per year. Section 15005 reduced the MACRA annual update to 0.4588% for FY2018. LTCHs can be freestanding, colocated with another hospital, or a satellite facility. CMS implemented a payment regulation in FY2005 to limit patient shifting based on financial reasons. In FY2008, the 25% patient threshold adjustment policy was expanded to include all LTCHs. Section 15006 amends MMSEA Section 114(c) to reinstate the delay of CMS's implementation of the 25% patient threshold adjustment for LTCHs from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017. LTCHs must maintain a Medicare inpatient average length of stay of greater than 25 days to receive reimbursement under the LTCH PPS. Section 15007 allows all LTCHs to exclude cases reimbursed under MA and those subject to the LTCH site neutral policy from the ALOS calculation, regardless of classification date. The majority of LTCHs have an ALOS greater than 25 days. In 1997, a second LTCH category was recognized for hospitals meeting specific criteria, including a focus on palliative care for end-stage cancer patients. Congress required the HHS Secretary to evaluate payment levels for these hospitals and adjust rates accordingly. CMS implemented a unique payment methodology for subclause (II) LTCHs in response to inadequate payments. Section 15008 redesignated the former subclause (II) hospital category as clause (vi), removing the LTCH designation. This change does not alter the payment methodology for these hospitals. The provision changes the statutory treatment of clause (vi) hospitals, removing them from the LTCH PPS methodology. Claims from these hospitals will now be reimbursed on a reasonable-cost basis. LTCHs are now eligible for full payment under the LTCH PPS only if specific clinical criteria are met. LTCH discharges must meet specific clinical criteria to qualify for full payment under the LTCH PPS. Discharges related to psychiatric issues or rehabilitation do not qualify. For those that do not meet the criteria, a site neutral payment rate will be phased in, similar to hospital reimbursement. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 amended the law to provide temporary clinical criteria for LTCH payment under the LTCH PPS. LTCHs receive a blended payment amount for discharges in FY2016 and FY2017, and a site neutral payment rate for FY2018 and subsequent years. An LTCH is entitled to full LTCH PPS if certain conditions are met for discharges before January 1, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 amended the law to provide temporary clinical criteria for LTCH payment under the LTCH PPS. For discharges occurring in cost-reporting periods beginning during FY2018 and FY2019, an LTCH will be paid under the LTCH PPS if specific requirements are met, including being a not-for-profit LTCH on June 1, 2014, and having a certain percentage of discharges classified under specific LTCH diagnosis related groups. Section 15009 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 requires LTCHs to discharge patients from at least 20 states based on residency. The HHS Secretary has the authority to implement this requirement. A study by the U.S. Comptroller General must analyze Medicare payment rates, the number of beneficiaries with specific conditions, and the impact of state licensure rules on LTCHs. Section 15010 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 reinstates clinical criteria for LTCH PPS payment for severe wounds, with modifications. LTCHs meeting specific criteria can receive payment for discharges related to cellulitis or osteomyelitis in FY2018. The criteria for severe wounds differ from those in CAA 2016, requiring LTCHs to be grandfathered and colocated with another hospital. Section 15010 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 broadens the criteria for LTCH PPS payment for severe wounds, requiring a diagnosis of cellulitis or osteomyelitis. The Comptroller General is mandated to conduct a study on Medicare beneficiaries' specialized wound care needs and costs, reporting to Congress by October 1, 2020. The study will address access to care, the impact of Medicare LTCH site neutral payment provisions on care quality and cost, and appropriate payment methods. MedPAC has recommended Medicare implement site neutral policies to equalize outpatient payment rates at hospitals and freestanding physician offices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 codified the CMS definition of provider-based off-campus hospital outpatient departments. The CMS defines provider-based off-campus hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) as departments not on the hospital campus or within 250 yards of a remote hospital location. New PBD HOPDs, not billing as hospital departments before November 2, 2015, are paid under the ASC payment system or MPFS instead of OPPS since January 1, 2017. Section 16001 allows certain new PBD HOPDs to be paid under OPPS from 2017 onwards if criteria are met. Existing PBD HOPDs can continue receiving OPPS payments. The off-campus HOPD was deemed part of a hospital in 2015 and will be paid under the OPPS from January 1, 2017. \"Mid-build\" PBD HOPDs with construction agreements before November 2, 2015, are exempt from BBA 2015 modifications. Attestations must be submitted by December 31, 2016, with audits by December 31, 2018. $10 million from the Federal SMI Trust Fund will support this change until December 31, 2018. BBA 2015 Section 603 exempts eleven cancer hospitals from Medicare inpatient PPS. PCHs receive Medicare payments based on reported costs with potential add-on payments. BBA 1997 ensures PCH HOPDs are paid no less than pre-OPPS implementation. BBA 2015 Section 603 does not exempt cancer hospitals. Section 16002 excludes PCH OPDs from BBA 2015 modifications for services in 2017 and beyond. PCHs must notify HHS Secretary if their outpatient departments meet HOPD requirements. Beginning on January 1, 2018, outpatient departments at PCHs must notify the HHS Secretary if they meet HOPD requirements. The HHS Secretary will use a target PCR 1.0 percentage point less than usual for payment adjustments at PCHs. An additional reduction to the PCR may be considered for off-campus outpatient departments. $2 million will be allocated from the Federal SMI Trust Fund to implement these changes, effective as if included in the enactment of BBA 2015 Section 603. The HITECH Act, part of ARRA, authorized incentive payments for adopting electronic health record technology. Eligible hospitals and physicians can receive payments for meaningful use of certified technology. Medicare incentive payments for physicians demonstrating meaningful use ended in 2016, with penalties for non-compliance starting in 2015. Physicians who operate in ASCs are still eligible professionals subject to meaningful use requirements. For those who see patients in multiple locations, at least 50% of patient encounters must occur at locations with CEHRT to be considered meaningful EHR users. Physicians practicing at ASCs have expressed concerns about meeting this threshold due to lack of control over CEHRT availability. Hardship exceptions are available for those unable to meet the 50% patient threshold. Physicians concerned about meeting EHR requirements due to CEHRT availability can apply for a hardship exception annually through 2018. MACRA sunset the Medicare EHR payment adjustment in 2018 and introduced MIPS, which will adjust payments based on EHR-related measures starting in 2019. MIPS data collection on ACI measures begins in 2017, with performance scores reported back to physicians in 2018. MIPS adjustments to Medicare payments will not apply until 2019. In implementing MIPS, CMS noted commenters' concerns about hardships for clinicians in multiple locations due to CEHRT availability. CMS finalized fewer required measures for the advancing care information category, making additional exclusions unnecessary. Section 16003 excludes physicians from the Medicare meaningful use payment adjustment in 2017 and 2018 if most services are provided in an ASC, determined by site of service or attestation. The exclusion from the Medicare meaningful use payment adjustment for physicians in 2017 and 2018 is determined by site of service or attestation, as defined by the HHS Secretary. The exclusion will end when certified EHR technology for ASC settings is available, as determined by the HHS Secretary through rulemaking. CMS had previously required direct physician supervision for outpatient therapeutic services in hospital outpatient departments, but a moratorium was placed on enforcement for CAHs and small rural hospitals in CY2010 and CY2011. The moratorium on enforcement of direct supervision of outpatient therapeutic services in CAHs and small rural hospitals was extended through CY2016, with further extensions through CY2015. MedPAC is required to report on the impact of the moratorium on access to healthcare, economic impact, staffing needs, and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare covers durable medical equipment (DME) based on competitive bidding or fee schedules. Competitive bidding areas determine payments for selected items, while outside areas use statutorily specified formulas. Not all DME items are competitively bid, resulting in lower costs. The fee schedules for DME are adjusted based on competitive bidding information, resulting in lower payments. Certain items like Group 3 complex rehabilitative power wheelchairs were excluded from competitive bidding, while Group 2 chairs were competitively bid. The difference between the two groups lies in the number of power accessories and chair performance. The HHS Secretary published final regulations in 2014 to adjust the fees. The HHS Secretary published final regulations in 2014 to adjust fee schedule payments for wheelchair accessories based on competitive bidding information. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act delayed the use of competitive bidding information for Group 3 power wheelchairs until July 1, 2017. Physicians can retain substitute physicians for temporary absences from their practices, billing Medicare for their services starting in 1995. Locum tenens physicians are independent contractors paid a fixed amount per diem. Section 16006 of P.L. 114-255 allows physical therapists in designated shortage areas to use locum tenens arrangements for payment purposes, similar to physicians. Medicare pays for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies based on fee schedules or competitive bidding. The ACA required the HHS Secretary to expand competitive bidding or adjust fee schedule amounts. The final rule established a methodology phased in from January 1, 2016, with 50% payment based on the new adjusted fee schedule. The ACA required the HHS Secretary to adjust fee schedule amounts for Medicare payments for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. The transition to the adjusted fee schedule amounts was extended by six months, with payments based on the new methodology for items and services furnished from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. The impact of these payment adjustments on suppliers and equipment availability to beneficiaries during CY2016 is also being examined. The ACA required the HHS Secretary to adjust fee schedule amounts for Medicare payments for durable medical equipment. The transition to the adjusted fee schedule amounts was extended by six months, with payments based on the new methodology for items and services furnished from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. The impact of these payment adjustments on suppliers and equipment availability to beneficiaries during CY2016 is also being examined. The HHS Secretary is to submit a report on the findings to Congress by January 12, 2017. The HHS Secretary requested comments on factors to consider when developing a methodology for adjusting fee schedule amounts for Medicare payments for durable medical equipment. Comments were sought on whether costs vary by geography, market size, or delivery distance, and alternative information to determine relative costs. The final rule, published on November 6, 2014, indicated that there was no direct evidence that costs in rural areas are higher than in urban areas or vice versa. The regulation sets adjustments to fee schedule amounts based on regional averages with a national average ceiling and floor. Rural areas cannot have payments adjusted below 110% of the national average. Stakeholder input is required for fee schedule rate adjustments outside competitive bidding areas. The HHS Secretary must consider the highest bid amount in competitive bidding areas and compare various factors. The regulation sets adjustments to fee schedule amounts based on regional averages with a national average ceiling and floor. Rural areas cannot have payments adjusted below 110% of the national average. Stakeholder input is required for fee schedule rate adjustments outside competitive bidding areas. The HHS Secretary must consider the highest bid amount in competitive bidding areas and compare various factors such as average travel distance, volume of items and services furnished, and number of suppliers. Medicare Advantage (MA) pays private health plans a per-enrollee amount to provide Medicare-covered benefits, with bonus payments for high-performing organizations based on a five-star quality rating system. The IMPACT Act required the HHS Secretary to study the impact of Medicare beneficiaries' socioeconomic status on quality measures and resource use. The Social Security Act allows the HHS Secretary to terminate contracts with MA organizations or PDPs for various reasons. CMS amended its regulations in 2012. CMS amended its regulations in 2012 to include a ground for contract termination related to an MA organization's or a PDP's rating under the five-star system. Contracts may be terminated if the plan receives a rating of less than 3 stars for 3 consecutive years. Congress intends to study the effects of socioeconomic status and dual-eligible populations on the rating system before making reforms. Section 17001 of P.L. 114-255 delays CMS's authority to terminate MA organizations' contracts based on low quality ratings until the end of plan year 2018. This provision also applies to PDPs, preventing contract termination for failing to achieve a minimum quality rating. CMS provides Medicare enrollment data, with no statutory requirement to do so. Section 17002 mandates the HHS Secretary to submit this data. Section 17002 of P.L. 114-255 requires the HHS Secretary to submit Medicare enrollment data annually, starting in 2016. This data includes enrollment figures for FFS Medicare, MA, and Part D at state and congressional district levels. Individuals receiving Social Security benefits are automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, receiving a \"Welcome to Medicare\" package three months before eligibility. The booklet Form CMS-1966 provides an overview of Medicare and key decisions for new beneficiaries, such as choosing Part B coverage, original Medicare, MA plan, PDP, or Medigap. Section 17003 mandates the HHS Secretary to update the Welcome to Medicare package based on stakeholder input within 12 months. The HHS Secretary can impose temporary moratoriums on new Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP FFS providers and suppliers to address fraud, waste, or abuse. This authority allows for numerical caps or limits on enrollment, with state Medicaid programs also having the ability to impose moratoriums. The Secretary must specify the type of providers affected or the geographic area impacted. The HHS Secretary can impose temporary moratoriums on new Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP FFS providers and suppliers to address fraud, waste, or abuse. Before initiating a moratorium, consultation with affected state Medicaid programs is required. States can determine if a moratorium would reduce access to care and must notify the HHS Secretary in writing. Moratoriums can be imposed for six months initially and extended in six-month increments. Compliance with moratoriums is required by state Medicaid and CHIP programs. Beginning October 1, 2017, the HHS Secretary can prohibit payment for services by Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP providers under temporary new provider enrollment moratoria. Providers must be enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP and in the same geographic area and category as those in the moratorium. Section 17004 also prohibits federal matching payments to states for services provided by providers under a temporary new provider moratorium. Providers and suppliers under a temporary new provider enrollment moratorium and payment prohibition cannot charge Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP beneficiaries for restricted items or services. The HHS Secretary can exempt state Medicaid programs from the moratorium to ensure access to services. States must amend their plans to comply with the payment prohibition. During specified special election periods, Medicare Advantage enrollees can disenroll from their plans within the first 45 days of the year and switch to Parts A and B or enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan. Additionally, MA enrollees have the option to discontinue or change their MA enrollment during other special election periods, such as for individuals who first become eligible for Part A at age 65 and immediately enroll in an MA plan. Starting in 2019, Medicare Advantage enrollees have a continuous open enrollment and disenrollment period during the first three months of each year. This allows them to switch to a different MA plan or return to Parts A and B. Individuals who enroll in an MA plan when first becoming eligible for Medicare also have a three-month window to make changes. Marketing materials cannot be sent to individuals during this period. \"Section 17005 prohibits marketing materials from being sent to individuals during the continuous open enrollment and disenrollment period for Medicare Advantage plans. Eligibility for an MA plan requires being eligible for Part A, enrolled in Part B, and not having ESRD. MA plans receive a capitated monthly payment based on benchmarks determined by a statutory formula. Benchmarks are influenced by per capita spending in Parts A and B, adjusted for quality ratings. Payments to MA plans are risk-adjusted for demographics.\" The risk-adjustment model used to adjust Medicare Advantage (MA) payments considers demographics, health histories, and whether beneficiaries are dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Dual-eligible beneficiaries can be full-benefit or partial, with different levels of benefits. Prior to 2017, the risk-adjustment model did not differentiate between full-benefit and partial dual-eligible beneficiaries. The risk-adjustment model for Medicare Advantage payments was updated in 2017 to distinguish between full-benefit and partial dual-eligible beneficiaries. The new model included six separate models for different beneficiary groups, resulting in more accurate cost estimates. However, MA plans with a higher proportion of partial dual-eligible beneficiaries would receive lower payments. Additionally, starting in 2021, beneficiaries with ESRD can enroll in MA plans. The HHS Secretary is required to adjust benchmarks for MA plans starting in 2021 to exclude the cost of organ acquisition for kidney transplants covered under Medicare. Costs for kidney acquisition for MA enrollees will be payable under Parts A and B. The HHS Secretary must evaluate if the MA five-star quality rating system should include a measure for ESRD care and report to Congress on the impact of these provisions on spending and beneficiary numbers. The HHS Secretary is required to make changes to risk adjustment for MA plans, considering the number of diseases or conditions of enrollees. Separate adjustments are to be made for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Additionally, a report on spending and beneficiary numbers related to ESRD care must be submitted by December 31, 2023. The HHS Secretary must evaluate the impact of new diagnosis codes for mental health and substance-use disorders in the risk-adjustment model. They also need to assess the inclusion of chronic kidney disease severity and other ESRD factors. Changes to risk adjustment must be phased in over three years, starting in 2019 and fully implemented by 2022. MedPAC is required to evaluate the impact of these changes on risk scores for MA enrollees and payments to plans. The MedPAC report on risk scores for MA enrollees and payments to plans, including the impact on accuracy, is due by July 1, 2020. The HHS Secretary must submit a report on the risk-adjustment model for MA every three years, with revisions and impact on predictive ratios, by December 31, 2018. The comptroller general is required to conduct a study on measuring functional status in MA plans for improved risk adjustment by June 30, 2018. The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) under the ACA promotes accountability for patient populations and coordinates services for high-quality care. Starting January 1, 2019, changes will be made to how Medicare beneficiaries are assigned to MSSP ACOs based on primary care services provided by physicians, practitioners, federally qualified health centers, or rural health clinics. Starting January 1, 2019, Medicare beneficiaries will be assigned to MSSP ACOs based on primary care services provided by federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics. Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) are employer-funded arrangements that reimburse employees for medical care expenses, with contributions determined by employers. HRAs can only be used for substantiated medical care expenses and are tax-exempt if they meet specified requirements. Eligible participants include current, former, and retired employees, as well as their spouses and dependents. Medical care expenses covered by HRAs include diagnosis, cure, treatment, prevention of disease, transportation, lodging, health insurance premiums, and long-term care costs. If HRA distributions are used for non-medical expenses, all distributions in that tax year are taxable. Integration with another group health plan is generally required for HRA compliance. An HRA must be integrated with a non-HRA group health plan to comply with two requirements: no annual limits on covered health benefits and coverage for preventive services without cost sharing. Noncompliant arrangements could result in a $100 per day per employee excise tax. The guidance specifically addresses HRAs reimbursing employees for individual health insurance coverage. The guidance issued in September 2013 prohibits HRAs from being used to pay for health insurance in the individual market. Transition relief was provided for small employers until June 30, 2015. Section 18001(a)(1) creates qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (SEHRAs). A SEHRA is an arrangement offered by an eligible employer that reimburses employees for medical expenses up to $4,950 for self-only coverage or $10,000 for family coverage annually. Employees cannot contribute to a SEHRA directly. The maximum benefit an employee can receive is called the permitted benefit, and all eligible employees must be offered the SEHRA on the same terms. Variations in benefits based on age and family size are allowed. SEHRAs allow eligible employers to offer reimbursement for medical expenses up to certain limits, with variations for age and family size in insurance policies. Eligible employees can include family members, and SEHRAs are exempt from group health plan requirements. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are eligible to offer SEHRAs. SEHRAs allow employers with fewer than 50 employees to offer reimbursement for medical expenses. Employers must provide written notification to employees 90 days before offering SEHRAs, including details on the permitted benefit, advising employees to provide information when applying for premium tax credits, and warning about penalties for not having minimum essential coverage. SEHRAs allow employers to offer reimbursements for medical expenses. Employers must provide written notification to employees before offering SEHRAs, including details on benefits and penalties for not having minimum essential coverage. Reimbursements from SEHRA are tax-exempt if used for medical expenses while covered by minimum essential coverage. Failure to provide notification incurs a fine of $50 per employee per failure, up to $2,500 per year. SEHRAs allow employers to offer reimbursements for medical expenses. Employees may not be eligible for a premium tax credit if their SEHRA provides affordable coverage. If the SEHRA is not affordable, the employee may qualify for a reduced credit amount based on their household income. SEHRAs are included in the definition of group health plans for the excise tax calculation. Employers must report SEHRA benefits on W-2 forms. Amendments are effective after December 31, 2016, with transition relief for small employers. SEHRAs are generally exempt from ERISA and PHSA regulations. The amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) exempt SEHRAs from the definition of group health plans, effective for plan years starting after December 31, 2016.
