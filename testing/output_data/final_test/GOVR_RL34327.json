Bush introduced the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in Krakow, Poland on May 31, 2003, as a new approach to interdiction cooperation outside of traditional treaties. The initiative aimed to prevent the movement of WMD materials to hostile states and terrorist organizations, addressing legal gaps highlighted by the incomplete interdiction of the So San, a North Korean-flagged ship carrying Scud missile parts to Yemen in December 2002. The North Korean-flagged ship carrying Scud missile parts to Yemen in December 2002 was interdicted by a Spanish warship after a tip from American intelligence. Inspectors found 15 complete Scud-like missiles, warheads, and missile fuel oxidizer hidden on board. The ship was released as U.S. and Spanish authorities had no legal basis to seize the cargo. Yemen claimed ownership of the missiles and promised not to retransfer or purchase additional missiles from North Korea. This incident was an impetus for the formation of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to improve interdiction cooperation. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) was initially formed by the United States to improve cooperation in interdicting shipments of WMD and related materials. The initiative now includes 105 countries and the Holy See, with participation requirements kept general due to early international resistance. States are encouraged to publicly endorse the initiative's principles. Some states are encouraged to commit to endorsing the Statement of Principles, review and strengthen legal authorities, identify national assets for PSI efforts, provide interdiction points of contact, participate in training exercises and operations, and consider signing agreements for cooperation. China, Pakistan, and South Africa are not part of the initiative, while other countries may participate indirectly in interdictions or information exchange. India has attended PSI exercises. PSI participants attend exercises as observers, with India and Taiwan involved in WMD interdictions. PSI lacks a formal structure but holds high-level meetings and exercises. An Operational Experts Group coordinates discussions and future exercises among 21 PSI states. The current setup does not legally bind participants, leading to questions about sustainability. The U.S. delegation to PSI OEG meetings is led by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction. Ship-boarding agreements with \"flags of convenience\" countries are crucial for successful implementation. The United States has signed 11 such agreements to date. Flag of convenience (FOC) ships raise proliferation concerns due to lax government regulations. Flags of convenience (FOC) ships are a concern for proliferation due to loose government regulations and the ease of switching registries. Thirty-five countries have FOC registries, with Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands being the top three by tonnage. A 2012 study found that FOC ships accounted for over 70% of reported destabilizing transfers by sea. The top five countries with Flags of Convenience (FOC) registries are Panama, Liberia, Belize, Malta, and Honduras, all of which are participants in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The PSI's mission is to interdict shipments, disrupt proliferation networks, and create partnerships to counter WMD and missile-related technology trade. It functions as an activity, not an organization, aiming to strengthen national capacities through legal, diplomatic, economic, military, and other means. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to interdict WMD shipments using various tools. Success is measured by the number of interdictions, with 11 reported in nine months and over 30 shipments interdicted. Under Secretary Joseph highlighted PSI's role in preventing transfers to WMD programs. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) has played a key role in interdicting over 30 shipments, preventing transfers to Iran's missile and nuclear programs. However, the extent of PSI's contribution to these interdictions is unclear, and the increase in interdictions may be due to other factors. Recent PSI meetings focus on capacity-building, best practices, and interagency cooperation to improve interdiction efforts. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to improve interdiction efforts by reviewing national legal authorities, considering consent for boarding and searching vessels, establishing advance agreements with other states, and participating in joint interdiction exercises. The focus is on stopping suspected transport of WMD or related items through various means, including seizing cargos in ports and strengthening domestic laws. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) focuses on strengthening domestic laws and interdicting suspected transport of WMD or related items. However, the PSI framework only applies to commercial, not government, transportation, creating a key gap. This was highlighted by the inability to intercept missile shipments picked up by a Pakistani C-130 in North Korea in 2002. The need for multilateral cooperation was illustrated by the interdiction of uranium centrifuge enrichment parts from Malaysia to Libya in 2003. The BBC China ship passed through the Suez Canal and was diverted to the Italian port of Taranto for a search. The PSI aims to disrupt WMD trafficking at sea, air, and land, with exercises held to practice interdictions. President Bush proposed expanding PSI to include shutting down facilities and freezing assets. The PSI focuses on disrupting WMD trafficking by targeting shipments to states like Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist acquisitions. Efforts also include targeting proliferation finance through closer ties with the business community and introducing industry representatives to PSI goals. In June 2011, PSI participants introduced the concept of Critical Capabilities and Practices (CCP) to identify and share tools and resources. The Operational Expert Group countries discussed sharing tools and resources to support interdiction activities and emphasized the importance of using PSI and other cooperative means to prevent WMD technology transfer to North Korea. They also addressed challenges of intangible technology transfer, non-state actors acquiring WMD, and preventing proliferation finance as part of a nonproliferation strategy. PSI members issued a Joint Statement supporting U.N. Security Resolutions 2375 and 2397 to prevent proliferation to and from North Korea. U.S. officials highlighted that PSI actions, such as ship boarding and seizures, would be implemented. The PSI actions, including ship boarding and seizures, will be conducted in accordance with national legal authorities and international law. There are differing opinions on expanding international legal authority for interdictions on the high seas and in international airspace. U.N. Security Council resolutions can authorize interdiction activities under Section VII of the U.N. Charter. The 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) requires states to criminalize transportation of WMD materials and their delivery vehicles. The United States Senate ratified the 2005 SUA Protocol in 2008, and the State Department has stated that participating in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) helps states comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. Council Resolution 1540, passed in April 2004, requires states to establish and enforce domestic controls over WMD materials and develop export controls. While the resolution did not mention interdiction explicitly, U.N. Security Council 1874 establishes procedures for interdicting WMD and weapons to or from North Korea. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) assists in coordinating interdiction of WMD and weapons to or from North Korea. The Law of the Sea Convention is supported by the Pentagon to enhance PSI efforts, as it codifies navigation rights essential for global mobility of armed forces. Senior military officials argue that not being a party to the Convention hinders recruitment of new PSI participants. In April 2008, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Patrick Walsh expressed concerns about the limitations of not being a party to the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) during a Senate hearing. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed the treaty in June 2012, but no further action has been taken. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires the President to include PSI activities in the budget request and submit joint DOD-DOS reports to Congress. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandates detailed three-year plans for PSI activities to be submitted to Congress annually. It suggests expanding PSI by utilizing NATO resources, involving non-NATO countries, and encouraging Russia and China to participate. There is bipartisan support for strengthening and expanding PSI, with critics calling for increased transparency, more participants, and better coordination. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing PSI's membership and emphasizing coordination. Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Richard Lugar emphasized the need for a coordinated effort to improve the capabilities of foreign partners in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended better organization and management within the Departments of Defense and State, including clear roles, communication mechanisms, and strategies to work with PSI-participating countries. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to resolve interdiction issues and enhance coordination among participating countries. Recommendations endorsed by Congress in 2007 were not fully implemented by the Bush Administration, as reported by the GAO in 2008. The Obama Administration expressed interest in institutionalizing PSI. The Obama Administration aims to institutionalize the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) by following mandates from the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The GAO highlighted the need for more steps to meet reporting requirements and improve effectiveness. Geographic expansion, particularly engaging China and India, remains a key issue. Congress may need to assess intelligence resources, sharing requirements with non-NATO allies, and coordination with other interdiction-related programs. Absence of a measurement method complicates congressional oversight of PSI. The absence of a way to measure PSI's success complicates congressional oversight. Funding for PSI activities is integrated into other programs addressing WMD proliferation, with the Department of Defense providing some dedicated expense breakdowns in its annual report. However, other DOD programs also contribute to PSI efforts, making it challenging to track specific PSI-related activities. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act allocated $4 million for the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) from the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program funds. The State Department's Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR) account also funds PSI-related activities, including multinational exercises and staff travel. The FBI, DHS's Customs and Border Patrol, and the Department of Energy contribute to PSI efforts through various funding sources. On October 1, 2007, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations received the Protocol of 2005 to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation for consideration. The protocol, signed by the United States on February 17, 2006, provides a legal basis for interdiction at sea of weapons of mass destruction. The committee unanimously advised and consented to the Protocol on July 29, 2008, and the full Senate approved it on September 25, 2008. Congress would need to approve implementing legislation for ratification to be finalized. On June 6, 2012, the House Judiciary Committee reported out the Nuclear Terrorism Conventions Implementation and Safety of Maritime Navigation Act of 2012 (H.R. 5889), which includes implementing legislation for the SUA Protocol. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended advice and consent for U.S. adherence to the Law of the Sea Convention on October 31, 2007. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that joining the convention would likely strengthen the PSI by attracting new cooperative partners. The Law of the Sea Convention would enhance the Proliferation Security Initiative and expand interdiction authorities at sea, allowing the U.S. to continue conducting maritime interdiction operations. Top military officers testified in support of the treaty, while critics argue against non-related provisions and the necessity of adherence. Some members of Congress support the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) through legislation, recognizing its role in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced bills in the 111th Congress that highlighted PSI's effectiveness and called for cooperation from Western Hemisphere countries. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 (H.R. 2410) and the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-195) promote the expansion of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and encourage countries to participate in PSI for nonproliferation efforts. The PSI is praised for its success in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction through flexible consensus among like-minded countries. The FY2013 Foreign Relations Authorization Act (H.R. 2583) emphasizes the importance of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in preventing Iran and other rogue states from acquiring nuclear weapons and other dangerous materials. It authorizes the President to enforce U.S. laws and agreements by utilizing PSI and ship-boarding agreements with other countries. The FY2017 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (S.3117) amended the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to require more frequent reports on proliferation interdiction efforts. It also allocated funds for programs to increase international participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative. The FY2017 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act amended the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to require more frequent reports on proliferation interdiction efforts. The Secretary of State must submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations within 45 days detailing steps to implement the requirements."
