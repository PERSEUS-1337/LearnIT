    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Any TARP Extension Act of 2009\". The Congress established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) with $700 billion to purchase toxic assets from banks. The Secretary of the Treasury changed the program's purpose to inject capital into financial institutions instead of buying toxic assets, leading to no significant increase in lending. The Capital Purchase Program funds increased by $250 billion under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Recipients now face additional restrictions on accepting the funds. Some banks want to return the funds, and Congress should have a say in how returned funds are spent in the future. The Troubled Assets Relief Program funds are being returned, and there are discussions on how to spend them. SEC. 3. REPEAL OF TARP EXTENSION AUTHORITY. Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to repeal TARP extension authority. SEC. 4. DEBT REDUCTION. Subsection (d) of section 106 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to require the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit remaining funds in the Public Debt Reduction Payment Account within 30 days of enactment. Additionally, any amounts received for repayment of financial assistance or interest on such assistance must also be deposited in the account. The Capital Purchase Program revenues and proceeds from troubled assets sales are deposited into the Public Debt Reduction Payment Account as per the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Establishment of Public Debt Reduction Payment Account. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay, redeem, or buy government obligations held by the public. Amounts deposited in the account are appropriated solely for this purpose. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is established to deposit funds received by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will implement necessary actions in accordance with debt management policies. Reducing debt under this section will not interfere with the Treasury's debt management goals. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account, established under section 3114 of title 31, United States Code, allows for the reduction of the statutory limit on public debt. Receipts and disbursements from this account are not considered new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit/surplus for budgetary purposes. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is being removed from budget pronouncements. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is excluded from budget statements and will be presented separately in budget documents."
