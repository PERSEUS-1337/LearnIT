    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that freedom of speech and the press, protected by the first amendment, are essential for the public to obtain information about the government to make informed judgments on important issues. The first amendment protects the right of the news media to gather and disseminate information for the public. The public's right to petition the government for grievances also relies on access to information about government affairs. In the twenty-first century, people in the United States rely on print and electronic media for information on judicial matters. Television offers a closer look at courtroom proceedings than newspapers or still photography, enhancing public access to the Federal judiciary. Providing statutory authority for televised coverage would further increase this access. The first amendment prevents Congress from limiting freedom of speech, press, and petitioning the Government. Granting authority would help implement public trials as guaranteed by the sixth amendment. The guarantee of public trials serves as a safeguard against judicial abuse, ensuring that every criminal trial is subject to public scrutiny. SEC. 2. AUTHORITY OF PRESIDING JUDGE TO ALLOW MEDIA COVERAGE OF COURT PROCEEDINGS. The presiding judge of appellate and district courts in the United States may allow photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising of court proceedings at their discretion. Witnesses in trial proceedings can request to have their faces and voices disguised or obscured. The Judicial Conference of the United States can create guidelines for judges to follow when deciding on the management of photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising court proceedings. Witnesses who are not parties have the right to request their image and voice be obscured during testimony. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"presiding judge\" refers to the judge overseeing the court proceeding, with the senior active judge taking precedence in multiple judge scenarios. The Chief Justice presides in en banc sittings of the Supreme Court of the United States. The term \"appellate court of the United States\" includes United States circuit courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. The authority under section 2(b) will end 3 years after the enactment of this Act."
