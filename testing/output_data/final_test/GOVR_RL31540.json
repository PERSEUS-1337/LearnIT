    "content": "Second chance homes, also known as maternity group homes, provide a safe environment for unwed teenage mothers and their children. These homes help teens become self-sufficient, develop job skills, learn parenting skills, access child care, and plan for the future. The concept of SCHs gained renewed interest in 1995 during the welfare reform debate, leading to the creation of the state block grant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in 1996. Legislation has been introduced in the 109th Congress to further support these homes. In the 109th Congress, legislation has been introduced to authorize funding for maternity group homes through the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) Transitional Living Program. Second chance homes provide housing and services for teen mothers, funded through TANF and other programs. Evaluations of the effectiveness of these homes are also discussed. Second chance homes provide housing and services for teen mothers and their children who cannot live at home due to abuse, neglect, or other extenuating circumstances. These homes aim to promote long-term economic independence and the well-being of the residents by teaching parenting skills, child development, family budgeting, health, and nutrition. The distinction between a second chance home and a maternity home is not clearly defined in the TANF law, but state welfare agencies are required to assist unwed teen mothers in finding appropriate housing. Second chance homes are nonprofit institutions that provide refuge and support for vulnerable teen mothers and their children. These homes aim to help young mothers become self-sufficient by completing high school, developing job skills, and learning to care for their child. They also offer access to childcare and guidance for future planning. Criteria for these homes include serving parenting teens and being residential. Second chance homes offer a stable, nurturing environment for teen mothers and their children, providing access to childcare, education, job training, counseling, and parenting advice. These homes can be individually operated or funded by agencies, churches, or nonprofit organizations. States have supported community-based or faith-based programs to create and operate second chance homes using TANF or state funds. Second chance homes were established in the mid-1880s by Charles Crittenton to provide support for unwed teenage mothers through private maternity homes. These homes aimed to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies through moral and religious instruction. In the 19th century, private maternity homes like Florence Crittenton provided support for unwed mothers, offering medical services, nutritional support, and assistance with adoptions. The average stay was 20 months, with 60% of mothers choosing adoption. Federal funding for unwed mothers was established in 1935 with the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. The AFDC program led to the decline of local maternity homes as cash aid was provided to unwed mothers to care for children at home. By 1980, maternity homes were considered obsolete due to changing social attitudes. In the mid-1990s, there were 215 maternity homes nationwide. In 1995, the Senate supported the SCH concept, allocating $150 million over six years for community-based homes for teen mothers under 18. The SCH concept provided funding for community-based homes for teen mothers under 18, requiring them to live with their children under adult supervision to receive welfare. Despite being included in welfare reform bills vetoed by President Clinton, the concept gained support and interest. The welfare reform bill in 1996 established block grants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, allowing funds to be used for second chance homes at state discretion. The concept of second chance homes for unmarried teen parents under 18 gained renewed interest due to factors such as decreased state welfare caseloads, surplus funds, and President George W. Bush's support for compassionate conservatism. These homes provide secure and stable housing for young teen mothers who cannot live at home due to extenuating circumstances. Second chance homes are a key aspect of compassionate conservatism, with providers setting goals such as safety and education for teen mothers. Massachusetts focused on safety, establishing 27 homes for unwed teen mothers, while New Mexico prioritized education to help mothers complete high school and pursue college. Short- and long-term goals are important for the success of second chance homes. Second chance homes aim to support teen mothers by emphasizing the importance of protecting children, reuniting families, building self-esteem, suggesting alternatives to abortion, and keeping mothers united with their children. Many teen mothers in these homes have faced troubled lives, including poverty, abuse, neglect, and drug use. Adjusting to the structured environment of a second chance home can be challenging for these mothers, as it may be their first experience with strict rules and expectations. Second chance homes have strict rules and expectations for teen mothers. Not all homes can serve teen mothers under age 14, as they may be better suited for foster care. Providers must decide on age range, time limits, services for teen fathers, and custody issues for residents. Some second chance homes have strict criteria for teen mothers, with age limits ranging from 12 to 29. Providers may have time limits for stay, such as until the mother completes high school or the child turns three. Some second chance homes have time limits for stay, such as until the mother completes high school or the child turns three. HHS reports that providers involve fathers in obtaining services for parenting and employment skills. SPAN Second Chance Homes National Directory lists 54 homes for teen fathers, breaking the cycle of poverty and abuse for teen mothers. Several states have established second chance homes using their own funding or TANF funds, contracting with nonprofit organizations to operate them. States like Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, and New Mexico were among the first to provide funding for these homes. Texas, Rhode Island, Nevada, and Georgia also started statewide programs for second chance homes. Some communities in Missouri, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Vermont have used HUD funding to open second chance homes. However, due to a lack of funding, some second chance homes have been closed in various states. In November 2001, SPAN listed information about 95 second chance homes operating nationwide, with details on services, budget, and contact information. An additional 37 homes were also listed without detailed information. A total of 132 second chance homes were operating in 30 states, with plans for annual updates. SPAN planned to produce annual updated editions of the list of second chance home providers, but it is unknown if these updates were ever made. Legislation was enacted to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorize funding for maternity group homes through TLP. H.R. 1925, the Runaway, Homeless, and Missing Children Protection Act, was signed into law on October 10, 2003, amending the eligibility for assistance under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to include Transitional Living Programs. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act was reauthorized to include Transitional Living Programs and maternity group homes. Funding for the program fluctuated between $88 million to nearly $90 million from FY2002 to FY2006. For FY2007, the President requested $87,837,000 for the program. No specific funding was recommended for maternity group homes in FY2004. The President did not request separate funding for maternity group homes in FY2006. The Administration plans to award 193 TLP grants in FY2007, including maternity group homes, to support pregnant and parenting homeless teens. ACF will use vouchers worth $4 million to assist about 100 pregnant and parenting homeless teens, with a national organization responsible for issuing the vouchers and accrediting maternity group home programs nationwide. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is currently funded at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. A bill introduced in 2005 aimed to amend RHYA to evaluate maternity group homes and allocate $33 million for FY2006 for eligible homes. The Charitable Giving Act of 2005 proposed amending the Internal Revenue Code to incentivize contributions to charities and include maternity group homes for homeless youth within the Transitional Living Program. There is no primary federal funding source for second chance homes, but funding can be obtained through various federal, state, and local programs. Second chance homes can be expensive to operate, with costs ranging from $8,000 to $65,000 per year per teen family. Funding for these homes can come from various sources including federal programs administered by HHS and HUD, state Department of Social Services, United Way, state grants, contracts, individual donors, non-profits, foundations, faith-based groups, county or city governments. Not all providers receive federal funding for second chance homes. Funding for second chance homes can come from various sources including federal programs administered by HHS and HUD. The amount of funding used for these homes cannot be determined as it is at the discretion of the agency. Some second chance homes have closed due to lack of funding. HHS programs that may provide assistance include the Runaway and Homeless Youth Transitional Living Program, TANF, Social Services Block Grants, Child Welfare Services Program, and the Foster Care Program. The largest federal funding sources for second chance homes are TANF and the Social Services Block Grant, according to HHS. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program provides grants to states for creating community-based care systems for youth and families. The program is up for reauthorization in the 110th Congress. The Administration proposed a new Maternity Group Homes initiative as a program component of TLP to help young single mothers in transitional living opportunities. Concern for vulnerable mothers prompted the proposal for safe living environments. Congress appropriated $39.7 million for TLP in FY2002, without specifying funds for maternity group homes. The 108th Congress reauthorized the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, adding maternity group homes as an allowable use of funds under TLP. Despite the President's request for $10 million annual funding for maternity group homes from FY2003 to FY2006, Congress never appropriated specific funds for them. Pregnant and parenting teens were to be supported through community- or faith-based maternity group homes. Congress recognized the need for funding residential services for young mothers and their children, with pregnant and parenting teens eligible for assistance through TLP. Technical assistance was expected to be provided by the Family and Youth Services Bureau to address the unique needs of young mothers and their children. Funding for Maternity Group Homes was not requested for FY2007, and there are restrictions on the use of federal TANF funds for unwed teen parents. Teen parents must live with adult supervision, attend school or a GED program, and may receive cash assistance or vouchers through TANF funds. States can use TANF funds for operating Second Chance Homes and maternity group homes, but not for construction or medical services. Services provided in Second Chance Homes may include family planning, with no limit on TANF funding for these homes. States have discretion in implementing time limit policies for TANF assistance, with the option to exempt teens living in Second Chance Homes. Up to 20% of welfare caseloads can be exempted from lifetime limits for reasons of family hardship or domestic violence. The definition of \"hardship\" is determined by states and could include teens in Second Chance Homes. Second Chance Homes are supported by the Social Service Block Grant (SSBG), which aims to promote self-sufficiency and prevent neglect or abuse. States have flexibility in using SSBG funds for services related to second chance homes, with no set limitations on funding allocation. Reporting to HHS is required on fund usage, and there are federal restrictions on fund utilization. The Child Welfare Services program under the Social Service Block Grant (SSBG) aims to protect children from abuse or neglect. Federal restraints on SSBG funds include limitations on using funds for construction, purchasing facilities, medical care, cash assistance, unlicensed child care, education services, and social services provided by hospitals, nursing homes, or prisons. The goal is to assist state public welfare agencies in interventions to protect children and provide alternative placements like foster care. The Child Welfare Services program aims to protect children from abuse or neglect through services like foster care and adoption. States have discretion over Title IV-B funds to provide services for teen mothers in a SCH if deemed appropriate. The Foster Care Program helps states care for children removed from their families due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment, with funds provided for maintenance payments, administrative costs, and training. Eligible teen mothers can receive support through federal programs. The John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides flexibility and resources for child welfare services to assist teens in foster care with transitioning to independent adulthood. Services are available for foster children under 18 and former foster care youth aged 18 to 21, offering support for a successful transition. The John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides services for youth aged 18 to 21 transitioning to independent living, including educational assistance, vocational training, job placement, and housing support. States receive $140 million in mandatory funding for CFCIP, with restrictions on the use of funds for room and board. Second chance homes offer housing and programs for unwed mothers and foster care teens, with funding sources available through HUD programs like Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). The CDBG program provides assistance for community and economic development to help low- and moderate-income individuals, including funding for second chance homes. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) under the CDBG funds has no funding limits for second chance homes, but federal restrictions apply. States and grantees must create an action plan detailing fund usage and ensuring 70% benefits low- and moderate-income families. Administered by HUD, the SHP aims to provide supportive housing. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) under HUD's Community Planning and Development office provides stable housing and services for the homeless through the Homeless Assistance Grant. SHP funds can be used for transitional and permanent housing, supportive services, and \"safe havens\" for mentally ill homeless individuals. Funding for SHP is awarded competitively. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) provides funding through competitive grants for homeless individuals and families with children. SHP funds can be used for housing, supportive services, and second chance homes for homeless teenage mothers. Services include child care, employment assistance, health services, food, and case management. Grants can be awarded to governmental and nonprofit organizations to provide permanent housing, counseling, security services, and additional support at various levels. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) provides funding through competitive grants for homeless individuals and families with children. Grants can be awarded to governmental and nonprofit organizations for acquiring or rehabilitating buildings, operating costs, supportive services costs, and leasing costs with specific limitations. Grant recipients must match funds from other sources for acquiring, rehabilitating, and building new structures. The Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESG) aims to improve emergency shelters and transitional housing for the homeless, increase shelter availability, cover operating costs, provide social services, and prevent homelessness. Funding is provided through the Homeless Assistance Grant, with allocations distributed to states, cities, and urban areas. The Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESG) provides formula grant allocations to states, cities, urban counties, and territories based on population. States must distribute ESG funds to local governments or nonprofit groups with approval, including second chance home providers. ESG funds for second chance homes can be used for conversion, rehabilitation, operating expenses, homelessness prevention, and necessary services for homeless unwed teen mothers. Restrictions on fund usage include a maximum of 30% for prevention and essential services, unless waived by HUD, and a maximum of 5% for grant administration. Limited evaluations on the effectiveness of second chance homes have been conducted, but HHS reports multiple analyses on service delivery approaches. HHS reports multiple analyses on service delivery approaches of programs for teen mothers, documenting program outcomes such as employment, education, and reduced repeat pregnancies. Successful outcomes include higher rates of school completion, lower child abuse rates, improved health, increased employment, and reduced welfare dependency. New Mexico operates 10 second chance homes for teen mothers, with successful results since 1990. New Mexico and Massachusetts operate second chance homes for teen mothers, providing services like supervision, education, job training, and health care. Repeat pregnancies among residents are low, with New Mexico having less than 1% and Massachusetts around 2%. Mothers can stay until age 22, and the programs aim to support teen parents in completing their education and gaining employment. The SPAN report highlighted the success of teen mothers in Massachusetts second chance homes, with fewer repeat pregnancies and progress in education and parenting skills. Despite closures due to funding issues, Massachusetts still had the largest network of such homes in the state. Texas operates four second chance homes for teen mothers, providing services like case management, counseling, parenting classes, and transportation. The San Antonio home reports that 90% of babies born to residents have a higher birth weight than average for teen births. However, HHS cautions that the results may not be entirely accurate due to self-reported data. HHS found that evaluation of second chance homes is crucial for determining their effectiveness and informing program design. They highlighted the lack of comparison groups in existing studies and emphasized the need for accurate evaluation to assess outcomes. This information could benefit program operators and those interested in starting or redesigning second chance homes. Challenges in evaluating second chance homes include program size and capacity, measurements of outcomes like education and parenting skills, and the difficulty of creating comparable groups for impact evaluation. This poses a dilemma as denying services for research purposes is not supported by program operators or researchers. HHS suggests including applicants not selected for services in research studies to compare outcomes like long-term employment, higher earnings, self-sufficiency, and child development. Tracking participants after leaving second chance homes is challenging."
