Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities, as highlighted in reports by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA and Ground Water Protection Council reports found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, stating that state regulations effectively protect water resources during oil and gas activities. The EPA and Ground Water Protection Council reports found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, stating that state regulations effectively protect water resources during oil and gas activities. Federal regulations already cover activities related to hydraulic fracturing, such as surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions. Lisa Jackson and Bob Abbey testified that there is no proven case of groundwater contamination or adverse effects from the fracking process. Federal regulations already cover various environmental statutes, but Congress has chosen not to include hydraulic fracturing in the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin focused on \"Fact-Based Regulation.\" The Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin study found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The term \"Federal land\" in the Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is addressed in the Act. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents for fracturing purposes within the boundaries of the State. On Federal land, such activities are subject to the laws of the State where the land is located."
