    "content": "The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has a group of employees called the Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) who fill key management positions. As of FY2011, USPS employed 645,950 people, with 640 employees in the PCES as of May 18, 2012. These employees include 36 officials who serve at the pleasure of the Postmaster General (PMG) and 604 executives who perform various duties. The PMG is not part of the PCES, and pay for PCES employees and the PMG is capped at $276,840 in FY2012, with the possibility of earning more through performance-based bonuses. Former Postmaster General John E. Potter had an $815,788 aggregate balance in deferred pay as of September 30, 2011, which is paid out in annual installments. PCES employees receive benefits not provided to other federal employees, including free life insurance, periodic physical examinations, financial counseling, parking, and membership in airline clubs. They also have no cap on annual leave days accrued. USPS has been self-supporting since 1971 and does not rely on appropriations. The USPS receives an annual appropriation of about $100 million, which is approximately 0.1% of its $75 billion operating budget. Between FY2007 and FY2011, USPS lost $25.4 billion, with its debt rising from $0 to $13 billion. The Government Accountability Office has flagged USPS's financial condition as a high-risk area. The pay of USPS executives is a concern due to the organization's financial condition. The total cost for PCES employees' compensation in FY2012 is $126.2 million, a small percentage of the annual budget. Two bills in the 112th Congress aim to limit USPS executive pay, with S. 1789 proposing to cap pay at $199,700 in 2012. H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 aim to limit USPS executive pay by prohibiting bonuses in deficit years and capping pay at $199,700. The bills were passed by the Senate and reported by the House Committee, but no further action has been taken. This report analyzes executive compensation at USPS compared to other public and private-sector employees. It does not address bargaining USPS employees' pay and benefits or workforce size trends. The laws governing USPS employee pay rates do not use the term PCES but refer to \"officers,\" \"employees,\" \"executives,\" and \"critical senior executives.\" USPS has the authority to maintain compensation comparable to the private sector, capping pay at $199,700 for postal executives. Annual bonuses can push their total compensation above this level. Executives at USPS are eligible for annual bonuses that can exceed the Executive Schedule cap, as long as their total compensation does not surpass the Vice President's pay of $230,700 in 2012. The USPS Board of Governors must ensure that the performance appraisal system justifies the bonuses based on relative performance. Additionally, the Board has the authority to select up to 12 officers in critical positions to receive total compensation not exceeding 120 percent of the Vice President's pay. The pay rate for the Vice President at USPS is $230,700 in 2012, with no performance-based bonuses. The cap for critical senior executive positions receiving this compensation is $276,840. The USPS Board of Governors must notify Congress and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of their selections within 30 days. Currently, eight employees are eligible for this compensation level. USPS annually hires a consulting firm to set executive pay levels based on market practices. In 2010, a private consulting firm found that USPS executive base salaries are significantly below market rates. USPS executives can earn bonuses for meeting annual performance goals, which vary among executive officers. The Board of Governors determines bonus metrics for the PMG and the Deputy. The Board of Governors determines bonus metrics for USPS executives, with performance incentives not awarded in FY2011 due to financial conditions. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to reduce pay and benefits for USPS executives, capping executive pay at $179,700 in 2012 under S. 1789. The bill S. 1789 would cap executive pay at $179,700 in 2012, with up to six USPS employees eligible for higher pay at $199,700. It limits fringe benefits and prohibits bonuses during financially challenging years. H.R. 2309 would cap pay for Level Two Postal Service Executives at $199,700 and ties pay increases to specific conditions. H.R. 2309 links pay increases for Level Two Postal Service Executives to the Consumer Price Index and prohibits bonuses when USPS expenditures exceed revenues. Level Twos cannot accrue deferred compensation in these years. USPS faces challenges in comparing executive pay to private sector due to its unique mission and size. The PMG oversees a large workforce and significant revenues. Comparing pay rates to similar entities may provide insight. The pay rates of USPS executives can be examined by comparing them to similar positions in the private sector, as mandated by federal law. Three private-sector corporations - FedEx, UPS, and Amtrak - were selected for comparison due to their similarities in services and size. FedEx offers transportation and delivery services globally, providing a basis for comparison. FedEx, a global transportation and delivery company, competes with USPS in some services. In FY2011, FedEx paid its CEO $7.26 million in total compensation. UPS, another global delivery company, also competes with USPS. UPS's compensation data for FY2011 was unavailable, but in FY2010, its Chairman received compensation. In FY2010, D. Scott Davis, Chairman and CEO of UPS, received a $1 million salary and $10.73 million in total compensation, with $7.8 million earned in stock options. UPS has 398,300 employees worldwide and earned $53.1 billion in revenue in 2011. Amtrak, a private organization receiving federal subsidies since 1971, pays its president $350,000. The U.S. Code allows the board of directors to set Amtrak officers' pay. The pay of officers of Amtrak is regulated to be in line with officers of rail carriers with similar responsibilities, except when no Federal assistance is provided. The original legislation allowed the board to fix officers' compensation. Comparing to other federal officials, the Vice President's pay is capped at $230,700 and the President's pay is $400,000 with an additional expense allowance of $50,000. In FY2012, cabinet secretaries are paid $199,700 with a total compensation of about $259,610. The President's pay is $400,000 with an additional $50,000 expense allowance. The CEO of Tennessee Valley Authority earned $850,000 in 2011. Legislation has been introduced to limit postal executives' compensation. The House and Senate propose limiting postal executives' compensation as part of bills to improve the Postal Service's financial condition. USPS faces financial troubles due to declining revenues and increasing operating costs, exacerbated by factors like the economic downturn and electronic communication. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act requires USPS to prefund retiree health benefits, costing $5.6 billion annually. Additionally, USPS must provide universal service at a cost of $4.4 billion per year. The USPS's monopoly value has decreased due to a decline in mail volume, generating around $3.5 billion in annual revenues. USPS executives face challenges in assessing their performance and aligning their pay, as factors driving USPS's revenues and costs are beyond their control. Congress may determine that current executive pay rates are suitable to attract qualified candidates who can balance USPS's autonomy, legal obligations, and oversight requirements. The USPS executives' compensation is currently among the highest for federal employees, with up to 12 executives earning more than the Vice President. Congress has the authority to adjust executive pay to align more closely with other federal officials. The USPS executives' high compensation raises questions about their worth compared to other federal officials. Reducing pay could impact leadership retention and candidate interest. Tying executive pay to financial performance prompts debate on increasing compensation during profitable times. The USPS's use of deferred compensation has drawn attention for potentially evading pay limits and allowing former executives to continue receiving significant compensation after leaving the service. This practice could make postal executive positions less attractive to qualified candidates or prompt current executives to seek employment elsewhere."
