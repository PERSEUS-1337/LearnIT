Congress acknowledges that without international cooperation, the United States cannot effectively address global climate change and protect threatened or endangered species. Ratifying international agreements among major carbon-emitting countries is seen as crucial for reversing climate change and ensuring the recovery of affected species through relevant laws and regulations. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include a requirement relating to global climate change, defining it as significant increases in global air temperatures or sea levels. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for overseeing this aspect. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to include a requirement related to global climate change, defining it as significant increases in global air temperatures or sea levels. The term \"greenhouse gas\" is defined, and a \"major emitter of greenhouse gas\" includes countries like China and India. The Secretary shall not consider global climate change as a factor in determining threatened or endangered species until major emitters of greenhouse gases ratify an international agreement to reduce emissions. The Secretary requests the Administrator to determine compliance of major greenhouse gas emitters with international agreements annually. The Secretary will not consider global climate change as a factor until major greenhouse gas emitters comply with international agreements. The amendments made by subsection (b) take effect on January 1, 2006. Each species determined to be threatened or endangered due to global climate change will not have that status until a specified date."
