    "content": "Various bills in the 114th Congress address hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal and state lands. Hunting and conservation have been linked in federal wildlife legislation since the early 1900s. Some believe federal lands are overly restricted, while others question the impact of opening more lands to hunting and fishing on game management and public safety. Two recent bills, S. 556 and S. 659, focus on giving hunting and fishing activities higher priority in land management. S. 556 is specific to federal lands, while S. 659 covers various topics such as lead shot regulation, polar bear trophy imports, funding for land acquisition, and wildlife conservation laws. Federal land managers currently balance hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting with game management, public safety, resource management, and statutory purposes of the lands. The balance point varies among agencies based on agency requirements, land classification, location, and other factors. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS) do not track the exact acreage open to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. However, BLM estimates over 99% of its lands are open to hunting and recreational shooting, while FS estimates over 95% of its lands are open to these activities. FWS has over 360 wildlife refuges open to hunting and over 300 units offering fishing opportunities. NPS allows hunting in 61 units and fishing in 200 units as of February 2014. Other federal agencies have varying policies on these activities. Various federal agencies have different policies on activities like hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Bureau of Reclamation allows recreational shooting but discourages repeated target shooting. The Army Corps of Engineers and military bases like Camp Pendleton, Camp LeJeune, and Camp Bullis offer hunting, fishing, and trapping opportunities. Some bases may restrict access to military members, veterans, and their families. Other agencies manage lands for conservation purposes, including wildlife conservation. The report focuses on two bills in the 114th Congress: S. 556 and S. 659, both titled \"the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015.\" These bills aim to preserve federal lands for environmental conservation, even if hunting and fishing are not the primary purposes of these lands. The Department of Energy and NASA are examples of agencies that restrict access to their lands. S. 556, part of the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, includes provisions amending the Equal Access to Justice Act and impacting the Judgment Fund in the Department of Justice. The bill's definitions of federal land raise questions about the land classifications involved. Hearings on S. 556 were held by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in March 2015. S. 556, part of the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, addresses hunting, trapping, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands. It proposes an \"open until closed\" management policy and outlines factors for closing federal lands to these activities. The bill also impacts the Judgment Fund in the Department of Justice. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015, S. 556, addresses hunting, trapping, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands. It proposes an \"open until closed\" management policy and outlines factors for closing federal lands to these activities. The steps to do so include meeting specific criteria for closure determinations, revising planning documents, and filing reports with Congress. Section 101 defines federal public land broadly as any land or water owned and managed by a Federal agency for conservation purposes, with exemptions for certain types of lands. The definition is broader than the Federal Land Policy and Management Act's definition of public lands. The Section 101 definition of federal public lands in the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015 is broader than the FLPMA definition, potentially including all federal lands except those explicitly excluded. This could impact various federal agencies beyond BLM and FS, such as BOR, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Department of Commerce, all of which have natural resource conservation purposes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also used a similar inclusive definition of federal lands. Multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, suggesting that conservation is a purpose for any agency with land. The Section 101 definition of federal public lands in the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015 is broader than the FLPMA definition, potentially including all federal lands except those explicitly excluded. This could impact various federal agencies beyond BLM and FS, such as BOR, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Department of Commerce, all of which have natural resource conservation purposes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also used a similar inclusive definition of federal lands. Multiple executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, suggesting that conservation is a purpose for any agency with land. The legislation defines hunting as the pursuit, shooting, capture, collection, trapping, or killing of wildlife using authorized means. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015 defines federal public lands broadly, potentially impacting various federal agencies. The legislation includes trapping in the definition of hunting, but references to trapping may be unnecessary. Recreational fishing is defined as an activity for sport or pleasure involving the lawful catching of fish. Recreational shooting is defined as any form of sport, training, competition, or pastime involving the discharge of firearms or the use of a bow and arrow. Managers are to facilitate access to Federal Public Lands for recreational shooting activities. Shooting ranges on lands besides those of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management may be controversial. The bill aims to promote recreational shooting on Federal Public Lands, which has been controversial in some areas due to conflicts with property owners and resource damage. It directs FPL management agencies to support hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting opportunities in accordance with state law. The bill aims to promote recreational shooting on Federal Public Lands by supporting hunting, fishing, and shooting opportunities in accordance with state and federal laws. There is tension in the bill as it directs agencies to facilitate these activities while also maintaining existing management structures and policies. The bill promotes recreational shooting on Federal Public Lands by supporting hunting, fishing, and shooting opportunities in accordance with state and federal laws. It directs agencies to facilitate these activities while also maintaining existing management structures and policies. Section 101(b)(4)(C) allows BLM and FS to lease or permit lands for shooting ranges and designate lands for recreational shooting. Section 101(b)(8) requires agency heads to consult with advisory councils established in executive orders. Executive Order 12962 established a recreational fisheries council, while Executive Order 13443 referred to the Sporting Conservation Council. Section 101(b)(3)(B) of the bill allows skilled volunteers to assist in wildlife management on BLM and FS lands where hunting is prohibited, with the option to continue using Wildlife Services employees if deemed necessary by agency heads based on scientific evidence or federal law. The bill aims to keep lands open for hunting, fishing, and shooting unless closed, with processes outlined for closures. Section 101 of bill S. 556 establishes processes for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting. Existing land plans by BLM, FS, and other agencies may not have considered all activities related to hunting, fishing, and shooting. The bill does not specify how existing plans should be handled, leaving options such as keeping plans in place, immediate revision, or opening all lands to activities until new plans are finalized. The bill S. 556 establishes processes for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting. It creates a three-prong test for when agencies may close lands, including limits for national security, public safety, or resource conservation. This could require agencies to determine land uses if limits on activities are imposed. The bill S. 556 establishes processes for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting based on limits for national security, public safety, or resource conservation. Section 101(b)(1) requires evaluation to curtail activities based on phrases like \"necessary and reasonable\" and \"supported by the best scientific evidence.\" Wilderness areas and designated lands are not automatically closed to these activities. Section 101(b)(4) directs BLM and FS lands to remain open unless the managing agency acts otherwise. The bill S. 556 establishes processes for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting based on limits for national security, public safety, or resource conservation. Section 101(b)(4)(A)(ii) specifies limitations on motorized access in certain areas, but does not apply the same savings provision to designated wilderness. In testimony regarding S. 556, Leslie Weldon, FS Deputy Chief expressed concerns about potential interpretations of this provision. FS Deputy Chief expressed concerns about section 101(b)(4)(A)(ii) potentially allowing motorized access in designated wilderness areas for recreational hunting, shooting, and fishing. The provision does not address other prohibited uses under the Wilderness Act, creating uncertainty about the continued prohibition of such activities. The specific criteria in Section 101(b)(4) may supersede the general application of Section 101(b)(1) to BLM or FS lands. Under Section 101(b)(4), BLM and FS can close or limit lands for hunting, fishing, or shooting for various reasons such as resource conservation, public safety, energy production, water facilities, national security, or compliance with other laws. This provision allows closures based on criteria other than \"best scientific evidence.\" Section 101(b)(4) allows BLM and FS to close or limit lands for hunting, fishing, or shooting for reasons like resource conservation, public safety, energy production, water facilities, national security, or compliance with other laws. Section 101(b)(6) would require a process for closures that restrict access to Federal public land for recreational fishing or hunting, excluding recreational shooting and closures made under Section 101(b)(4). Section 101(b)(6) outlines the procedure for closures that restrict access to Federal public land for recreational fishing or hunting, excluding closures made under Section 101(b)(4) on BLM and FS lands. Closures must follow specific steps, including coordination with state agencies and notifying congressional committees. Short-term closures are generally not exempted, and aggregate effects of multiple closures on smaller areas are considered as a single withdrawal. Section 101(b)(6) outlines the procedure for closures restricting access to Federal public land for recreational fishing or hunting. It does not specify if closures among different agencies or geographical links are required. Emergency closures can be made for public safety, resource conservation, or national security, but the duration is not defined. There is no coordinating body among federal land agencies to manage these requirements. The bill requires agencies to include decisions affecting hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting in their planning documents. While many federal lands are open to hunting and fishing, recreational shooting is less common. Agencies may not have evaluated recreational shooting in existing land use plans, especially considering the broad definition of recreational shooting activities in the bill. Some potentially affected lands may not have planning in place. The bill requires agencies to include decisions affecting hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting in their planning documents. Some potentially affected lands may not have planning in place, and it is unclear if all planning documents would need immediate changes or if management changes could be incorporated later. Lands may be open upon the law's enactment regardless of the current plan, especially for BLM and FS lands. It is not clear what parts of the bill would trigger a plan revision. The bill requires federal land management agencies to notify Congress of restrictions on hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Agencies would incur costs to revise land management plans to allow trapping. Reporting mandates require agencies to report closures affecting 1,280 acres or more every two years. The bill requires federal land management agencies to notify Congress of closures affecting 1,280 acres or more. Section 101(b)(4)(C) includes a waiver of liability for shooting ranges on Federal public land. The liability limitation may apply to various agencies, not just BLM and FS lands. Section 101(b)(9) of the bill clarifies that it does not interfere with state authority to manage fish and wildlife on land or water within the state. It also specifies that no federal license, fee, or permit is required for fishing, hunting, or trapping on federal lands, except for the Migratory Bird Stamp. The provision in Section 101(b)(9) of the bill clarifies that state authority to manage fish and wildlife is not affected. It states that no federal license, fee, or permit is needed for fishing, hunting, or trapping on federal lands, except for the Migratory Bird Stamp. This could impact permit requirements on federal lands, potentially requiring agencies to revise regulations. The directive does not allow new fees for fishing, hunting, or trapping but does not prohibit the application of the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) for other recreational activities subject to its restrictions. Section 102 of S. 556 aims to reduce fees and simplify access for commercial film crews on federal land and waterways. Crews of up to five people can obtain a $200 permit for one year, with no additional fees allowed. Access can be denied if resources may be damaged, public use disrupted, or safety risks posed. The fee structure is being standardized across DOI and FS as directed by P.L. 106-206. The proposed fee of $200 for commercial filming on federal lands is being standardized across DOI and FS as directed by P.L. 106-206. Concerns include whether it opens up wilderness areas to filming, if the fee provides access to all federal lands, and if it generates a fair return to the taxpayer. Section 103 of the bill would amend provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act, allowing a \"prevailing party\" to recover costs and attorneys' fees against the United States if its position was not substantially justified. Section 103 of the bill would reinstitute reporting requirements for fees awarded under agency adjudication and court proceedings, with the Chairman of ACUS responsible for issuing annual reports to Congress and establishing searchable online databases. The information to be included in the reports and databases is similar for both agency and court-awarded fees. The bill reinstates reporting requirements for fees awarded under agency adjudication and court proceedings. The reports must include details on the awards, claims involved, and relevant information for Congress. Payments made pursuant to a settlement would also be reported. Specific information for court-awarded fees includes amounts paid under Title 31, Section 1304, the award amount, and the statute under which the plaintiff filed suit. Online databases for agency and court-awarded fees must include case details and a hyperlink to the case if available. The bill reinstates reporting requirements for fees awarded under agency adjudication and court proceedings, including details on the awards, claims involved, and relevant information for Congress. It also amends Title 31, Section 1304 of the United States Code regarding payments from the Judgment Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to make an annual report available online about payments made from the Judgment Fund for the fiscal year. The committee wanted the annual report on payments from the Judgment Fund to include details like the name of the plaintiff, counsel, agency, claim facts, and amount paid. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service issued reports to Congress with this information for FY2011 and FY2012, and has made online all payments since FY2003. Section 103 aims to codify this directive by amending Title 31, Section 1304 of the United States Code. Section 1304 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to post details of payments made from the Judgment Fund on a public website. Section 104 allows the transport of bows or crossbows in a vehicle across NPS lands under certain conditions. Section 104 allows the transport of bows or crossbows in a vehicle across NPS lands under certain conditions, ensuring compliance with state laws and avoiding issues in visitor centers or historic buildings. Federal land management agencies have the authority to acquire property for easier access to federal lands, including through eminent domain. Section 201 of S. 556 would direct a portion of LWCF appropriations to secure access for recreational purposes. The bill directs a portion of LWCF appropriations to secure access for recreational activities, with $10 million or 1.5% of the annual appropriation allocated for land acquisition. The distribution of funds among agencies is not specified, unlike annual appropriations laws for federal land management agencies. The Administration seeks acquisition funding for recreational access in FY2016. Section 202 of the bill directs federal land management agencies to study federal lands where public access for activities like hunting and fishing is difficult. The study must be updated regularly and prioritize lands over 640 acres. The term \"federal public land\" is not clearly defined in this section, but it includes lands managed by FWS, NPS, BLM, or FS. The study mandated by Section 202 of the bill requires federal land management agencies to prioritize federal lands over 640 acres with restricted public access. It must assess if access can be resolved through easements, right of ways, or fee titles from various entities. Section 203 of the bill reauthorizes and amends the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which expired in 2001. FLTFA allowed for the sale or exchange of BLM land identified for disposal, with proceeds split between states and a Treasury account used by federal land management agencies for land acquisition. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allows federal land management agencies to acquire inholdings and nonfederal lands adjacent to federal lands with exceptional resources. BLM raised $117.4 million through land sales, with federal agencies acquiring 37 parcels totaling 18,535 acres at a cost of $50.4 million. BLM retains authority to dispose of land under the FLPMA, with proceeds deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury. Section 203 of the bill would permanently reauthorize FLTFA, allowing for updated BLM land management plans to identify lands for sale and exchange, and acquisition of lands within federally designated areas. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allows federal land management agencies to acquire inholdings and nonfederal lands adjacent to federal lands with exceptional resources. BLM raised $117.4 million through land sales, with federal agencies acquiring 37 parcels totaling 18,535 acres at a cost of $50.4 million. Section 203 of the bill would permanently reauthorize FLTFA, allowing for updated BLM land management plans to identify lands for sale and exchange, and acquisition of lands within or adjacent to federally designated areas regardless of when they were established. It also includes provisions related to regulating lead shot and sinkers, funding shooting ranges, importing polar bear trophies, hunting over baited fields, carrying loaded arms at Army Corps of Engineers water resource project areas open to the public, and reauthorizing seven wildlife statutes. The bill was introduced on March 5, 2015, and referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held hearings on March 17, 2015. Witnesses from Ducks Unlimited, Humane Society of the United States, and Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus discussed provisions related to the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, lead shot and sinkers, imports of polar bear trophies, hunting over baited fields, and more. Section 2 of S. 659 would expand the exclusion of shells and cartridges from regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act to include specific components like shot and bullets. The exclusion under the Toxic Substances Control Act would be expanded to include specific components such as shot, bullets, propellants, and primers, as well as \"sport fishing equipment\" like lead sinkers. Citizens' organizations have petitioned the EPA to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing sinkers, but the petitions were denied due to existing statutory exclusions. The EPA denied a petition to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing sinkers under TSCA. Lead shot is banned for hunting migratory waterfowl, but not for upland game birds or fishing. Section 3 of S. 659 would allow for this exclusion. Section 3 of S. 659 proposes increasing the federal share from 75% to 90% for projects involving land acquisition, construction, and expansion of public target ranges for firearms or archery. States may also contribute up to 90% of the costs for these projects. Section 3 of S. 659 proposes increasing the federal share from 75% to 90% for projects involving land acquisition, construction, and expansion of public target ranges for firearms or archery. A public target range is defined as a location open to the public and able to accommodate shooting activities. Import of polar bear trophies legally taken in Canada was allowed before May 15, 2008, but not after the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the ESA. FWS conducted a campaign to alert hunters about the impact of the ESA listing on trophy imports. The FWS continued to authorize the import of polar bear trophies until the ESA listing became final. A court order made the listing effective immediately. Legislation was proposed to allow hunters to import polar bear trophies legally hunted in Canada, regardless of the polar bear's status as a depleted species. In 2011, FWS did not oppose similar legislation for importing polar bear trophies. The Humane Society opposes allowing permits for importing polar bear trophies, citing concerns about conservation efforts and setting a dangerous precedent. A federal court upheld the ban on permits, finding no procedural flaw in blocking them when the bear was listed as threatened. Hunting migratory game birds over baited fields is prohibited by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, with little controversy over this practice being unsportsmanlike. Section 105 addresses controversies surrounding baiting in hunting, defining a baited area as one with salt grain or feed to attract game birds or manipulated unharvested cropland. It excludes areas with normal agricultural practices, standing crops, or flooded cropland. The section defines normal agricultural practice, including recommendations from the state office of the Cooperative Extension System. It also requires consultation with the state game department and an annual report on any changes to these practices. The provision allows farmers to hunt over baited fields deemed normal agricultural practices by local officials, avoiding strict liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. This change addresses controversy over hunting restrictions on second rice crops in Arkansas. The proposed language in Section 6 would allow individuals to possess loaded firearms at Corps water resource project areas open to the public, as long as they comply with state law and are not prohibited from possessing firearms. This does not apply to federal facilities or areas not open to the public. Individuals must also follow applicable concealed carry laws of the state. The proposed legislation allows individuals to possess loaded firearms at Corps water resource project areas open to the public, as long as they comply with state laws. Supporters believe it will improve consistency in firearms regulations on federally managed lands and protect Second Amendment rights. Critics raise concerns about implementation challenges unique to federal lands with critical facilities. Section 7 reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through FY2020, while Section 8 reauthorizes the Multinational Species Conservation Fund laws through the same year. The Great Ape Conservation Act would be modified to allow annual and multiyear grants and clarify the duties of the panel of experts. The panel of experts created under GACA includes experts from range states to identify conservation priorities. The Marine Turtle Conservation Act would be amended to include territories of the United States for grants. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Fund provides grants for wildlife conservation and hunter education, funded by excise taxes on firearms and ammunition. Unused funds are invested in U.S. obligations, with interest available for use under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. The authority to transfer interest to the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) is set to expire in FY2016, but Section 9 aims to extend this authority until FY2026."
