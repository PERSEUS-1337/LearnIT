    "content": "The Act titled \"Preventing Abandoned Foreclosures and Preserving Communities Act of 2016\" requires notification from servicers initiating foreclosure proceedings. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 is amended to include definitions related to enterprises and notices regarding foreclosure for covered loans. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 is amended to include requirements for servicers of covered loans to provide initial notice to borrowers and record owners before initiating foreclosure proceedings. The notice informs them that they can remain in the property until the deed and title are transferred to another person. Under State law, owners must vacate the property and are responsible for taxes, assessments, and fees. Servicers of covered loans do not need to provide a written notice if they inform the borrower and record owners as required by State law. Additionally, servicers must provide notice of charge-off and release of lien for covered loans. When a servicer makes the first required notice for foreclosure and subsequently charges off the loan, they must provide prompt written notice to the borrower and record owners stating that the property lien has been released and the loan discharged. The borrower and record owners may face tax consequences related to the discharged loan and should consult a tax advisor. The servicer must make at least 3 attempts to provide the required notice. The servicer must make multiple attempts to provide a notice to the borrower and record owners, in both telephone and written form. They should also try to locate the borrower and provide the notice in their preferred language if known. The Bureau may develop standard forms for notices required for borrowers with preferred languages other than English. Additionally, a database of abandoned foreclosures is defined as loans secured by properties that were the borrower's principal residence at the time of origination. The covered loan must have made the initial notice or filing for foreclosure, must not be an open-end credit or reverse mortgage loan, and the servicer must have stopped pursuing further action in the foreclosure process. The Bureau will establish a database of abandoned foreclosures, including property address information and deed status. The Bureau will establish a database of abandoned foreclosures, including property address information, deed status, borrower delinquency days, outstanding loan amount, foreclosure initiation date, loan charge-off date, and charged-off loan amount. The Director may provide accessibility to this information. The Bureau will establish a database of abandoned foreclosures and provide access to taxing districts. The Bureau will protect personally identifiable information in the database. State laws regarding borrower notice in foreclosures are not preempted, except where this section provides greater notice. SEC. 3. SELLER AND SERVICER ELIGIBILITY. The Federal Housing Finance Agency must establish a rule within 90 days of this Act's enactment, stating that sellers or servicers of mortgage loans held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac cannot initiate foreclosure proceedings without following state laws and must continue with the process without charging off the loan. The seller or servicer must record a release of the mortgage loan and comply with notice requirements. This does not prevent them from engaging in loss mitigation during foreclosure. The servicer must not initiate foreclosure proceedings without engaging in loss mitigation efforts, as required by State law. Additionally, for mortgages insured under Section 203 of the National Housing Act, the servicer cannot start foreclosure proceedings without pursuing additional actions or charging off the mortgage unless a release of the mortgage is recorded simultaneously. The servicer of a mortgage insured under Section 203 of the National Housing Act must record a release of the mortgage in the registry of deeds when initiating foreclosure proceedings, including a discharge of the debt secured by the mortgage. Additionally, the servicer must comply with notice requirements and can continue loss mitigation efforts during the foreclosure process. GAO will conduct a study on abandoned foreclosures. The term \"abandoned foreclosure\" refers to a covered loan secured by a property that was the borrower's principal residence at the time of origination or when the first foreclosure notice was made.

The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment, focusing on abandoned foreclosures' impact on property values and neighborhoods, including their potential to trigger foreclosures on neighboring properties. The report will focus on the impact of abandoned foreclosures on property values and neighborhoods, including the potential for triggering foreclosures on neighboring properties. Recommendations may be included for additional requirements for servicers regarding charging off covered loans or releasing liens on abandoned foreclosures. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.
