The \"Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013\" defines terms such as \"actual stamp\" as a paper Federal migratory-bird hunting stamp and \"automated licensing system\" as an electronic system used by State fish and wildlife agencies for issuing licenses.

The Secretary may authorize any State to issue electronic stamps in consultation with State management agencies. The Secretary must approve a State's application to issue electronic stamps, which must include details on the stamp format, fees, and accounting processes. The number of new States participating in the program per year is determined by the Secretary. The State must transfer collected amounts to the Secretary, transmit stamp customer data electronically, deliver actual stamps, issue duplicate electronic stamps, and provide other required policies and information.

The State may charge a fee for issuing electronic stamps to cover costs incurred by the State and the Department of the Interior. This fee does not affect any additional fees collected by the State. (d) A State can issue a duplicate electronic stamp to replace a lost or damaged one. (e) States cannot require the purchase of a hunting license to issue an electronic stamp. SEC. 6. Electronic stamp requirements; recognition of electronic stamp. The Secretary shall require an electronic stamp issued by a State to have the same format as any other license and specify identifying features of the licensee. The electronic stamp bestows the same privileges as an actual stamp, is recognized nationally as a valid Federal migratory bird hunting stamp, and authorizes the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl. The electronic stamp issued by a State allows the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl in any State according to its laws. The stamp's duration, agreed upon by the State and the Secretary, cannot exceed 45 days. The authority of a State to issue electronic stamps under this Act may be terminated by the Secretary if the State violates terms approved by the Secretary, or by the State itself with written notice to the Secretary at least 30 days before termination."
