    "content": "Members sentenced by a court-martial to confinement and punitive discharge or dismissal have their pay and allowances affected. Members sentenced by a court-martial to confinement and punitive discharge or dismissal will have their pay and allowances terminated after the sentence is adjudged. If the punishment is not included in the final sentence or is set aside, entitlement to pay and allowances will be restored. Upon final approval or disapproval of a punishment, a member's entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a) ceases. The member becomes entitled to pay and allowances that were previously terminated. Covered punishments include dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, and dismissal. Section 858b of title 10, United States Code, allows for sentences of confinement and punitive discharge or dismissal to result in termination of pay and allowances. This amendment also repeals section 804 of title 37, United States Code. Additionally, transitional compensation is provided for spouses, dependent children, and former spouses of members sentenced to confinement and punitive discharge or dismissal. The Secretary of the executive department concerned may establish a program to pay transitional compensation to spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of members of the armed forces during periods when the member's entitlement to pay and allowances is terminated under section 858b of title 10, United States Code. Compensation is provided based on demonstrated need as determined by regulations. The transitional compensation payable to eligible individuals is determined by regulations and cannot exceed the total pay and allowances the member would have received in a one-year period after termination of entitlement. Transitional compensation is paid directly to the recipient or their legal guardian. Coordination of benefits ensures that individuals cannot receive transitional compensation under multiple sections. Emergency transitional assistance can be provided for up to 45 days while awaiting approval, with exceptions to certain payment rules. Emergency transitional assistance regulations are prescribed by the Secretary of the executive department concerned for programs established under this section. Definitions include the Secretary of Defense for armed forces and the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard. Dependent child is defined as per section 1059(l) of this title. Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to include a new item after section 1059. Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to include a new item after section 1059 regarding transitional compensation for spouses, dependent children, and former spouses of members sentenced to confinement and punitive discharge or dismissal. The effective date and applicability of this amendment is specified in section 3. The amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment and apply to pay and allowances for periods after such date. If section 858b of title 10, United States Code is deemed unconstitutional for acts committed before enactment, the amendments will not apply to those acts but will apply to future acts under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The term \"Uniform Code of Military Justice\" refers to the provisions of chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code, for acts committed after the enactment of this Act."
