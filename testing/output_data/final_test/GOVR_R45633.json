    "content": "Iraqis are rebuilding their country after years of conflict and debating their relationship with the United States. Despite declaring victory against the Islamic State, insurgent attacks still pose a threat. Security forces lack key capabilities, and extensive reconstruction is needed in liberated areas. Millions of internally displaced Iraqis have returned home, but many remain as IDPs. Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion for reconstruction efforts. Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion in reconstruction needs over the next decade. Some Iraqi political groups, including those with ties to Iran, are pushing for the departure of U.S. and other foreign troops in Iraq, which could create political and diplomatic complications. The Iranian government sees instability in Iraq as both a threat and an opportunity, influencing security sector decisions. The Iranian government views instability in Iraq as both a threat and an opportunity since 2003, influencing security sector decisions and maintaining ties to armed groups, including units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). U.S. officials recognize the PMF's contributions to fighting the Islamic State but are wary of Iran-linked elements potentially becoming permanent proxy forces. U.S. policy aims to develop Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to relying on PMF units. The U.S. aims to develop Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to using PMF units for security. Concerns about Iranian influence in Iraq have grown, with Iraq becoming a battleground for U.S.-Iranian competition. Iraqi leaders seek to prevent their country from being used in regional rivalries and build positive ties with neighbors and global powers. U.S. efforts to pressure Iran extend to the Iraqi energy sector. U.S. efforts to pressure Iran in the Iraqi energy sector involve encouraging Iraq to diversify its energy relationships and develop independence. U.S. officials promote American companies as partners to help Iraq expand electricity generation and capture natural gas currently being flared. Iraq's oil production and exports, vital for its economy, have reached record levels. Iraq's oil export revenues have reached all-time highs, providing significant financial resources to the government. However, this has led to a state-centric economic model that prioritizes public sector employment and contracting over private sector activity. Public investment and reconstruction are funded through deficit spending, borrowing, and international aid, leaving Iraq vulnerable to price changes in global oil markets. Despite being an attractive market for foreign investment due to its young population and geographic location, bureaucratic constraints, corruption, and security concerns deter some investors. The U.S. government supports Iraq's compliance with reform targets and aims to expand trade and investment ties, but future U.S. investment prospects may depend on broader political developments. The United States faces complex choices in Iraq, with a history of military and financial investment since 2003. Efforts have focused on defeating the Islamic State, but Iraqi security needs persist. Successive administrations aim to keep involvement minimal compared to the past, while examining future investment terms. The United States maintains a cooperative relationship with Iraq, providing economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and security training for Iraqi security forces. The U.S. aims to keep involvement minimal and support Iraq's stabilization efforts through partnerships with various entities. The size and mission of the U.S. military presence in Iraq have evolved based on changing conditions since 2017. The 116th Congress has allocated funds for security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid for Iraq. The relationship between Iraq and the United States may shift depending on Iraqi officials' requests for continued security assistance. Both countries face complex political and security challenges in building a less conflict-defined bilateral relationship. Competition among Shia movements and coalition building across communal groups are now major factors in Iraqi politics, with demands for improved security, government effectiveness, and economic opportunity. Iraqi politicians are broadening their narratives to appeal to disaffected citizens, amidst ongoing challenges from conflict, poor service delivery, corruption, and regional security concerns. The Islamic State's control over distinct territories in Iraq has ended, but domestic and regional security pressures persist. The U.S. intelligence community assessed in 2018 that the Islamic State will maintain a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria to enable the reemergence of its caliphate. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned in January 2019 that the Islamic State remains a terrorist threat and will exploit Sunni grievances to regain Iraqi territory. The Popular Mobilization Committee and its militias, recruited to fight the Islamic State, are now enduring components of Iraq's national security establishment. The U.S. intelligence community views Iran-linked Shia elements of the PMF as the primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq. National and KRG forces are deployed along contested lines of control, with negotiations ongoing between their leaders. PMF units are active in disputed territories between the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Region. The State Department evacuated U.S. personnel from Basra and closed the consulate due to attacks by Iran-backed forces. The incidents underscore the potential for escalating U.S.-Iran tensions in Iraq. Iraq held legislative elections in May 2018 with lower turnout than previous elections. The 2018 COR election had lower turnout and faced recount delays. Sa'irun coalition led by Muqtada al Sadr won with 54 seats, followed by Fatah coalition with 48 seats. Political factions negotiated to form a dominant coalition for the new Iraqi cabinet. The 2018 COR election saw lower turnout and recount delays. Sa'irun coalition led by Muqtada al Sadr won with 54 seats, followed by Fatah coalition with 48 seats. Various political factions formed blocs like Islah and Bin'a for negotiations in the new Iraqi cabinet. In the 2018 COR election, Sa'irun coalition led by Muqtada al Sadr won with 54 seats. Mohammed al Halbousi was elected as COR Speaker, Barham Salih as Iraq's President, and Adel Abd al Mahdi as Prime Minister-designate. Adel Abd al Mahdi, the consensus Shia Arab leader chosen as Prime Minister, lacks a strong party or parliamentary group. Despite COR approval of most cabinet nominees, disagreements persist over key ministries. Unrest in southern Iraq during government formation talks reflected citizens' frustrations with shortages, corruption, and heavy-handed security responses. The dissatisfaction in Basra led to mass demonstrations and burning of the Iranian consulate and political offices. The success of the Abd al Mahdi government in addressing protest issues will determine its viability. Iraqi security operations against IS fighters continue in various governorates to prevent their reestablishment as a threat. Iraq continues to face IS attacks on Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces, especially in rural areas. IS fighters threaten, intimidate, and kill citizens in some governorates. Despite a drop in violence against civilians since 2014, IS activity is still reported in Mosul and fatal security incidents have occurred near Baghdad and other locations since January 2019. Popular Mobilization Committee and its militias have been active since 2014. Residents in cities like Mosul and Baghdad have experienced increased freedom of movement and security. The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq, founded in 2014 to fight against the Islamic State, have raised concerns about their ties to Iran and their challenge to the authority of the state. Some PMF entities have refused to follow the government's command, and there are reports of direct Iranian support to certain groups within the PMF. The U.S. intelligence community views Iran-linked Shia militia, including the PMF, as the primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq. The PMF in Iraq, with ties to Iran, poses a primary threat to U.S. personnel. Despite some disassociation from the PMF, key figures remain influential in ongoing operations. The unresolved issue revolves around the incomplete implementation of a 2016 law regarding the PMF's involvement in politics. The incomplete implementation of a 2016 law regarding the PMF in Iraq remains a key issue, with most units not following the law's structure. Some units associated with Shia groups receiving Iranian support are not fully under the authority of the Prime Minister. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that the PMF plan to use political power to reduce or remove U.S. military presence. The PMF in Iraq aims to reduce or remove the U.S. military presence while competing with Iraqi security forces for resources. The popularity of the PMF and respect for their sacrifices create political complexities. Iraqi law does not foresee dismantling the PMF structure, and proposals to do so are currently politically unfeasible. Rapid redeployments of PMF units could create opportunities for IS fighters in areas lacking replacement forces. Competition between PMF and ISF may lead to violence and abuse. The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq faces tensions with the national government in Baghdad, exacerbated by issues such as territory, security, and energy. A controversial independence referendum in 2017 led to a security crisis as Iraqi Security Forces and PMF fighters clashed with KRG peshmerga forces. Despite some agreements reached, border and customs controls remain contentious issues. The KRG and ISF have agreed on border and customs controls, oil exports, and salary payments. The KRG delayed legislative elections but held them in September 2018. The KDP won the majority of seats in the Kurdistan National Assembly. Talks are ongoing for regional and national government formation. KDP leader Masoud Barzani's term as president expired in 2015, and his nephew Nechirvan Barzani is set to succeed him. Masrour Barzani is likely to become the KRG prime minister. There are differences within the PUK over KRG cabinet formation, and tensions between KDP and PUK at the national level. The KDP wanted to nominate a Kurdish candidate for the Iraqi national presidency, but Barham Salih, a PUK member, was chosen instead. In March 2019, a four-year political agreement was announced between KDP and PUK leaders, including joint commitments on government formation and key positions. U.S. officials have urged Kurds and Iraqis to resolve disputes peacefully. U.S. officials are encouraging Kurds and Iraqis to engage on disputes and improve security cooperation between the KRG and Baghdad to prevent IS resurgence. KRG officials are concerned about IS remnants and operations by some PMF units near the KRI. U.N. officials highlight ongoing humanitarian and protection issues for displaced populations needing various forms of support. Protection is crucial in areas of displacement due to harassment and threats of forced return by armed actors. As of February 28, 2019, over 4.2 million Iraqis displaced after 2014 had returned to their districts, while 1.7 million individuals remained as IDPs. Ninewa governorate hosts the most IDPs, reflecting the effects of military operations against the Islamic State. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq hosts nearly 700,000 IDPs. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq hosts nearly 700,000 IDPs, with Dohuk governorate facing the most challenging conditions. The UNOCHA 2019 funding appeal seeks $701 million for 1.75 million vulnerable Iraqis, with only 1% of the target met as of March 2019. The United States was the top donor to the 2018 Iraq HRP. The United States has contributed nearly $2.5 billion to humanitarian relief efforts in Iraq since 2014, including over $498 million in FY2018. U.S. stabilization assistance in liberated areas is channeled through the UNDP-administered Funding Facility for Stabilization, which has received more than $830 million in resources. UNDP identified $426 million in stabilization program funding shortfalls in priority areas in Iraq. At a February 2018 reconstruction conference in Kuwait, Iraqi authorities outlined over $88 billion in short- and medium-term reconstruction needs. Countries at the conference pledged around $30 billion in loans, investments, export credits, and grants. The Trump Administration supported U.S. companies' participation and planned to provide $3 billion in Export-Import Bank support for Iraq. Iraqi leaders aim to attract private sector investment for reconstruction and economic development. Iraq's reconstruction needs are significant, with the country's internal market and low-cost energy production making it attractive to investors. However, challenges such as security, service reliability, and corruption need to be addressed. The new Iraqi government's success in pursuing reforms will be crucial for investment opportunities. National and KRG finances are strained, with budget deficits exacerbated by lower oil prices and military campaign costs. The IMF estimated Iraq's financing needs for 2017-2018. Iraq's budget deficits have been worsened by lower oil prices and military campaign costs. The IMF estimated Iraq's 2017-2018 financing needs at 19% of GDP, with oil exports contributing nearly 90% of public-sector revenue. Despite challenges like insecurity and corruption hindering non-oil sector growth, the 2019 budget focuses on expanding public salaries and investments. Iraq's oil production and exports have increased since 2016, with revenues improving due to better oil prices. In February 2019, Iraq exported nearly 4 million barrels per day, exceeding the budget's export assumption and selling above the $56 per barrel benchmark. The IMF projects modest GDP growth in the next five years. The IMF projects modest GDP growth in Iraq over the next five years, with stronger growth expected in the non-oil sector if agreed measures are implemented. Fiscal pressures are acute in the Kurdistan region due to the fallout from the national government's response to the 2017 referendum. The KRG's loss of control over oil resources in Kirkuk led to a sharp decline in revenue in 2018, but exports resumed later in the year. An agreement between the KRG and Baghdad allows for the payment of some public sector salaries in exchange for oil export proceeds. The agreement between the KRG and Baghdad for the payment of public sector salaries in exchange for oil export proceeds has improved the situation as of March 2019. Issues surrounding the allocation of funds to the KRI in the 2018 and 2019 budgets have been a point of contention, with national government officials arguing for a revised population estimate to determine KRG resources. The 2019 budget includes provisions for the national government to pay KRG civil service and peshmerga salaries in exchange for the KRG placing 250,000 barrels per day of oil exports under federal control. The agreement between the KRG and Baghdad for public sector salaries in exchange for oil export proceeds has eased fiscal pressures. US military and coalition partners continue to support Iraqi security forces through training efforts funded by Congress. The Trump Administration is requesting $745 million in FY2020 defense funding for Iraq programs. The FY2020 defense funding request for Iraq programs includes support for various Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish Ministry of Peshmerga. The legal authorization for U.S. military operations against ISIS in Iraq is based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the U.N. Charter's self-defense provisions. The U.S. military presence in Iraq is governed by an exchange of diplomatic notes referencing the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement. The size of the U.S. force in Iraq has decreased since 2017, with operations being conditions-based and in coordination with the Iraqi government. As of March 2019, 71 U.S. troops have been killed in Operation Inherent Resolve, costing $28.5 billion through September 2018. Since August 2014, Operation Inherent Resolve has cost $28.5 billion. U.S. and coalition forces have trained over 190,000 Iraqi security personnel, including 30,000 Kurdish peshmerga. Despite progress, there is a shortage of Coalition trainers, and efforts are being made to increase Iraqi trainers. NATO launched NATO Mission Iraq in 2018 to support Iraqi security sector reform. Iraq's security forces still have weaknesses such as poor intelligence gathering, corruption, and reliance on coalition air support. The U.S. and coalition forces have been training Iraqi security personnel since 2014, with a focus on developing the capacity of Iraqi police, border, and energy forces. The Lead Inspector General for Overseas Contingency Operations has raised concerns about the adequacy of advisors to support offensive operations and hold cleared areas. U.S. arms transfers to Iraq come with the expectation of responsible use, with Congress informed of any misuse of U.S.-origin defense equipment. The U.S. has provided Iraq with assistance for security and economic objectives, including Foreign Military Financing funds for defense equipment purchases and institution-building. Additionally, the U.S. has contributed $2.5 billion to humanitarian relief efforts in Iraq since 2014, with additional support for persecuted religious minority groups. The U.S. has directed additional support to persecuted religious minority groups in Iraq since 2017, allocating funds for stabilization in northern Iraq. The FY2019 foreign operations appropriations act appropriates $150 million in Economic Support Fund aid and $250 million in security assistance funds. $50 million is designated for stabilization purposes, with funds also directed towards transitional justice programs and accountability for crimes in Iraq. The Administration's FY2020 request seeks over $165 million for continued stabilization and nonmilitary assistance. The United States seeks over $165 million for stabilization and nonmilitary assistance programs in Iraq, including support for stabilizing the Mosul Dam. The dam poses a risk of collapse due to structural flaws and compromised geology, which could lead to catastrophic damage downstream. Reports highlight challenges faced by religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq, prompting some to flee the country or seek shelter elsewhere. In October 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced increased support for persecuted religious minority groups in Iraq, including those facing territorial disputes and exploitation. Minority communities express various territorial claims and administrative preferences, leading to potential tension and violence within and among these groups. The Trump Administration has collaborated with UNDP to provide assistance to these minority groups. The Trump Administration collaborated with UNDP to provide assistance to persecuted religious minority groups in Iraq, including the Ninewa Plains. USAID allocated $75 million in stabilization assistance in January 2018, part of a $150 million pledge announced in July 2017. In January 2018, USAID renegotiated a contribution agreement with UNDP to allocate $55 million for vulnerable religious and ethnic minority communities in Ninewa Province affected by ISIS atrocities. This funding focuses on restoring essential services like water, electricity, sewage, health, and education. Additionally, USAID Administrator Mark Green visited Iraq in June 2018 to engage with minority groups and announced $10 million in awards. UNDP reported completion of 259 projects out of 486 in minority communities in the Ninewa Plains by the end of the third quarter of 2018. Overall, the United States has provided $216.8 million to support the FFS program. The United States has provided $216.8 million to support the FFS program in Iraq, which is the main conduit for post-IS stabilization assistance. UNDP identified $426 million in funding shortfalls for priority areas at risk of future conflict. Trump Administration requested funds for continued U.S. contributions to post-IS stabilization in Iraq. The Trump Administration seeks greater Iraqi and international contributions to post-IS stabilization efforts in Iraq and Syria. Policy questions arise regarding the Iraqi government's makeup, approach to Iran-backed groups, compliance with U.S. sanctions on Iran, U.S. military presence in Iraq, and terms of partnership with the U.S. The Trump Administration seeks greater Iraqi and international contributions to post-IS stabilization efforts in Iraq and Syria. Policy questions arise regarding sanctions on Iran, U.S. military presence in Iraq, security assistance to Iraqi forces, relations with Iraqi constituent groups, and responses to Iran-aligned entities in the region. Iran-linked groups in Iraq have targeted U.S. forces in the past, with concerns about potential future attacks. Iran-aligned Iraqi groups have been targeted by U.S. sanctions for their involvement in terrorism and threats to Iraq's stability. Efforts to counter Iranian influence in Iraq could challenge Iran's control in the region. The U.S. government has placed sanctions on Iran-linked groups to minimize Tehran's ability to exploit Iraqi blowback. U.S. efforts to counter Iranian activities in Iraq may complicate other U.S. interests in the region, such as counter-IS operations. President Trump's comments on using the U.S. presence in Iraq to monitor Iran have raised concerns among Iraqi leaders. Iran-aligned groups in Iraq are using this to push for a U.S. withdrawal, potentially leading to disruptions in the Iraqi government and civil conflict. Treating all Iraqi groups with ties to Iran uniformly risks alienating potential U.S. partners. The Trump Administration used sanctions and foreign assistance to limit Iranian influence in Iraq. They signaled that U.S. support would be reconsidered if Iraqis close to Iran assumed authority in the government formation process. Ultimately, figures with ties to Iran were excluded from cabinet positions. U.S. officials aim to strike a balance in competing with Iran without severing Iraq's relationships with its neighbor. Iraq's relationships with neighboring Iran are being targeted for severance, but balancing this with competing Iran-linked groups and respecting Iraq's independence poses challenges. The Arab Gulf states' relations with Iraq may influence the balance of Iranian and U.S. interests. Saudi Arabia has made efforts to reengage with Iraq since 2015, reopening diplomatic offices and border crossings. While the GCC states have not provided significant economic or security assistance, they supported Iraq's 2018 reconstruction conference. Saudi and other GCC officials are wary of Iran-linked Shia militia groups in Iraq. Iraq's relationships with neighboring Iran are being targeted for severance, but balancing this with competing Iran-linked groups and respecting Iraq's independence poses challenges. The United States and other countries seek to limit Iran's influence in Iraq, especially through Shia militia groups. Negotiations among Iraqi factions post-2018 election have not fully resolved questions about U.S.-Iraqi relations. Former Prime Minister Abadi could not secure a second term, and his successor, Prime Minister Adel Abd al Mahdi, lacks a strong electoral mandate. Iraqi President Barham Salih, a leading figure among Iraqi Kurds, serves at a time of significant uncertainty. Iraqi President Barham Salih, a prominent figure among Iraqi Kurds, faces political differences within the Kurdish community and strained relations with the national government. While supporting continued U.S.-Iraqi cooperation, he has also criticized some U.S. officials' statements. As negotiations over cabinet positions and national budget implementation continue in Baghdad, discussions on reforming sectors like water and electricity, employment, anti-corruption measures, and national security issues are expected. There are concerns that the national government may assert its sovereignty regarding foreign assistance to substate entities, while KRG representatives may seek increased aid or direct foreign support. Some Iraqi groups criticize the presence of U.S. and coalition military forces in Iraq, calling for their reduction or expulsion. Mainstream Iraqi political movements did not make the U.S. military presence a major issue in the 2018 election. Despite this, there are difficulties in developing policy options to secure Iraq's security partnership with the United States. Iraqi leaders may seek alternative support from Iran if the U.S. decides to leave Iraq. Debates over U.S. military aid to Iraqi forces and substate actors against the Islamic State have faced criticism from Iraqi groups suspicious of U.S. intentions. Some Members of Congress have advocated for aid to the Kurds with Baghdad's approval. The strained relationship between the Baghdad government and Kurdish forces, as well as concerns about the Popular Mobilization Forces, are key issues in debates over U.S. assistance to Iraq. The Department of Defense estimates that Iraqi Security Forces are years away from being self-reliant and will require continuous Coalition assistance. The Lead Inspector General for Overseas Contingency Operations (LIG-OCO) questions the duration of the OIR mission for the enduring defeat of ISIS. The Department of Defense may seek to continue U.S. and coalition training and advisory relationships with Iraq for an unspecified period, raising questions for Congress on authorizing and funding future U.S. security assistance to Iraq. The financial structure of U.S. security support efforts could also change, with some in Congress suggesting reimbursement or loans for military aid to Iraq. The U.S. and coalition training and advisory relationships with Iraq may continue for an unspecified period, raising questions for Congress on authorizing and funding future security assistance. H.R. 571 proposes sanctions on Iranian persons threatening Iraq's peace or stability, requiring flexibility and patience to align U.S. interests with Iraq's evolving politics and security conditions. The bill proposes sanctions on Iranian individuals who commit acts of violence threatening Iraq's peace, stability, and democratic process. It also requires the Secretary of State to determine if certain groups meet terrorist designation criteria and to publish a list of armed groups in Iraq receiving support from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. The U.S. government designated Harakat Hizballah al Nujaba as a terrorist group in March 2019. A bill, H.R. 361, would impose sanctions on select groups without a national security waiver. S.J.Res. 13 is a joint resolution to repeal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq."
