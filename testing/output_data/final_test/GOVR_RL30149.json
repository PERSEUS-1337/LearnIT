    "content": "The individual minimum tax was first enacted in 1969 as an add-on tax paid in addition to regular income tax. It had a 10% tax rate and included eight tax preference items, with capital gains income being a significant one. The tax has been modified multiple times since 1969, with major changes in 1976 and 1978 leading to the creation of the current alternative minimum tax (AMT). The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was introduced as a new tax in 1978, applying to a taxpayer's regular taxable income with certain deductions and excluded capital gains income. Tax rates ranged from 10% to 25%, payable if it exceeded regular income tax and add-on minimum tax liability. In 1982, the add-on minimum tax was repealed, expanding the AMT base and changing the tax rate to 20% to focus on high-income taxpayers. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) made significant changes to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), including increasing the tax rate to 21%, adjusting the exemption amount, broadening the tax base, and introducing a phase-out of the exemption for certain taxpayers. The most impactful change was the modification in the tax treatment of capital gains income under the regular income tax. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the exclusion for long-term capital gains income, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. Subsequent acts increased the AMT tax rate and exemption amounts, creating a two-tiered tax rate structure for the AMT. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 established a two-tiered tax rate structure for the AMT, with a 26% tax rate on the first $175,000 of alternative minimum taxable income and 28% on income exceeding $175,000. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset regular income tax in full for 1998 only. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 extended the provision allowing individuals to offset their regular income tax by nonrefundable personal tax credits regardless of the AMT. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 allowed various tax credits to be claimed against both regular income tax and alternative minimum tax, while also increasing the AMT exemption amount temporarily. The JCWAA extended temporary provisions allowing tax credits against regular and AMT liabilities until 2003. The JGTRRA increased AMT exemption amounts for 2003 and 2004 and applied a 15% tax rate to capital gains and dividends under both regular and AMT. The WFTRA extended AMT exemption increases through 2005. The WFTRA extended provisions for nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset regular and AMT tax liability for taxable years 2004 and 2005. The AJCA made changes to the AMT, coordinating farmer and fisherman income averaging with the AMT and repealing the 90-percent limitation on the use of the AMT foreign tax credit. It also allowed credits for alcohol used as fuel and electricity from renewable resources to be used against the AMT. TIPRA 2005 increased the AMT exemption amount for 2006 and extended provisions for nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset AMT tax liability through 2006. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable, allowing taxpayers to claim an AMT refundable credit amount based on unused minimum credit from previous years. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 further expanded tax credits for certain categories. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 and the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 raised AMT exemption levels and allowed nonrefundable personal credits to offset AMT liability. The latter act also increased the AMT refundable credit amount for individuals with prior year AMT liability. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and subsequent legislation in the 111th Congress increased AMT exemption amounts for individuals and joint filers for the tax years 2009-2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently indexed the AMT based on FY2012 exemption amounts. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 set the exemption amounts for 2012 at $50,600 for single filers and $78,750 for joint filers, with 2013 amounts at $51,900 and $80,800. The AMT for individuals involves adding back tax preference items to taxable income, calculating the basic exemption, and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28% to determine AMT tax liability. Taxpayers pay the greater of their regular income tax liability or AMT tax liability, with the AMT tax credit available to offset regular income tax liabilities. The AMT tax credit is calculated to offset future income tax liabilities by adding tax preference items to the AMT tax base. Adjustments are made to deductions, including differences in depreciation rates, which can either increase or decrease the AMT tax base. The AMT tax base is adjusted by disallowing certain itemized deductions, such as miscellaneous expenses, tax payments to governments, and medical expenses below 10% of adjusted gross income. Other adjustments include using the percentage of completion method for long-term contracts, capitalizing mining exploration costs, and including the excess of fair market value on incentive stock options in the AMT tax base. The AMT tax base includes the amount paid on incentive stock options and is not reduced by personal exemptions or standard deductions. The AMT exemption is subtracted before calculating the AMT tax liability, with exemption amounts of $80,800 for joint filers and $51,900 for single filers in 2013. The exemption is phased out for taxpayers with AMT taxable income exceeding certain thresholds. The AMT tax liability is determined by applying the AMT tax rate schedule, which is 26% on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income and 28% on any additional income. The maximum tax rate for capital gains and dividend income is 15%. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax. In 2011, some personal tax credits are limited by regular income tax liability exceeding AMT liability. TIPRA 2005 allowed offsetting AMT liability with nonrefundable personal tax credits. ATRA (P.L. 112-239) allows most nonrefundable personal credits against AMT starting in 2012. Credits still allowed against AMT for 2012 include Child Tax Credit, Saver's Credit, energy efficiency property credit, plug-in vehicle credits, and adoption expenses credit. The AMT tax credit is calculated to prevent tax deferrals from being taxed twice. Before ATRA, concerns were raised about the increase in taxpayers subject to AMT. Over 30 million taxpayers would have been affected in 2012 without congressional action. Before ATRA, concerns were raised about the increase in taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The number of taxpayers covered by the AMT would have increased due to inflation and reductions in the regular income tax. Unlike the regular income tax, the AMT was not indexed for inflation, causing tax liabilities to increase over time. This led to a shrinking gap between tax liabilities under the regular income tax and the AMT, potentially subjecting many taxpayers to the unindexed AMT or reducing their nonrefundable tax credits. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was a concern before ATRA due to inflation and non-indexed tax credits. However, with AMT indexation under ATRA, this issue is less critical. Looking ahead to tax reform, the role of the AMT will be considered, as its permanent indexation ensures lower tax revenue. This may be important for budget scoring if reform aims for revenue neutrality. The AMT poses an economic dilemma under an income tax system consistent with economic theory. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) poses a dilemma under an income tax system consistent with economic theory. An economically ideal income tax would eliminate the need for the AMT by accurately measuring taxpayers' change in net worth. Efforts to reform the regular income tax, such as ending special tax preferences, could align it more closely with an ideal income tax and eliminate the need for the AMT. However, broadening the tax base of the regular income tax to this extent is unlikely. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally intended for high-income taxpayers to prevent them from significantly lowering their tax burden through tax incentives. Changes in the tax code, such as reduced maximum tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains, have expanded the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. Congress faces the challenge of modifying the AMT to limit its coverage while preserving social and economic incentives in the tax code. The AMT was originally for high-income taxpayers but now affects middle and upper-middle income earners due to tax code changes. This leads to significant differences in tax liabilities for taxpayers in these income ranges."
