The Act defines green chemistry and the Interagency Working Group involved in the Program. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program, established by the President, promotes Federal green chemistry research, development, education, and technology transfer through various activities like grants for individual and collaborative research partnerships. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program aims to promote green chemistry through activities like research, technology transfer, incentives creation, adoption of innovations, and education and training. The Green Chemistry Research and Development Program includes expanding education and training in green chemistry, collecting and disseminating information on research and technology transfer, and providing outreach venues for green chemistry advances. An Interagency Working Group will be established by the President to oversee these efforts. The Interagency Working Group, including representatives from various agencies, will oversee the planning and coordination of the Green Chemistry Research and Development Program. The group will establish goals, priorities, and ensure interagency coordination, including budget coordination.
