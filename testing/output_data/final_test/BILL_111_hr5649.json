    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to digital goods and services taxation. The Congress finds that a consistent framework for taxation is needed to prevent multiple taxation and provide certainty in electronic commerce. Neutrality should guide tax policy to ensure fair taxation of similar goods and services, regardless of distribution method. To prevent multiple taxation and ensure fairness in electronic commerce, new taxes on electronic transactions should be prohibited. Rules should be adjusted to accommodate the unique nature of digital goods and services. Online health, energy management, and education services should be exempt from all State and local taxes to support their crucial role in the economy. SEC. 3 prohibits multiple or discriminatory taxes on digital goods or services. SEC. 4 imposes limitations on retail and sourcing. SEC. 4 imposes limitations on retail and sourcing of taxes on digital goods or services, restricting taxes to sales or use by customers within the State and local jurisdictions where the customer's tax address is located. The text discusses the sourcing of taxes on digital goods or services, specifying that the tax should be based on the customer's place of primary use, business location, or known location where the digital good or service is received. The tax on digital goods or services should be based on the customer's location, seller's address, or delivery location for goods/services delivered to someone other than the customer. The tax on digital goods or services should be based on the customer's location, seller's address, or delivery location for goods/services delivered to someone other than the customer, including advertising services. No tax on tangible personal property, telecommunications service, Internet access service, or audio or video programming service can be imposed on digital goods or services. This limitation does not apply to any construction approved by a judicial determination before June 30, 2010. No tax shall be imposed on digital medical services, digital education services, or digital energy management services by a judicial determination made on or before June 30, 2010. SEC. 5. BUNDLED GOODS AND SERVICES. Charges for digital goods or services may be taxed at the same rate as other goods or services if not separately stated, unless the seller can identify them separately. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL RULES. For the purposes of this Act, a customer is defined as a person who purchases a digital good or service for personal use, excluding resale. Purchase for resale includes commercial activities like broadcast, reproduction, or distribution of the digital content. The term \"delivered or transferred electronically\" refers to providing products or services to customers without tangible storage media.

A \"digital education service\" is electronically delivered educational content for students.

On the other hand, \"digital medical service\" involves delivering health care, information, or education electronically to practitioners, researchers, or patients.

SEC. 7 grants federal jurisdiction to district courts to prevent violations of the Act, regardless of the amount in controversy or parties' citizenship. SEC. 8 empowers the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to create necessary regulations. SEC. 9 specifies the effective date and application of the Act.
