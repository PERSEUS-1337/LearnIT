    "content": "The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act allows federal delinquency proceedings for juvenile offenders when state courts are unable to take jurisdiction or for certain serious crimes with federal interest. In some cases, juvenile offenders may be tried as adults. The increase in serious juvenile crime, limited state court jurisdiction, and expanded federal criminal law have led to more federal delinquency proceedings. In early America, children under 7 were considered incapable of criminal responsibility, with a rebuttable presumption of incapacity until age 14. The intellectual capability to entertain criminal intent was assumed to develop over time. Children under seven were considered innocent, with a presumption of incapacity until age 14. However, this presumption could be overturned by evidence of malicious intent, as guilt is based on understanding rather than age. Children as young as eight have been executed for showing consciousness of guilt and malicious intent. In the early 20th century, states established juvenile court systems to separate children accused of crimes from the adult criminal justice system. By 1930, the federal government was the only entity treating child offenders as adults, while states adopted noncriminal approaches to juvenile offenders for rehabilitation. In the early 20th century, states established juvenile court systems to separate child offenders from the adult criminal justice system. Attorney General Wickersham recommended that juveniles charged with violating federal law be returned to the juvenile authorities of their home state for rehabilitation instead of being prosecuted and convicted. Congress agreed to this approach to address the limitations in federal penal institutions for dealing with juvenile delinquency. The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act of 1938 addressed limitations in state juvenile court systems by allowing federal proceedings for juveniles charged with capital crimes or misconduct on Indian reservations or military installations. This Act, supplemented by the Federal Youth Corrections Act in 1950, remained essentially unchanged for over thirty-five years. In 1974, Congress substantially revised the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act to provide basic procedural rights to juveniles under federal jurisdiction and align federal procedures with various model acts and court decisions. Crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment were made subject to federal juvenile treatment for the first time, following Supreme Court decisions on capital punishment procedures. The 1974 revision of federal juvenile law limited the Attorney General's discretion in trying children as adults for serious crimes. Congress further adjusted the law in 1984, repealing the Federal Youth Corrections Act and allowing juveniles to be tried as adults at a younger age. The Reform Act lowered the age for juveniles to be tried as adults and expanded the list of crimes for such transfers. Federal juvenile law emphasizes state jurisdiction, with federal delinquency proceedings historically involving Native Americans in areas like Indian country. In cases involving drugs or violence, juveniles can be tried as adults in federal court. Federal law allows juveniles to be tried as adults in federal court for certain crimes involving drugs or violence. A juvenile is defined as an individual under 21 years old when the crime is committed and before reaching the age of 18. Federal authorities can prosecute individuals as adults if they are actively involved in a conspiracy or racketeering enterprise that spans their eighteenth birthday. Once found delinquent, a juvenile can be held until age 26 if their supervised release is revoked. State and local officials primarily handle criminal investigations and prosecutions, but federal law violations often overlap with state laws. Federal law violations often overlap with state laws, as crimes that violate federal criminal law are usually contrary to state law as well. For example, robbery of a federal insured bank or murder of a federal employee will almost always be contrary to state robbery and murder statutes. State juvenile courts can also have jurisdiction based on violations of federal law, allowing individuals under 18 to move through the state juvenile delinquency system without involving federal authorities. However, some states now define juvenile court jurisdiction more narrowly than federal law. Some states define juvenile court jurisdiction more narrowly than federal law, allowing for adult criminal trials of juveniles under certain circumstances. When a juvenile is taken into federal custody for violating federal law, immediate legal rights advisement and parental notification are required. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has clarified that \"immediate\" notification means prompt action once the juvenile is in federal custody. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has clarified that \"immediate\" notification means prompt action once a juvenile is in federal custody. Parental notification must include advice on the juvenile's rights and can be done through a surrogate or foreign consulate if parents are outside the US. Violations of section 5033 may require overturning convictions or suppressing incriminating statements. Juveniles must be brought before a magistrate for arraignment \"forthwith.\" When a juvenile is in federal custody, they must be brought before a magistrate for arraignment promptly. The magistrate can appoint counsel for the juvenile if needed and may order detention if necessary for court appearances or safety. A juvenile under federal detention is entitled to a delinquency hearing within 30 days. Federal law requires a speedy trial for juveniles in federal custody, starting from the time of detention. Delays are not counted during state detention, periods of non-detention, deception by the juvenile, between plea and sentencing, or when continuances are requested by the juvenile. Time spent on government appeals or transfer motions is excluded, except when the juvenile is unlawfully detained. Federal law allows federal proceedings for juvenile offenders when there is no viable state option or for serious federal crimes. The government must certify a federal forum if state courts are unable to proceed, state programs are inadequate, or for specific federal offenses. Certification by the Attorney General is required, but authority can be delegated. Certification by the Attorney General is required for federal proceedings for juvenile offenders when state options are not viable or for serious federal crimes. The authority to certify has been redelegated to United States Attorneys, and a facially adequate certification is generally not subject to judicial review unless there is evidence of bad faith. The term \"crime of violence\" for certification purposes is not statutorily defined, so courts have previously relied on definitions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. The term \"crime of violence\" for certification purposes is not statutorily defined, so courts have previously relied on definitions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. However, on April 17, 2018, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutionally vague the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3) regarding what constitutes a \"crime of violence.\" The Supreme Court declared the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) unconstitutionally vague on April 17, 2018. This decision may lead lower federal courts to use different statutes to define \"crime of violence\" or create a new definition. If the government doesn't pursue federal proceedings, a juvenile may be released or handed over to state authorities. The government can start proceedings by filing information and the juvenile's past record with the district court. Juveniles are typically not prosecuted until evidence of their prior record is received. The government can proceed against a juvenile as an adult through a mandatory or discretionary transfer, based on the type of offense and the juvenile's age. Mandatory transfers apply to violent felonies committed by juveniles 16 or older with a prior record, while discretionary transfers can be triggered for juveniles 15 or older for certain offenses. The term \"crime of violence\" impacts transfers involving assault, homicide, or robbery cases. The language used for mandatory transfer of recidivists aged 16 or older is similar to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16(a) and 16(b), which has been deemed unconstitutionally vague by the Supreme Court. Juveniles 15 years of age or older also face a similar problem with discretionary transfer provisions. The discretionary transfer provision for juveniles 15 years of age or older presents a challenge due to the uncertainty of defining \"crimes of violence.\" Courts must determine if prior offenses should be considered violent for transfer purposes based on the elements of the felony. Some courts have rejected claims that mandatory transfers are unconstitutional, except for issues related to ineffective assistance of counsel. The discretionary transfer provision for juveniles 15 years of age or older involves factors like age, offense nature, delinquency record, intellectual development, treatment history, and program availability for behavioral issues. The court considers factors like age, offense seriousness, and social background when deciding whether to transfer a juvenile to adult court. The older the juvenile at the time of the offense, the more likely transfer is. Family life and misconduct severity are also taken into account. The court considers factors like age, offense seriousness, social background, prior delinquency record, intellectual development, and psychological maturity when deciding whether to transfer a juvenile to adult court. Clean record is not a bar to transfer, and older juveniles may show reduced development. The court considers factors like age, offense seriousness, social background, prior delinquency record, intellectual development, and psychological maturity when deciding whether to transfer a juvenile to adult court. Older juveniles may show reduced development, which could impact the decision. Transfer hearings are similar to preliminary hearings, and juvenile statements during these hearings may not be used in subsequent criminal proceedings. Availability of treatment programs for juveniles is also considered. The court may require a juvenile to undergo a psychiatric examination for a transfer hearing, with the court able to base its decision on the results without violating the juvenile's Fifth Amendment rights. The determination of whether transfer is appropriate can be appealed under an abuse of discretion standard. The Supreme Court's decision in Miller v. Alabama prohibits life imprisonment without parole for offenses committed as a juvenile, but does not prevent transfer for offenses punishable by imprisonment for a term of years. If the government does not request transfer and the juvenile does not request an adult trial, the district court has discretion in the matter. The district court can conduct a delinquency hearing for juveniles at its discretion, without the need for a grand jury indictment or jury trial. The Constitution requires various features of an adult criminal trial, such as notice of charges, right to counsel, and protection against self-incrimination. After a finding of delinquency, the court can schedule a sentencing hearing or a commitment for examination. The court may then suspend sentence, order restitution or probation, or commit the juvenile to the custody of the Attorney General. Section 5037 establishes time limits for court authority in juvenile detention and probation. The court may order detention based on age, with different limits for those under 18 and between 18 and 21. The maximum term of detention is determined by age and sentencing guidelines. The court may order detention for juveniles between 18 and 21 based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with a maximum term of five years for more serious offenses. For less serious misconduct, the court may order detention for up to three years. Probation for juveniles under 18 can be set until they turn 21 or for a maximum of five years. The court may order detention for juveniles between 18 and 21 based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with a maximum term of five years for more serious offenses. For less serious misconduct, the court may order detention for up to three years. The court may later revise or revoke a juvenile's probation and order detention for violation of probation conditions. The court may order detention for juveniles between 18 and 21 based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with a maximum term of five years for more serious offenses. For less serious misconduct, the court may order detention for up to three years. An individual who is 21 years of age or older may not be detained beyond the age of 23, or beyond the age of 25 for more serious offenses. The court may order a term of detention no longer than the shorter of five years or the top of the sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines for serious offenses. For less serious offenses, the limit is the shorter of three years or the top of the sentencing range. When a court orders juvenile detention, it may also impose a term of juvenile delinquent supervision with its own time limits and conditions. The initial term of juvenile delinquent supervision may not exceed the juvenile's 21st birthday if under 18 when the detention order is issued, or less if between 18 and 21. The court may order a term of juvenile delinquent supervision based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 years or more. The court may order a term of supervision for juvenile delinquents based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 years or more. Violation of supervision conditions may result in further detention and supervision. The court may order a term of supervision for juvenile delinquents based on the seriousness of the misconduct, with limits on the duration depending on the severity of the offense. The term of supervision can range from three to five years, or until the individual reaches a certain age, with specific guidelines outlined for different scenarios. The term of juvenile delinquent supervision is determined based on the seriousness of the offense, with limits on duration depending on age. Section 5037(d)(1) does not specify time limits, leading to difficulty in determining maximum supervision term. The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act aims to protect juveniles from harsh consequences of the criminal justice system by keeping them separate from adults. Juvenile records are typically sealed except for specific circumstances. Evidence from juvenile proceedings can still be used in criminal cases, and the court will consider balancing interests in response to media requests. The court balances competing interests in favor of confidentiality when dealing with juveniles transferred for trial as adults in federal court. The Sentencing Guidelines have been amended to allow consideration of a defendant's age in atypical cases, and the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole cannot be imposed on juveniles. Juveniles accused of delinquency may not be prosecuted in federal court unless the Attorney General certifies that the state lacks jurisdiction, services, or the offense is a violent felony. The Attorney General must certify that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or offense to warrant Federal jurisdiction for juveniles accused of delinquency. If not certified, the juvenile shall be surrendered to the appropriate state authorities. If not surrendered, proceedings will be in a district court of the United States. The Attorney General must certify a substantial Federal interest in juvenile delinquency cases for Federal jurisdiction. If not certified, juveniles will be surrendered to state authorities or face proceedings in a district court of the United States. Juveniles alleged of delinquency can request to be treated as adults in certain felony cases. The Import and Export Act allows for criminal prosecution to be transferred to the appropriate district court by the Attorney General if deemed in the interest of justice. Certain offenses may have age adjustments for sentencing. The Federal jurisdiction for offenses in Indian country is determined by the governing body of the tribe, unless the offense involves physical force or certain specified crimes. In cases where a juvenile has committed certain specified offenses, they may be transferred to the appropriate district court for criminal prosecution. Factors such as the juvenile's age, social background, prior delinquency record, and intellectual development are considered in determining if a transfer is in the interest of justice. The court considers factors like the juvenile's delinquency record, intellectual development, past treatment efforts, and availability of programs for behavioral problems when deciding on a transfer to adult status. Leadership in criminal activities involving controlled substances or firearms can weigh in favor of transfer. The juvenile must be given notice and assisted by counsel during the transfer hearing. During the transfer hearing, juveniles must have legal representation. If a juvenile pleads guilty or evidence is presented in a delinquency case, subsequent criminal prosecution is prohibited. Statements made during the transfer hearing are not admissible in future criminal proceedings. If a juvenile is not convicted of the transferred crime, further proceedings follow juvenile justice guidelines. Juveniles cannot be transferred to adult court without a hearing. Juveniles cannot be transferred to adult prosecution without prior juvenile court records being received or certified as unavailable. Adjudged delinquent acts must be described in the official record."
