The Congress acknowledges the exceptional diversity of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) population, which includes indigenous Pacific Islanders, well-established populations, recent immigrants, and refugees. This diversity is reflected in the Federal government's categories, with 17 ethnic groups classified as Asian and 4 as Pacific Islander. The educational experiences of different AAPI sub-populations are often overlooked due to the \"model minority myth\" assumption, affecting academic support services for AAPI youth. The lack of disaggregated data hinders outreach efforts by student services offices. Intentional outreach efforts, like TRIO programs such as Upward Bound and Educational Talent Search, are needed for AAPI students who are often perceived not to require support. Disaggregated data reveals significant poverty rates among specific AAPI subgroups, despite the overall high college graduation rates for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. For instance, only 13.8 percent of Vietnamese Americans have attained a college degree. Certain segments of the AAPI population face barriers to higher education, with low college degree attainment rates among Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, and Hmong Americans. Pacific Islanders also have low degree attainment. Designating AAPI-serving institutions could help expand support for underserved AAPI students. SEC. 318. ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER-SERVING INSTITUTIONS. This section amends the Higher Education Act to designate institutions serving Asian American and Pacific Islander students. The Secretary will provide grants and assistance to Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions to enhance their capacity to serve these communities.

The term 'Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institution' refers to a higher education institution that meets specific enrollment criteria. A 'low-income individual' is defined as someone from a family with taxable income below 150% of the poverty level. Grants awarded under this program are intended for authorized activities to support Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. This section is for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions to enhance their capacity to serve these communities. Authorized activities include acquiring equipment, improving facilities, and supporting faculty development and exchanges. The curr_chunk focuses on activities that can be funded for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions, including curriculum development, library resources, funds management, joint facility use, academic support programs, and community outreach initiatives to promote post-secondary education. The curr_chunk discusses funding opportunities for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions, including endowment funds, academic instruction in underrepresented disciplines, research for these populations, and partnerships with community organizations. The application process requires institutions to submit enrollment data to the Secretary for eligibility. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions to demonstrate eligibility for assistance, including submitting enrollment data and a 5-year improvement plan. The Secretary may require special rules for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions receiving funds under this section, including eligibility criteria, exemption from certain provisions, and equitable distribution of grants. The Secretary may require special rules for Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions receiving funds under this section, including eligibility criteria, exemption from certain provisions, and equitable distribution of grants.
