New Jersey was launched in 1942 and served for nearly 50 years before decommissioning in 1991. It played a key role in various operations during World War II and the Korean War. The U.S.S. New Jersey served as the flagship for Commander 7th Fleet during the Korean War. It was reactivated in 1968 as the only active-duty Navy battleship and provided major-caliber fire support during the Vietnam conflict. The battleship was decommissioned in December 1969 but was called back to active duty in 1982 for missions off the coast of Nicaragua and in the Mediterranean. The U.S.S. New Jersey provided critical fire support in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 and continued serving in various roles, including deployments in the Western Pacific. It was decommissioned for the final time in February 1991, and in 1998 Congress passed legislation to permanently berth the ship in New Jersey. The state strongly supports bringing the U.S.S. New Jersey home, with the congressional delegation united in its support. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\nIn honor of the U.S.S. New Jersey, the Secretary of the Treasury will mint up to 500,000 $1 coins, each weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, and containing 90% silver and 10% copper.
