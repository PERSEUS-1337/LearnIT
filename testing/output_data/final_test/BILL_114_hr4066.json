    "content": "The \"Nuclear Innovation Act\" defines terms like \"advanced fission reactor\" and \"Department of Energy.\" It also includes provisions for high-performance computation and supportive research. The Secretary will enhance reactor technology development through high-performance computation modeling and simulation, coordinating with relevant agencies. The program aims to utilize expertise from various sectors to accelerate research on advanced fission and fusion reactor systems, as well as tools for space exploration. Computational tools will be developed to simulate nuclear phenomena for validation through physical experimentation. The Secretary will support research activities to enhance reactor technology development by coordinating with relevant agencies and leveraging experience from the Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation. This includes ensuring new experimental and computational tools are accessible to research communities for simulating degradation of materials and validating computational tools. SEC. 4. ENABLING NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION. The Secretary will establish the National Reactor Innovation Center to test and demonstrate reactor concepts proposed by the private sector. This program will leverage expertise from Federal agencies and National Laboratories to expedite the construction and operation of experimental reactors. The objectives include validating novel reactor concepts, resolving technical uncertainties, and conducting research to improve emerging technologies. The Secretary will transmit a report assessing the Department's capabilities for privately funded fusion and advanced fission experimental reactors. This includes safety review, oversight capabilities, leveraging expertise from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and National Laboratories, and identifying potential hosting sites. The Department will assess its contractual mechanisms for partnering with the private sector and Federal agencies, cost structures related to security and project costs, and any other challenges identified by the Secretary."
