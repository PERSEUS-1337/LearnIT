    "content": "In this paper, the authors focus on obtaining generalization error bounds for learning non-convex objectives. They introduce a new framework called Bayes-Stability, which combines ideas from PAC-Bayesian theory and algorithmic stability. By applying this method, they derive new data-dependent generalization bounds for stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and other noisy gradient methods. Their results are typically tighter than a recent study by Mou et al. (2018). Our experiments show that our data-dependent bounds can differentiate randomly labeled data from normal data, explaining phenomena observed in Zhang et al. (2017a). New generalization bounds for continuous Langevin dynamics are obtained by developing a Log-Sobolev inequality for the parameter distribution. These bounds are more effective with higher noise levels and remain valid as T tends to infinity. Supervised learning involves optimizing a model parameter w using data distribution D and objective function F. The goal is to understand generalization performance by proving upper bounds on generalization error. This error is defined as the the difference between population loss and empirical loss. The loss function L can vary, such as the 0/1 loss. Recent work in deep learning has shown that traditional complexity measures may not fully explain the success of over-parametrized neural networks. By incorporating data-dependent quantities like margin and compressibility, more meaningful generalization bounds can be obtained. Another approach is to establish algorithm-dependent bounds for generalization. The algorithmic stability framework, introduced by Bousquet & Elisseeff in 2002, provides a way to bound generalization error based on algorithm stability. Hardt et al. (2016) applied this framework to study the stability and generalization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex and non-convex functions. This work has inspired further research on the generalization performance of other gradient-based optimization methods. In a non-convex setting, a gradient-based method with continuous noise injected in each iteration is studied. Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) is considered, adding Gaussian noise at each update step. A continuous version of this dynamic is also explored through a stochastic differential equation. Previous work has focused on algorithm-dependent generalization bounds of stochastic gradient methods, with results scaling linearly with the number of iterations. Our work builds on previous research on generalization bounds for stochastic gradient methods in non-convex optimization. London (2017) introduced a generalization bound combining PAC-Bayesian analysis with stability, while Mou et al. (2018) provided bounds for SGLD from both perspectives. Pensia et al. (2018) derived similar bounds for noisy stochastic gradient methods, but their results are sub-optimal. Our approach differs by focusing on distributions on the hypothesis space rather than hyperparameter space. Recent advances in learning theory aim to explain the generalization performance of neural networks from various perspectives, including bounding network capacity by weight matrix norms. Our work focuses on generalization in non-convex stochastic optimization, while other studies provide explanations for similar phenomena from different viewpoints. Additionally, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) has been considered as a sampling algorithm in Bayesian inference, with non-asymptotic analysis establishing finite-time convergence. In this paper, generalization guarantees for noisy variants of stochastic gradient methods are provided. A new method called Bayes-Stability is introduced, incorporating ideas from PAC-Bayesian theory. The method shows that generalization error is bounded by specific values, offering insights into the stability framework. The paper introduces Bayes-Stability, a method incorporating PAC-Bayesian theory to provide generalization guarantees for noisy stochastic gradient methods. It bounds generalization error by incorporating a distribution-dependent prior, resulting in a tighter error bound dependent on the gradient norm. In modern deep neural networks, the worst-case Lipschitz constant L can be quite large, much larger than the expected empirical gradient norm. The generalization bound does not grow much in the later stages of training, even with longer training. The difference between training on correct and random labels is explained, showing higher expected squared gradient norm with random labels. The PAC-Bayesian bound for SGLD with 2-regularization is also mentioned. The bound proposed by Mou et al. (2018) scales as O(1/ \u221a n) and is based on the PAC-Bayesian approach, holding with high probability. Their technique allows for a simpler proof of their theorem and can be extended to handle mini-batches and various gradient-based methods. Our analysis easily extends to log-Lipschitz noises, and the generalization bound holds for various optimization path variants. Pensia et al. (2018) also show similar pathwise stability with a slower scaling rate. The text discusses generalization bounds for continuous Langevin dynamics (CLD) with 2 regularization using Log-Sobolev inequalities. The bounds show a slower scaling rate of O(1/ \u221a n) for C-bounded loss, matching previous results. The analysis extends to log-Lipschitz noises and various optimization path variants. The generalization bound for continuous Langevin dynamics with 2 regularization approaches 2e 4\u03b2C CLn \u22121 \u03b2/\u03bb as time T increases. The analysis is based on a new Log-Sobolev inequality for the parameter distribution at time t, derived from the variational formulation of the entropy formula. Notations include D for data distribution, S for training dataset, and F (w, z) and L(w, z) for objective and loss functions, respectively. The learning algorithm A outputs a parameter w \u2208 R d randomly from a dataset S. The proof leverages the Fokker-Planck equation and assumes the loss is sub-Gaussian. The expected generalization error of A is defined. The expected generalization error of a learning algorithm A is defined as Algorithmic Stability, which is closely connected to its generalization performance. A randomized algorithm A is n-uniformly stable w.r.t. loss L if for all neighboring sets S, the outputs of A on S do not vary too much. If a randomized algorithm A is n-uniformly stable, then the generalization error is bounded by n. The text discusses algorithm A being n-uniformly stable and introduces ideas from PAC-Bayesian theory into the algorithmic stability framework. It defines the posterior of a dataset and a single data point, along with making an assumption on the learning algorithm being order-independent. The text introduces a new Bayes-Stability framework for algorithm stability, assuming order-independence and a C-bounded loss function. The generalization error is bounded by terms involving the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior distribution and the posterior distributions. The Bayes-Stability framework is introduced for algorithm stability, incorporating data distribution information through the prior. It differs from uniform stability and leave-one-out error, focusing on how a single data point influences the learning algorithm outcome. An expectation generalization bound is derived for gradient Langevin dynamics under certain conditions. The expected generalization bound for T iterations of GLD is derived under the assumption that the loss function is C-bounded. The proof relies on a technical lemma and the convexity of KL-divergence. The training process of GLD for different datasets is compared to show the impact of a single data point on the learning algorithm outcome. Theorem 11 provides an expected generalization error bound for T iterations of SGLD under certain conditions. The proof involves bounding the KL-divergence between Gaussian mixtures and is more technical, deferred to Appendix A.3. The expected generalization error bound for T iterations of SGLD depends on the empirical squared gradient norm and the parameter at each step. The proof also yields a bound based on the population gradient norm. The bound holds for various variants of SGLD, including outputting averages of the trajectory or suffix. In this section, the study focuses on the generalization error of Continuous Langevin Dynamics (CLD) with regularization. The loss function and objective function are assumed to be C-bounded, differentiable, and L-lipschitz. The Continuous Langevin Dynamics is defined by a specific stochastic differential equation. The generalization error of Continuous Langevin Dynamics (CLD) with regularization is bounded by O e 4\u03b2C n \u22121 \u03b2/\u03bb, independent of training time T. As T approaches infinity, the error bound tightens to O \u03b2C 2 n \u22121. Gradient Langevin Dynamics (GLD), a discretization of CLD, shows similar generalization as CLD when K\u03b7 2 tends to zero. The generalization error of Continuous Langevin Dynamics (CLD) with regularization is bounded by O e 4\u03b2C n \u22121 \u03b2/\u03bb, independent of training time T. GLD (running K iterations with the same \u00b5 0 as CLD) has the expected generalization error bound, where C 1 is a constant that only depends on M, \u03bb, \u03b2, b, L, and d. Lemma 16 establishes a Log-Sobolev inequality for \u00b5 t, the parameter distribution at time t, crucial for the generalization bound of CLD. The proof sketch of Theorem 15 in Appendix B discusses the process of CLD on neighboring datasets and the pdf of the parameter distribution. It mentions generalization bounds for gradient-based methods and the potential for future research on handling discrete noise in SGD. The study focuses on analyzing the discrete noise in SGD and the time it takes for diffusion processes to reach a stable distribution. Future research directions include examining local behavior and generalization of diffusion processes in finite time. The generalization error is bounded by the population loss, and Theorem 7 (Bayes-Stability) is proven. Theorem 7 (Bayes-Stability) states that for a C-bounded loss function and an order-independent learning algorithm, the generalization error is bounded by 2C times the KL-divergence between prior distributions. Lemmas are used to simplify the proof process, reducing it to the analysis of a single update step. The directional triangular discrimination from P to Q is defined as where Lemma 20. For any two probability distributions P and Q on R d, the KL-divergence between two Gaussian mixtures induced by sampling a mini-batch from neighbouring datasets is bounded by a technical lemma. Two collections of points labeled by mini-batches satisfy certain conditions for mixture distributions over all mini-batches. The KL-divergence between Gaussian mixtures induced by sampling mini-batches from neighboring datasets is bounded by a technical lemma. The integral is unchanged when projecting the space to a two-dimensional subspace, reducing the problem to d=2. The integral in the right-hand side is denoted as I, and certain claims are made regarding its properties. Finally, the proof for the claims used in the analysis is provided. Theorem 11 states that under certain conditions, the expected generalization error bound holds for T iterations of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). The proof involves prior distribution, convexity of KL-divergence, and empirical squared gradient norm. The proof of Theorem 11 involves the training process of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and the distribution of data points. It utilizes the concavity of KL-divergence and the Gaussian distribution. The theorem is established by bounding the population squared gradient norm and the KL-divergence between distributions. The text discusses extending generalization bounds to include log-lipschitz noises in addition to Gaussian noise. It introduces the concept of L-loglipschitz noises and defines them as distributions with a specific gradient constraint. The text also mentions defining variations of optimization methods with L-loglipschitz noise instead of Gaussian noise, and how Lemma 23 implies analogs of previous theorems under more general noise distributions. Lemma 23 extends the analogs of previous theorems to more general noise distributions, specifically L noise -log-lipschitz distributions on R d. It involves defining collections of points in R d satisfying certain conditions and bounding integrals based on the properties of the noise distribution. The noisy versions of Classical Momentum and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient methods are defined with specific parameters. The generalization bounds for these methods still hold under certain assumptions. The noisy versions of Classical Momentum and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient methods are defined with specific parameters. The generalization bounds for these methods still hold for noisy momentum method and noisy NAG. The Entropy-SGD algorithm minimizes negative local entropy instead of directly optimizing the original objective. The Entropy-SGD algorithm uses exponential averaging to estimate the gradient in the SGLD loop. It has a generalization bound with specific hyper-parameters and conditions for expected generalization error. The Entropy-SGD algorithm utilizes exponential averaging to estimate the gradient in the SGLD loop, with a generalization bound based on specific hyper-parameters and conditions for expected generalization error. The proof of Theorem 27 establishes bounds on the generalization error of Entropy-SGD by defining the history before a given time step and focusing on the training process. The proof involves considering different cases and applying Lemmas to analyze the empirical squared gradient norm during SGD iterations. The continuous version of the noisy gradient descent method is the Langevin dynamics, described by a stochastic differential equation involving a standard Brownian motion. To analyze this dynamics, knowledge about Log-Sobolev inequalities and diffusion semigroups is needed. The diffusion semigroup P is a family of operators satisfying certain properties, such as linearity and the semigroup property. The diffusion semigroup P maps nonnegative functions to nonnegative functions and is associated with the carr\u00e9 du champ operator \u0393. A probability measure satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality if certain conditions are met. Gaussian measures satisfy a specific Logarithmic Sobolev Inequality according to Lemma 30. The centered Gaussian measure with covariance matrix \u03c3^2 I_d satisfies LS(\u03b2\u03c3^2) with respect to \u0393, where \u0393 = \u03b2^(-1) \u2207f, \u2207g is the carr\u00e9 du champ operator of the diffusion semigroup. The invariant measure of the CLD is the Gibbs measure d\u00b5 = 1/Z\u00b5 exp(\u2212\u03b2F(w)) dw. Lemma 31 by Holley and Stroock allows us to determine the Logarithmic Sobolev constant of the invariant measure \u00b5. Lemma 31 states that if a probability measure \u03bd satisfies LS(\u03b1) with respect to \u0393, and another probability measure \u00b5 satisfies 1/b \u2264 d\u00b5/d\u03bd \u2264 b for some constant b > 1, then \u00b5 satisfies LS(b^2 \u03b1) with respect to \u0393. This lemma is a consequence of a variational formula, Lemma 32, which involves a convex function \u03c6. The integrand of the formula is nonnegative due to the convexity of \u03c6. Additionally, Lemma 33 discusses the carr\u00e9 du champ operator under Assumption 14. The carr\u00e9 du champ operator \u0393(f, g) of the diffusion semigroup associated with CLD and the invariant measure \u00b5 satisfy LS(e 4\u03b2C /\u03bb). A Log-Sobolev inequality is established for \u00b5 t, the parameter distribution at time t > 0, under Assumption 14. The initial distribution \u00b5 0 is crucial for the proof. The invariant measure of CLD is analyzed using Lemmas and definitions. The probability measures of W t are considered, leading to the conclusion under Assumption 14. The proof involves rewriting equations and defining probability measures in CLD and GLD. The bound of KL(\u00b5 S,k , \u03bd S,\u03b7K ) under Assumption 35 by Raginsky et al. (2017) allows for deriving a generalization error bound for discrete GLD from continuous CLD. The SGLD considered by Raginsky et al. (2017) involves a conditionally unbiased estimate of the gradient \u2207F S (w k ). In the GLD setting, the function h satisfies certain conditions, including being non-negative, smooth, and dissipative. The initial hypothesis W 0 has a bounded and strictly positive density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R d. The expected generalization error bound for GLD and CLD is derived using the uniform stability framework. By applying the Fokker-Planck equation for CLD, a differential inequality is solved to bound the generalization error of CLD. Pinsker's inequality is then used to further analyze the generalization error. The second part of the theorem is proven by considering GLD processes training on different sets. The exponential decay in entropy is discussed, showing the equivalence of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. The diffusion semigroup of CLD and its invariant measure are also examined. The diffusion process (Smoluchowski dynamics) is reversible, with \u00b5(x)p t (x, y) = \u00b5(y)p t (y, x). The GLD process has an expected generalization error bound, and the invariant measure of CLD for different datasets is examined. The invariant measure of CLD for datasets S and S are denoted as \u00b5 and \u00b5, respectively. The total variation distance of the measures is bounded by an exponential term. The generalization error of CLD is bounded by a certain expression. The proof for GLD follows a similar approach. The setup for the experiments involves a Small AlexNet with specific parameters. In our experiments, we used a Small AlexNet with specific parameters and an MLP with 3 hidden layers. The objective function for data points in MNIST is discussed, along with the introduction of random labels. Our implementation details include repeating the experiment 5 times, sampling 10000 data points, and using an initial learning rate of 0.003. During training, the initial learning rate is set at 0.003 and decays by 0.995 every 60 steps until it reaches 0.0005. An unbiased estimation is used for the empirical squared gradient norm, g e (t), by sampling a minibatch of size 200 at each step. Experiment results on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets show the effectiveness of the approach. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using SGLD on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets to distinguish normal datasets from those with random labels. The sum of squared empirical gradient norms is closely linked to generalization performance, with potential for optimizing constants to achieve a more accurate generalization bound."
