Approximately 5,300,000 Americans are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or both, which are the most common cause of liver cancer and chronic liver disease in the United States. Chronic HBV and HCV also lead to liver cirrhosis, transplantation, and are a significant cause of death, especially in individuals with HIV/AIDS. At least 15,000 deaths per year in the US are attributed to chronic HBV and HCV. According to the CDC, approximately 2 percent of the US population has chronic HBV, HCV, or both. HBV is highly infectious, transmitted through contact with infected blood or body fluids, while HCV is transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. In 2008, an estimated 18,000 Americans were newly infected with HCV and over 38,000 with HBV. In 2009, there were 10 outbreaks of healthcare-acquired HBV and HCV infections reported to the CDC for investigation, with 6,748 patients potentially exposed to the viruses. Chronic HBV and HCV may not show symptoms early on, but over time, more than 33 percent of infected individuals may develop serious liver conditions. Many people with these infections are unaware of their status, leading to unknowing disease progression. HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain populations. HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain populations in the United States, with Asian and Pacific Islanders, baby boomers, African-Americans, Latinos, and American Indian/Native Alaskans having high rates of infections. Behavioral changes can slow disease progression if diagnosed early through simple tests, reducing transmission risk. Advancements in diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis, including rapid testing, can reduce transmission risk and aid in early detection of liver cancer for those chronically infected with HBV or HCV. These tests can be used alongside HIV testing for individuals at risk for both infections. Liver cancer is the second deadliest cancer in the United States, but has received little funding for research, prevention, or treatment. Treatment for chronic HCV can cure the disease in 75% of cases, while treatment for chronic HBV can suppress viral replication in over 80% of cases. The Department of Health and Human Services released an action plan in 2011 to combat the viral hepatitis epidemic in the United States. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies produced a 2010 report on the Federal response to HBV and HCV titled: Hepatitis and Liver Cancer: A National Strategy for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis B and C. The recommendations and guidelines provide a framework for HBV and HCV prevention, education, control, research, and medical management programs. The annual health care costs attributable to viral hepatitis in the United States are significant, estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 for HBV and more than $100,000,000,000 for HCV. The annual health care costs for HCV patients are expected to increase from $30 billion in 2009 to over $85 billion in 2024. Early screening and diagnosis can help avoid costly liver transplants or hospital admissions for liver cancer or end-stage liver disease. Federal investment in effective prevention mechanisms is crucial to address these cost drivers. According to the Institute of Medicine report in 2010, chronic HBV and HCV infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality despite being preventable and treatable. Deficiencies in implementing guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and management perpetuate burdens. Screening and testing for HBV and HCV align with Healthy People 2020 goals to increase immunization rates and reduce infectious diseases. Awareness, prevention, and treatment are crucial for reducing disease transmission. Federal support is essential to increase knowledge and awareness of HBV and HCV, assisting State and local efforts in reducing morbidity and mortality. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has discretion to carry out the Act through various agencies to combat these epidemics. Revision and extension of hepatitis surveillance, education, and testing program. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include surveillance, education, and testing programs for hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. The Secretary may carry out these programs directly or through grants to various entities. The Secretary will cooperate with entities to establish a national system for HBV and HCV, aiming to determine infection rates, increase awareness through testing programs, provide education on detection and control, and offer counseling referrals. The Secretary will determine high-risk populations for HBV and HCV, including individuals born in countries with 2% or more HBV prevalence. Additionally, efforts will focus on improving education and skills of health professionals in detecting and treating infections. The Secretary will prioritize early diagnosis of chronic cases of HBV or HCV in high-risk populations, including individuals born between 1945 and 1965, those exposed to infected blood, family members, or sexual partners of high-risk individuals. Education, counseling, and medical treatment referrals will be provided to reduce the risk of mortality. The Secretary prioritizes early diagnosis of chronic HBV or HCV cases in high-risk populations to reduce mortality. Patients should receive medical management, including monitoring liver function, screenings for liver cancer, and appropriate treatment to prevent progression to cirrhosis. Additionally, they should receive drug, alcohol abuse, mental health treatment, and education on preventing HBV perinatal infection for women of childbearing age.

Services provided should be culturally and linguistically appropriate. Coordination of Federal screening guidelines involves the CDC Director and AHRQ Director. The CDC Director is tasked with revising guidelines for screening individuals for hepatitis C virus infection and transmitting them to the AHRQ Director by March 1, 2012. The revised guidelines will include testing for HCV under the Public Health Service Act. The CDC Director is revising guidelines for HCV screenings, considering effectiveness issues, stigma perception, and age-based screenings. The AHRQ Director will receive the updated guidelines. The AHRQ Director will consider CDC guidelines and new HCV treatments when developing recommendations for HCV screenings. They will also provide recommendations for HBV screenings to the Preventive Services Task Force. The Preventive Services Task Force will consider CDC guidelines for HBV screenings recommended in 2008. Authorization of appropriations for testing, education, and referrals under the Public Health Service Act is set at $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, and $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The Secretary must reserve at least 80 percent of funds for grants under subsection (a) for a fiscal year. The amendments made by this section do not require termination of any program under section 317N of the Public Health Service Act."
