The current FCC Strategic Plan aims to close the digital divide by making broadband more accessible and affordable, and promoting innovation in the communications market. The FCC's key priorities include promoting entrepreneurship, expanding economic opportunity, and protecting consumers and public safety. They plan to combat robocalls, make communications accessible for people with disabilities, and reform their processes for transparency and accountability. The FCC aims to modernize operations, improve decision-making, and reduce regulatory burdens. Performance objectives are set for each strategic goal. Commission management annually sets targets and measures for performance goals, published in the FCC's Performance Plan and submitted with the annual budget request to Congress. Results are detailed in the FCC's Annual Performance Report each February, along with a Summary of Performance and Financial Results. Funding for the FCC has been through the House and Senate Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill since the 110th Congress. Regulatory fees are collected annually to offset agency costs. The FCC collects regulatory fees annually to fund its operations, derived from license holders and certain entities. These fees, known as \"Section (9) fees,\" do not apply to certain non-commercial entities. The FCC reviews and adjusts the fees each year based on changes in its appropriation. The Regulatory Fee Collection Program was implemented in 1994, with the most recent fee order released in 2018. The FCC's budgets from FY2010 to FY2020 are shown in Figure 1. The FCC's budgets from FY2010 to FY2020 are detailed in Figure 1. The RAY BAUM'S Act of 2018 requires the FCC to transfer excess collections to the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. In FY2018, over $9 million was transferred, along with $112 million from prior years. For FY2020, the FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections. The FCC has requested $335,660,000 in budget authority from regulatory fee offsetting collections for FY2020, which is a decrease from the previous authorization levels. Specifically, the budget request includes $132,538,680 for the spectrum auctions program, representing an increase from the FY2019 appropriation. The FCC has requested funding to reimburse various stations for costs related to the incentive auction, make more spectrum available for 5G, and educate consumers. The spectrum auctions program has generated over $114.6 billion for the government, with costs totaling less than $2.0 billion. The FCC was reauthorized through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The FCC's Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 guides the development of its Performance Plan and Budget, aligning with the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act. The Performance Budget sets targets based on strategic goals, included in the President's budget request. The Agency Financial Report provides financial analysis, while the Annual Performance Report compares actual performance with targets at the end of the fiscal year. The FCC's performance is evaluated based on its targets, with reports available on the FCC website. A hearing on the FY2020 FCC budget addressed various issues such as 5G deployment, merger reviews, robocalls, and net neutrality. The FCC operates under a public interest mandate established in the 1927 Radio Act, with two regulatory philosophies guiding its interpretation. The FCC operates under a public interest mandate established in the 1927 Radio Act, with two regulatory philosophies guiding its interpretation. The agency has wide latitude to revise its interpretation of the public interest standard, leading to significant changes in how it regulates the broadcast and telecommunications industries over time. Changes in FCC leadership have influenced the agency's strategic goals, resulting in the repeal of net neutrality rules in 2017 and structural changes in 2019. The FCC's strategic goals are outlined in its quadrennial Strategic Plan, reflecting the evolving priorities of the commission. Chairman Wheeler's strategic goals in the FY2015-FY2018 plan focused on protecting and benefiting the public through regulation, emphasizing the rights of users and responsibilities of network providers. In contrast, Chairman Pai's goals in the FY2018-FY2022 plan also aim to protect and benefit the public, but with a different approach. Chairman Pai's regulatory philosophy focuses on promoting market incentives and efficiency, aiming to reduce regulatory burdens and promote entrepreneurship. This approach is evident in the strategic goals of the FCC, particularly in the context of the net neutrality debate. Chairman Pai's regulatory philosophy contrasts with that of Chairman Wheeler, emphasizing market incentives and efficiency over strict regulations. The 2015 Open Internet Order and the 2017 Order illustrate this difference in approach to net neutrality. The FCC's 2017 Restoring Internet Freedom Order has sparked debate over net neutrality laws. In January 2019, the FCC voted to replace the Office of Strategic Planning and Policy Analysis with a new Office of Economics and Analytics, a move approved along party lines. The FCC established the Office of Economics and Analytics to enhance economic analysis in policy making, improve auction processes, and implement data practices. This aligns with the goal of modernizing operations, reducing regulatory burdens, and adapting to market realities. The FCC's long-term strategic goals may be influenced by changing regulatory philosophies of chairmen, impacting agency structure and decision-making processes. The FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics aims to improve economic analysis in policy making and auction processes. The agency's long-term strategic goals may be affected by changing regulatory philosophies of chairmen, influencing agency structure and decision-making processes. Congress has not introduced legislation on net neutrality, indicating a potential continuation of FCC's authority in defining it. Hearings in the 115th Congress regarding FCC operations are detailed in tables."
