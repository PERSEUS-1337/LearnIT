Article 1.5 (Section 520) of the Public Resources Code defines a park support organization as a nonprofit group focused on increasing park access, promoting healthy lifestyles, and supporting the protection of California's natural resources. The organization must be tax-exempt and comply with relevant laws. The department may enter into a statewide agreement with a park support organization to develop new funding sources, support marketing activities, and implement reforms for the state park system.

If an agreement is made, the park support organization must work with the department to fulfill these objectives. The park support organization collaborates with park agencies, partners, and volunteers to enhance state park activities. The director and Director of Finance may be nonvoting members of the organization's board for effective communication. The organization is not a state entity. The park support organization collaborates with park agencies, partners, and volunteers to enhance state park activities. If the department enters into an agreement with the organization, they will develop an annual list of strategic initiatives and projects that are statewide priorities. These initiatives must align with the purposes specified in Section 521. The department will develop a priority list of initiatives and projects that align with the natural, scenic, cultural, and ecological values of state parks. This list will be posted on the department's website and provided to relevant committees. Agreements with park support organizations must include clear goals, objectives, and commitments for oversight and staffing to advance park purposes. The department may enter into agreements with park support organizations to secure expertise, resources for strategic initiatives and projects on the priority list. Agreements can include grants, contracts, staff-sharing, and rights of entry onto state park property.

Agreements entered into by the department are not subject to advertising or competitive bidding requirements. Construction work by park support organizations on state-owned property is considered a public work. The director can receive donations of projects, services, and funds from park support organizations. The Director of Finance has 60 days to review and approve agreements or amendments proposed under subdivision (a). Upon approval, donations can be accepted, and supplementary agreements can be entered into. The park support organization is not limited in applying for grants, loans, or funds from public entities other than the department. They must consult with the department if both parties are applying for the same funds. Section 5003.17 of the Public Resources Code is amended. Section 5003.17 of the Public Resources Code allows the department to lease state park property for compatible use, with rent based on fair market value and a maximum lease term of 10 years. Approval from the Department of General Services is required for all leases, which cannot extend beyond 10 years without meeting specific conditions. The director must provide at least 30 days' notice and a copy of the proposed lease to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee for approval before entering into any operating lease or agreement. The documentation must allow for a full evaluation of the lease terms, including rent and revenues. The director must provide documentation to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee for evaluation of operating costs, revenues, and terms of proposed leases. Leases exempt from approval include those for a portion of a state park unit and with a term of 20 years or less. Amendments to existing leases or agreements are exempt from approval if they involve only a portion of a state park unit and generate less than $1,000,000 in annual gross revenue. The amendment to Section 5080.42 of the Public Resources Code does not significantly impact state funding or staffing levels, and does not involve state expenditures for the development of the unit. Section 5080.42 of the Public Resources Code allows the department to enter into operating agreements with nonprofit organizations for the management of state park units, with a limit of 20 units per agreement. The agreement must be approved by the director and may include various conditions. The district superintendent will liaise with the department, nonprofit organization, and the public. The nonprofit organization must submit an annual report to the department on its operating activities, including financial details for each state park unit it operates under an agreement. The report will be available to the public on both the department and nonprofit organization's websites. The qualified nonprofit organization must use all revenues from a unit for its care, maintenance, operation, and development. They can also provide in-kind services and funds from external sources for the same purposes. The qualified nonprofit organization can dedicate excess revenues from one state park unit to another unit for its care, maintenance, operation, administration, improvement, or development, if not already committed to specific purposes. General Fund moneys cannot be used to subsidize the operation or maintenance of a park unit by a nonprofit organization. The state can enter agreements with nonprofits to operate a portion of a park or share operational and financial responsibilities. Jobs under a memorandum of understanding between the state and bargaining units cannot be eliminated and will remain state employment. An operating agreement under subdivision (a) must respect the current term of a concession contract for the state park unit. It should outline the duties of the nonprofit organization regarding the management and protection of natural, historical, and cultural resources. The agreement should also specify which management duties will remain with the department to ensure all core park operations are defined. Scientific, architectural, and engineering tasks requiring specialized expertise must be carried out by qualified individuals overseen by the department. The nonprofit organization and district superintendent must hold a joint public meeting after submitting the annual report. This does not override the requirements for protecting natural, scenic, cultural, and ecological values as stated in Section 5019.53. The department must notify relevant parties before entering into an operating agreement for a unit, including estimated costs and responsibilities for a qualified nonprofit organization. An organization eligible to provide visitor services in state parks, improve facilities, offer interpretive services, and protect natural or cultural resources. Must comply with the Supervision of Trustees and Fundraisers for Charitable Purposes Act. The department must provide a biennial report to the Legislature on the status of operating agreements for state park units, including management, revenues, and benefits.
