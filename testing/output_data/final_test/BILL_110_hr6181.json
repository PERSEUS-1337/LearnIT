    "content": "The \"American Heroes' Homeownership Assistance Act of 2008\" is also known as the Qualified Service Member Homebuyer Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"American Heroes' Homeownership Assistance Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit of 10% of the purchase price of a principal residence for qualified service members or their surviving spouses. The credit is limited to $7,500, or $3,750 for married individuals filing separately. If multiple individuals purchase a home together, the credit is allocated by the Secretary. The tax credit under the \"American Heroes' Homeownership Assistance Act of 2008\" is limited to $7,500 for qualified service members or their surviving spouses. Individuals can only receive the credit once for the purchase of a principal residence. A qualified service member is defined as someone who served in a combat zone between 2001 and 2010. The term 'service member' refers to a member of the uniformed services, 'combat zone' is defined as per section 112(c)(2), 'principal residence' has the same meaning as in section 121, and 'purchase' means any acquisition not from a related person. The term 'purchase price' refers to the adjusted basis of the principal residence at the time of purchase. A residence constructed by the taxpayer is considered purchased when the taxpayer first occupies it. Related persons are defined based on their relationship to each other. The credit for the purchase of a residence is not allowed if the residence is financed by a tax-exempt mortgage, the taxpayer is a nonresident alien, or the taxpayer sells the residence. Related persons are defined based on their family relationship. If a taxpayer disposes of their principal residence before the end of the recapture period, they must include half of the credit allowed in their gross income in the following two taxable years. Exceptions apply in case of the taxpayer's death. Exceptions to the recapture rule include the taxpayer's death, involuntary conversion of a residence, and transfers between spouses or incident to divorce. In the case of a transfer of a residence to which section 1041(a) applies, paragraph (1) does not apply to the transfer. If the taxpayer acquires a new principal residence within 2 years of the disposition, paragraph (1) applies to the new residence during the recapture period. The recapture period applies to the taxable year following the year the credit is allowed. For joint returns, half of the credit is allocated to each individual. This section only applies to principal residences purchased before January 1, 2011. Conforming amendments are made to Section 26(b)(2) of the Code. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code, including the addition of a new subparagraph related to the recapture of qualified service member homebuyer credit. It also includes changes to sections 6211(b)(4)(A) and 1324(b)(2) of the Code, as well as updates to the table of sections. These amendments are part of the recapture period for the homebuyer credit and apply to principal residences purchased before January 1, 2011. The amendments made by this section apply to principal residences purchased by the taxpayer on or after the date of enactment of this Act."
