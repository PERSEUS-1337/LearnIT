    "content": "The purpose of spectrum policy, law, and regulation is to manage the electromagnetic spectrum for public benefit. It involves assigning rights to specific license holders or user classes, managed by the FCC and NTIA. Spectrum capacity is crucial for delivering wireless broadband services to consumers and businesses. Spectrum capacity is essential for delivering mobile broadband to consumers and businesses, as well as supporting industries that rely on fixed wireless broadband for fast and reliable data transmission. Spectrum policy involves allocating radio frequencies and managing exclusive licenses through auctions to avoid interference. The FCC has transitioned from using \"comparative hearings\" to market-driven solutions for assigning licenses. The FCC has used various methods to grant spectrum licenses, including comparative hearings and lotteries. Spectrum is allocated for specific purposes like WiFi, and there is a push for laws and regulations to reflect changes in wireless technology. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 includes provisions for spectrum reallocation and new assignments. The Spectrum Act, part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, focuses on spectrum assignment through competitive bidding systems. Provisions include deficit reduction, directed auctions, incentive auctions for TV broadcasters, reallocation of spectrum from federal to commercial use, and unlicensed spectrum. Other measures in the act aim to simplify zoning requests for cell tower modifications and facilitate antenna placement on federal property. The Spectrum Act, part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, focuses on spectrum assignment through competitive bidding systems. It has established a new authority for a nationwide public safety broadband network and includes measures for improved emergency communications. The act addresses spectrum access, deficit reduction, and extends the FCC's auction authority until FY2022. The legislation allowing the FCC to establish competitive bidding systems was first included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 extended FCC auction authority until 2011, further extended to 2012 by the DTV Delay Act. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allocated $7.363 billion for deficit reduction from auction proceeds. Most auction proceeds are deposited into a Public Safety Trust Fund, with $28 billion designated for various purposes, including $20.4 billion for deficit reduction. Proceeds from the sale of federal spectrum licenses go to the Spectrum Relocation Fund and the Public Safety Trust Fund. Proceeds from auctions of spectrum licenses are allocated to the Public Safety Trust Fund, with any remaining balances reverting to the Treasury in 2022. The law allows for transfers from the Trust Fund to cover costs specified in the act, with any remaining funds after FY2022 going towards deficit reduction. Auction proceeds are distributed to the NTIA to reimburse the Treasury for funds advanced. The Spectrum Act allocates funds in various priorities: $2 billion to reimburse the Treasury for establishing FirstNet, $135 million for State and Local Implementation, $7 billion for Network Construction, $100 million for public safety research at NIST, $20.4 billion for deficit reduction, $115 million for improving 911 services, and any remaining amounts for deficit reduction from auction revenues. The FCC and NTIA are required to identify specific bands for auction from designated spectrum for wireless services. The Spectrum Act mandates spectrum license auctions for specific bands for commercial wireless services and federal use, with a timeline of three years to commence the auction process. The Secretary of Commerce must identify 15 MHz of spectrum for reallocation from federal to non-federal use. NTIA has a Ten-Year Plan and Timetable to identify available spectrum for wireless broadband service, including a \"Fast Track Evaluation\" recommending 15 MHz of spectrum from frequencies between 1695 MHz. The NTIA has recommended reallocating 15 MHz of spectrum between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz for commercial use, with a potential for sharing between commercial and federal users. The FCC is required to complete auctions and issue licenses by February 22, 2015, providing an additional 65MHz of spectrum for commercial broadband. Incentive auctions are permitted under the Spectrum Act, allowing license-holders to relinquish spectrum for auction. Regulatory frameworks for sharing are being developed by the NTIA's CSMAC. The Spectrum Act allows license-holders, like television broadcasters, to participate in incentive auctions to repurpose their spectrum for different uses. The FCC follows established procedures for reallocating television broadcasting spectrum licenses through a reverse auction process where broadcasters determine compensation for voluntarily releasing spectrum for auction. The Spectrum Act allows TV broadcasters to participate in incentive auctions to repurpose their spectrum. Broadcasters may be compensated for voluntarily releasing spectrum for auction, either in cash or through regulatory relief. The spectrum released would be repurposed for commercial broadband communications through a forward auction, with minimum prices set by a reverse auction. Proceeds from the forward auction must cover payments to broadcasters, FCC auction costs, and relocation costs for other broadcasters. The Spectrum Act allows TV broadcasters to participate in incentive auctions to repurpose their spectrum. The FCC may make reassignments of television channels subject to certain conditions, including not assigning licenses to frequencies below existing assignments and ensuring no adverse effects on cross-border channel agreements. The auction and channel reassignment process may only occur once. The Budget Act of 1997 mandated the transition to digital television, providing broadcasters with spectrum for digital broadcasting. The completion of the transition in 2009 freed up the 700 MHz band for communications. The FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan proposed new changes based on technology advancements and consumer habits. The National Broadband Plan proposed sharing spectrum among TV stations to optimize usage and potentially auctioning unneeded spectrum. The Spectrum Act allows for incentive auctions and repurposing spectrum for commercial use. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act was amended to facilitate spectrum rights transfer to commercial buyers. The Spectrum Act allows for the transfer of spectrum rights to commercial purchasers from federal agencies, with reimbursable costs covering various technical options including spectrum sharing. The act prioritizes reallocating spectrum for exclusive, non-federal uses through competitive bidding. A Technical Panel within the NTIA reviews federal agency transition plans, with members required to be radio engineers or technical experts. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 established rules for federal agencies to cover costs of relocating wireless facilities to new spectrum assignments. The act created the Spectrum Relocation Fund for agencies to recover costs from auction proceeds. Successful bidders cover relocation expenses, with key provisions including auction requirements. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 established rules for federal agencies to cover relocation costs. Key provisions include recouping at least 110% of projected costs and reverting unused funds to the Treasury after eight years. The NTIA has produced a 10-year plan identifying spectrum bands for possible commercial wireless broadband service. Recommendations include making 100 MHz of spectrum available within specific bands. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, concluding it would cost $18 billion to clear federal users. Recommendations were made for federal and commercial users to share frequencies, with some frequencies identified for auction to the private sector. The NTIA assumptions for the cost of relocating federal agencies were challenged at a House Committee hearing. The NTIA faced criticism for not separately evaluating the 1755-1780 MHz band during a House Committee hearing. The GAO provided testimony on undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies, suggesting options like spectrum usage fees and identifying more spectrum for unlicensed use. The GAO found that further study by the NTIA and the FCC was needed for implementing spectrum sharing policies. In a hearing before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the GAO presented preliminary findings on Department of Defense estimates of reallocation costs from some radio frequencies, particularly focusing on the 1755-1850 MHz band. The GAO noted the variable nature of assumptions for costs and revenues related to spectrum relocation. Unlicensed spectrum is accessible to anyone using certified wireless equipment, used for various monitoring and communication needs. WiFi enables wireless Internet access for personal and business use, connecting to high-speed landlines through hotspots in homes or public locations. New technologies like Super WiFi are being developed to expand unlicensed spectrum use without interference. Geolocation database technology is used to identify unassigned white spaces between digital TV signals. Super WiFi devices are expected by 2013 to improve WiFi capacity. Studies are being conducted to expand commercial use of spectrum at 5 GHz. Commercial providers currently share parts of the spectrum with federal users. The FCC and NTIA are working on expanding commercial use of unlicensed spectrum at 5 GHz. The U.S. leads in mobile broadband technology, with companies driving innovation in mobile wireless and Internet convergence. The success of smartphones like the iPhone and WiFi has fueled economic growth. The Spectrum Act aims to increase spectrum capacity for wireless broadband by allocating additional spectrum, reassigning spectrum to new users, and opening up spectrum for unlicensed use. Policy options include sharing wireless network infrastructure, changing spectrum access cost structure, adopting spectrum-efficient technologies, and promoting spectrum sharing for new wireless technologies. Spectrum sharing is a key policy consideration for spectrum management, endorsed by the Obama Administration and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. They recommend increasing spectrum capacity through new technologies that allow for shared use of spectrum resources, potentially providing up to 1000 MHz of additional spectrum capacity through shared access between the federal government and commercial providers. The PCAST report recommends new spectrum policies based on spectrum-sharing technologies like geolocation databases, smart antennas, and cognitive radio. These technologies enable immediate sharing of TV broadcast spectrum with super WiFi, allowing communication devices to switch frequencies instantly for optimal use of available spectrum. Future breakthroughs in technology are also anticipated in this area. Future technological breakthroughs in fields like quantum communications could lead to even faster transmission speeds and spectrum efficiencies. Policy actions supporting spectrally efficient technologies could impact broadband policy goals in the long term. Advancements in wireless technology have given the US a competitive edge in communication innovation, driving industry growth and job creation. Policymakers need to consider maintaining leadership and adapting to changing economic and social expectations in the mobile network communications environment, which presents challenges like identity theft and privacy concerns. The curr_chunk discusses challenges and opportunities in policy areas such as identity theft, privacy protection, street crime, health services, education, urban management, and electronic payments. It highlights the need for new radio frequencies to meet the demands of the wireless industry and suggests rethinking spectrum policy to better serve wireless broadband deployment and national policy goals. The adoption of spectrum-efficient technologies may require a rethinking of spectrum management policies. Auctioning licenses could be replaced by auctioning access on a moment-by-moment basis. Auction winners are companies that maximize the value of spectrum as a corporate asset. However, auction-centric spectrum policies have focused on assigning licenses to commercial competitors, potentially directing assets to end-use customers instead of providing wireless services. Wireless networks are crucial for smart grid implementation. Wireless networks are essential for smart grid communications and other applications like railroad safety and water conservation. Telephone service was once a natural monopoly, regulated to benefit from economies of scale. Monopoly providers were expected to fulfill requirements for societal benefits. The regulated monopoly in the telecommunications industry was expected to meet society's needs and ensure costly infrastructure was in place. Past policies influenced current efforts to promote competition, with the FCC's focus on efficiency potentially leading to wireless competition becoming a monopoly. The shift towards competitive market mechanisms, such as spectrum license auctions in 1994, aimed to increase competition in the communications industry as outlined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to open up the communications industry to greater competition, leading to the establishment of different regulatory regimes for information networks and telecommunications. The wireless industry faces competition for spectrum licenses within a regulatory framework, prompting companies to adapt their business plans for the shift from voice to data. This change in infrastructure technology and regulatory environment may allow new players in wireless broadband, not limited to traditional telecommunications companies. Wireless broadband competition involves access to radio frequency spectrum, with differing viewpoints on prioritizing market economics or social goals in spectrum policy. Economic policy focuses on efficient spectrum allocation through auctions, while social policy aims to ensure wireless access for various social objectives. Both approaches can drive economic growth and job creation by reducing barriers to entry, such as high market entry costs. The FCC has identified barriers to entry in the commercial mobile communications industry, including first-mover advantages, large sunk costs, and access to spectrum. These factors are influenced by regulations related to spectrum allocation and assignment. The FCC allocated two spectrum licenses to each market, one to the incumbent provider and the other to a competing service provider. Early entrants benefited from regulatory decisions, not market competition, to acquire market-leader status. Large sunk costs, excluding spectrum purchase, are required to build infrastructure in the wireless market. The FCC allocates spectrum licenses to incumbent and competing service providers in each market. High sunk costs are needed to build wireless infrastructure, making it challenging for new entrants to compete effectively. Spectrum auctions and policy decisions can increase the cost of entry for license-holders. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to establish competitive bidding for spectrum allocation, prohibiting decisions based solely on federal revenues. It directed the NTIA to identify 200 MHz of federal radio frequencies for commercial use through auctions, with the FCC allocating these frequencies over a 10-year period. The FCC was instructed to ensure availability of frequencies for new technologies and services, stimulate wireless technology development, and consider reallocating spectrum for more efficient use. Auction rules have evolved with FCC and Congress policy goals, but provisions regarding spectrum allocation have remained unchanged. Service rules for spectrum licenses may have been geared towards specific goals. The FCC's rules for spectrum licenses may favor traditional telecommunications business models, potentially excluding companies with different business models. Public entities like utilities and co-operatives face constraints that limit their ability to participate in spectrum auctions. Federal spectrum policy perpetuates these limitations, impacting competition. The Federal Trade Commission promotes competition to reduce costs, encourage innovation, and expand choices for consumers in the wireless services market. Analysts generally view the U.S. wireless market as competitive, benefiting consumers with lower prices, better service, wider coverage, and new device options. Both the industry and regulators focus on improving wireless consumer welfare. The wireless industry and its regulator prioritize \"wireless consumer welfare\" when assessing competition and spectrum policies. Spectrum caps were implemented to prevent one company from controlling too much spectrum in a specific market, aiming to avoid foreclosure bidding and ensure fair competition. The FCC ruled to end spectrum caps in 2003, citing greater spectral efficiency from larger networks as a benefit. Spectrum caps were seen as barriers to mergers and growth in the wireless industry. Auction rules requiring timely network build-out were implemented to deter hoarding, and spectrum holdings were evaluated on a market-by-market basis for competitiveness. In 2008, the Rural Telecommunications Group petitioned the FCC to impose a spectrum cap of 110 MHz for holdings below 2.3 GHz, citing declining competition in the industry. They argued that larger carriers were warehousing spectrum in rural areas, hindering rural carriers' access to spectrum for mobile broadband. Opponents of the spectrum cap claimed the wireless market was competitive and more spectrum was needed for mobile broadband growth. The FCC is considering implementing spectrum caps to regulate competition and support mobile broadband growth. The Department of Justice highlighted the importance of deploying newly available spectrum for new market entrants to challenge broadband incumbents. Various initiatives have been put in place to help small and rural carriers acquire spectrum licenses. The FCC's efforts to encourage spectrum license ownership for small, rural, or entrepreneurial businesses are in response to congressional mandates. These programs have allowed many small carriers to remain in business, but the changing operating environment may disproportionately affect rural wireless carriers' ability to compete effectively. A study on how new technologies impact small and rural carriers' competitiveness could help review the effectiveness of policies intended to aid them. The FCC, with broad regulatory powers for spectrum management, was created as part of the Communications Act of 1934. The allocation of bands of frequencies for specific uses and the assignment of licenses within those bands are key components of spectrum policy. The Radio Act of 1912 was the first statute covering the regulation of airwaves in the United States, assigning usage rights to minimize interference among wireless transmissions. Decisions at the international level allocate frequency bands for specific uses, while assignment involves transferring spectrum rights to license-holders. FCC rules may favor traditional telecom business models over newer technologies like LTE, WiMAX, and WiFi, driven by the demand for mobile broadband services. Future technologies like LTE and WiMAX are changing the landscape of mobile broadband services. LTE, based on UMTS standards, uses Internet protocols to deliver large amounts of data efficiently. LTE will be implemented in stages using various frequency bands, while WiMAX initially focused on fixed wireless services before providing mobile broadband. WiMAX, an industry standard for broadband services, utilizes multiple frequencies worldwide. In the US, frequencies range from 700 MHz to 2.7 GHz and are led by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire. Fixed wireless services play a crucial role as backhaul links for 4G networks. The curr_chunk discusses backhaul technologies for mobile Internet access, including fiber optic cable and microwave radio relay transmissions. It also mentions the use of microwave links as a cost-effective alternative to fiber optic wire for network expansion plans. Additionally, it highlights the popularity of WiFi for wireless Internet access and its use in linking computer-based communications within a local area through hotspots. Cloud computing is a term used to describe IT resources accessed through a network like the Internet. Google offers services like word processing and email through Google Docs. It involves off-site data processing and storage. Cloud computing, utilizing advances in network technology, offers economies of scale to businesses of all sizes. Small businesses can benefit by avoiding hardware and software costs through cloud services. Consumers no longer need personal computers for complex programs or data storage. The convergence of 4G wireless technology and cloud computing accessibility will drive demand for wireless bandwidth. The development of channel management dates back to the radio telegraph era. However, in the age of the Internet, network-centric spectrum management is more efficient for providing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband. This technology enables sharing of radio signals similar to the Internet, allowing transmissions to move from node to node. Network-centric technologies help overcome radio limitations and manage interference effectively. The network is evolving to overcome radio limitations through concepts like Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Content-Based Networking. These technologies enable Internet-like management of spectrum resources, with the neXt Generation program (XG) spearheading development. The Department of Defense (DOD) is implementing network-centric operations (NCO) to enhance spectrum management efficiency. The Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) within the Department of Defense (DOD) is leading efforts to transform spectrum management for future net-centric operations. DARPA's Shared Spectrum Access for Radar and Communications (SSPARC) program aims to improve radar and communications capabilities in the 2-4 GHz frequency range. The DARPA's Shared Spectrum Access for Radar and Communications (SSPARC) program focuses on frequencies between 2 and 4 GHz, with potential applications to other frequencies. It aims to support military radar sharing environments with both military communications networks and commercial networks."
