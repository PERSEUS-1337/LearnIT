ENSURING FAIR AND EXPEDITIOUS FEDERAL COLLATERAL REVIEW OF CONVICTIONS FOR KILLING A CHILD. Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code is amended to limit jurisdiction for considering claims related to judgment or sentence in habeas corpus applications, requiring claims to qualify under specific grounds. Applications not filed in district court must be transferred for consideration or dismissal. Authorization from a court of appeals panel is needed for second or successive applications. The amended Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code limits jurisdiction for habeas corpus applications related to State court judgments involving crimes against individuals under 18 years old. Requirements for evidentiary hearings in district court include timely filing, granting or denying motions within specific timeframes, and conducting hearings accordingly. The amended Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code sets time limits for evidentiary hearings in district court related to habeas corpus applications for State court judgments involving crimes against individuals under 18 years old. The district court must convene the hearing within 60 days of the order and complete it within 150 days. A final order must be entered within 15 months of the State filing its answer or within 60 days of the case being submitted for decision. Failure to comply may result in the State petitioning the court of appeals for enforcement. The court of appeals must decide on a petition for a writ of mandamus within 30 days of filing. For appeals related to habeas corpus orders, a notice of appeal acts as a stay, and the court must rule within 120 days of the appellee's brief or within the deadline for the brief. If there is a cross-appeal, the decision must be made within a specified timeframe. Following a decision by a panel of the court of appeals, a petition for panel rehearing is not allowed, but rehearing en banc may be requested. The court of appeals must decide on granting a petition for rehearing en banc within 30 days of filing, unless a response is required. The court of appeals must make a final determination of an appeal within 120 days if rehearing en banc is granted. Failure to comply allows the State to petition the Supreme Court for enforcement. Time limitations apply to initial and subsequent applications, as well as redeterminations or appeals after a remand. In proceedings following a remand by the court of appeals or the Supreme Court, time limits for further proceedings in the district court or court of appeals are determined based on the need for additional briefing. If no further briefing is required, time limits run from the date of the remand order. If additional briefing is necessary, time limits start from the date of filing a responsive brief or the due date if no timely brief is filed. The time limit for further proceedings in habeas cases following a remand by the court of appeals or the Supreme Court is determined based on the need for additional briefing. Failure to meet time limitations does not grant relief from a judgment of conviction or sentence. Victims' rights in habeas cases arising from a State conviction are extended under section 3771(b) of title 18, United States Code. The amendment made by this section applies to pending cases, including those commenced before the enactment of this Act. In cases pending on the enactment date, time limits will run from that date if the amendment affects events before then."
