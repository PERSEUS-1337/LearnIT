The program details were finalized on August 23, 2019, with up to $16 billion in new funding authorized by the President. This initiative builds on the 2018 trade aid package under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. The 2019 trade aid package, with $16 billion in new funding, builds on the previous 2018 package to assist farmers affected by tariff retaliation and trade disruptions. It includes three assistance programs and aims to help agricultural producers while trade disputes are resolved, particularly with China. The 2019 trade aid package, with $16 billion in funding, includes three programs to assist producers affected by trade disputes, notably with China. The package consists of a Market Facilitation Program providing direct payments to eligible producers, and a Food Purchase and Distribution Program to purchase surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation. The 2019 trade aid package includes $1.4 billion for purchasing surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation, such as fruits, vegetables, processed foods, beef, pork, lamb, poultry, and milk for distribution to low-income individuals. Additionally, $100 million is allocated for an Agricultural Trade Promotion Program to develop new export markets for U.S. agricultural producers. Notable differences from the 2018 package include increased funding of up to $16 billion, an expanded list of eligible commodities, and a modified payment formula for non-specialty crops. The 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments for non-specialty crops will be based on planted acres to avoid reductions due to lower yields from wet spring conditions. The payment limits have been expanded, with a maximum combined limit of $500,000 per individual across commodity groups. Adjusted gross income (AGI) eligibility criteria have also been updated based on average AGI for 2015-2017. The 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments are based on AGI for 2013, 2014, and 2015. The AGI limit of $900,000 for eligibility was initially in place for 2018 MFP payment recipients, but it was retroactively eliminated if 75% of a farm's AGI came from farming operations. This expanded AGI interpretation applies to 2019 MFP payments based on a different three-year period. Producers of eligible commodities can receive direct payments by submitting application forms during the signup period from July 29 to December 6, 2019. More information is available on USDA's MFP program website. Producers of MFP-eligible commodities can apply for MFP payments if they meet certain criteria, including having an average AGI of less than $900,000 per year or an AGI in excess of $900,000 with at least 75% derived from farming activities. Compliance with conservation regulations and filing a 2019 acreage report are also required. Crop insurance or participation in other CCC programs is not mandatory for eligibility. In 2019, USDA categorized eligible commodities for MFP payments into three groups: non-specialty crops, specialty crops, and animal products. Each group has different payment structures, with non-specialty crops receiving a county payment rate based on total acres planted, while dairy, hogs, and specialty crops receive a national payment rate based on production history or acres under cultivation. Eligible non-specialty crops include alfalfa hay, barley, canola, corn, and more. In 2019, USDA changed the payment structure for MFP-eligible non-specialty crops to a fixed county payment rate based on total plantings in that county. This was done to avoid influencing producer crop choices and discrepancies in payment rates across commodities. In 2019, USDA changed the payment structure for MFP-eligible non-specialty crops to a fixed county payment rate based on total plantings in that county. Producers' total MFP-eligible plantings in 2019 may not exceed total 2018 plantings. MFP payment rates vary across counties based on historical crop data, with minimum and maximum rates set at $15 and $150 per acre. Producers affected by adverse weather can receive $15 per acre for planting FSA-certified cover crops. Non-planted acres in 2019 are not eligible for MFP payments. Producers of non-specialty crops and cover crops must have planted by August 1, 2019, to qualify for MFP payments. Dairy producers will receive $0.20 per hundredweight payment, while hog producers will get $11 per head. Specialty crop producers like almonds, cranberries, and walnuts will also receive MFP payments based on their 2019 acres. Payments will be made in up to three tranches, with the first payment being 50% of the calculated amount or $15 per acre. The USDA began processing the first tranche of MFP payments on August 22, 2019. The second tranche was announced to be sent out on November 18, 2019. Producers with payment rates equal to $15 per acre will not receive a second or third tranche. For those with rates between $15 and $30 per acre, the second tranche will cover the remaining balance. Producers with rates over $30 per acre may receive up to 75% of their calculated payment. As of November 25, 2019, $10.2 billion had been paid out under the first and second tranches, with the possibility of a third tranche depending on market conditions. The third and final MFP payment, starting in January 2020, will be based on USDA's evaluation of market conditions. Payments are capped at $250,000 per crop year for non-specialty crops, dairy, and hog producers, and specialty crop producers. There is no limit on total payments across the three commodity groups. MFP payments do not affect other farm bill payment limits and may be received for the same acres eligible for ARC or PLC payments. Under the 2018 MFP program, soybean producers received $7 billion in payments, with soybeans allocated the largest payment rate at $1.65 per bushel. In 2019, MFP payment rates ranged between $15 and $150 per acre, with regions heavy in cotton and sorghum production receiving the highest rates. In 2019, MFP payment rates ranged from $15 to $150 per acre, with some counties receiving the maximum payment. Cotton acreage likely influenced higher payment rates in southern states. USDA is implementing a $1.4 billion FPDP program to purchase surplus commodities affected by trade retaliation for distribution to low-income individuals. The USDA administers the ATP program to provide cost-share assistance to U.S. organizations for activities to boost exports for agriculture, food, fish, and forestry products. In 2019, $100 million was awarded to 48 organizations through the ATP to help farmers access new export markets. In 2018, the Secretary had broad discretionary authority to implement a $12 billion trade aid package in response to foreign tariffs. A second round of trade aid worth $16 billion was announced in 2019. The USDA used CCC authority to fund these programs without congressional involvement, sparking increased interest due to the $28 billion total aid provided. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have created uncertainty about U.S. exports. The use of CCC authority to mitigate tariff-related losses may set a precedent for future situations, with some suggesting annual trade aid packages could continue as long as trade disputes persist. While most farm commodity groups support the trade aid package, concerns have been raised about the equity of 2018 MFP payments and the rationale for determining payments based on \"trade damage.\" Some economists believe USDA is overpaying farmers for trade losses under the 2019 formulation. The USDA's Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments have raised concerns about overpaying farmers for trade losses. There is interest in whether these payments comply with WTO commitments, especially regarding the annual spending limit on trade-distorting farm subsidies. The details of the MFP payment formula were published on August 23, 2019. The USDA's Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments for the 2018 and 2019 trade aid packages were based on gross trade damages caused by foreign retaliatory trade actions. The payments were calculated using commodity-specific rates for non-specialty crops, hogs, dairy, and specialty crops. The methodology for estimating trade damages was the same for both years, but different time frames were used, resulting in varying payment rates. The 2018 and 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments were based on gross trade damages caused by foreign retaliatory trade actions. Different time frames were used for calculations, resulting in varying commodity-specific MFP payment rates. The 2019 methodology included a longer historical time series and combined commodity-specific rates at the county level to derive a single county-level MFP payment rate. Hogs, dairy, and specialty crops retained national MFP payment rates but with different values due to the extended \"look-back\" period for estimating trade damages. The 2018 MFP payment rates were calculated based on gross trade damages caused by retaliatory tariffs from Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, and Turkey. USDA estimated direct trade losses for each affected commodity by comparing expected trade values with and without tariffs. The 2019 methodology adapted county-level payments for non-specialty crops and national-level rates for specialty crops, hogs, and dairy. The USDA compared U.S. exports in 2017 to 2018 levels affected by retaliatory tariffs. The final trade impact was uncertain, so USDA estimated export values with and without tariffs using a global trade model. Indirect effects like market price declines due to high soybean production were considered. The USDA estimated trade damage for each affected commodity by dividing it by the crop's production in 2017 to calculate a national commodity-specific damage rate. This rate was used to determine the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payment for producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, fresh sweet cherries, and shelled almonds. For hog and milk producers, the MFP payment was based on a producer-selected inventory. The USDA calculated trade damage for each commodity using 2017 production data to determine MFP payments for corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, sweet cherries, and almonds. For hog producers, payments were based on inventory, while milk producers had rates multiplied by production history. In 2019, USDA adjusted the methodology by using 2019 retaliatory tariffs and 10 years of export data for payment calculations. The USDA calculated trade damage for each commodity using 2017 production data to determine MFP payments. The methodology was adjusted in 2019 by using 10 years of historical U.S. export data to capture trade losses for certain commodities. The estimated trade damage for each affected commodity was divided by the crop's average production to calculate a national commodity-specific damage rate. County-level payment rates were established based on historical county data for affected commodities. The USDA calculated trade damage for each commodity using 2017 production data to determine MFP payments. The county-level trade damage for each MFP-eligible crop was estimated by multiplying average yield, planted acres, and damage rate. This generated a unique county-level MFP payment rate based on crop mix and planted acres. In 2019, producers received MFP non-specialty-crop payments based on county-level rates, independent of individual crop choices. Wet conditions prevented planting on some acres, making them ineligible for payments, but planting USDA-approved cover crops on these acres qualified for a $15-per-acre payment. This approach aimed to prevent distortion of county-level MFP payments. The 2019 MFP payments were non-commodity-specific outlays but required planting an MFP-eligible crop. $1.4 billion was allocated for purchasing agricultural commodities under the 2019 FPDP program, with deliveries starting in January 2020. The USDA announced funding allocations under the ATP program for 2018 and 2019 trade. Products purchased can be adjusted to accommodate changes in growing conditions, market conditions, and program capacity. These products will be distributed to food banks, food pantries, elderly feeding programs, tribes, and child nutrition programs. USDA allocated $300 million in funding to 59 organizations under the 2018 and 2019 ATP programs. $200 million went to 57 organizations in 2018, while $100 million was shared among 48 organizations in 2019."
