Congress finds that early childhood is crucial for developing healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors to prevent obesity. Infants as young as 7 months exhibit eating patterns similar to older children and adults. Encouraging movement in children under 1 year old can enhance physical activity and motor skills. Exposure to healthy foods early on increases the likelihood of preferring and consuming nutritious foods, leading to healthy growth and improved learning abilities. (5) Healthy eating can improve a child's learning ability and lead to higher academic performance, along with mental, social, and physical well-being, contributing to increased self-esteem. (6) A 2010 study showed that daily physical activity is essential for healthy weight maintenance, learning fundamental motor skills, and socioemotional and cognitive skills in children. Adequate physical activity benefits children physically, psychologically, and socially. (7) About 20 percent of 2-year-olds spend over 2 hours a day watching TV or videos. (8) Each additional hour of TV watching is linked to negative health outcomes. A study in Pediatrics found that increased TV watching at age 2 is linked to declines in school engagement, math achievement, and physical activity, as well as increases in bullying, consumption of unhealthy snacks, and BMI at age 10. Another major study revealed that a third of overweight kindergarteners became obese by eighth grade, emphasizing the need for early intervention. In 2012, most preschoolers in the US spent their day in sedentary activities in child care programs. The early childhood care and education setting plays a crucial role in promoting healthful habits for children ages birth through 5. Programs and collaboratives in various states have reached thousands of children, improving nutrition and physical activity practices. The purpose of this Act is to influence practices, policies, and environments in early care and education settings to support healthy habits and enhance provider training on promoting healthy eating. The Act aims to educate providers on promoting healthy habits in early care and education settings, monitor progress, and engage families in healthy practices for children ages birth to 5. The Healthy Kids Program, part of the Public Health Service Act, includes definitions under Section 399OO. The program focuses on promoting healthy habits for children ages birth to 5.

The Maternal and Child Health Bureau will provide grants to eligible entities with expertise in early childhood health and obesity prevention. Eligible entities include nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, research centers, or consortia of these entities. Funds must be used to identify areas of opportunities and goals for improving healthy eating and physical activity for children aged birth to 5 in early care settings. An entity receiving a grant under this section must identify areas of opportunity and set goals to promote healthy habits among children aged birth through 5 years in early care settings.

The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for selecting implementing partners for grants related to promoting healthy eating and physical activity in early care and education settings for children ages birth through 5 years. Partners must have existing infrastructure, capacity, expertise in children's health, and the ability to implement evidence-informed interventions. The Secretary will use funds to track State progress in obesity prevention policies and practices of early care and education programs through approved entities. A report to Congress will evaluate program results and provide recommendations for future guidance. Authorization of Appropriations: $4,000,000 for each fiscal year 2017-2021 and $1,700,000 for fiscal year 2017 to track State progress in obesity prevention policies and practices in early care and education programs."
