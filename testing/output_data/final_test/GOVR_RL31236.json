The solicitation requested interested providers to identify Berry Compliant Athletic shoes in the commercial marketplace, including descriptions, sales volume, cost, and manufacturing capacity. Responses were due by February 18, 2014. The DOD issued a solicitation in January 2014 to assess the availability of American-made shoes compliant with the Berry Amendment. Interested providers were asked to provide information on production quantities, lead times, manufacturing locations, and confirm full domestic product offerings. Some companies reported being capable of producing 100% domestic athletic footwear for military personnel. The Berry Amendment ensures American soldiers use American-made materials, including footwear. Proposed provisions in H.R. 1960 and S. 1197 were not included in the enacted bill. The House bill required the Department of Defense to issue compliant athletic footwear to Armed Forces members, but this provision was not included in the final agreement. The Berry Amendment ensures American soldiers use American-made materials, including footwear. The Army and Air Force have shifted to providing recruits with an allowance to purchase athletic footwear. A domestic contractor is now producing Berry Amendment compliant athletic footwear. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to issue a Sources Sought to identify domestic manufacturers meeting the Department's requirements. The House bill includes a provision for the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to audit compliance with the Berry Amendment, which requires buying certain articles from American sources. The audit will assess if athletic footwear meets requirements and if Department policies are followed. The House bill includes a provision for the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to conduct periodic audits of contracting practices related to procurement under section 2533a of title 10, United States Code. The audits' findings will be included in the semiannual report transmitted to congressional committees. H.R. 1960, introduced in the House on May 14, passed in a recorded vote (315-108) on June 14, and was referred to the Senate on July 8, 2013. The bill included provisions impacting domestic source restrictions, such as requiring American flags to be procured domestically and mandating DOD to report on supply chain vulnerabilities during sole source procurement. The curr_chunk discusses vulnerabilities created by single source suppliers and recommendations to reduce them, including requirements for domestic sourcing of footwear and periodic audits of contracting practices related to the Berry Amendment. H.Rept. 113-102 highlighted the Committee's interest in enforcing domestic source provisions under the Berry Amendment. The committee is concerned with protecting the domestic production base for components and weapon systems vital to the Armed Forces. A provision in the Act requires periodic audits by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to review compliance with sourcing restrictions under the Berry Amendment. The Defense will conduct an audit of the Department's compliance with contracting practices related to procurement under the Berry Amendment. The Inspector General will include audit findings in the semiannual report to congressional committees. S. 1197 was introduced on June 20, 2013, and referred to the Armed Services Committee. S.Rept. 113-44 directed DOD and the Army to study domestic sourcing for athletic footwear for enlisted members. The committee directs U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center to complete a study by January 1, 2014. The committee directs the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center to study available Berry compliant athletic footwear by January 1, 2014, to meet the Department of Defense's needs for new recruits. The study will assess sizes, fit, cost, and availability of products. The committee is concerned about compliance with the Berry Amendment for athletic footwear, textiles, and clothing, and requests a report on audits, investigations, and procurement practices. The Defense Logistics Agency procures American flags through DLA Troop Support, ensuring they are made in the U.S. The procurement of U.S. flags is not under the authority of the Berry Amendment. The Berry Amendment does not specifically include U.S. flags, but the fabric used to make flags is covered under Title 10, USC \u00a72533a (b) (1) (D). U.S. flags are not exempted from the Berry Amendment, but only items specifically listed are covered. The coverage of rayon used in flags was waived in 2001. The waiver for rayon yarn/thread in clothing and textile items was granted in 2001 based on domestic non-availability. The Department of Defense has contracts with domestic suppliers for U.S. flags, including Allied Materials and Alphasoft/Dawn's Early Light. There is no specific list of domestic flag producers. Allied Materials, Alphasoft/Dawn's Early Light, US Flag & Signal, Valley Forge Flag Company, and All Seasons are U.S. companies supplying flags to the Department of Defense. Rayon, not domestically available, is covered under the 2001 DNAD. Section 826 of H.R. 4310 requires textile components for Afghan uniforms to comply with the Berry Amendment. The NDAA for FY2012 required \"best value\" as the basis for contracts for tents and temporary structures, clarified the Berry Amendment for purchases from domestic sources, and repealed the sunset of procuring fire resistant rayon fiber from foreign sources for uniforms. DOD published an interim rule to implement these provisions, with a deadline for public comments. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 implemented a rule prohibiting DOD from specifying the use of fire-resistant rayon fiber in solicitations before January 1, 2015. Section 821 required reports on the supply chain for fire-resistant materials for military uniforms. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the application of the Berry Amendment to tents and related items. The committee directs the Defense Logistics Agency to review the interpretation of the statute regarding buying certain articles from domestic sources, specifically tents, tarpaulins, or covers. P.L. 111-383 provided a non-availability exception for domestic hand or measuring tools procurement. On March 17, 2011, DOD issued an interim rule in accordance with Section 847, published in the Federal Register with a public comment period extended through May 16, 2011. The final rule was published on August 19, 2011. A June 2011 GAO report examined fire-resistant materials in military uniforms procured under various regulations and legislative initiatives like P.L. 111-383 (H.R. 6523). Section 821 of P.L. 111-383 required reports on the supply chain for military uniform procurement. The legislation mandated an assessment of the supply chain for fire-resistant fibers for military uniforms due to concerns about fire-related injuries from IED attacks. The assessment focused on the sources and properties of fire-resistant rayon fiber for military uniform production. The Department of Defense is examining the procurement of fire-resistant rayon fiber for military uniforms, looking at alternatives and their effectiveness, as well as addressing any obstacles to their use. Additionally, they are assessing how uncertainty in the availability of fire-resistant rayon fiber impacts the textile industry and business practices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that an Austrian company was the sole source for fire-resistant rayon fiber for military uniforms, and the Department of Defense (DOD) was exploring alternative options. There was debate over the superiority of fire-resistant rayon compared to other alternatives. GAO did not provide a recommendation but assessed the sufficiency of the Berry Amendment for defense industrial protection. The 2003 report directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess the sufficiency of the Berry Amendment in protecting the defense industrial base and explore alternatives to maintain critical industries during war and peace. GAO acknowledged the positive impact of the Berry Amendment in maintaining domestic suppliers for unique military needs but noted the overall decline in the domestic clothing and textile industry due to factors like declining employment, production levels, and free trade agreements affecting the supply chain. The Berry Amendment and its impact on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) supply chain were addressed through legislative provisions. P.L. 111-5 included a provision similar to the Berry Amendment, known as the \"Kissell Amendment,\" restricting DHS from purchasing certain textiles unless made in the U.S. Additionally, the Berry Amendment Extension Act proposed further restrictions on DHS procurement related to national security. The Berry Amendment Extension Act aims to restrict DHS procurement of certain textiles unless they are grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States. H.R. 679 (112 th Congress) and H.R. 3116 (111 th Congress) were introduced to enforce these restrictions. The Berry Amendment Extension Act proposed restrictions on DHS procurement of textiles unless they are made in the US. H.R. 917 (110th Congress) introduced similar restrictions on clothing and textiles. In 2008, there were reports of proposals to broaden exceptions under the Berry Amendment. John Young submitted proposals for the FY2009 National Defense Authorization bill, including waiving the Berry Amendment during emergency operations and giving contracting preference to indigenous groups for economic development. Another proposal aimed to allow the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources. Two public resources, DOD's Office of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) and the U.S. Department of Commerce, provide information on the Berry Amendment, including FAQs and a website for manufacturers. The Berry Amendment imposes domestic source restrictions on DOD acquisitions, prohibiting the purchase of certain items not made in the U.S. This legislation aims to protect the U.S. defense industrial base by favoring American-made products in federal procurement. The Berry Amendment, introduced in 1941, amended the Buy America Act to include wool as a domestically produced material. It was codified in 2001 under the FY2002 National Defense Authorization Act, giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to waive the domestic sourcing requirement under certain conditions. The controversy over the procurement of black berets and the waiver authority has sparked interest in the Berry Amendment. The Berry Amendment, with its provisions and restrictions like the specialty metal clause, has sparked debate among policy makers. Some argue it contradicts free trade policies, while others believe U.S.-based companies need its protections. In 2000, the Army announced the black beret as standard headgear, planning to issue 1.3 million berets to soldiers at a cost of $23.8 million. The first contract was awarded to Bancroft, an Arkansas-based company. The Defense Logistics Agency granted waivers to purchase black berets from foreign firms due to insufficient U.S. production capacity. This decision sparked protests from domestic manufacturing, military groups, and Congress. The House Small Business Committee held a hearing on May 2, 2001, to discuss waiving Berry Amendment restrictions for Bancroft, the sole U.S. manufacturer of black berets. Despite using materials from foreign sources, Bancroft was granted a waiver to continue production for the Army. DOD awarded Bancroft a $14.8 million contract in 2002 to manufacture berets for the Army and Air Force. The Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia awarded a contract for 3.6 million black berets to 13 vendors. The Berry Amendment ensures that U.S. troops wear uniforms and eat food produced in the U.S. Small businesses losing contracts to foreign sources is a concern for some. The Berry Amendment, enacted on the eve of World War II, requires that U.S. troops be fed with food products solely produced in the United States. It was added to override exceptions in the Buy American Act of 1933 for products procured by the Department of Defense. Concerns were raised about the nation's preparedness for adversity, leading to the legislation. The Berry Amendment, enacted on the eve of World War II, requires U.S. troops to be fed with food products solely produced in the United States. Questions were raised about the disposal of surplus wheat and the purchase of foreign wool. A bill was enacted into law on April 5, 1941, requiring the purchase of American agricultural products for national defense needs. Representative Walter B. Jones introduced a bill to amend Title 10 of the United States Code in response to controversy surrounding the procurement of black berets. Walter B. Jones introduced H.R. 1352 to make the Berry Amendment a permanent provision of law, addressing the black beret controversy and the need to improve the law's effectiveness. The bill required the Secretary of Defense to notify relevant committees before granting waivers. These provisions were enacted into law as part of the FY2002 National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 107-107. The Buy American Act (BAA) and the Berry Amendment are often confused, but they have key differences. The BAA gives preference to domestically produced products in federal government purchases, while the Berry Amendment governs DOD procurement specifically, overriding many BAA exceptions for food, clothing, and specialty metals. The BAA applies only to contracts within the United States, while the Berry Amendment is not limited to U.S. contracts. The Berry Amendment requires items to be 100% domestic in origin, while the BAA allows for 50% of costs to be from foreign components for defense contracts. Other domestic source provisions exist for specific types of procurement not covered by the BAA or Berry Amendment. Some argue that the Berry Amendment restrictions may not always provide the best value to DOD or the federal government. The Berry Amendment preserves certain items for national security interests, but some argue for consideration of U.S. workers and businesses. Certain restricted items align with the original intent, like chemical warfare protective clothing and specialty metals for high-tech electronics. Food restrictions may hinder DOD's use of commercial practices in a globalized economy. Many food suppliers struggle to comply with Berry Amendment restrictions, leading to challenges in selling to DOD. Economic, social, and political factors impact the purpose of the amendment. Maintaining these restrictions can benefit small businesses but may also result in job losses in industries like textiles and apparel. The U.S. textile and apparel industries lost 540,000 jobs in the 1990s. The Berry Amendment is relevant due to post-9/11 security concerns. Some specialty metals and steel products covered by the amendment are produced by struggling U.S. industries like Bethlehem Steel. Restrictions under the Berry Amendment ensure domestic production of critical items like ballistic fibers for military protection. Proponents argue that the Berry Amendment is necessary to maintain a viable industrial base for critical industries, ensuring the capacity to feed and clothe military forces. Critics claim it hinders free market competition, reduces business incentives to modernize, causes inefficiency, and increases costs for the DOD. Critics argue that the Berry Amendment may undermine international trade agreements and cause delays in procuring body armor for U.S. troops. DOD officials have differing views on the necessity of the Amendment, with a 1989 report suggesting alternative approaches to ensure a stable supply for mobilization purposes. The Berry Amendment, along with other federal and DOD acquisition regulations, restrict foreign-source participation in U.S. defense contracting, deviating from full and open competition. In 1997, the DOD Acquisition Reform Executive Focus Group recommended easing some Berry Amendment restrictions on food, clothing, and textiles while keeping restrictions on specialty metals and measuring tools. Former DLA Deputy Director, Major General (Ret.) Charles R. Henry, emphasized the importance of the Berry Amendment in maintaining a strong U.S. industrial base during times of adversity and war. Some proponents of the Berry Amendment argue against foreign dependency for critical military items to avoid supply issues during war. They suggest expanding the Amendment to cover new industries like Homeland Security. Critics claim the Amendment hinders free market competition. Critics of the Berry Amendment argue that it undermines free market competition, promotes discriminatory practices, and leads to inefficiency and higher costs for the DOD. They also believe it will harm U.S. technological edge, alienate foreign trading partners, and hinder international trade agreements. Additionally, restrictions on food purchases limit DOD's ability to buy foreign products. In 2006, the Berry Amendment Reform Coalition proposed legislative reforms advocating for exceptions to the Berry Amendment for domestic specialty metals. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for FY2007 moved the specialty metal provision out of the Berry Amendment to protect strategic materials critical to national security. The Army's black beret controversy highlighted issues with the sourcing of materials for military apparel. The Army's black beret controversy raised questions about the Berry Amendment's restrictions on domestic sourcing for military apparel. Congress may consider examining these restrictions to determine their impact on the defense industrial base and relationships with foreign trading partners. Options include retaining current provisions, eliminating selected restrictions like those on food, to allow for more cost-effective commercial practices. The Pentagon and Congress may consider eliminating restrictions on food and clothing sourcing for the military to promote competition and cost-effectiveness. This would allow food suppliers to use foreign ingredients and processing, making it easier to do business with the Department of Defense. The Buy American Act would still give U.S. suppliers an advantage, while DOD could find the best items at competitive prices by modifying the clothing restriction. The Department of Defense has known for 25 years that it does not produce a solely domestic beret. One proposed alternative is to classify restricted items as \"high-tech\" or \"low-tech,\" with different waiver requirements. Military uniform components like the beret could be classified as \"low-tech\" to allow procurement without a waiver. Congress may revise the Berry Amendment to consider articles as domestic if \"substantially all\" components are sourced domestically, similar to the Buy American Act. This could prevent future procurement issues like those seen with the Army black beret. The House-passed version of H.R. 1588 proposed a provision in Section 829 to broaden the definition of \"domestic\" origin for Department of Defense purchases under the Buy American Act. The provision would have required items to be at least 65% domestic in origin to be considered domestic. This would have allowed DOD to procure items with a combination of domestic and foreign origin, departing from the 100% domestic requirement of the Berry Amendment. However, this provision was ultimately dropped from the final bill. Congress could seek input from trade associations and labor organizations on future procurement issues. The American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) supports the preservation of the Berry Amendment and suggests Congress consider the impact of restrictions on U.S. companies and workers. Congress could solicit opinions from trade associations, labor organizations, and industry experts on the use of Berry Amendment restrictions and waivers. This approach is seen as preferable to an \"all or nothing\" stance by some interest groups. During Desert Storm, the apparel and textile industry demonstrated its ability to rapidly increase production in response to a major contingency. The number of manufacturers producing camouflage fatigues increased from nine to sixteen, producing 5 million fatigues by 1991. Congress may consider the impact of Berry Amendment restrictions on U.S. relationships with foreign trading partners and could appoint a commission to study the effects on the industrial base, national security, and military capabilities. The Congress could appoint a commission to investigate military procurement contracts for compliance with the Berry Amendment. There were proposals to broaden domestic source provisions related to the Berry Amendment during the 110th-113th Congresses. Congressional testimony suggested potential instances of non-compliance with the Amendment. The Secretary of Defense's waiver authority under the Berry Amendment was broadened by Congress through proposed and enacted laws. Provisions aimed to expand coverage to new items like athletic footwear and additional agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. DOD issued an interim rule in 2013 to implement compliance requirements with the Berry Amendment, specifically for textiles procured for military uniforms for the Afghan National Army or Police. The Berry Amendment compliance extends to the Afghan National Army and Police. Legislation introduced in 2013 aimed to ensure that footwear for enlisted members meets Berry Amendment requirements. This includes purchasing athletic footwear in the same manner as other military uniform items. The Berry Amendment requires domestic origin for footwear. Bills like S. 2114 and H.R. 679 were introduced to extend the amendment. H.R. 2955 aimed to include athletic footwear under the Berry Amendment. P.L. 112-81 clarified the intent of the Berry Amendment for military purchases. The Berry Amendment Extension Act, introduced by Senator John D. Rockefeller, seeks to extend the provisions of the Berry Amendment to the Department of Homeland Security. Similar bills have been introduced in previous Congresses, including the \"American Shoes for American Servicemembers Act\" introduced by Representative Mike. The \"American Servicemembers Act\" introduced by Representative Mike Michaud on September 15, 2011, seeks to amend the Berry Amendment to include athletic footwear. Another related bill, H.R. 6262, the Jobs through Procurement Act, introduced by Representative Phil Hare on September 29, 2010, aims to strengthen domestic sourcing requirements. Additionally, H.R. 5013, the Implementing Management for Performance and Related Reforms to Obtain Value in Every Acquisition Act of 2010, introduced by Representative Robert Andrews on April 14, 2010, focuses on acquisition reforms. The proposed measure introduced by Representative Robert Andrews to the Senate Armed Services Committee includes provisions to ensure compliance with the Berry Amendment and Buy American Act, as well as not procuring products from manufacturers in the US that violate labor standards. H.R. 5013 also includes amendments to strengthen the application of the Berry Amendment to defense procurement. H.Amdt. 617 expressed Congress's sense that DOD should comply with the Berry Amendment and Buy American Act, and not procure products from US manufacturers violating labor standards. H.R. 3116, introduced by Rep. Larry Kissell, aimed to extend the Berry Amendment to prohibit purchasing certain textiles unless made in the US. H.R. 917, introduced in 2007, also addressed the Berry Amendment. H.R. 917, the Berry Amendment Extension Act, introduced in 2007 by Rep. Robin Hayes, aimed to restrict DHS from buying certain textiles unless made in the US. The bill was referred to the House Homeland Security Subcommittee but no further action was taken."
