Section 205(c)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act is amended to prohibit assigning a social security number to individuals authorized to work in the U.S. under a specific Department of Homeland Security memorandum. This includes individuals who came to the U.S. as children or are parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Additionally, there is a prohibition on the payment of Title II benefits. SEC. 3 amends sections of the Social Security Act to prohibit payment of Title II benefits to certain individuals. SEC. 4 denies credit towards benefits for earnings from unauthorized work. The amendment to the Social Security Act prohibits crediting quarters of coverage for individuals not authorized to work in the US. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide necessary information to enforce this limitation. The Secretary of Homeland Security will develop and maintain information on individuals authorized to work in the US, including their personal details, authorization dates, and naturalization dates.
