Oil industry profits increase with high prices, led by major companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. These companies operate across the oil supply chain globally. The financial performance of major oil companies from 2007-2011 is analyzed in this report. The market structure for oil in the United States, influenced by oil prices and company profits, could impact gasoline prices, availability, and energy security. Crude oil prices are determined by quality grades based on specific gravity and sulfur content, leading to different prices for different types of crude oil. The prices of crude oil, specifically West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent, serve as benchmarks for other grades of crude oil. However, the spot and futures prices of these reference crude oils may not accurately reflect the actual prices paid by refiners or received by producers. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes data on the Refiners Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil, showing the escalating oil prices from 2007 to 2008 due to tight global market conditions and growing demand, especially from China. The price of oil declined in late 2008 and remained lower through 2010 due to consumer response to high prices and the recession. High prices in 2011 were caused by supply disruptions like the Libyan civil war and Iranian threats. Domestic crude oil is generally purchased at a higher price than imported crude, likely due to quality differences. The revenues of major oil companies fluctuated from 2007 to 2011 in response to oil price movements. Despite the volatility in revenues, the production activities of these companies remained stable during this period. The major oil companies did not significantly increase or decrease production in response to changes in oil prices from 2007 to 2011. Possible reasons for this include internal planning prices, challenges in finding new production resources, and external factors like geology, politics, or economics. This behavior deviates from market economic theory. Major oil companies have not adjusted output in line with market economic theory based on price signals. The oil market's characteristics make it challenging to fit into the model of free market adjustments. Natural gas reserves, production, and consumption in the United States have increased due to non-conventional natural gas technologies and economics. Some suggest the United States may have 100 years of reserves. The United States may have 100 years of reserves of non-conventional natural gas. The big five oil companies have shown interest in expanding their positions in the natural gas market. ExxonMobil increased its natural gas production by 41% between 2009 and 2011 through the acquisition of XTO Energy Inc. Chevron also expanded its natural gas reserves by purchasing Atlas Energy Inc. The companies' enhanced positions in the natural gas market occurred as the wellhead price of natural gas was volatile and declining. Net income is the amount available to management after deducting all costs of operation, interest on debt, and taxes. The net incomes of the five major oil companies from 2007 to 2011 are shown in Table 6, reflecting corporate earnings from various business segments. Upstream and downstream sectors are key sources of net income in the oil industry, with profits generally following oil price trends. Record profit years in 2008 and 2011 were observed, with ConocoPhillips' loss in 2008 attributed to its Luk Oil venture in Russia. BP's 2010 net income was impacted by costs unrelated to oil price volatility. In 2010, BP's net income was affected by the Macondo oil spill, with adjusted income at $20.5 billion. Upstream activities are the main source of earnings for major oil companies, with ExxonMobil earning 84% from upstream activities in 2011. Downstream activities are crucial as crude oil has little consumer value until refined into petroleum products. The major oil companies derive small portions of their total net incomes from downstream activities. Downstream profits have recovered from 2009 lows but have not reached 2007 levels. Refiners may pass on high crude oil prices to consumers if markets are growing and demand is not sensitive to price increases. However, in stagnant markets, full pass-through of costs may not be possible, leading to lower refining profits. The refining industry faced challenges in 2009 due to economic conditions, with high gasoline prices and a weakened demand. Analysts suggest major revisions are needed to meet future demand patterns. Transition in the U.S. market was observed, with companies like ConocoPhillips splitting into two independent entities. Sunoco left the refining sector to focus on logistics and marketing. The oil industry's capital projects are long-term commitments, taking years for full production to begin after initial analysis. Refineries' construction or expansion also takes years to complete. Capital budgets are stable due to the lagged nature of exploration, production, and refining activities. Political realities limit major oil companies' capital allocations. The oil industry faces constraints in development due to limited areas open to private firms and availability of construction resources. Balancing the need to expand reserves with market stability is crucial, as excess supply can lead to a sharp decline in crude oil prices. The price of crude oil can tumble to excessive levels, impacting oil company profits and the fiscal budgets of oil exporting nations. Capital expenditures, including exploration expenses, are a significant part of oil companies' financial activities. Exploration expenses make up a small portion of total capital expenditures, with acquisitions and other financial transactions also included. The five major oil companies focus on generating returns for their shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Dividends are direct earnings distributions per share, while stock repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, increasing dividends per share. Retired shares can be reissued at the company's discretion. Retired shares from the company treasury can be reissued at any time without further approvals. They represent potential capital for future investments. The oil industry's profitability is closely tied to the price of crude oil, which fluctuates due to economic conditions, political developments, and new markets. Changes in oil prices impact company profitability, with high prices leading to windfall gains. The industry's financial position is subject to future changes as oil prices have fluctuated since the 1970s. The oil industry's financial position is subject to future changes as oil prices have fluctuated since the 1970s. Despite capital expenditures not increasing oil and gas production, companies have provided returns to shareholders. High oil prices are expected to keep major oil companies profitable, with small changes in net incomes or revenues having minimal effects on operations."
