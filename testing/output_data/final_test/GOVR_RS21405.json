There are variations in dates cited in the Code of Federal Regulations and declarations of war. Armistice dates are sometimes confused with termination dates. Title 38, Part 3, Section 3.2 of the Code of Federal Regulations lists official beginning and termination dates for war periods for veterans' benefits. Dates from Indian Wars to recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are included. Service requirements and C.F.R. citations are provided. The Code of Federal Regulations, Section 3.2, specifies official beginning and termination dates for war periods for veterans' benefits, including Indian Wars, the Philippine Insurrection, the Boxer Rebellion, and service in Mexico, Russia, and other conflicts. The Code of Federal Regulations specifies official beginning and termination dates for war periods for veterans' benefits. Veterans who served in the U.S. military forces in Russia until April 1, 1920, are considered to have World War I service if they served between April 5, 1917, and November 12, 1918. The armistice for World War I was signed near Compi\u00e8gne, France, on November 11, 1918, and ended on July 2, 1921. For World War II service, veterans who were in service on December 31, 1946, are considered to have continuous service until July 26, 1947. During World War II, war was declared against six countries, with official surrender ceremonies held in Reims and Berlin. Hostilities ceased on December 31, 1946, and the state of war with Germany ended on October 19, 1951. The state of war with Germany was terminated on October 19, 1951, by a Joint Resolution of Congress and Presidential Proclamation 2950. No peace treaty was signed with Germany. The Japanese surrendered on September 2, 1945, on the USS Missouri, and hostilities ceased on December 31, 1946. The Multilateral Treaty of Peace with Japan was signed on September 8, 1951, ratified on March 20, 1952, and became effective on April 28, 1952. The Joint Resolution of Congress on December 11, 1941 declared the cessation of hostilities by presidential proclamation on December 31, 1946. The Treaty of Peace dated at Paris on February 10, 1947, terminated the state of war, effective September 15, 1947. The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces attacked South Korea. President Truman ordered U.S. military support, and the United Nations Security Council called for assistance in repelling the North Korean forces. Council adopted a resolution seeking U.N. members' help to repel the North Korean attack and restore peace. The President authorized the use of U.S. air and ground units as needed without a declaration of war from Congress. An armistice was signed in 1953, but no peace treaty followed. The Joint Resolution of Congress supported the President's determination to defend against armed attacks in Southeast Asia. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution was repealed in 1971, and the Agreement Ending the War in Vietnam was signed in 1973. U.S. Marines were deployed in Lebanon in 1982 as part of a multinational force. On October 25, 1983, U.S. troops were deployed to Grenada and on December 21, 1989, President George H.W. Bush ordered U.S. military forces to Panama. These operations were known as Operation Urgent Fury and Operation Just Cause, respectively. It is important to note that participation in these conflicts does not automatically grant veterans' status to servicemembers. During the Gulf War, Congress passed H.J.Res. 77 authorizing military force against Iraq, which was signed by the President on January 14, 1991. Operation Desert Storm began on January 17, 1991, with the air war phase, followed by the ground assault on February 24, 1991. A cease-fire was declared on February 28, 1991, with terms negotiated in Safwan, Iraq on March 1, 1991.

Trump extended the national emergency with respect to Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303 beyond May 22, 2018, for 1 year. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush demanded Afghanistan's leaders to hand over Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders, which was rejected. The Administration sought international support from the United Nations for military action against Afghanistan. The UN resolution after 9/11 authorized military action, leading to the US passing a bill for the use of force. President Bush signed the bill, allowing the use of force against those responsible for the attacks. US military operations in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001. President Obama announced the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2011, with plans for a responsible transition of forces out of the country. The drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan began after achieving key goals in defeating al-Qaeda and the Taliban. President Obama and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the end of combat operations in 2014, marking the transition to a follow-on mission in 2015. This marked the conclusion of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) after 13 years, with a ceremony held in Kabul attended by U.S. commanders and NATO troops. In January 2015, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced the focus of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan on training Afghan security forces under Operation Freedom's Sentinel. Approximately 13,000 troops, mostly from the U.S., were deployed alongside NATO nations for the Resolute Support Mission (RSM) to train and assist Afghan Security Institutions and Defense Forces. General John F. Campbell defined the U.S. military's objectives in October 2015, including a Counter-Terrorism mission. President Obama announced in 2015 that 9,800 U.S. troops would remain in Afghanistan through 2016, with 5,500 troops expected to stay by the end of the year. President Trump later outlined his strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia in 2017, emphasizing the importance of counterterrorism operations and training Afghan security forces. \"In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America's interests are clear: stop safe havens for terrorists and prevent nuclear weapons from falling into their hands. Army General John M. Nicholson handed over command to Army General Austin S. Miller in Kabul, emphasizing the mission to make their countries safer by training Afghan security forces to fight terrorists and provide stability.\" In mid-2002, the George W. Bush Administration deployed U.S. troops to Kuwait and debated sending troops to Iraq. H.J.Res. 114 was signed into law as P.L. 107-243, authorizing military force against Iraq. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 found Iraq in breach of past resolutions on weapons of mass destruction. In March 2003, President George W. Bush initiated Operation Iraqi Freedom against Iraq after Saddam Hussein's government remained uncooperative with U.N. investigators. By May 1, 2003, major combat actions in Iraq were declared over, but U.S. troops remained. In January 2010, the Multinational Forces-Iraq transitioned to United States Forces-Iraq under General David Petraeus. On December 15, 2011, U.S. Armed Forces in Baghdad marked the official end of the war in Iraq with a ceremony transferring command from General Ray Odierno to General Lloyd J. Austin. President Obama had announced the end of the American combat mission in Iraq on August 31, 2010, with a transitional force remaining for advising and assisting Iraqi security forces. The military operations in Iraq were officially designated as Operation New Dawn on September 1, 2010. The official end of the war in Iraq was marked in Baghdad by top U.S. military leaders after nearly nine years of conflict that resulted in the deaths of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops. Army General Martin E. Dempsey, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and others addressed officials and troops at Baghdad International Airport. The DOD designated U.S. and coalition operations against ISIL as \"Operation Inherent Resolve\" on October 15, 2014. The Combined Joint Task Force\u2013Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) was established to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) along the Syrian-Iraqi border. Airstrikes by U.S. and coalition forces continue, with operations costing $14.3 billion since August 8, 2014."
