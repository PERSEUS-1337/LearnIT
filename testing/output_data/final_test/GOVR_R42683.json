    "content": "This report discusses resilience in critical infrastructure and homeland security, focusing on policy evolution at the Department of Homeland Security. Critical infrastructure is defined as vital systems and assets with a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety. DHS has identified 18 sectors, including electric power generation and distribution. The Department of Homeland Security focuses on resilience in critical infrastructure, which includes systems like electric power generation, drinking water, communications, oil and gas, transportation, and banking. Resilience is defined as the ability to withstand and recover from adversity or change, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or technological failures. This is a key element in the nation's homeland security strategy and remains a topic of interest in Congress. The report focuses on the resilience of critical infrastructure, defined as the ability to recover from adversity or change. Researchers across various fields have applied this concept to their studies since the 1990s. In the 1990s, researchers and policymakers began applying the concept of resilience to communities and vital infrastructures to mitigate the impact of earthquakes. Now, the concept is also being considered for reducing risks from terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure operations. Resilience is defined in various ways, but all definitions assume a disruption in normal system performance. Resilience is defined as the ability of a system to recover quickly from a disruption in performance or to adapt to changed conditions. It can be applied to various systems such as public drinking water systems, electric power grids, or national railroad systems. Performance can be measured in different ways, such as the number of households being served. Resilience is the ability of a system to recover quickly from disruptions or adapt to changed conditions. Performance can be measured in various ways, such as the number of households served or power generated within an electric grid. Time can be measured in seconds or years. System A's performance is shown in Figure 1, with a constant 100 units during normal operations. Figure 2 illustrates a disruption, like a flood, causing performance to drop to 60 units before recovering to 100 by Time = 7. The performance of System A is depicted in Figure 3, showing a sudden failure, gradual recovery, but not returning to the original performance level. Resilience is measured by the time to fully recover and the total loss of performance. There is no standard definition or measure of resilience. The difference between normal operations and interrupted performance equals the loss of performance during disruption. Reducing total loss of performance increases resilience, which can be measured by time to recover and initial reaction to the event. Measurement of resilience may vary based on policymakers' priorities, such as monetary losses or time to full recovery. Improving resilience can be achieved by adding redundancies to assets or systems, such as rerouting production flows through parallel components. Having backup components available can also enhance resilience by quickly replacing disrupted functions. For example, firms with multiple production facilities can increase production at unaffected sites if one facility shuts down. Mobile communication is a prime example of resilience, as messages can still flow even if some routers are lost. Substitution and redesigning processes can enhance resilience by replacing disrupted components or assets. For example, mobile communication assets can be deployed to areas where fixed assets are lost. Backup transformers for electric power distribution can be transported as needed. Industrial burners can switch between fuels, and materials can be substituted for each other. Redesigning products and processes can reduce vulnerabilities to specific threats. Redesigning processes and assets can enhance resilience by reducing vulnerabilities to specific threats. Improvisation during disruptive events, re-engineering processes in real-time, and practicing improvisation exercises can improve the ability to respond creatively to unique situations. Having a detailed understanding of how an asset or system operates is crucial for enhancing resilience. Enhancing resilience of critical infrastructure assets involves prioritizing access to resources, modeling system operations, assessing vulnerabilities, and contingency planning. Preparedness is crucial for utilizing backup systems or alternative sources of materials during events, even though it may incur costs. The financial feasibility of resiliency enhancing options depends on the risks a firm, community, or nation is willing to accept. Homeland security is about effectively managing risks to the Nation's security, defined as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents based on likelihood and consequences. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan guides risk assessment and management for critical infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan outlines how risk is influenced by threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Risk can be reduced by addressing any combination of these factors. Improving resiliency helps by reducing vulnerability and potential consequences of attacks or natural events, such as designing buildings to withstand earthquakes or floods. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force report in January 2006 emphasized the importance of enhancing resilience in protecting the nation's critical infrastructure. This includes promoting resilience as the top-level strategic objective to drive effective policies and strategies. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force report in January 2006 emphasized promoting resilience as the top-level strategic objective to drive national policy and planning, aligning directives for risk-based decision-making with the objective. The Task Force highlighted the bias towards defensive measures in current strategies and guidance, stating that it is not feasible to protect all possible targets against every threat. The Task Force recommended a strategy based on resilience to complement protection efforts for critical infrastructure. This approach would involve considering a wider range of options to reduce risks and improve business case for investing in resilience over solely focusing on protection and vulnerability reduction. The Task Force recommended a strategy based on resilience to complement protection efforts for critical infrastructure, emphasizing the need to focus on resilience rather than justifying investments in protection or vulnerability reduction. Other organizations and individuals also called for a greater emphasis on resilience in addressing homeland security, highlighting the importance of preparing the nation and its critical infrastructure to absorb catastrophic incidents. James Carafano echoed the need for a shift towards strategies that prioritize resiliency over unrealistic approaches focused on protecting infrastructure. Spending billions on protecting infrastructure still leaves the nation vulnerable. Resiliency focuses on sustaining society in the face of threats and disasters. Brian Jackson at RAND discussed weaknesses in solely preventive strategies, citing uncertainties in identifying threats and targets. Addressing threats with resilience is crucial. Jackson argues that while traditional preventative measures may seem more appealing as the scale of potential attacks increases, resilience offers a way to reduce consequences and broaden risk reduction strategies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council found the current policy framework sound but recommended improvements to better reflect principles of resilience. The report recommended expanding funding for resilience programs and grants, setting resiliency goals for each sector, and building resilience in infrastructure. Early government policy documents did not mention resilience but focused on strategic investments in protection and security to deter terrorist attacks. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (2002) emphasized the importance of resilience in infrastructure protection efforts. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force's debate influenced the development of the 2006 National Infrastructure Protection Plan by DHS, which highlighted the need for infrastructure to be both robust and resilient through effective protection and response planning. The final 2006 version of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) by DHS emphasized resilience, defining it in the glossary and discussing building a more secure and resilient nation. It included research goals for self-healing systems as a resilience measure, but still considered resilience part of a protective strategy. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) emphasized resilience in its list of protective actions, including developing redundancies and back-up systems. In a 2008 hearing, Robert Stephan from DHS stated that resilience was integrated into their operations but emphasized the importance of balancing protection and resilience. The Assistant Secretary emphasized the importance of protection and resilience in critical infrastructure efforts, including measures such as hardening facilities, building redundancy, and implementing security systems. The 2009 update of the NIPP included resiliency in its title, indicating a shift towards a more resilient approach to infrastructure protection. The 2009 update of the NIPP emphasized resilience in infrastructure protection efforts, with a focus on incorporating resilience strategies into protective programs. The update aimed to increase the emphasis on resilience as a risk reduction approach without signaling a major policy shift. The NIPP Program Office provided additional guidance to agencies to better integrate resilience into Sector Specific Plans. The Obama Administration established a Directorate for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resiliency Policy in 2009. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review in 2010 emphasized the importance of resilience in homeland security policy. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review in 2010 highlighted the need for resilience in homeland security. The QHSR identified five core missions, with Mission 1 focusing on preventing terrorism and enhancing security. Goal 1.3 under this mission aims to manage risks to critical infrastructure, key leadership, and events by protecting critical infrastructure and making it resilient. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review in 2010 emphasized the importance of resilience in homeland security, with a focus on enhancing the ability of critical infrastructure systems to withstand and recover from damage. Mission 5 aimed at Ensuring Resilience to Disasters through goals such as mitigating hazards, enhancing preparedness, effective emergency response, and rapid recovery. The National Security Strategy also highlighted the concept of resilience, calling for strengthening security and resilience at home. The strategy emphasized the need to strengthen security and resilience at home by developing public-private partnerships, incentivizing resilient design, ensuring redundant systems, decentralizing critical operations, testing continuity plans, and investing in infrastructure maintenance. In March 2011, the Obama administration issued a new Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 8, National Preparedness, to enhance security and resilience. The PDD 8, National Preparedness, aims to strengthen the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for threats. It calls for the development of a National Preparedness Goal with core capabilities in prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. Mitigation was added as a primary modification, and capability targets are to be identified for each core capability. The concept of resilient critical infrastructure is addressed in the mitigation, response, and recovery missions. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) emphasizes building resilient systems, communities, and critical infrastructure to reduce vulnerability and adverse consequences. The debate between promoting protection or resilience as the strategic vision may seem like a semantic argument, but there is a significant difference between the two. Protection focuses on reducing risks through physical barriers and security measures, while resilience involves developing plans to rebuild infrastructure for future resilience. Protection focuses on reducing risks through physical barriers and security measures, while resilience involves developing plans to rebuild infrastructure for future resilience. DHS has incorporated resiliency into its guiding documents, acknowledging that both protection and resilience are essential for risk reduction efforts. Policymakers should consider both aspects when assessing the best options for reducing risks. While protection focuses on reducing risks through physical barriers and security measures, resilience involves rebuilding infrastructure for future resilience. DHS has integrated resilience into its policies and goals, with Assistant Secretary Robert Stephan mentioning various activities aimed at improving critical infrastructure resilience. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has programs to help critical infrastructure owner/operators identify threats, assess vulnerabilities, and develop protective measures. This includes the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), training on NIPP implementation, information sharing networks, and support for partnership meetings. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council and the Community Resilience Task Force found that government lacks cohesive programs addressing critical infrastructure resilience. Resilience is not well understood by key homeland security stakeholders. The Government Accountability Office found that resilience is not well understood by key homeland security stakeholders, leading to a lack of policies and specific means to assess, achieve, or sustain resilience. Despite this, some programs within the Department of Homeland Security do consider resilience, such as Site Assistance Visits and the Enhanced Critical Infrastructure Protection Security Survey. The Department of Homeland Security has programs like the Enhanced Critical Infrastructure Protection Security Survey (ECIP) and the Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP). They are training Protective Services Agents (PSAs) to incorporate resiliency concepts into their interactions with critical infrastructure owners and operators. PSAs facilitate Site Assistance Visits (SAVs) and use the ECIP survey to collect security-related information and develop metrics for comparing facility security. The ECIP survey assesses dependencies on infrastructures, contingency plans, and develops a Resiliency Index based on robustness, resourcefulness, and recovery elements. It includes a \"dashboard\" to visualize indexes and make changes for overall protection and resilience. The Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) expands and integrates ECIPs to assess vulnerabilities and responses across critical assets in a region. The Resiliency Index is based on robustness, resourcefulness, and recovery elements, but it is not a measure of actual resilience in terms of recovery time or costs. The Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP) evaluates vulnerabilities in water supply and response strategies for facilities. It highlights the importance of considering broader regional factors in contingency planning. The program focuses on natural disasters and the need for resiliency measures in critical infrastructure. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted the lack of tracking for resiliency measures taken by infrastructure owners/operators. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is working on incorporating resiliency concepts into training programs for Protective Security Advisors (PSAs). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers grant programs focusing on community and regional resilience, including critical infrastructure resilience. Grants like SHSGP and UASI support preparedness activities for states and local communities, considering critical infrastructure presence when allocating budgets. These grants can fund overtime personnel costs and vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructure assets. The grants provided by FEMA can support vulnerability assessments and security plans for critical infrastructure assets. They can also aid in citizen preparedness through Citizen Corps Councils. Government entities can use the grants to purchase equipment for protective measures at critical infrastructure sites, with costs incurred by state and local governments. The impact is limited to assets owned or operated by the government. The grants provided by FEMA support the formation and activities of Citizen Corps Councils and vulnerability assessments for critical infrastructure assets. These grants contribute to community resilience by assisting in planning, organizing, and implementing response and recovery efforts after natural disasters or terrorist events. FEMA also administers a Transit Security Grant Program to secure transportation infrastructure such as buses, ferries, and passenger rail. Allowable activities include planning, operations, and equipment purchases. The FY2012 grant guidelines for the Transit Security Grant Program prioritize operational activities, operational packages, and remediation of assets on the Top Transit Asset List. Operational activities include training, drills, public awareness, and security planning. The Top Transit Asset List includes critical assets like underwater tunnels, underground stations, and high-density bridges. Grantees must work from a risk assessment and security plan that considers redundant or backup assets for the transportation system. The FY2012 grant guidelines for the Port Security Grant program prioritize enhancing recovery and resiliency capabilities, including protecting tunnel ventilation and drainage systems, flood gates, and plugs to mitigate damage from events. Eligible recipients include private sector facility owners/operators. The FY2012 Port Security Grant program prioritizes enhancing recovery and resiliency capabilities for private sector facility owners/operators. Recipients must belong to a port-wide management planning group and participate in a port-wide risk management plan. Funds can be used for operational activities, planning, equipment, training, and exercises, including construction for continuity of critical port operations. FEMA also supports mitigation grant programs. FEMA supports mitigation grant programs such as Hazard Mitigation and Pre-Disaster Mitigation, focusing on risk assessments, mitigation plans, and implementation of measures. Eligible expenses include property purchase, clearing, and structural improvements. Courses are offered on mitigating risks against terrorist attacks, with guidelines published for building safety. The documents mention resilience measures for safe school projects and terrorism risk management in buildings, including fire-resistive construction techniques and designs to resist collapse. FEMA's PS-Prep program, established by Congress, provides voluntary standards for private sector preparedness in emergency situations. The PS-Prep program provides standards for private sector preparedness in emergency situations, including protective/preventive options and resiliency-related measures. AT&T was the first firm to receive certification under PS-Prep in March 2012. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate focuses on research, development, and innovation to promote resiliency. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate focuses on research, development, and innovation to promote resiliency, with a significant portion of the budget allocated to protection-oriented projects. The Acquisition and Operations Support program supports the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute, which focuses on infrastructure resilience and contributes to a greater understanding of resilience in homeland security. The program supports over 150 projects, with a focus on developing new sensor technologies and systems for surveillance and threat detection in various environments. Some technologies could also aid in response and recovery efforts after a chemical, biological, or radiological attack. Additionally, projects in the Disaster Resilience area specifically target incident response and recovery. The Disaster Resilience projects focus on incident response and recovery, developing decontamination techniques, incident management systems, and information sharing systems. Projects aim to reduce damage from attacks and improve system functionality post-incident. Examples include the Resilient Electric Grid project and Blast Analysis of Complex Structure projects. In Cyber Security, projects also aim to enhance resilience. The Cyber Security thrust includes projects like Experimental Research Testbed, Leap Ahead Technologies, Moving Target Defense, and Tailored Trustworthy Spaces focusing on keeping information networks secure during attacks. DHS contributes to community resilience through grants and assistance programs, with recent emphasis on risk mitigation. However, private sector critical infrastructure assets often do not receive assistance from these programs. DHS has helped assess risks for critical infrastructure but has not fully implemented resilience-oriented corrective measures recommended by advisory councils. There is reluctance to use public funds for privately owned assets, and market incentives may not be enough to drive investments in risk reduction. Congress has not taken significant action in this area. Congress has primarily overseen critical infrastructure resilience, with a focus on metrics and the PS-Prep program. DHS has struggled to measure owners' resilience actions, and Congress may revisit the program's status and identify implementation obstacles. Updating metrics on firms adopting resiliency measures and seeking certification through the PS-Prep program could reveal the need for additional incentives. Congress may expand grant programs for private sector critical infrastructure operators, potentially requiring budget reallocation. Alternatively, making voluntary standards mandatory for high-risk assets could be considered, although recent challenges in establishing cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure suggest obstacles. Efforts to establish cybersecurity standards for privately held critical infrastructure would spark significant debate."
