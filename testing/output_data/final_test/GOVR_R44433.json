    "content": "The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, allowing for the transmission of various types of wireless communications. The allocation and management of radio frequency spectrum are overseen by the FCC for commercial and nonfederal uses, and by the NTIA for federal government use. The electromagnetic spectrum is segmented into bands of radio frequencies measured in hertz. Frequencies are abbreviated as kHz, MHz, and GHz. Licenses are issued on a geographic basis, with larger bands preferred for technologies like LTE and Wi-Fi. Geographic coverage has also expanded, benefiting larger carriers but potentially creating barriers to entry. The FCC has developed a system of exclusive licenses for specific radio frequencies, with auctions being a market-driven method for assigning licenses. Previously, licenses were granted through \"comparative hearings\" and lotteries. Spectrum can also be allocated for specific purposes like Wi-Fi without assigning a license (unlicensed spectrum). Legislation authorized the FCC to establish competitive bidding for spectrum licenses. The FCC established a system of competitive bidding for radio frequency spectrum licenses, with auction authority extended through various legislative acts until FY2025. Net proceeds from auctions are typically deposited in the U.S. Treasury. The FCC conducts auctions of spectrum licenses, with proceeds deposited in the U.S. Treasury for deficit reduction. Over $40 billion has been generated from auctions, with $33 billion applied to deficit reduction. The Broadcast Incentive Auction is expected to provide $10 billion to $40 billion for deficit reduction. The Spectrum Pipeline Act is expected to contribute $4.4 billion to deficit reduction by FY2025. Revenue from spectrum license auctions is directed to the Public Safety Trust Fund, with $20.4 billion allocated for deficit reduction. Additional auction proceeds will also be used for deficit reduction. License sale revenue from repurposed federal spectrum goes to the Spectrum Relocation Fund. The Spectrum Pipeline Act directs revenue from spectrum license auctions to the Public Safety Trust Fund, with a portion allocated for deficit reduction. Proceeds from the sale of advanced wireless service licenses and new licenses created by the release of television broadcasting spectrum also contribute to the Public Safety Trust Fund. FirstNet is a major beneficiary of the funding, with auction proceeds distributed to the NTIA. Balances in any fund created by the act will revert to the Treasury in 2022 for deficit reduction. Auction proceeds from spectrum license auctions are distributed to various funds within the NTIA. Priorities include reimbursing the Treasury for establishing FirstNet, grants for state planning, network construction costs, public safety research, deficit reduction, and improving 911 services. The Spectrum Act funding obligations have been met with proceeds from auctions held in 2014-2015. Remaining net proceeds will be deposited in the Treasury for deficit reduction. CBO projected approximately $30 billion in revenue from three auctions. Key estimates for scoring a bill with spectrum licenses include quantity, market value, and historical auction values. The Spectrum Act funding obligations have been met with proceeds from auctions held in 2014-2015, totaling approximately $30 billion in revenue. The CBO projected an average market value of $0.70 per megahertz per person for spectrum licenses auctioned during the FY2013-FY2022 period. Completed auctions included the H Block at $0.50 MHz-pop and AWS-3 at $2.21 MHz-pop. The CBO also estimated a $25 billion net proceeds value for the remaining required auction, the Broadcast Incentive Auction. The Spectrum Act requires the FCC and NTIA to identify specific bands for auction from designated spectrum for commercial wireless services and federal use. Spectrum license auctions are mandated for various frequencies, including 1915-1920 MHz, 1995-2000 MHz, and 2155-2180 MHz. The estimated MHz-pop values vary between $1.50 and $2.21 based on different reports. The Secretary of Commerce must identify 15 MHz of spectrum as per the act. The Spectrum Act required the FCC to reallocate 15 MHz of spectrum for commercial use, with the NTIA recommending the 1695-1710 MHz band. Auction 96 in January 2014 offered the H Block frequencies, with a reserve price of $1.56 billion. Dish won all licenses for $1.564 billion. Auction 97 in January 2015 auctioned Advanced Wireless Service spectrum licenses. Auction 97, known as AWS-3, offered 65 MHz of AWS spectrum licenses covering various frequency bands. The auction grossed nearly $44.9 billion, with $5.1 billion allocated for relocation or sharing of federal government frequencies. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile were among the top bidders, acquiring a total of 583 licenses for over $22.6 billion. Sprint did not participate, while Dish acquired 702 licenses valued at $13.3 billion through designated entities. The FCC reversed designated entity status for SNR Wireless LicenseCo., LLC and Northstar Wireless, LLC, requiring them to pay full auction price. Dish affiliates returned 200 licenses valued at $3.5 billion and paid penalties. Federal frequencies at 1695-1710 MHz and 1755-1780 MHz were reassigned for commercial use in Auction 97, to be shared with federal incumbents. Successful commercial bidders will share frequencies with federal systems migrating to other frequencies. Some federal systems are transitioning to new frequencies, including the 1695-1710 MHz range auctioned for shared use with weather satellite systems. Licensees must coordinate with federal users to avoid interference and follow transition plans on the NTIA website. The Spectrum Act allows the FCC to conduct incentive auctions, rewarding license-holders like television broadcasters for repurposing spectrum for different uses. The Spectrum Act allows the FCC to conduct incentive auctions for TV broadcasters to voluntarily release spectrum for commercial broadband use through a reverse auction process. Broadcasters may receive compensation for relinquishing spectrum or for relocation costs. The repurposed spectrum is then sold through a forward auction for commercial broadband communications. The Spectrum Act allows the FCC to conduct incentive auctions for TV broadcasters to release spectrum for commercial broadband use through a reverse auction. The outcome of the forward auction depends on the results of the reverse auction, and auction proceeds must cover various costs for the auctions to be valid. If auction revenues do not cover costs, new licenses may not be assigned, and reassignments may not occur. The FCC may reassign television channels in a forward auction if certain conditions are met, such as not reassigning licenses to lower frequency bands and ensuring no adverse effects on cross-border agreements. The auction process, known as Auction 1000, consists of two parts: Auction 1001 (reverse) and Auction 1002 (forward). The FCC also released a Public Notice establishing Incentive Auction bidding procedures on August 11, 2015. The FCC initiated the Broadcast Incentive Auctions on March 29, 2016, with a market-based spectrum reserve of up to 30 MHz to enhance competitive bidding. The first phase involved broadcasters volunteering to release up to 126 MHz of spectrum for sale, with the next phase determining prices payable to broadcasters. The Broadcast Incentive Auctions began on May 31, 2016, with offers totaling over $86 billion for 100 MHz of spectrum. The first forward auction started on August 16, 2016, but failed to meet FCC rules. A second stage set new targets, with wireless carriers required to meet $54.6 billion in the next auction starting on October 19. The FCC concluded an auction with bids reaching $20.95 billion. Stage 3 of the auction will clear 108 MHz of spectrum, with 80 MHz offered in the forward auction starting on November 1, 2016. Industry analysts doubt there is enough demand to cover the $88 billion target, with potential buyers willing to invest around $40 billion. The FCC's rules allow for repeated auctions until supply and demand reach equilibrium, or until demand from wireless carriers falls short of broadcasters' selling price. If the auction fails, the FCC may consider reallocating broadcast spectrum. The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 requires the NTIA to make 30 MHz of spectrum available for licensing to nonfederal users below 3 GHz, with certain restrictions. The FCC concluded an auction with bids reaching $20.95 billion, and Stage 3 will clear 108 MHz of spectrum. 108 companies completed applications to bid in Auction 1002, with 62 qualified applicants submitting good faith payments. The number of qualified bidders participating in Stage 3 is confidential. The NTIA must identify suitable spectrum for reallocation by January 2022, with FCC auction proceedings starting by July 2024. Two additional tranches of 50 MHz each below 6 GHz must be identified for nonfederal use. Reports to congressional committees are due by January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2025, including assessments of federal use, bidding timelines, and plans for licensed and unlicensed use. The FCC's auction authority is extended to FY2025 for required auctions. The act also updates criteria for the federal Spectrum Relocation Fund administration and eligible uses. The Spectrum Pipeline Act expands funding for research and development, engineering studies, and planning activities to improve federal spectrum efficiency. It requires reports to Congress on the impact of rules changes and proposals for additional spectrum bands. Three tranches are mandated for identifying auctionable and unlicensed spectrum, starting with 30 MHz below 3 GHz. The NTIA must identify suitable spectrum by January 2022, with FCC auctions beginning by July 2024. Two more tranches of 50 MHz each below 6 GHz are required for nonfederal use. Reports to Congress are due by January 2022 and 2025, detailing federal use assessments and auction plans. The FCC's auction authority is extended to FY2025, and criteria for the Spectrum Relocation Fund are updated. The FCC is tasked with reallocating federal spectrum below 3 GHz for nonfederal or shared use through competitive bidding by January 1, 2022. Bands like 1300-1390 MHz, 2200-2290 MHz, 2700-2900 MHz, and 2900-3100 MHz are being evaluated for repurposing, including for radar, space research, air traffic control, and defense purposes. The goal is to clear identified spectrum for new uses. The Spectrum Pipeline Act mandates the FCC to reallocate federal spectrum below 6 GHz for nonfederal or shared use through competitive bidding by July 1, 2024. The NTIA must provide information to the FCC for identifying additional spectrum for reallocation. Two reports to Congress are required, each identifying 50 MHz of spectrum suitable for licensed or unlicensed use below 6 GHz. Additional bands for reallocation include 3100-3500 MHz, allocated for federal use and used by DOD for national defense. The 3500-3650 MHz band is used by DOD for radar, with potential for nonfederal sharing. The 3700-4200 MHz band is used for satellites, with paired frequencies for Earth-to-space transmissions. The 4200-4400 MHz band is reserved for altimeters on aircraft, with discussions on releasing two 20 MHz bands. The Spectrum Act and Spectrum Pipeline Act address repurposing spectrum for commercial use through auction or sharing. The Spectrum Act and Spectrum Pipeline Act address repurposing spectrum for commercial use through auction or sharing, including defining and compensating for the cost of reassignment. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act of 2004 established rules for covering federal agencies' costs of relocating wireless communications facilities to new spectrum assignments. The Spectrum Act established the Spectrum Relocation Fund for federal agencies to recover relocation costs from auction proceeds. Successful bidders cover the costs, with auctions required to recoup at least 110% of projected costs. Unused funds revert to the Treasury after eight years. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act designated frequencies for auction and required federal agencies to prepare transition plans reviewed by a Technical Panel within the NTIA. The Spectrum Pipeline Act added criteria for the Technical Panel to consider in approving transition plans, including increasing auction proceeds. The NTIA, with input from the PPSG, published a discussion on the act's provisions and procedural requirements. In 2010, the NTIA, in collaboration with the PPSG, developed a 10-year plan and timetable to identify spectrum bands for commercial wireless broadband service. The NTIA also conducted a \"Fast Track Evaluation\" to assess spectrum availability. Unlicensed spectrum is accessible to anyone using FCC-certified wireless equipment, serving both commercial and noncommercial entities for various communication needs. Wireless device suppliers must meet certification requirements to operate on unlicensed frequency bands. Examples of unlicensed use include garage door openers. New technologies are being developed to expand the usefulness of unlicensed spectrum, such as using white spaces between digital TV signals. Geolocation database technology helps identify available airwaves for unlicensed use at 5 GHz. Commercial providers share parts of the spectrum for wireless Internet access. The Spectrum Act required new studies and evaluations of frequencies at 5 GHz to improve Wi-Fi capacity. The FCC added 100 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed use in the 5.15-5.85 GHz band, with future actions likely to release more segments. Policy issues include spectrum allocation between licensed and unlicensed use. The FCC has taken actions to improve competitive access to spectrum by modifying auction rules, encouraging participation by designated entities, and establishing limitations on licenses available to top carriers like Verizon and AT&T. Spectrum caps may restrict the amount of spectrum available in key auctions, with requests for smaller licenses in Cellular Market Areas to benefit small rural carriers. The FCC has implemented spectrum caps to promote competition by limiting the amount of spectrum any one company can control in a designated market. This policy dates back to the 1990s and aims to ensure a fair distribution of licenses and encourage participation from smaller carriers. The FCC implemented spectrum caps in the 1990s to prevent foreclosure bidding and promote competition. Spectrum caps were eliminated in 2003 to encourage spectral efficiency and deter hoarding through auction rules requiring timely network build-out. The FCC implemented spectrum caps in the 1990s to prevent foreclosure bidding and promote competition. In response to hoarding, the FCC instituted spectrum screening to evaluate holdings on a market-by-market basis. New criteria for the Broadcast Incentive Auction will limit Verizon and AT&T's ability to acquire licenses in certain areas, aiming to restrict the amount of spectrum any one carrier may hold. Verizon and AT&T currently hold the majority of commercial spectrum licenses below 1000 MHz. The FCC implemented spectrum caps in the 1990s to prevent foreclosure bidding and promote competition. New criteria for the Broadcast Incentive Auction will limit Verizon and AT&T's ability to acquire licenses in certain areas. T-Mobile and smaller carriers have unsuccessfully pressed the FCC to increase the amount of spectrum reserved for priority bidding. The Spectrum Act prohibits exclusion of any qualified bidder in the Broadcast Incentive Auction. Debate surrounds how spectrum caps may impact auction revenue, with arguments for and against their implementation. The Department of Justice emphasizes the importance of spectrum access for competition and innovation, urging the FCC to prevent bids based on spectrum foreclosure value and enhance opportunities for smaller carriers. The FCC promotes competition among wireless network providers by offering bidding credits to smaller companies known as Designated Entities. These entities meet specific size and revenue criteria to receive a credit against the purchase price of auctioned licenses. Restrictions are in place to limit the leasing of spectrum assets acquired through bidding credits to larger partners with an attributable material relationship. The FCC is reconsidering rules for Designated Entities, focusing on the attributable material relationship (AMR) which may be discriminatory. The Spectrum Act and Spectrum Pipeline Act aim to increase radio frequency spectrum availability for wireless broadband through competitive auctions, federal spectrum reassignment, and unlicensed spectrum use. The MOBILE NOW Act (S. 2555) emphasizes these policies and was approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on March 3. The MOBILE NOW Act, approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on March 3, 2016, aims to address issues related to mobile broadband deployment by providing infrastructure and minimizing regulatory hurdles. It expands on provisions in the Spectrum Pipeline Act to make additional federal spectrum available for commercial use by 2020, requiring at least 225 MHz of new spectrum to be released below 6 GHz, with 100 MHz for unlicensed use and 100 MHz for auction as exclusive use licenses. Some bands of federal spectrum would be excluded from this initiative. The MOBILE NOW Act aims to facilitate mobile broadband deployment by providing infrastructure and reducing regulatory obstacles. It includes provisions to release federal spectrum for commercial use, with requirements for new spectrum allocation below 6 GHz. The act also mandates the establishment of a database to provide information on communications facilities on federal property. The MOBILE NOW Act allows federal agencies to accept funds from commercial carriers to expedite the release of spectrum for clearance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a cost of $85 million over 2017-2021 for implementing the bill, primarily for developing new data systems. The impact on spending would be $135 million over 2017-2026 due to accelerated spending on clearing federal spectrum for commercial use. No revenue-generating provisions are included in the bill. The MOBILE NOW Act allows federal agencies to accept funds from commercial carriers to expedite the release of spectrum for clearance. The act also recognizes the needs of future technologies by evaluating millimeter wave spectrum bands for 5G and the Internet of Things. NTIA and FCC are tasked with assessing and proposing rules for high band frequencies within specific timeframes. The FCC proposed rules in the \"Spectrum Frontier Order\" to make 10.85GHz of high-band spectrum available for 5G. The MOBILE NOW Act allows for licensed, unlicensed, and shared use of spectrum resources, with potential additions for new bands of spectrum auction. The DIGIT Act (S. 2607, H.R. 5117) aims to support the Internet of Things by directing the FCC to assess spectrum needs and convene a working group for recommendations. The 114th Congress has passed resolutions for strategic planning for the Internet of Things at the national level. The Senate passed a resolution supporting a strategy for U.S. global competitiveness in the digital age, emphasizing the importance of innovation and consensus-based best practices for the Internet of Things. The estimated cost for creating a working group and funding reports required by the DIGIT Act is $3 million, to be spread among federal agencies. The introduction of 5G is expected to rapidly expand commercially from 2020-2025, with trials for early technologies starting in late 2016. The introduction of 5G is expected to rapidly expand commercially from 2020-2025, with trials for early technologies starting in late 2016. Initial standards for transitioning existing LTE and LTE Advanced technologies to 5G may be ready as early as 2018. New spectrum-dependent industries are emerging, including IoT, advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine communications. Many industry experts anticipate disruptive technologies to emerge as 5G develops, based on new concepts for network organization and communications. 5G is seen as including IoT solutions outside mobile broadband, with projected worldwide demand for IoT in 2020 largely met by Wi-Fi. The projected worldwide demand for IoT in 2020 can be mostly met by Wi-Fi (67%) and LTE technologies (13%), leaving a 19% gap. To bridge this gap, network operators need to accelerate the transition to 5G. This 19% gap presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial solutions and the potential for exponential growth in the IoT market. The MOBILE NOW and DIGIT acts aim to address gaps in national planning for future communication technologies. The DIGIT Act proposes a working group to examine policy questions related to the Internet of Things, while the MOBILE NOW Act focuses on providing mechanisms for federal agencies to license spectrum for mobile broadband. Neither bill includes a framework for public-private collaboration on key factors influencing future technologies. The curr_chunk discusses a framework for public-private collaboration on factors influencing the success of the United States in technology, including investment in IoT infrastructure, international negotiations, technology transfer programs, research coordination, FCC auction rules, and intellectual property protection."
