    "content": "Prior to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, the U.S. Post Office Department was responsible for mail delivery. The Act was driven by the department's inability to meet the demands of a growing population and changing economy. The current U.S. Postal Service faces challenges due to a sharp drop in mail volume between 2006 and 2015, influenced by market changes and global economic conditions. Statutory mandates like maintaining six-day delivery and prefunding health benefits for retirees limit the Postal Service's flexibility. The USPS faces financial challenges due to structural reforms needed for long-term viability, influenced by economic conditions and technological innovations. Maintaining self-sufficiency and meeting statutory requirements like retiree health benefit prefunding are key issues. The USPS's financial structure was established by the PRA and the PAEA, limiting its ability to expand operations and raise rates. These constraints have led to challenges and reform efforts by the USPS and Congress. The PRA created the USPS as an independent agency responsible for financing its own operations, replacing the U.S. Post Office Department, which was not financially self-sustaining. The USPS, established by the PRA, generates funding through mail users, with an annual appropriation compensating for revenue forgone and debt from the 1990s. Funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund, consisting mainly of revenues from postal products and services. The Postal Service Fund is funded by revenues from postal products and services, supporting USPS operations. Despite nine years of consecutive losses, there was a turnaround in FY2016 with a net income of $300 million in the first quarter, compared to a net loss of $800 million in FY2015. The USPS saw an improvement in its first quarter financial results due to increased shipping and package volume and revenue compared to FY2015. The USPS does not receive additional appropriations when ending a fiscal year with a financial loss but can borrow up to $3 billion per fiscal year with a total debt limit of $15 billion. The USPS's total debt has remained at $15 billion since FY2012, with plans to borrow up to its statutory limit by the end of FY2016. The debt includes various loan instruments and credit lines that were fully drawn by the end of FY2015. Financial losses have led to defaults on retiree health benefit prefunding obligations totaling over $28 billion since FY2012. The USPS has maintained cash-on-hand to cover operational expenses by using debt instruments and defaulting on retiree health prefunding payments. Despite having $15 billion in debt, it ended FY2015 with at least $889 million cash-on-hand. However, its total liabilities exceeded assets by about $101 billion at the end of FY2015. The PAEA defined postal service for the first time. The PAEA defined postal service as the delivery of letters, printed matter, or mailable packages and divided postal products into market dominant and competitive categories. It also addressed concerns about cross-subsidization by the USPS. The PAEA addressed concerns about cross-subsidization by forbidding the subsidization of competitive products with market dominant revenue and establishing the Competitive Products Fund (CPF). In FY2015, overall revenue from postal products and services increased by 1.6% to $68.951 billion, with revenue from competitive products offsetting decreased revenue from market dominant products. Total revenue from market dominant products was $52.426 billion, a decrease of 0.64% from FY2014, while revenue from competitive products increased. Total revenue from competitive products in FY2015 was approximately $16.52 billion, showing an increase of $1.437 billion (9.52%) from FY2014. Standard mail was one of the profitable products, with revenue increasing by approximately $217 million (1.24%) from FY2014. Competitive products represented 24% of USPS revenue in FY2015, despite accounting for only 3% of mail volume. Competitive products generated more revenue per piece ($4.17) compared to market dominant products ($0.35). The USPS explains that future growth in shipping and packages may not fully offset the decline in market dominant products like First-Class Mail and Standard Mail, which have higher profit margins. Revenue from Shipping and Packages would need to grow significantly faster than the decline in First-Class Mail revenue to make up for the lost profit contribution. Processing and delivery costs for competitive products are also higher. In FY2015, USPS's competitive products had lower profit margins compared to market dominant products. Market dominant products like First-Class Mail saw a decline in volume, while competitive mail volume, primarily shipping and package services, increased by 16.4% from FY2014. Total mail volume and revenue for USPS have been consistent or declining over the past 10 years, with market dominant products experiencing sharp drops since FY2009 due to factors like the transition to electronic mail. However, growth in competitive product volume and revenue has helped offset some of the losses. From FY2005 to FY2015, USPS's total annual mail volume dropped by 57.5 billion pieces, mainly in market dominant products. Despite this decline, total annual operating revenue remained relatively flat. The sharp declines in revenue and volume were likely due to the economic recession, but by FY2015, revenue began to recover, reaching $68.9 billion. Additionally, temporary price increases for market dominant products were implemented in FY2014 and FY2015 under the PAEA. The PAEA allows USPS to petition for an expedited postal rate adjustment during \"extraordinary or exceptional\" circumstances. In 2010, USPS requested a 5.6% rate increase due to poor economic conditions and decreased mail volume. The request was denied by the PRC, citing multiple factors contributing to the volume decline. In 2013, USPS filed and PRC approved a rate adjustment. In 2013, the USPS implemented a 4.3% rate increase on market dominant products approved by the PRC. The increase was initially temporary until $2.8 billion in lost revenue from the recession was recovered. Despite ongoing volume losses, the USPS maintained steady revenue. The DC Circuit Court upheld the temporary nature of the increase in June 2015. The PRC methodology for calculating recession losses was deemed \"arbitrary and capricious\" by the DC Circuit Court, leading to a $1.4 billion increase in exigent price revenue for USPS. The PRC announced the removal of the surcharge on April 10, 2016, resulting in price drops for various products and services. For example, the price of a First-Class Forever stamp decreased from $0.49 to $0.47. The exigent surcharge, in place since January 26, 2014, contributed $1.4 billion in FY2014 and $2.1 billion in FY2015 to USPS revenue. It accounted for 2.1% and 3.2% of total revenue in those years. USPS made operational adjustments to align revenue, mail volume, and expenses, including changes to its workforce and delivery routes. In FY2015, USPS made operational adjustments to its workforce, delivery routes, and facilities to reduce expenses. Personnel costs accounted for two-thirds of operating expenses, totaling $51.8 billion, with salaries being the largest expense. From FY2010 to FY2014, salaries and compensation costs decreased steadily. In FY2010 to FY2014, USPS reduced costs by $600 million annually through management decisions like voluntary separation incentives and hiring non-career employees. However, in FY2015, salaries and compensation costs increased by 2.3% to $35.9 billion due to salary escalations and increased work hours. Non-personnel costs remained stable at $15-16 billion from FY2010 to FY2015. In FY2010 to FY2015, total non-personnel expenses have been about $15-16 billion annually. The largest non-personnel expense is transportation, with $6.6 billion spent in FY2015 on air, ground, and water transportation. Other expenses include supplies, rent, utilities, and depreciation of USPS assets. The USPS has expenses mandated by law, such as the RHBF prefunding requirement and reached its statutory debt limit of $15 billion in FY2012. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) requires the USPS to prefund its retiree health benefits through statutorily prescribed payments into the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF) from FY2007 to FY2016. The RHBF was created as an on-budget account in the U.S. Treasury, with payments ranging from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion annually. Starting in FY2017, the USPS will continue making annual payments to the RHBF as determined by OPM based on future retiree healthcare benefit liability. The USPS is required to prefund its retiree health benefits through annual payments to the RHBF until September 30, 2056. The USPS has made some payments in full, defaulted on others, and Congress reduced one payment. The total contributions to the RHBF amount to $20.9 billion, with defaulted payments totaling $28.1 billion. The prefunding policy has been a contentious issue. The USPS is facing financial losses due to the prefunding requirement for retiree health benefits. They are seeking legislation to change how they offer health insurance to employees and retirees to eliminate this requirement. Cost-cutting strategies, including reducing workforce size and cost, are being implemented to address financial challenges. The USPS has implemented three initiatives to reduce workforce size and cost since FY2007: attrition and separation incentives, increased use of non-career employees, and non-personnel initiatives. The total number of USPS employees decreased by 21% (168,052 employees) between FY2007 and FY2014. Separation incentives ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 per person were offered to increase voluntary attrition rates, with 55,473 employees accepting incentives between FY2007 and FY2014. Between FY2012 and FY2014, incentives were offered by USPS to avoid employee layoffs. In January 2015, a Reduction in Force (RIF) was implemented for 249 postmasters who did not accept separation incentives. 169 postmasters opted for Discontinued Service Retirement (DSR), while the remaining 80 received severance pay. All affected postmasters were offered part-time career positions at USPS. Career employees have permanent positions with full federal benefits, while non-career employees do not. The USPS has increased its use of non-career employees to contain costs, with a 28% growth in non-career employees between FY2007 and FY2014. Non-career employees do not receive full federal benefits like federal life insurance and coverage under the Federal Employees Retirement System. The number of career employees decreased by 28% during the same period. The largest increase in non-career employees occurred between FY2011 and FY2014, primarily due to the establishment of three new non-career positions. The USPS has increased its use of non-career employees to reduce costs, with three new positions established: Postal Support Employees (PSEs), City Carrier Assistants (CCAs), and Mail Handler Assistants (MHAs). These non-career employees can perform duties at lower wage rates compared to career employees, as reported by the USPS and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The USPS has reduced compensation costs by utilizing non-career employees instead of career employees earning overtime. This has led to a decrease in total compensation costs by $526 million from FY2013 to FY2014. The increased use of CCAs and MHAs, along with separation incentives paid in FY2013, contributed to the reduction in employee work hours and lowered productive hourly wage rates for certain functions. The USPS reduced compensation costs by using non-career employees instead of career employees earning overtime, leading to a $526 million decrease in total compensation costs from FY2013 to FY2014. Reports show a decline in work hours over time, resulting in cost savings, but overall expenses did not decrease despite efforts to reduce workforce size and work hours. The USPS's expenses fluctuated due to required annual RHBF payments, with expenses declining at a slower rate compared to employee work hours when excluding RHBF payments. The USPS attributed slower expense decline to increased wage and benefit costs, non-personnel expenses, and fixed costs. The USPS Business Plan includes reform initiatives that do not require legislative action. Congress may propose legislation to halt USPS actions. The USPS Business Plan proposes reform initiatives to improve financial stability and sustainability, including the consolidation of mail processing facilities and adjustments to delivery standards and retail locations. The USPS Business Plan proposes reform initiatives to improve financial stability and sustainability, including changes to delivery standards and retail locations. Initiatives include self-service kiosks, centralized mail delivery, expanded services at retail locations, and a shift to five-day mail delivery while maintaining six-day package delivery. Some initiatives are already being implemented, while others may require legislative action from Congress. The Postal Service has revised delivery standards for market dominant products since 2012, with First-Class mail taking one to three days for delivery and periodicals taking three to nine days. Service Performance Targets are set based on these standards, but they do not guarantee specific delivery times. In FY2015, USPS failed to meet on-time performance targets for most market dominant mail categories, including First-Class mail. Single-piece letters and flats within the 3-day processing window met standards 77% and 65% of the time. Winter weather storms and insufficient air transportation capacity were cited as reasons for the performance below targets. The USPS's Network Rationalization Initiative (NRI) aims to address winter weather storms, insufficient air transportation capacity, and staff realignments. The initiative includes changes to delivery standards and the closure of mail processing facilities to improve efficiency and adapt to changes in mail volume. Phase I is complete, and Phase II began in January 2015, with remaining consolidations deferred to 2016. The USPS's Phase II of the Network Rationalization Initiative (NRI) failed to achieve projected savings, resulting in a net loss of $65.9 million. The increased costs were attributed to unplanned package growth and workload shift. The USPS OIG suggests that consolidations led to higher transportation costs and calls for more transparency in USPS transportation contracts. The 2015 USPS OIG report highlighted the effects of the Network Rationalization Initiative (NRI) on USPS operations, including workforce changes. Revised service standards allowed for quicker mail processing, leading to 5,000 employees transitioning to day shifts. This resulted in reduced pay differentials and required re-bidding of jobs at larger mail processing plants. USPS proposed moving to five-day delivery and reducing retail post office hours in its Five-Year Business Plan. The USPS has proposed reducing delivery days from six to five to align with operational demand, while maintaining six-day delivery for packages. Opponents argue that this change could negatively impact postal delivery standards, which have already suffered from previous facility closures. Shifting to five-day mail delivery with Saturday package delivery could increase revenues by $912 million to $1.677 billion, but net profit may be lower due to increased labor costs and potential revenue loss if local post offices are closed on Saturdays. The USPS could save between $625 million and. The USPS announced a plan to reduce hours at 13,000 \"low foot traffic\" U.S. Post Offices in rural communities, aiming to prevent closures by implementing the Post Office Structure Plan (POStPlan). The plan is estimated to save between $625 million and $1.393 billion annually. Most POStPlan facilities are small and in rural areas, with the USPS implementing non-personnel initiatives to reduce workforce size and costs. The USPS implemented initiatives like the POStPlan and NRI to streamline operations and reduce workforce size and costs. These efforts have led to a decrease in career employees and work hours for various positions. The USPS projected savings of $347.2 million through FY2016 from the POStPlan. Despite aiming to reduce the career workforce to around 404,000 employees by FY2017, the actual decrease has not met projected rates. Other initiatives, such as changes to delivery schedules, have also impacted the workforce. The USPS workforce reduction targets for FY2015-FY2017 may be challenging to achieve as the workforce decreased by 40,158 employees instead of the anticipated 84,000. It is uncertain if USPS will reach its FY2017 goal, as it has not been revised since April 2013. Additional workforce reduction initiatives may be necessary to meet the goal, and unanticipated policy changes could impact the outcome. The USPS postponed Phase II of the NRI, affecting 15,000 employees. Postal unions have fought against reductions to the career workforce, with the APWU winning an arbitration award creating 9,000 clerk craft positions, including 3,000 career positions. Union contracts limit the number of non-career employees, with the NALC contract raising the limit to 15% of career carriers. The USPS's use of non-career employees has increased to 15% of career carriers in a district, compared to 3.5% in the previous contract. Some labor unions oppose this increase, leading to failed negotiations with the APWU. The APWU contract called for more career employees, but an arbitration panel issued a new contract maintaining the increase in non-career employees. The arbitration panel issued a new APWU contract on July 8, 2016, maintaining current levels of covered non-career employees. Lower caps on non-career employees could impact the size and cost of the USPS's workforce. The USPS is close to reaching current caps on non-career employees, and reducing the number of non-career employees might lead to changes in workforce composition and increased personnel costs. This could involve hiring more career employees or transitioning non-career employees to career positions, potentially increasing compensation costs. Alternatively, reducing non-career employees could result in higher overtime pay costs for career employees. Some postal labor unions and Members of Congress are concerned about employee morale at the USPS due to efforts to reduce workforce size and costs. Senator Heidi Heitkamp highlighted challenges faced by USPS employees in North Dakota, including long hours, poor working conditions, lack of training, and managerial focus. She introduced the Rural Postal Act of 2015 to improve employee morale by establishing a Chief Morale Officer responsible for developing initiatives. The Officer is tasked with developing national initiatives to address employee morale, including factors like working conditions, communication, and training. The bill also proposes Regional Morale Officers to implement these initiatives, hold monthly roundtables with employees, submit feedback reports, and communicate with other officers. No action has been taken on the bill as of August 10, 2016. The USPS is facing the need to replace its aging delivery fleet, with 75% of its vehicles exceeding their life expectancy. The proposed Next Generation Delivery Vehicle program aims to acquire up to 180,000 new vehicles at a cost of $25,000 to $35,000 each. The USPS is planning to replace its aging delivery fleet with the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDVs) costing between $25,000 and $35,000 each. The new fleet will handle more packages, use less fuel, and have advanced safety features. The NGDV acquisition program will take 5 to 7 years to complete after prequalifying suppliers through a Request for Information (RFI) process in January 2015. The USPS issued a Request for Proposal in October 2015 to design and manufacture prototypes of its NGDVs. The program will take about two years to complete, with production and delivery of the fleet starting in 2017. A second RFP will establish final production requirements, and the USPS may purchase or lease the vehicles from one or more suppliers. The PAEA restricts the USPS from offering new nonpostal products and services to increase market share and revenue. Currently, the Postal Service is authorized to offer 11 nonpostal products and services, including USPS/public sector alliances and philatelic sales for stamp collectors. In FY2015, revenues from nonpostal market dominant products were $75 million and expenses were $13 million. In FY2015, revenues from nonpostal market dominant products were $75 million with expenses of $13 million, resulting in a net gain of $62 million. Revenues for nonpostal competitive products were $106 million with expenses of $17 million, leading to a net gain of $89 million. The Postal Service is authorized to conduct short-term market tests for nonpostal products, including gift cards, same-day delivery services, and international eCommerce shipping services. Proposed postal reform legislation may allow USPS to offer additional nonpostal products and services. The USPS is seeking authority to offer nonpostal products and services, including public Internet access, drivers' license services, and postal banking. Proposed legislation aims to expand USPS's offerings, such as financial services like international money orders and prepaid cards. Postal financial services have been available since the termination of the Postal Savings System in 1967. Many countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and Brazil, offer postal financial services through various models. Some countries have their own financial products, while others facilitate the sale of financial services managed by private institutions. South Korea, for example, uses a hybrid approach with its postal service offering its own financial services alongside handling deposits for private institutions. The USPS OIG issued a white paper in 2014 to study the potential for USPS to offer financial services, determining it as a revenue opportunity. A second study in 2015 explored statutory authority and proposed models for USPS to expand its financial products, including money orders and check cashing. The USPS OIG white paper in 2014 explored revenue opportunities for USPS through financial services like money orders and check cashing. It proposed a low-cost approach with limited growth but estimated $1.1 billion in additional revenue annually after five years. Additionally, four alternative models were identified, each requiring higher upfront costs and additional statutory authority. These models include partnerships with outside firms, a marketplace model, and a full-fledged postal bank. The USPS OIG explored revenue opportunities through financial services like money orders and check cashing, proposing a low-cost approach with limited growth but estimated $1.1 billion in additional revenue annually after five years. Advocates for postal financial services believe it would offer services to underserved populations and generate revenue for the USPS. Many recommend a postal savings system to reach households and individuals who do not use insured financial institutions. The FDIC report found that 7.7% of U.S. households were unbanked and 20% were underbanked. Critics argue that postal financial services may not generate revenue and could encroach on the private market. There is skepticism about revenue forecasts and the trust underserved populations have in the USPS. Some question the conflicting benefits proposed by postal banking advocates. The USPS faces a dilemma with postal banking - is it to assist low-income individuals or to boost revenue amidst declining mail business? Past experience with the Postal Savings System from 1911 to 1967 is often cited, showing success with millions of depositors. The viability of expanding USPS financial services hinges on a detailed cost analysis. The Postal Savings System from 1911 to 1967 aimed to attract savings from immigrants and provide safe depositories. Representative Cummings introduced a bill in Congress to expand USPS's authority to offer nonpostal products like check-cashing services. A proposal for USPS to become a chartered bank would allow it to offer a range of financial services. The USPS could offer financial services like savings accounts, loans, check cashing, and insurance. Representative Richmond introduced a bill in Congress for USPS to provide basic financial services, including loans and accounts. The bill allows USPS to partner with banks but does not establish a new postal banking system. Various proposals leverage USPS's nationwide network for accessibility. The USPS aims to provide financial services to underserved populations and generate additional revenue. Appendices include USPS revenue and mail volume data, as well as postal reform legislation introduced in Congress."
