    "content": "The \"Elder Justice Reauthorization Act\" may be cited as the official title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Elder Justice Reauthorization Act\" highlights key findings on elder abuse, including the prevalence of financial abuse, the lack of dedicated federal funding for protective services, and the underreporting of cases leading to a vast underestimation of elder abuse in the nation. The Elder Justice Reauthorization Act reveals the underestimation of elder abuse in the nation due to differences in state laws and practices. The Federal Government has been involved in promoting research and training to address abuse and neglect in various forms. The Federal Government should lead efforts to prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation by promoting coordinated planning and sharing knowledge among all levels of government and organizations. This comprehensive approach integrates the work of various agencies and recognizes the roles of adult protective services and long-term care ombudsman programs. The need for prevention, detection, reporting, investigation, assessment, treatment, and prosecution of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation at all levels of government is emphasized. It ensures sufficient trained personnel are in place to provide services related to elder abuse and cultural competency to address the unique needs of a diverse older adult population. Additionally, it balances an elder's right to self-determination with society's responsibility to protect elders. The future well-being of older adults is at risk due to elder abuse, requiring a coordinated Federal response. Prevention of elder abuse is a wise investment that can save Medicare and Medicaid costs in the future. Victims of elder abuse suffer long-lasting effects. SEC. 3.
