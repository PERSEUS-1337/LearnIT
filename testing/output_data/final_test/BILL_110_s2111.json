The Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act highlights the importance of implementing positive behavior supports in schools to improve academic outcomes and reduce disciplinary issues. Successful schools focus on high academic and behavior standards, correlating improvements in student behavior with better school climate and academic performance. Negative and reactive school management practices are deemed ineffective and counterproductive. The implementation of evidence-based practices for improving behavior and creating a positive school climate is lacking. Early intervening services, such as positive behavior support, have shown significant success in reducing suspensions and increasing instructional time. Effective positive behavior support strategies include active supervision, positive feedback, and social skills instruction to minimize problem behaviors. Implementing positive behavior support strategies, such as active supervision and social skills instruction, in schools has shown to reduce disciplinary issues and improve the overall school environment. For example, a school in Maryland saw a 42% decrease in major rule violations, resulting in 119 days of instructional time and 40 days of administrator time saved in just one school year. Similarly, a school in South Carolina experienced a 100% decrease in teacher transfer requests and a 36% decrease in teacher absence days when implementing positive behavior supports. These interventions, when paired with effective services for students, can lead to significant improvements in behavior and school climate. The Act aims to expand the use of positive behavior supports and early intervening services in schools to create a conducive learning environment, reduce discipline issues, and enhance student academic outcomes. Effective interventions for students with challenging behaviors can lead to overall success for all students. The Act defines positive behavior support as a systematic approach to reinforce desired behaviors and prevent problem behaviors in order to improve social outcomes and student learning. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility to use Title I funds for school-wide positive behavior support, including early intervening services for all students needing academic and behavioral support. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility in using funds for school-wide positive behavior support and other evidence-based approaches. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility in using funds for school-wide positive behavior support and other evidence-based approaches.

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows flexibility in using funds for implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports to enhance academic outcomes for students. SEC. 5 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include understanding of social and emotional learning in teachers' preparation and improving school climate. SEC. 6 focuses on safe and drug-free schools and communities. The purpose of amending Section 4002 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is to support programs that improve school climate, prevent discipline problems, violence, and substance abuse, involve parents and communities, and create a safe learning environment to enhance student academic achievement. The provision of Federal assistance aims to improve school-wide climate and academic achievement by supporting local programs implemented by educational agencies and consortia. SEC. 7 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to address the need for early intervening services in improving school climate. SEC. 8 adds an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services to the Department of Education. The Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services in the Department of Education administers programs to improve academic achievement through specialized instructional support services in schools. The Office is headed by a Director selected by the Secretary and reports to the Deputy Secretary of Education. The Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services in the Department of Education aims to enhance academic achievement and educational outcomes for students by identifying effective practices, providing training for personnel, offering technical assistance to educational agencies, and coordinating programs within schools. The Department of Education coordinates programs and services in schools with other Federal agencies, evaluates their effectiveness, and defines specialized instructional support personnel as professionals providing necessary services for students. Specialized instructional support services are defined under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act as services provided by personnel to meet student needs. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 has been amended to include a definition of positive behavior support as a systematic approach to reinforcing desired behaviors and preventing problem behaviors to improve social outcomes and student learning."
