    "content": "Contractors can be debarred or suspended under federal statutes or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). There are only two overlaps between the causes of debarment and suspension under statute and the FAR. The FAR includes \"catch-all\" provisions that could potentially lead to debarment or suspension for various reasons. Some federal statutes allow for debarment or suspension of contractors for serious misconduct. These actions, known as \"statutory debarments\" or \"statutory suspensions,\" serve as inducements for compliance with the law. Exclusion may be based on convictions or agency findings of wrongdoing, and can be limited to certain contractors or agencies. Statutory debarments or suspensions are actions taken against contractors for serious misconduct, serving as inducements for compliance with the law. Exclusions can be specific to certain contractors or agencies, with determinations made by designated officials. Debarments have a fixed period specified by statute, while suspensions last until the contractor ceases the conduct that led to the violation. Waivers for statutory exclusions are limited and generally cannot be granted by heads of procuring agencies. The federal government aims to prevent improper use of public funds in contracting activities by only dealing with responsible contractors. Debarment and suspension are used to preclude agencies from working with contractors with prior violations or nonperformance. Exclusions under the FAR protect the government's interests and cannot be imposed solely for punishment. Federal courts can overrule agency decisions to debar contractors if punishment is the primary goal. Agency decisions to debar contractors aim to protect the government's interests rather than punish them. Debarment can be imposed for integrity offenses such as fraud or criminal acts related to government contracts. Exclusions are typically initiated by the agency involved in the misconduct. Debarment can be imposed for various offenses related to government contracts, including violations of antitrust laws, embezzlement, forgery, bribery, tax evasion, and other acts indicating a lack of business integrity. In the absence of convictions, debarment may still occur if government officials find evidence of serious violations. Debarment can be imposed for various offenses related to government contracts, including violations of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, unfair trade practices, delinquent federal taxes over $3,000, and failure to disclose violations of federal laws or False Claims Act. Debarment can be imposed on government contractors for various offenses, including violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Debarments last up to three years and require written notice and a hearing for due process. Conduct by a contractor's associates can be imputed to the contractor. Agency officials can also suspend contractors for suspected offenses or indictments. Debarment of government contractors can occur for offenses such as fraud, antitrust violations, embezzlement, bribery, tax evasion, Drug-Free Workplace Act violations, and more. Contractors can also be debarred for failing to disclose evidence of criminal violations. Debarment of government contractors can occur for various offenses, including violations of Title 18 of the United States Code, False Claims Act violations, significant overpayments on contracts, and other offenses affecting business integrity. Contractors may be suspended pending investigation or legal proceedings, with suspensions typically lasting 12-18 months unless legal action is initiated within that timeframe. The FAR allows agencies to extend debarment or suspension decisions to affiliates of a contractor, with imputation of conduct possible. Fraudulent or improper conduct of individuals associated with a contractor can be imputed to the contractor. Conduct in joint ventures can also be imputed to other contractors involved. The FAR allows agencies to extend debarment or suspension decisions to affiliates of a contractor, with imputation of conduct possible. Agency exclusion determinations could potentially be challenged if they are inconsistent in excluding particular affiliates of a contractor. Not all contractors engaging in conduct that could lead to debarment are excluded from contracting with executive branch agencies. The debarment or suspension of a contractor does not guarantee that agencies will not contract with them before the exclusion period ends. The FAR allows agencies to decide on debarment or suspension, focusing on the public interest. This discretion means that contractors who engaged in exclusion-worthy conduct may not necessarily be excluded. Contractors who engage in exclusion-worthy conduct may not necessarily be excluded, as agencies can consider factors such as changes in personnel, restitution, or cooperation in a government investigation. Exclusion can be limited to specific divisions or elements of a company if only certain segments were involved in wrongdoing. Contractors cannot challenge agency decisions not to debar them but can contest determinations of present responsibility. Agencies can also use administrative agreements as alternatives to debarment. Agencies can use administrative agreements as alternatives to debarment for contractors who admit wrongful conduct and agree to remedial measures. The agency reserves the right to impose additional sanctions, including debarment, if the contractor fails to comply. The formation of these agreements falls within agencies' authority to determine contract terms. Only the signing agency is a party to the agreement, and other agencies may not be aware of its existence. The Clean Contracting Act, part of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009, established the Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) to include information on contractor misconduct beyond the Excluded Party List System. FAPIIS must contain descriptions of administrative agreements related to federal contracts within the past five years, along with other contract-related proceedings. The Clean Contracting Act established FAPIIS to include information on contractor misconduct. Debarment or suspension under the FAR precludes contractors from receiving new contracts or orders, but current contracts remain in effect unless terminated. Agencies can waive a contractor's penalties. The FAR allows agencies to waive a contractor's exclusion for compelling reasons, with waivers being agency-specific and not regularly communicated. Agency determinations on compelling reasons are not reviewable by courts, but challenges can be made through bid protest processes. Agencies can also reduce debarment periods if contractors provide new evidence or show a reversal of circumstances. The FAR allows agencies to waive a contractor's exclusion for compelling reasons, with waivers being agency-specific and not regularly communicated. Agency determinations on compelling reasons are not reviewable by courts, but challenges can be made through bid protest processes. Contractors have protections in the exclusion process, including entitlement to due process under the Fifth Amendment. Contractors can seek to reduce debarment periods by presenting new evidence or demonstrating changes in circumstances. In 1964, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in Gonzalez v. Freeman that contractors have the right to challenge government decisions regarding their eligibility for contracts. The court found that the Commodity Credit Corporation had improperly debarred a contractor due to lack of notice and opportunity to present evidence. The FAR currently requires contractors to receive notice and a hearing before being debarred, but allows for suspension without prior notice as long as contractors are immediately informed and given a chance to oppose the suspension within 30 days. The doctrine of de facto debarment can also protect contractors from improper exclusion. The doctrine of de facto debarment can protect contractors from improper exclusion by focusing on conduct outside the debarment process that effectively excludes them. For example, in Old Dominion Dairy Products, Inc. v. Secretary of Defense, the Air Force de facto debarred a contractor through repeated nonresponsibility determinations without informing the contractor of the allegations. The Air Force did not inform a contractor of allegations, leading to a nonresponsibility determination for a second contract. This was deemed an improper de facto debarment as the contractor was excluded without notice or chance to challenge. Judicial and administrative tribunals have also found improper de facto debarments based on repeated nonresponsibility determinations or intent to exclude from government contracts. In certain circumstances, agencies' determinations to debar or suspend a contractor could potentially violate the Administrative Procedure Act, as seen in the 2001 case of Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims found that the USDA's suspension of a contractor for falsifying raisin certifications violated the APA, as the USDA knew of the contractor's conduct when previously deeming them \"responsible\" for federal contracts. The court found that the USDA abused its discretion in suspending a contractor for alleged lack of integrity, as the agency had previously awarded the contractor five contracts affirming their present responsibility. The USDA suspended a contractor despite having evidence of their present responsibility, leading the court to question the decision's immediacy and validity. The decision in Lion Raisins has been debated, with some suggesting it could prevent agencies from suspending contractors based on old allegations."
