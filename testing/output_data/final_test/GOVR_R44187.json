    "content": "In the 1990s, concerns arose about how emerging technologies like digital communications and encryption could hinder law enforcement's ability to investigate crime, particularly in terms of surveillance and intercepting communications. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the challenge of digital and wireless technologies in public telephone systems affecting the FBI's wiretap capabilities. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA; P.L. 103-414) was passed to assist law enforcement in maintaining wiretap capabilities in the face of changing technology. CALEA requires telecommunications carriers to assist in authorized electronic surveillance, but with limitations - law enforcement cannot mandate specific equipment designs or prohibit certain features. Telecommunications carriers are not obligated to decrypt or ensure the government's ability to decrypt any communications. A decade after CALEA was passed, concerns arose about the limitations of electronic surveillance due to emerging technologies. The DOJ, FBI, and DEA requested the FCC to expand CALEA to more telecommunications providers. The FCC then extended CALEA's requirements to include broadband and VoIP providers. The CALEA requirements now apply to broadband and VoIP providers, with debates on expanding it to cover email and data on mobile devices. In the 1990s, the \"crypto wars\" involved government clashes with data privacy advocates over encryption, highlighted by the investigation of Philip Zimmermann, creator of PGP encryption software. The release of PGP encryption software was a milestone in public cryptography, providing high-level security that even the NSA couldn't crack. Its proliferation online led to a federal investigation into illegal export, but the case was resolved without charges. Courts have since debated the First Amendment's protection of software code, including encryption. Law enforcement has adapted to evolving cell phone and smartphone technology for data collection. Cell phones have evolved into mobile computers with a wide range of data stored on them, including call records, GPS locations, emails, photos, videos, and messages. This data can be a valuable source of evidence for law enforcement, stored in various locations based on default settings, user preferences, and provider policies. In 2014, judges authorized 3,554 wiretaps, with 36% under federal jurisdiction. 96% of intercept orders were for portable devices, producing an average of 5,724 intercepts from federally authorized orders. In 2014, out of 3,554 authorized wiretaps, 25 contained encrypted communications. Officials were unable to decipher the plain text in 4 instances, representing 0.11% of authorized wiretaps. In 2014, out of 3,554 authorized wiretaps, 25 contained encrypted communications. 4 instances (0.11% of authorized wiretaps) were unable to decipher the plain text. Law enforcement encountered encryption since 2001, with instances of encryption they couldn't circumvent since 2011. The number of such instances fluctuated, making it difficult to determine a specific trend. Apple's release of iOS 8 in 2014 included encryption that law enforcement couldn't bypass, making it technically infeasible for Apple to comply with government warrants for data extraction. The company also stated that they couldn't decrypt iMessage and FaceTime data in transit between devices. Google's Android 5.0 also offers default privacy protections like automatic encryption of data when locked with a passcode, making it impossible for Google to unlock encrypted devices. This enhanced data encryption, a response to privacy concerns post-Edward Snowden, has raised discussions on its impact on law enforcement investigations. Law enforcement officials compare the new encryption to a house or car trunk that can't be searched. There are concerns that encryption may be used by malicious actors to conceal illicit activities, hindering law enforcement investigations. Critics argue that law enforcement has the necessary tools for investigations. The debate on privacy vs. information access has been reignited by advancements in encryption, particularly on smartphones. Telecommunications carriers are required to assist law enforcement under CALEA. Some communications, like Apple's iMessage, are exempt from being wiretap-ready under CALEA due to encryption and lack of decryption keys. This poses challenges for law enforcement in executing electronic surveillance. As technology evolves, communication methods change, making some communications inaccessible to law enforcement even with a warrant. Companies like Apple and Google encrypt data on mobile devices, hindering law enforcement's ability to access this data for court-authorized searches. Technology companies like Apple and Google encrypt data on mobile devices, making it difficult for law enforcement to access content even with a warrant. They are not required by federal law to maintain a key to unlock encryption, but if they did, they might have to provide it to law enforcement with a valid search warrant. This raises questions about the challenges police face in cracking encryption on smartphones compared to obtaining information from other types of containers like home safes. Manufacturers may be required to provide assistance to law enforcement to access safes or safe deposit boxes with a warrant. If companies do not have a key to unlock a mobile device, law enforcement may resort to using a cryptanalytic attack like \"brute force\" to unlock it. This method involves trying every possible combination of keys to unlock the device. FBI Director Comey has highlighted challenges in breaking encryption due to advanced techniques and data erasure settings. Law enforcement may resort to brute force tactics to unlock devices, similar to breaking physical locks with a warrant. Law enforcement's investigative authorities have faced challenges due to advancements in technology. The FBI's Going Dark initiative aims to maintain electronic surveillance capabilities. The debate on \"going dark\" originally focused on intercepting real-time communications, leading to discussions on adapting existing laws like CALEA. The debate on expanding laws like CALEA to include all VoIP and Internet service providers for assisting law enforcement in accessing real-time information continues. Encryption advancements by companies like Apple and Google pose challenges for law enforcement in keeping pace with new technologies. Concerns over law enforcement's ability to monitor communication in online services without intercept capabilities have raised issues of \"going dark.\" Concerns over \"going dark\" have evolved due to recent technology changes impacting law enforcement's access to both communications and stored data. Encryption of stored data by technology companies is now a key issue for law enforcement investigations. Data on the impact of encryption on law enforcement access to stored data is still lacking, despite past requests for information. Congress previously required reporting on law enforcement encounters with encryption during wiretaps and deciphering encrypted information. The debate on encryption and law enforcement surveillance continues, with some arguing that law enforcement is \"going dark\" while others believe they are in a \"golden age of surveillance.\" Technology advances like encryption may hinder access to certain information but also create new opportunities for information access. Following the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December 2015, the FBI was unable to unlock a suspect's cell phone. A court ordered Apple to assist in accessing the data on the device, sparking a debate on encryption and law enforcement's ability to access critical information. Following the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December 2015, the FBI faced challenges accessing encrypted data on a suspect's cell phone, leading to a debate on law enforcement's access to critical information. Policymakers are considering potential compromises between law enforcement and the technology industry, such as incentivizing or requiring communication and technology companies to provide specified information. Congress may update laws like CALEA to cover a broader range of communications and data to address law enforcement's needs. Proposals are being considered to extend CALEA requirements to cover a wider range of technology services like instant messaging and video game chats. Supporters believe this would help law enforcement intercept real-time communications more effectively. However, opponents argue that mandating intercept capabilities in other services could be costly and pose security risks for companies. To assist law enforcement with authorized surveillance, policymakers may consider mandating technology companies to build in \"back door\" access for specified communications products sold in the United States. However, this could lead to U.S. consumers seeking privacy in overseas products and international consumers avoiding U.S. products that comply with these requirements. Policymakers may also explore alternative options to enhance law enforcement capabilities without amending CALEA. While policymakers may debate options to assist law enforcement, including making it a crime to withhold passcodes, those in support of encryption argue that a search warrant is permission, not compulsion. Judges may hold individuals in contempt for not providing information to unlock electronic devices, even though technology companies like Apple and Google may not have the ability to unlock encrypted smartphones. Encryption proponents argue that while law enforcement may not be able to access information on locked, encrypted smartphones, they can still retrieve data from unencrypted communications and the cloud. They believe that stronger digital security can help prevent malicious activity and benefit law enforcement in combating cybercriminals and those using technology to conceal crimes. The impact of enhanced encryption on law enforcement remains a topic of debate. Enhanced encryption on mobile devices may hinder law enforcement efforts against criminals. Policymakers are unsure about taking legislative action due to the unknown extent of the problem. Options include expanding requirements for tech companies, enhancing law enforcement resources, or improving officer training in technology."
