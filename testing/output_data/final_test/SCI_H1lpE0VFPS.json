    "content": "In this paper, the problem of detecting objects under occlusion is addressed by proposing a deep multivariate mixture of Gaussians model for bounding box regression. The model considers multiple plausible configurations of occluded object borders and their correlations with visible ones. It improves AP by 3.9% and 1.2% on CrowdHuman and MS-COCO datasets respectively, with no extra computational or memory cost. The model is also interpretable, allowing for better understanding of the results. Object detectors based on deep convolutional neural networks are crucial for real-world applications like self-driving cars, robotics grasping, and video surveillance. These detectors categorize candidate bounding boxes and regress each coordinate towards the object. The proposed deep multivariate mixture of Gaussians model improves object detection under occlusion by considering multiple plausible configurations of object borders and correlations with visible ones. This model enhances AP on CrowdHuman and MS-COCO datasets without additional computational or memory overhead, providing interpretable results. The candidate bounding box coordinates are regressed towards the ground truth independently, with two styles of bounding box annotation: visible box and full box. Full box annotation presents a multimodal problem when objects are occluded, while visible box annotation can still exhibit multiple modes due to inaccurate labeling. An object detector robust to these challenges is essential for accurate object detection. Our proposed deep multivariate mixture of Gaussians model for object detection under occlusion regresses multiple sets of bounding box coordinates, taking into account correlations between visible and occluded borders. Our proposed model regresses sets of coordinates and learns covariance matrices for Gaussian mixture components to predict plausible bounding box configurations. Experiments on four datasets show improvements in Average Precision, with explainable results using covariance matrices and Gaussian components. The model is computationally efficient and memory-free. Our model for object detection is computationally efficient and memory-free, using a fully-connected layer to predict mixture components. It is not limited to two-stage detectors and can handle occlusion in object detection. Object Detection Under Occlusion: Our method for general object detection is designed to handle occlusion without the need for manual labels or additional computation during inference. Unlike other methods specifically designed for pedestrian detection, our approach does not require detecting semantic parts. The authors propose adding synthetic occlusion to visible objects and using a CNN to learn on the generated composite images. Different datasets annotate occluded objects in various ways, such as visible bounding boxes or full boxes containing both visible and occluded parts. They extended the Faster R-CNN head architecture to predict parameters of a multivariate mixture of Gaussian. The authors extended the Faster R-CNN head to predict parameters of a multivariate mixture of Gaussian for Cityscapes. Experiments were conducted on various datasets like MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, CrowdHuman, and VehicleOcclusion, showing that occluded bounding boxes can be inferred from visible parts of objects. Multiple modes of occluded bounding boxes were observed, leading to the proposal of estimating bounding box coordinates as a probability. The authors proposed estimating bounding box coordinates as a probability distribution using a multivariate mixture of Gaussians with a deep network. This approach considers correlations between bounding box borders and multiple modes of occluded bounding boxes. The distribution is parameterized by a neural network and includes the most probable bounding box coordinates relative to the region of interest. The model estimates the precision matrix \u03a3 \u22121 instead of the covariance matrix \u03a3 during training, using Cholesky decomposition for unique parameterization. Mixture weights \u03c6 i are parameterized with Softmax, and outputs z i , u ii , and \u00b5 i are generated by a fully-connected layer in Faster R-CNN with RPN. Our model parameterizes the distribution over bounding boxes using a neural network in Faster R-CNN. It estimates parameters with maximum likelihood estimation during training using momentum stochastic gradient descent to minimize localization and classification losses. Different parameters are used for different classes. During testing, the model uses the expectation of the mixture module for prediction, discarding neurons producing the covariance matrix to speed up inference. The model degrades into a multivariate Gaussian when the number of mixture components is 1, with the localization loss rewritten accordingly. Multimodality is beneficial under occlusion as an occluded object typically has multiple modes. During testing, the model uses the expectation of the mixture module for prediction, discarding neurons producing the covariance matrix to speed up inference. Multimodality is helpful under occlusion as an occluded object usually has multiple modes. The Gaussian model with one mixture component and diagonal covariance matrix simplifies detection. The balancing term (U)jj adjusts bounding box regression accuracy, with smaller gradients for inaccurate regressions. The Euclidean loss occurs when all diagonal elements (U)jj are one, resembling standard Euclidean loss. Our model is initialized with random Gaussian weights and biases for different layers. It can be trained end-to-end following settings in Detectron. Experiments are conducted on the CrowdHuman dataset, which contains a large number of human instances with various occlusions. The annotations for occluded bounding boxes are full boxes. The experiments involve a synthetic dataset called VehicleOcclusion designed for object detection under occlusion. It contains six types of vehicles with varying levels of occlusion. The dataset includes annotations for full boxes representing occluded instances. Additionally, a large-scale object detection dataset called Lin et al. (2014) contains 80 object categories and over 330k images with labeled object instances. MS-COCO dataset has 330k images with over 200k labeled object instances and fewer occlusion cases compared to other datasets. PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset has 9,963 images with 20 classes and less occlusion cases. The number of mixture components is tested using a mixture of Gaussians model. The baseline model is ResNet-50 FPN Faster R-CNN on CrowdHuman. The performance of FPN Faster R-CNN on CrowdHuman improves with an increase in the number of components up to 8, but decreases with more than 16 components due to potential overfitting. The mixture of eight Gaussians model outperforms the Gaussian model by 1% AP. Using eight components is recommended to avoid overfitting. Comparison between Gaussian, mixture of Gaussians, and multivariate Gaussian models is done on CrowdHuman and MS-COCO datasets. On CrowdHuman, the model using ResNet-50 FPN Mask R-CNN greatly improves the baseline performance. Gaussian, mixture of eight Gaussians, and multivariate Gaussians all contribute to performance improvements, with the complete model showing a 3.9% AP increase. These improvements are beneficial for handling heavy occlusion, with Gaussian aiding in training the regression network, multivariate Gaussian learning correlations between occluded and visible borders, and mixture of Gaussians modeling multimodal occluded cases. Soft-NMS enhances classification scoring, while the approach discussed focuses on localization improvement. On MS-COCO, Gaussian methods still show improvements in bounding box annotations, with a mixture of eight Gaussians and multivariate Gaussians enhancing performance. However, the impact is less significant compared to CrowdHuman due to fewer occluded instances and less need for multimodality and covariances. The experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that Gaussian methods improve mAP by 1.5% and the complete model improves it by 2.0%. Multimodality and multivariate Gaussian do not significantly enhance performance. Comparison with DeepVoting on VehicleOcclusion demonstrates that the multivariate mixture of eight Gaussians model outperforms it by a large margin. The multivariate mixture of eight Gaussians model outperforms DeepVoting by a large margin at different occlusion levels. It helps to learn a better detector and considers multiple modes of an object, improving detection under occlusion. The model does not slow down inference or increase parameters significantly, with only a slight sacrifice in FPS on GPU. Our models outperform baselines by large margins, requiring almost no additional computation and memory. The inference latency is measured on MS-COCO with 80 classes, resulting in fewer computation and memory resources on CrowdHuman with only one class. The visualization of our mixture of Gaussian prediction results on CrowdHuman shows single modes when objects are not occluded and multiple modes when occluded. The visualization of a multivariate Gaussian prediction model for object detection under occlusion is shown in Figure 5. The model learns covariance between bounding box borders, with variance terms being high when objects are occluded. Our proposed model demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines in various datasets. Our model demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines in various datasets, including MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, CrowdHuman, and VehicleOcclusion. The detection results can be diagnosed via covariance matrices and mixture components, providing explainability."
