    "content": "The 9/11 Commission recommended improving screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers, with the TSA prioritizing this and Congress providing support. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed DHS to focus on developing passenger explosives screening equipment and required TSA to submit a strategic plan for deployment. Congressional interest in aviation security remains high. Congressional interest in aviation security remains high as the 110th Congress reexamines the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Proposed legislation such as H.R. 1 and S. 4 aim to require strategic plans for explosives detection at screening checkpoints, while H.R. 1591 seeks additional funding for checkpoint explosives detection pilot systems. The report discusses the current state of passenger explosives trace detection for aviation security, focusing on techniques using separation and detection technologies like mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Various technologies have been developed and deployed on a test or pilot basis, including the use of specially trained animals for explosives vapor detection. The effectiveness of chemical trace analysis for explosives detection relies on sample collection, analysis, and comparison with known standards. Ion mobility spectrometry is commonly used in current equipment, with pilot projects by TSA in 2004 deploying portal trace detection for operational testing. Passengers pass through a portal device that can collect, analyze, and identify explosive residues on their body or clothing. The portal device can detect explosive residues on a person's body or clothing using body heat or air puffs. Alternatives include handheld vacuum collection or testing objects like boarding passes for residue. Canines have sensitive olfactory abilities for detection but have limitations for regular passenger screening. Technology development efforts in the detection of explosives include portal systems using x-ray backscatter imaging, millimeter wave energy analysis, and terahertz imaging. These systems can detect bulk quantities of explosives without raising false alarms on passengers who have innocently handled explosives. Some versions can also detect nonmetallic weapons, providing a more comprehensive security screening solution. Passenger explosives detection portals focus on trace detection to identify security concerns about individuals who have been in contact with explosives. Challenges include determining detector placement, cost projections, and technical standards. Operational challenges involve maintaining passenger flow, addressing false alarms, ensuring passenger compliance, preventing disruptions, and supporting research for future detection technologies. The deployment strategy for passenger explosives detection equipment involves identifying where and how to use detection portals, either widely or selectively, as primary or secondary screening technology. Widespread deployment for primary screening could provide more uniform risk reduction but would increase costs. The cost of deploying explosives detection equipment for passenger screening is unknown, but portal systems in U.S. airports cost over $160,000 each. Document scanning systems are cheaper, ranging from $20,000 to $65,000. Several thousand devices might be needed for the 400+ commercial passenger airports in the U.S., with a total capital cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Installation, maintenance, and operating costs would be additional. The cost of deploying explosives detection equipment for passenger screening is unknown. Operating the equipment would require additional screening procedures and might lead to costs for additional screening personnel. Regulations and screening procedures for explosives trace detection on passengers are yet to be established. The current luggage regulations could serve as a model for future passenger screening criteria. Procedures need to be established for equipment use, including resolving detector alarms. Small increases in screening times could be logistically challenging due to the high number of airline passengers. The TSA aims for passenger wait times under 10 minutes, with screening systems processing 7 to 10 passengers per minute. Additional screening that slows throughput may lead to airport congestion and economic impacts. The TSA's pilot deployment of passenger explosives trace detection equipment will provide valuable information on passenger throughput. If screening times do not increase significantly, there may be minimal additional economic costs. However, if passenger throughput decreases, alternative screening methods may need to be considered. Adding screening lanes or using explosives detection equipment selectively on passengers recommended by the 9/11 Commission could help mitigate economic impacts. The accuracy of explosives trace detection is crucial, with challenges like false positives and false negatives. Balancing between these two is essential to minimize the burden of verifying results. Adjusting detection criteria can help trade off between false positives and false negatives, but complete elimination of either is not possible. The appropriate balance between false positives and false negatives in explosives trace detection is crucial. Innocuous true positives, such as passengers with legitimate reasons for contact with explosives, may lead to additional security scrutiny. Privacy concerns may arise with the addition of passenger explosives trace detection to the screening process. Issues of privacy may be raised by the connection between innocuous true positives and passenger medical status or field of employment. Equipment using a vacuum \"wand\" or puffs of air for sample collection may offend passengers' sense of propriety. Passenger reluctance could increase screening times. Allowing alternative forms of screening, such as within privacy enclosures or different imaging technology, might mitigate concerns. Another worry is the potential exploitation of a passenger screening regimen with explosives trace detection to disrupt airport operations by disseminating trace quantities of explosives on commonly touched objects. This could lead to many positive detections on passengers, making trace detection less effective for security screening. The DHS and other federal agencies fund research on trace explosives detection for airport security screening. Research focuses on increasing sensitivity and reducing sample analysis time. Detection of novel explosives is a key challenge. The DHS is evaluating technologies to detect liquid explosives, focusing on bulk detection methods such as scanners for testing bottle contents. Unlike imaging techniques, trace analysis provides no opportunity for human operators to identify suspicious materials based on experience or intuition. Novel explosives are difficult to detect until identifying characteristics and reference standards are developed and incorporated into equipment designs. The DHS is evaluating technologies for detecting liquid explosives, focusing on bulk detection methods like scanners for testing bottle contents. Trace detection systems can also be used to find liquids if designed to detect them."
