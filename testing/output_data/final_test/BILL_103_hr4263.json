    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business and Minority Small Business Procurement Opportunities Act of 1994.\" It amends the Small Business Act to include new functions for the Small Business Administration, such as coordinating the use of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network by small businesses and providing training on the Network. Section 15(j) of the Small Business Act is amended to reserve contracts under $100,000 for small businesses unless competitive offers cannot be obtained. Contracting officers must consider responsive offers from eligible small businesses. This amendment does not prevent contract awards under specific authorities. Contracts under certain sections of various laws must consider small business concerns and may include fast payment terms and electronic fund transfers. Purchases below a certain threshold are exempt from small business reserve requirements. Section 4 amends definitions related to procurement thresholds in the Small Business Act. Section 5 establishes contract goals for small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals and certain institutions of higher education. Section 8(g) of the Small Business Act is amended to establish Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded to small businesses and those owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The goals include a minimum of 20% for small business participation and 5% for disadvantaged individuals in prime contract and subcontract awards annually. In fiscal years 1994 through 2000, executive agencies are required to allocate a total combined amount for contracts and subcontracts with small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions including Hispanic-serving institutions. The head of the agency must set a specific goal within the 5 percent overall goal for awarding contracts to historically Black colleges and universities and minority institutions. Procedures will be provided for contracting officers to set goals for prime contractors to meet the 5 percent goal for awarding subcontracts, including to minority-owned media. The head of the agency must provide technical and infrastructure assistance to entities, including historically Black colleges and universities and minority institutions, to achieve specific goals for awarding contracts. Technical assistance includes information about programs and procurement procedures, and the agency may contract with minority private sector entities for additional support. Private sector entities with expertise in technical assistance services are awarded annual contracts by the agency based on their ability to bring in minority small businesses, historically Black colleges, and minority institutions. The agency aims to carry out programs at colleges and universities that share the cost burden. The agency head is responsible for ensuring progress in increasing contract awards to entities. The agency head is tasked with increasing contract awards to entities and monitoring prime contractors' progress. Evaluations are made to assess the effectiveness of using certain authorities and compliance requirements to achieve the 5 percent goal. Advance payments may be made to facilitate reaching the goal. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provides guidance for making advance payments to contractors under section 305 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. Agency heads may use less than full competitive procedures to achieve the 5 percent goal, but must not exceed fair market cost by more than 10 percent per contract. The agency head adjusts payment percentages to contractors or subcontractors to ensure fair competition. They aim to maximize participation of minority small businesses, historically Black colleges, and minority institutions. Regulations will be prescribed to achieve these goals. The regulations shall provide procedures for contracting officers to incentivize prime contractors to increase subcontractor awards to specific entities. Contracting officers must prioritize awarding contracts to these entities across all industry categories. Additionally, guidance will be given on the relationship between different programs implementing the subsection and established under subsection (a). The regulations will include procedures for contracting officers to prioritize awarding contracts to specific entities under the small business set-aside program. Additionally, policies and procedures will ensure current levels of contracts awarded under the program are maintained. The regulations will prioritize awarding contracts to specific entities under the small business set-aside program and ensure current contract levels are maintained. Implementation will not alter the procurement process, and contracting officers' performance evaluation will consider their ability to increase contract awards to eligible entities. Technical assistance to entities will also be increased. Increased technical assistance will be provided to entities described in paragraph (2). Misrepresentation for securing a contract under paragraph (2) will result in imprisonment or a fine. Contracts under this section will require compliance with specific regulations. The head of the agency must ensure a fair distribution of contracts among industry categories to meet the goal established in paragraph (2). The agency must ensure contracts are awarded across a broad range of industry categories to meet the goal established. Requests can be made to determine if small disadvantaged business set asides have caused a particular industry category to bear a disproportionate share of contracts, with actions taken to limit set asides in that category if necessary. The administration will issue regulations to ensure compliance with subcontracting plan requirements for procurement contracts under the program. Subcontracting plans will be a factor in evaluating bids or proposals, and an annual report on progress will be submitted to Congress by December 15 each year. The administration will submit a report to Congress on each executive agency's progress in achieving small business participation goals in procurement contracts. Compliance with goals for small disadvantaged businesses will also be included in the report. This subsection does not override any other laws establishing agency obligations for small business participation. The requirement for agencies to obligate 5 percent or more of total prime contract awards with certain entities for fiscal years 1994 through 2000. The Coast Guard and NASA are considered executive agencies for this purpose. The Small Business Act is amended to allow the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to waive certain requirements for innovative and alternative procurement test programs. This amendment is in consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration."
