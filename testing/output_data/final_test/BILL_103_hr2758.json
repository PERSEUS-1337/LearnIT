The Congress finds that the Cuban economy has declined by 45% in the last 3 years due to the end of Soviet Union subsidization and decreased trade. This has led to a deterioration in the welfare and health of the Cuban people, exacerbated by the Castro regime's refusal to implement reforms for democracy or economic recovery.
