    "content": "The \"Social Security Notch Act of 1993\" may establish a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for computing or recomputing an individual's primary insurance amount, including a transitional increase amount. The applicable transitional increase amount is calculated based on the difference under old law and the applicable percentage of that difference. The applicable percentage of the difference under old law is added to the individual's benefits based on a table when they become eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The percentage of difference under old law to be added to an individual's benefits when they become eligible for old-age insurance benefits varies from 70 percent in 1979 to 25 percent in 1987. In 1987, the difference under old law to be added to an individual's benefits when they become eligible for old-age insurance benefits is 25 percent. The applicable old law primary insurance amount is determined based on the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under the old law provisions in effect in December 1978, with modifications as specified. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply, and section 215(b) as of December 1978 is used, except for section 215(b)(2)(C). The individual's 'computation base years' for calculating the primary insurance amount may include only calendar years after 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) up to the year the individual turns 61, plus the 3 calendar years with the highest wages and self-employment income. The paragraph applies if it results in a higher primary insurance amount for the individual compared to the old law provisions in effect in December 1978. The paragraph applies if it results in a higher primary insurance amount for the individual compared to the old law provisions in effect in December 1978. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATED RULES. The amendments made by this Act shall be effective as if included in the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no retroactive benefit increases. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act to reflect the amendments made by the Act."
