    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1998\". Congress acknowledges the right of States to collect taxes on purchases from Indian tribes, but this has been hindered by tribal immunity claims in Federal court. Failure of an Indian tribe or its members to collect State taxes deprives the State of essential revenue needed for infrastructure and citizen welfare, creating a disadvantage for non-tribal businesses that fulfill their tax obligations. This may lead to some businesses being forced to close. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. COLLECTION OF STATE TAXES.\" is about the collection of state taxes, which is crucial for infrastructure and citizen welfare. Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code is amended to include provisions for Indian tribes to collect qualified state taxes on goods and services, such as tobacco products and motor fuel. The State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1998 exempts State taxes on purchases from tribal retail enterprises by non-tribal members, with exceptions for certain cases. The State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1998 exempts State taxes on purchases from tribal retail enterprises by non-tribal members, with exceptions for cases where the Indian tribe imposes and collects an equivalent tax or if the State has waived the applicability of the tax. The State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1998 exempts State taxes on purchases from tribal retail enterprises by non-tribal members, with exceptions for cases where the tax falls on an Indian tribe or if there is an agreement exempting the enterprise from collecting the tax. The term 'tribal immunity' refers to the immunity of an Indian tribe from Federal court jurisdiction and judicial review, including tribal retail enterprises owned or operated by an Indian tribe or member. The owner or operator of a tribal retail enterprise, which is owned by an Indian tribe or member, must collect and remit qualified State taxes. States can seek declaratory judgments in district courts regarding the applicability of these taxes. A State can take legal action in district court against a tribal retail enterprise or an Indian tribe or member who owns or operates it to enforce the collection of State taxes. Tribal immunity can be waived in such cases to obtain a judgment. The amendments made by section 3 apply to sales of goods or services under section 1362(b) of title 28, US Code, after the enactment of this Act."
