    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Dental and Optometric Care Access Act\" or the \"DOC Access Act.\" It aims to improve health care coverage under vision and dental plans by amending Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act. The \"Dental and Optometric Care Access Act\" or \"DOC Access Act\" aims to improve health care coverage under vision and dental plans by allowing doctors of optometry and dental surgery to charge enrollees for items or services not covered by the plan at a determined amount. The \"DOC Access Act\" allows doctors to charge non-enrolled individuals a negotiated rate for items or services not covered by the plan, ensuring the amount is reasonable and not nominal. The agreement between the plan and doctor must reflect this negotiated rate. The \"DOC Access Act\" allows doctors to charge non-enrolled individuals a negotiated rate for items or services not covered by the plan, ensuring the amount is reasonable and not nominal. The negotiated rate for providers in the network can only be changed with a subsequent agreement signed by the doctor. Limited scope vision and dental plans agreements cannot exceed two years. Plans cannot deny a doctor participation for ancillary services or procedures without cause. The \"DOC Access Act\" prohibits plans from denying a doctor's participation based on ancillary services or procedures. Plans cannot require doctors to join specific networks for limited scope benefits. Plans cannot interfere with existing doctor-patient relationships or state/federal requirements. The \"DOC Access Act\" prohibits plans from restricting a doctor's choice of laboratories or suppliers. Individuals affected by violations can take legal action for injunctive relief and recover damages. The \"DOC Access Act\" grants exclusive jurisdiction to district courts for civil actions related to the act. It defines terms like 'doctor of dental surgery' and 'doctor of optometry' for legal practice within states. Section 2722(c)(1) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include the requirements subject to section 2719B."
