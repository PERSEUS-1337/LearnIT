    "content": "This report summarizes federal programs addressing behavioral health among the American Indian and Alaska Native population. Congress and the Administration have shown interest in addressing issues such as alcohol and drug use disorders, and youth suicide. Legislation has been introduced to improve the health of this population, including recommendations and funding for behavioral health initiatives. In 2014, the President mentioned substance abuse and suicide when announcing the Generation Indigenous initiative. Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) is a federal initiative collaborating with organizations like the Aspen Institute to assist tribal youth through programs, policies, and leadership opportunities. The report clarifies the scope of information covered and provides background on AI/AN behavioral health, including risk factors, specific problems, and limited access to care. It summarizes programs meeting inclusion criteria and discusses how understanding existing program limits can inform policy decisions. The report describes programs supporting prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, substance use disorders, and suicide among the AI/AN population. It distinguishes between the overall AI/AN population and members of Indian Tribes targeted by federal programs. The self-identified AI/AN population in 2014 was 5.2 million, including 2.6 million individuals who identified as only AI or AN. In 2014, the self-identified AI/AN population was 5.2 million, including 2.6 million individuals who identified as only AI or AN and 2.7 million who identified as AI/AN in combination with another race. Designing programs to improve AI/AN behavioral health requires collaboration among federal agencies, tribal governments, and other organizations. This report focuses on the activities of the Indian Health Service and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health. The report focuses on two key federal agencies for health care among the AI/AN population: the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Other federal programs that support AI/AN well-being, including behavioral health, are not addressed in this report. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare directly or funds Indian Tribes (ITs) or Tribal Organizations (TOs) to operate healthcare facilities for approximately 2.2 million individuals, primarily members of federally recognized tribes. IHS may also serve individuals not belonging to federally recognized tribes. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare services to individuals of all ages through facilities in 35 states, focusing on primary care, prevention, and treatment of common conditions among American Indians and Alaska Natives. SAMHSA supports mental health and substance abuse services through grant programs, with ITs and TOs eligible to apply directly for certain grants. SAMHSA distributes funds to tribal entities through programs like the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness program. The Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy collaborates with tribal communities, ITs, TOs, and federal agencies on behavioral health issues. The report includes agency efforts to implement the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, focusing on reducing alcohol and drug usage. SAMHSA's Tribal Technical Advisory Committee facilitates information exchange on public health issues and collaborative approaches to addressing behavioral health needs in the AI/AN population. This report specifically targets behavioral health programs by IHS and SAMHSA for AI/AN communities. IHS offers scholarships and loan repayment to recruit providers to facilities, including behavioral health providers. IHS and SAMHSA participate in interagency activities related to AI/AN behavioral health, but approach it differently. IHS delivers health care directly or under contracts/compacts with ITs or TOs, including facilities focused on behavioral health. SAMHSA does not deliver health care services. Research on AI/AN behavioral health highlights high prevalence of risk factors and limited access to care. Social determinants like education, employment, and poverty play a significant role in health outcomes. Economic adversity and poor social conditions contribute to the high rates of behavioral health problems in the AI/AN population. The AI/AN population faces challenges such as education, poverty, discrimination in healthcare, and cultural differences, leading to disparities in income and education compared to other demographic groups in the US. These social determinants can impact various health conditions, including behavioral health issues. The AI/AN population has higher rates of behavioral health problems, including the highest suicide rates in 2014 compared to other racial/ethnic groups. They also have higher rates of substance use disorders, particularly alcohol and marijuana use disorders, leading to significant disparities in social, economic, and health outcomes. Intergenerational disparities in social, economic, physical, mental, and spiritual health exist in AI/AN communities, with alcohol-related deaths six times higher than the national average. Higher rates of PTSD, childhood conduct disorder, and suicidal behaviors are observed, but major depressive disorder is less common. Data collection and analysis are challenging due to small sample sizes in the AI/AN population. Studies among the AI/AN population face challenges due to small sample sizes, lack of comparisons to other groups, and inconsistent designation of individuals. Access to healthcare for behavioral health conditions is difficult for AI/ANs living in rural areas. Access to care in rural areas for the AI/AN population is challenging due to provider shortages, especially in behavioral health. IHS struggles to recruit and retain providers, with approximately 1,500 vacant positions. Geographic remoteness and other barriers impede access to appropriate healthcare for AI/ANs. Non-IHS-funded facilities may not provide culturally competent care for AI/AN patients, leading to reluctance to seek treatment due to cultural differences. Financial barriers also exist as non-IHS facilities require payment for services, which some AI/ANs may not be able to afford. IHS and SAMHSA have programs to improve AI/AN behavioral health, but differences exist between the two agencies. Programs and grants are listed separately, and not all programs are comprehensive for treating behavioral health conditions. AI/ANs may receive behavioral health services from IHS programs not focused on behavioral health, and SAMHSA funds may not always be specifically relevant to the AI/AN population. SAMHSA programs included in the report may not be specifically relevant to the AI/AN population, leading to potential inaccuracies in estimating spending on AI/AN behavioral health. The report does not capture federal funding for these programs. IHS programs, authorized by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, are structured under two main umbrella programs for behavioral health: the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program and the IHS Mental Health/Social Services Program. The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) provides preventive, educational, and treatment services for AI/ANs, delivered in conjunction with primary health services and through telehealth. Services can be provided by IHS, ITs, or TOs using ISDEAA funding mechanisms. 80% of programs are operated by ITs or TOs. Health care providers in IHS facilities must consult state PDMP databases before prescribing opioids. The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) provides services for AI/ANs, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment. IHS funds the Fetal Alcohol and Drug Unit (FADU) at the University of Washington for consultations, referrals, and resources on FASD. FADU collects data for prevention and treatment strategies. The Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment in Primary Care program at IHS-funded facilities incorporates substance abuse treatment into primary care and emergency services. Patients with substance use disorders receive medical advice and consultations, while those with severe substance use-related problems are referred to treatment. IHS promotes the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) strategy for community-based screening for health risk behaviors, including substance use. The Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI) program provides substance abuse and suicide prevention resources to IHS-funded facilities. The Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI) program provides substance abuse, suicide prevention, and intervention resources to IHS-funded facilities. Grantee programs must address community needs assessment, suicide prevention, methamphetamine prevention, and Gen-I Initiative support within a five-year period. Data is collected from grantee programs in collaboration with various organizations. In FY2016, new funds were made available to support the goals of the MSPI and Gen-I Initiative. The MSPI and Gen-I Initiative grants support early intervention strategies and youth development programming to reduce substance abuse and suicidal behavior among AI/AN youth. New applicants must implement evidence-based approaches, promote self-sufficiency, family engagement, and culturally appropriate prevention activities. Current grantees must hire additional behavioral health staff and can use funds to supplement existing activities. IHS funds 11 Youth Regional Treatment Centers providing residential substance abuse and mental health services to AI/AN youth. The IHS provides mental health services to AI/AN youth through regionalized facilities in 12 areas. Two areas contract for services, and a new facility is being built in California. The MH/SS Program offers preventive and clinical services, with 50% operated by ITs or TOs. The most common program model is crisis-oriented outpatient services. The IHS provides mental health services to AI/AN youth through regionalized facilities in 12 areas, with after-hour emergency services offered by local non-IHS hospitals. Intermediate level services are typically accessed through state and local resources. IHS programs within MM/SS's scope include Behavioral Health Integration with Primary Care, Telebehavioral Health, Workforce Development, and Zero Suicide Initiative. Behavioral Health Integration with Primary Care program incorporates behavioral health treatment into primary care to identify and intervene with high-risk individuals. The IHS Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) partners with the University of New Mexico to provide televideo clinical services, including addiction medicine and psychiatry, to patients at IHS-funded facilities. TBHCE also offers continuing education courses and IHS launched the Zero Suicide Initiative in FY2015, based on a model developed by the Education Developmental Center, Inc. (EDC). The Zero Suicide Initiative, funded by IHS, educates healthcare providers on suicide prevention and supports evidence-based practices. IHS is funding 10 pilot sites implementing this model and has developed a suicide surveillance reporting tool. The American Indians into Psychology Program aims to attract AI/ANs into health professions through scholarships. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides scholarships for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students in clinical psychology programs. Three institutions received grant funding in FY2014: Oklahoma State University, University of North Dakota, and University of Montana. Graduates must work in AI/AN communities for a specified period. SAMHSA awards grants tailored for AI/AN populations. SAMHSA administers grants specifically tailored for the AI/AN population, focusing on mental health treatment and suicide prevention. One program, the Systems of Care (SOC) initiative, provides funding to improve mental health outcomes for children with serious conditions and their families. The SOC program aims to address children's diverse needs by providing culturally appropriate services in a supportive environment. The Circles of Care program supports the implementation of behavioral health services for children and families, focusing on building infrastructure and capacity. Grantees must emphasize collaboration and cultural appropriateness in their approach. The GLS Youth Suicide Prevention\u2014Campus program targets improving mental health outcomes for youth. The GLS Youth Suicide Prevention\u2014Campus program aims to improve suicide prevention efforts in higher education by providing services for students with mental health issues and substance abuse problems. Grant-funded activities include outreach and support for at-risk students. The GLS Youth Suicide Prevention\u2014State/Tribal program focuses on reducing suicides and non-fatal attempts by developing statewide or tribal prevention strategies. Grant recipients are required to collaborate with local youth-serving institutions. The Native Connections program, also known as Tribal Behavioral Health Grants, supports efforts to promote mental health and reduce substance abuse and suicidal behavior among AI/AN youth. Grantees collaborate with local institutions, assess resources, address gaps, collect data on suicide attempts and substance abuse, and provide follow-up care and support services for young community members. Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health) aims to promote the health and well-being of children through coordination of agencies and funding reforms. Grants support pilot programs in communities with high service needs to address various aspects of children's development. SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention administers the Strategic Prevention Framework- Partnerships for Success grants. The SPF-PFS State and Tribal Initiative grants target underage drinking and prescription drug misuse among specific age groups. These grants aim to prevent substance abuse by implementing SAMSHA's Strategic Prevention Framework. Eligibility requires completion of the SPF-SIG grant to build a foundation for prevention services. Grantees are expected to enhance infrastructure and capacity for preventive services at various levels. ITs can use grant funds to address additional substance abuse prevention priorities. SAMHSA's Treatment Drug Court grants support substance abuse treatment services in adult drug courts, Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts, and Juvenile Treatment Drug Courts. Funds must serve individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders in need of treatment. SAMHSA Treatment Drug Court grants support substance abuse treatment services in adult drug courts, Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts, and Juvenile Treatment Drug Courts. Grantees may use funds for co-morbid conditions like mental health disorders, while expenditures must align with the drug court model. The report provides background information on behavioral health among the AI/AN population and federal programs, without addressing policy options. This information can help policymakers address potential policy issues related to AI/AN behavioral health care. The shortage of behavioral health providers in rural areas where the IHS beneficiary population resides is a challenge for IHS and SAMHSA-supported programs. Efforts are being made by IHS, SAMHSA, and HRSA to address workforce issues in AI/AN behavioral health care. Policymakers may need to coordinate or modify existing workforce programs to mitigate the impact of shortages on prevention and treatment programs. Fiscal constraints may hinder these efforts due to high demand for funding. Improving access to culturally competent care, such as integrating traditional AI/AN healing practices with mainstream health care, has been identified as a potential solution. Improving access to culturally competent care for AI/AN populations, such as integrating traditional healing practices with mainstream health care, can lead to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Policymakers should consider additional approaches to increase the culturally competent workforce, like training health care providers from other racial and ethnic groups about AI/AN culture. Data collection challenges exist in determining the need for programs and evaluating their effectiveness due to issues with identifying the AI/AN population in research. Policymakers may face challenges in data collection for AI/AN populations due to issues with sample size and mapping rates of conditions. They may need to balance programs addressing behavioral health directly, socioeconomic conditions, or a combination of both. Policymakers may need to consider evaluating the impact of programs on improving socioeconomic conditions and behavioral health rates."
