    "content": "The Child Care reauthorization includes legislation to reauthorize the ChildCare and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act and extend mandatory funding under Section 418 of the Social Security Act. The 108th Congress did not complete action to reauthorize either the CCDBG Act or the mandatory child care funding, which expired in FY2002. Funding for the CCDBG has been continued through temporary extensions and annual appropriations. The House passed H.R. 4, a consolidated bill including discretionary funding authorization and amendments to the CCDBG Act. The Senate had two separate bills but failed to reach a final vote. The Senate Finance Committee's version included mandatory funding for child care, while the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee's bill focused on discretionary funding authorization. The Senate bills on discretionary funding authorization for child care did not reach a final vote. Senator Snowe's amendment to increase mandatory child care funding was accepted. Current law authorizes discretionary CCDBG funding at $1 billion annually. Actual appropriation levels have exceeded this amount. The House and Senate proposed authorizing discretionary funding for child care at increasing levels from $2.3 billion in FY2004 to $3.1 billion in FY2008. Mandatory funding for the CCDBG was preappropriated in the Social Security Act, with funding maintained at $2.717 billion since FY2002. Funding for child care in H.R. 4 was set at $2.917 billion annually for FY2004-2008, with a proposed increase of $1 billion over five years. Senator Snowe planned to offer an amendment for a larger increase in child care funding on the Senate floor. An amendment by Snowe was approved, providing an additional $6 billion over five years in mandatory child care funding. The Senate approved an amendment by Senator Snowe, providing an additional $6 billion over five years in mandatory child care funding. This would have increased the funding allotment each year from $700 million in FY2005 to $1.7 billion in FY2009. The House-passed version of H.R. 4 would have allowed states to transfer up to 50% of their annual TANF grants to the CCDBG, while the Senate version proposed to maintain current law. The CCDBG Act required a percentage of funds to be spent on direct services, with S. 880 mandating at least 70% for this purpose. States could use excess funds for payment rate increases and establish tiered rates. Stricter requirements for setting payment rates were proposed. Quality activities, such as consumer education, must account for at least 4% of total CCDBG expenditures. Both the House-passed version of H.R. 4 and the HELP Committee's S. 880 aimed to increase the percentage of CCDBG funds spent on quality activities to a minimum of 6%. They provided detailed categories of quality activities, including school readiness, staff training, and retention initiatives. The Senate bill also allowed quality funds to be used for evaluating and assessing programs. S. 880 and H.R. 4 proposed changes to CCDBG funding, with S. 880 emphasizing evaluating program quality and effectiveness. H.R. 4 allowed states to set income eligibility levels without a federal maximum. Under current CCDBG law, states can set income eligibility levels with priorities based on need. Proposed changes in H.R. 4 and S. 880 would require additional elements in state plans, such as providing consumer education, coordinating child care services with other programs, and addressing special needs child care. S. 880 also included provisions for states to demonstrate their process in their state plans. S. 880 required states to demonstrate their process for redetermining eligibility every six months, set provider payment rates based on market surveys, ensure timely payments to providers, and make survey results public within 30 days. S. 880 introduced new data reporting requirements for states administering CCDBG programs, including monthly data collection and quarterly submission to HHS. It proposed changes to the list of data elements collected monthly and eliminated the separate annual report, incorporating annual provider information in the fourth quarterly report. Titles II and III of the bill contained provisions separate from CCDBG law and the Social Security Act. Title II and Title III of the bill included provisions to enhance security at child care centers in federal facilities and establish a small business childcare grant program. A detailed comparison of child care provisions in the House-passed and Senate Finance Committee-reported versions of the bill is provided in Table 1, with references to current law. The Snowe amendment in the section on mandatory funding is noted in a comparison of child care provisions in H.R. 4 as passed by the House, reported by the Senate Finance Committee, and S. 880."
