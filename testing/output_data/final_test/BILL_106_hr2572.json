    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Apollo Exploration Award Act of 2000\". Congress findings include the first humans landing on the moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission, followed by ten other Americans exploring the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972. The Apollo lunar landing missions were successful due to the pioneering work of previous Apollo missions, including Apollo 7 and Apollo 8. Apollo 13 safely returned from the Moon after an explosion disabled their command module in April 1970. In January 1967, astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger B. Chaffee tragically lost their lives in a fire during a spacecraft test for the first manned Apollo mission. Since the Apollo program, astronauts have shared their experiences to inspire space exploration and human achievement. Several astronauts, including Ronald E. Evans, James B. Irwin, Stuart A. Roosa, Alan B. Shepard Jr., and Charles J. \"Pete\" Conrad Jr., have passed away after completing their missions. The Congress acknowledges the bravery and achievements of Apollo program astronauts and proposes an Apollo Exploration Award. The Administrator of NASA will create the \"Apollo Exploration Award\" to honor Apollo astronauts with a lunar rock sample as the central feature. Awards will be presented to astronauts or their family members. The Administrator of NASA will create the \"Apollo Exploration Award\" to honor Apollo astronauts with a lunar rock sample.
