The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will reduce a State's annual allocation by 25 percent under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 if the State does not have laws and procedures in place for conducting records checks before issuing driver's licenses and identification documents. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will reduce a State's annual allocation by 25 percent under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 if the State does not have laws and procedures in place for conducting records checks before issuing driver's licenses and identification documents. Additionally, licenses must have a magnetic strip encoded with information to identify the licensee as a prohibited or nonprohibited person, readable only by a specific electronic device. If a person is identified as a prohibited person, their driver's license will be seized and voided by the State court. This action is taken if the person is convicted of a felony punishable by more than one year in prison or adjudicated as mentally incompetent. The State transportation agency will attach a magnetic strip to the license of a prohibited person, identifying them as such. Funding for criminal records checks will be covered by fines imposed on convicted felons in addition to their sentence. The State must maintain a computerized list of prohibited persons based on convictions or adjudications, with 80% currency of case dispositions within 5 years. The term \"license\" refers to a permit to operate a motor vehicle or any state-issued identification document. The term \"prohibited person\" refers to individuals who have been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year, adjudicated mentally incompetent and not restored to capacity, or are unlawful users of controlled substances. The Attorney General of the United States is responsible for creating a national list of prohibited persons, incorporating State criminal history records into the Federal system, developing systems to link State and national lists, and providing access to the national list to responsible State agencies upon request. Additionally, procedures for correcting erroneous records are outlined. Procedures for correcting erroneous records include requesting information from the Attorney General, submitting additional information for correction, and the Attorney General considering and investigating the provided information within 5 days. The General will investigate and correct any erroneous Federal records related to a person, and notify the relevant departments or agencies of the errors. Any person wrongly identified as prohibited can take legal action for damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees if successful. Licensed firearms dealers are required to check the magnetic strip on a driver's license of anyone trying to buy a firearm. Licensed firearms dealers must use an electronic device to read the magnetic strip on an identification document before transferring a firearm to ensure the buyer is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. Licensed firearms dealers must use an electronic device to read the magnetic strip on an identification document issued by the transportation agency of the State or fail to notify law enforcement of any prohibited person attempting to purchase a firearm within 72 hours. The term \"prohibited person\" refers to someone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year. The amendment to Section 924(a) of the title imposes penalties for individuals convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year, adjudicated mentally incompetent, not restored to capacity, restored for less than 5 years, or unlawful users of controlled substances. The term \"transportation agency\" refers to the entity issuing identification documents. The amendment to Section 924(a) of the title introduces penalties for knowingly violating section 922(y)(1), including a minimum 6-month imprisonment and the option for enlistment in the Armed Forces upon conviction. If the defendant accepts the enlistment offer, a probationary sentence with specific conditions is imposed. The court may not modify or reduce any conditions set forth in a probation sentence imposed for knowingly violating section 922(y)(2). Subsections (c) and (d) of section 3564, and section 3565(b), do not apply to this probation sentence. A licensed dealer who knowingly violates section 922(y)(2) faces a minimum $15,000 fine, 1 to 3 years imprisonment, or both. The Act and its amendments will take effect at the end of a 2-year period starting from the enactment date."
