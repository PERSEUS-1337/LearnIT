    "content": "The Act of 1994 is titled the \"Radiation Experimentation Compensation Act\" and includes findings, purpose, and an apology. The Congress finds that since the 1940's, the Federal Government conducted secret radiation experiments in the United States without informed consent. Experiments included injections of plutonium, ingestion of irradiated food, exposure to radiation, and prescription of radioactive medication to pregnant women for research purposes. The Federal Government conducted secret radiation experiments on individuals without informing them of the risks, resulting in harm and health problems. The Congress acknowledges the risk posed to innocent individuals who unknowingly participated in these experiments. The Federal Government conducted secret radiation experiments on individuals without informing them of the risks, resulting in harm and health problems. The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation to the individuals and their families for the hardships endured due to the experiments. The purpose of this Act is to establish a procedure for partial restitution to these individuals, although monetary compensation can never fully compensate them. The Trust Fund is established as part of the Act to provide partial restitution to individuals harmed by secret radiation experiments conducted by the Federal Government. The \"Radiation Experimentation Compensation Trust Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to provide restitution for individuals harmed by secret radiation experiments. The Fund is administered by the Secretary of the Treasury and investments are made in accordance with specific guidelines. Amounts in the Fund are available for disbursement by the Attorney General, and the Fund will terminate when the authorized amount is appropriated. The \"Radiation Experimentation Compensation Trust Fund\" is established to provide restitution for individuals harmed by secret radiation experiments. $100,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the Fund, with any remaining amounts after 22 years to be liquidated and deposited in the Treasury. SEC. 4. CLAIMS ELIGIBLE FOR PAYMENT. Individuals exposed to radiation without consent in federal government experiments between 1940 and 1974 are eligible for $50,000 if a claim is filed and approved by the Attorney General. An \"experiment\" is defined as a research test involving radiation exposure on the human body. Individuals exposed to radiation through various means such as injection, ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure to radioactive substances fall under the definition of being involved in federal government experiments. The term \"Federal Government\" encompasses the legislative, judicial, or executive branches of the United States government, as well as any agencies or entities funded or authorized by them for experiments involving human radiation exposure. The term \"informed consent\" refers to an individual's agreement to participate in an experiment after being fully informed of its nature and potential consequences. This consent can be given by the individual themselves or by their parent or legal guardian if the individual is a minor or incompetent. Informed consent requires individuals, or their parent/legal guardian if a minor or incompetent, to make a judgment on participating in an experiment. SEC. 5. DETERMINATION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. The Attorney General establishes filing procedures for individuals to submit claims for payments under the Act. Each claim is reviewed to determine if it meets the requirements, and payments are made from the Fund for eligible claims. Payments made under the Act may be offset by previous awards or settlements. Upon final award or settlement on a claim against any person for participation in an experiment, payments under this Act can offset those made under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Subrogation rights apply upon claim payment. Upon payment of a claim under this section, the Federal Government is subrogated to the individual's right or claim against any person involved in the experiment. In cases of deceased individuals, payments can only be made to the surviving spouse. If the individual is not survived by a spouse, payments will be made to their children, then to their parents, and finally to their grandchildren in equal shares. If an individual eligible for payment under this Act dies before filing a claim, the payment will be made to their surviving spouse, children, parents, siblings, and finally to their grandparents in equal shares. Under this Act, a survivor of an individual eligible for payment may file a claim on their behalf. Definitions include a child, grandchild, grandparent, and parent. The term \"parent\" includes fathers and mothers through adoption. The term \"sibling of the individual\" means a child of the parent or parents of the individual. The term \"spouse\" means a person married to the relevant individual for at least 12 months before their death. The Attorney General must make a determination on claims within 18 months, and if the claim meets requirements, payment will be made. Payment under this Act, when accepted by an individual or their survivors, settles all claims against the United States arising from the experiment. Administrative costs cannot be deducted from the payment. The Attorney General's duties end when the Fund terminates. Payments to individuals are treated according to internal revenue laws. The Attorney General should use available funds to carry out functions under this Act and may issue necessary regulations. Initial regulations must be issued within 120 days of enactment. Individuals receiving compensation under this Act are not considered income for benefit eligibility. Judicial Review: An individual denied compensation under this Act can seek initial judicial review in a US district court. The court will review the denial based on the administrative record and can overturn it if found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. The individual can appeal the district court's decision to higher Federal courts. SEC. 6. CLAIMS NOT ASSIGNABLE OR TRANSFERABLE. No claim under this Act can be assigned or transferred. SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON CLAIMS. An individual or their survivors must file a claim within 20 years of the enactment of this Act to receive payment. SEC. 8. ATTORNEY OR AGENT FEES. Agents or attorneys assisting with a claim cannot receive more than 10% of the payment made under this Act. Violators will face fines. SEC. 9. CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY PAYMENT. SEC. 9. A payment under section 5(c)(1) does not count as compensation or reimbursement for imposing liability on the recipient to repay insurance or worker's compensation. It also does not impact any claims against insurance carriers or individuals for worker's compensation. SEC. 10. Payments and contracts under this Act are subject to budget compliance."
