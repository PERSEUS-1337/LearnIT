    "content": "After June 12, 2009, households with analog-only televisions must switch to digital by buying a converter box, getting a digital TV, or subscribing to cable/satellite services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 mandated that full-power TV broadcasts transition to digital-only, ending analog signals. Congress is overseeing the digital transition to ensure American households are prepared for the switch to exclusively digital signals on channels 2 through 51. President-elect Obama's team requested a possible postponement of the transition date due to concerns about converter box coupons and federal support. Groups expressed concerns over the funding ceiling for converter box coupons and the lack of federal support for vulnerable populations in preparing for the digital transition. Calls to postpone the transition date were made due to the delay in coupon distribution and insufficient resources for households. Postponing the transition was seen as necessary to allow for additional federal funding and resources to assist households in preparing for the switch. Delaying the digital transition date was supported by Democratic FCC Commissioners and argued to allow for adequate funding of the coupon program, enhanced public outreach, and more time to address reception issues. Opponents feared confusion among the public who had already been exposed to various outreach efforts. On January 14, 2009, Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez opposed delaying the DTV transition date, recommending increased budget authority for immediate coupon distribution. Senator Rockefeller filed a bill the next day in support. The Senate passed the DTV Delay Act (S. 352) on January 29, 2009, extending the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009, and the coupon application deadline to July 31, 2009. Public safety users were exempted from FCC approval delays. The House made modifications to the DTV Delay Act, including exempting public safety users from FCC approval delays and delaying modifications to the coupon program until additional budget authority was available. The House initially failed to pass the amended bill, but the Senate passed a modified version (S. 352) which was eventually signed into law on February 11, 2009. The law change d the digital transition deadline from February 17 to June 12, 2009, and included provisions such as extending the coupon program deadline to July 31, 2009, allowing for replacement coupons for expired ones, and delaying program modifications until additional budget authority is available. Broadcasters were also allowed to switch off their analog signal early, and public safety radio services were addressed. The law extended the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009, allowing for replacement coupons and delaying program modifications until additional budget authority was obtained. Public safety radio services were also addressed. P.L. 111-5 allowed broadcasters to terminate their analog signals early with FCC approval and notification to customers. The DTV Delay Act postponed the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009, but many stations switched off analog signals before that date. The FCC required one affiliate of each major network to maintain an analog signal for local news and emergency information. By June 3, 2009, 784 stations had terminated their analog service early, with 6 more planning to do so before June 12. A total of 971 full-power stations terminated their analog signal on June 12. Many major network affiliates did not turn off their analog signal before this date. The FCC's national DTV call center prepared for peak activity during the week of February 17 for the digital transition. Over 32% of calls on February 18 were about reception and technical issues. By June 12, 2009, all full-power television stations in the United States no longer broadcast an analog signal. The FCC's consumer help line received over 900,000 calls between June 8 and June 15, with 28% seeking help setting up digital converter boxes, 26% reporting difficulty receiving an individual station, and 23% needing help with broader reception issues. Some viewers continue to experience digital signal reception problems, especially in areas where stations switched from UHF to VHF channels. The FCC predicts population losses for 401 stations and expects 31 stations to be temporarily dark due to financial or equipment issues. 118 stations are providing \"nightlight\" service with DTV and emergency information. Digital television (DTV) offers high-quality pictures and sound, including HDTV and multicasts. It also enables interactive features like pay-per-view. Viewers need a digital television set with a digital tuner to access DTV services. Digital television requires a digital television set with a digital tuner to receive signals over-the-air, via cable, or satellite. The transition to DTV aims to reclaim analog spectrum for more efficient use of radio frequency spectrum. The FCC and Congress are working to complete the transition quickly to reallocate the analog spectrum for other purposes. The analog spectrum is being reclaimed and reallocated for various purposes, including commercial wireless services and public safety communications. Revenue from spectrum auctions will contribute to federal deficit reduction. The transition to digital television offers a better viewing experience and allows broadcasters to offer more channels and services. Analog TV users will be most affected by the transition. Televisions for over-the-air broadcasts are most affected by the digital transition. Estimates vary on the number of analog TV sets impacted. Nielsen Media Research reported that 2.5% of TV households were unready for the transition as of June 7, 2009. A SmithGeiger survey found that 2.2 million households were unprepared, with 1.75 million households not taking any steps to prepare. The National Association of Broadcasters estimated 69 million analog television sets impacted by the transition, affecting 19.6 million households. Many policymakers are concerned about the impact of the digital transition on low-income, elderly, disabled, non-English speaking, minority, and rural populations who rely on over-the-air television. A survey showed that Americans aged 65 and older are more likely to receive TV signals via an antenna compared to younger households. The 2008 GAO survey found that lower-income households are at higher risk of losing television service, with African-American and Hispanic households most impacted by the DTV transition. MVPD households make up 85% of all households receiving television services. Approximately 85% of U.S. television households receive cable, satellite, or telephone company television services. Providers are expected to handle the digital-to-analog conversion for analog televisions. Cable and satellite households with spare televisions relying on over-the-air broadcasts will need a converter box for their analog televisions to function. The FCC adopted rules on September 11, 2007, to ensure cable customers continue to receive local TV stations after the transition. Cable operators must comply with a \"viewability requirement\" to carry the must-carry signal. The FCC requires cable operators to comply with a \"viewability requirement\" by carrying the must-carry signal in analog and digital formats or digital-only format with set-top boxes for all subscribers. Small cable systems are exempt from carrying digital broadcast signals if available in a viewable analog format. Analog-only televisions will need a digital-to-analog converter box to receive over-the-air broadcast signals after June 12, 2009. A separate converter box, priced at $40 to $70 each, is needed for analog over-the-air televisions to function. These converter boxes offer improved reception, additional features like closed captioning and parental controls, and access to multicasted channels. However, they do not enable high-definition viewing. The 109th Congress established a program to subsidize consumer purchases of converter boxes, providing up to two $40 coupons per household through the NTIA. The DTV Delay Act amended the statute to issue coupons for digital-to-analog converter boxes between January 1, 2008, and July 31, 2009. Expired coupons can be replaced, and the program is funded by the auction of the analog television spectrum. The initial funding was $990 million, with the possibility of raising it to $1.5 billion if needed. NTIA released the final rule for the converter box program on March 12, 2007. Starting on January 1, 2008, the converter box program offers up to two $40 coupons to U.S. households for purchasing digital-to-analog converter boxes. Coupons come with information on eligible models and retailers. If an additional $510 million is needed, only over-the-air households will be eligible for coupons during the \"Contingent Period,\" requiring self-certification of not subscribing to pay TV services. Cable and satellite households with extra over-the-air TVs may also be eligible. During the \"Initial Period\" of the converter box program, households with extra over-the-air televisions can get coupons, but not during the \"Contingent Period.\" Manufacturers and retailers must follow specific procedures to participate in the program, which is voluntary. Approved converter boxes must meet technical specifications for affordability and quality, with features like a smart antenna interface connector and program guide. Boxes with video recording or playback capabilities are not eligible for coupons. Retailers participating in the converter box coupon program must be certified by NTIA and comply with various requirements, including electronic coupon processing, inventory management, and fraud prevention measures. NTIA awarded a contract to IBM for running the program, with a total award of $119,968,468. The Box Coupon program, led by IBM, has a total award of $119,968,468. The contract includes consumer education, coupon distribution, and financial processing. Consumers can apply for converter box coupons online or by phone. NTIA is limited by law to not exceed $1.34 billion in total funding for coupons. Consumer demand for converter box coupons exceeded expectations in late 2008, possibly due to the economic downturn. NTIA reached its funding ceiling on January 5, 2009, placing new coupon requests on a waiting list. By March 2009, over 4 million coupon requests from 2 million households were on the waiting list. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $650 million to NTIA for converter box coupons, with $90 million for education and outreach. NTIA cleared the coupon request waiting list in March 2009 and is now distributing coupons via first class mail. Concerns about a possible converter box shortage due to higher demand than projected by NTIA. The NTIA is facing concerns about a potential shortage of converter boxes due to higher demand than initially projected. Retailers were urged to maintain sufficient inventory, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested information on the supply of converter boxes to meet consumer demand during the DTV transition. The committee requested updates every three weeks regarding converter box availability. Concerns were raised about potential shortages, with worries that they may occur regionally. Coupons for converter boxes expired three months after issuance, leading to concerns about the availability of lower-cost or preferred models. In May 2008, the 2008 converter box coupons expired. Concerns arose due to the initial unavailability of lower-cost or preferred models, prompting calls for allowing consumers to reapply for new coupons if theirs expired after 90 days. The DTV Delay Act reversed the prohibition on replacing expired coupons, allowing households to request one replacement coupon for each expired one. NTIA began accepting requests for replacement coupons on March 24, 2009. Eligible households needed a USPS mailing address, with P.O. box addresses only accepted for residents of specific areas without home mail delivery. The NTIA revised a rule in September 2008 to allow residents of nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and assisted living facilities to be eligible for the coupon program by providing their facility's name and how they receive television service. Applicants using post office boxes can also receive coupons by providing their physical address. The rule, effective since October 20, 2008, allows applicants with post office boxes to receive coupons by providing their physical residence. A converter box is needed to receive digital signals over-the-air, and antennas can vary in size and type. While most households can use their existing antenna for digital signals, some may need to adjust or upgrade their antenna for better reception, especially if they live near obstructions or at the edge of a station's broadcasting range. The FCC provides resources for fixing DTV reception issues, including a troubleshooting guide, publication, and online reception map. The test pilot program in Wilmington, NC highlighted DTV signal reception challenges, such as the \"digital cliff effect\" and reduced coverage areas. The FCC has estimated that about 5% of over-the-air viewers may need a new antenna due to the \"digital cliff effect,\" equivalent to about 1% of all TV households. Some digital stations will have a reduced service contour compared with their current analog service contour, leading to complaints in Wilmington. The FCC released data and maps showing coverage areas for TV stations in the US. 89% of stations will gain population coverage, while 11% will lose. Updated maps show 55 new stations with service loss and exclude 19. 401 stations are expected to have digital service coverage issues. The FCC has taken steps to address DTV signal reception problems. On November 3, 2008, the FCC approved an order allowing stations to use distributed transmission systems to fill coverage gaps. On May 8, 2009, a rule was adopted for broadcasters to use \"replacement\" digital translators for areas at risk of losing service. Additionally, on March 13, 2009, broadcasters were required to notify viewers about digital reception issues like signal loss and antenna changes. During the transition, stations must inform viewers about the need to periodically rescan their digital televisions to ensure correct reception of broadcast services. Viewer concerns over signal reception, especially for channels switching from UHF to VHF, are a primary issue reported to the FCC consumer help line. The Digital TV Transition Fairness Act, S. 25 / H.R. 2867, aims to help consumers receive digital TV signals by providing coupons valued at up to $80 for purchasing or installing antennas. It also requires multichannel video providers to offer basic broadcast television service for $10 per month to those affected by the transition. Additionally, H.R. 2827 extends the DTV converter box coupon program to include television antennas. The DTV Cliff Effect Assistance Act, S. 899 / H.R. 2903, aims to address concerns over DTV signal reception by providing funding for digital TV translators to fill coverage gaps caused by the analog to digital transition. The funding, not to exceed $125 million during FY2009 through FY2012, would be drawn from the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. Congressional focus is on informing the public about the digital transition as the June 12, 2009 deadline approaches. The NTIA and FCC are working on consumer education for the digital transition, focusing on steps like scanning converter boxes and addressing signal reception issues. Funding for consumer education was provided by P.L. 109-171. The NTIA's DTV consumer education effort focuses on raising awareness of the coupon program for the digital transition, targeting senior citizens, the economically disadvantaged, rural residents, people with disabilities, and minorities. They are partnering with private sector stakeholder groups and federal government agencies to reach these groups and the American public in general. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment to increase NTIA funding for DTV consumer education, which was later incorporated into the DTV Transition Assistance Act (S. 2607). The Act allows NTIA to use unused funds for consumer education targeting vulnerable populations and areas served by low-power or translator stations. NTIA reduced grant funding for low-power television Digital-to-Analog Conversion program from $8 million to $3.5 million, with $4.5 million allocated for consumer education and technical assistance. $2.7 million was awarded to help seniors transition to DTV, and $1.65 million to assist vulnerable populations, focusing on markets with large over-the-air populations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $650 million to NTIA for the DTV coupon program, with up to $90 million for outreach to vulnerable populations. The FCC is also collaborating with private and public entities to raise awareness about the DTV transition. The FCC received $14.5 million in FY2008 for DTV consumer education activities, with an additional $20 million requested for FY2009. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $20 million for FCC DTV education on June 25, 2008. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations approved $20 million each for FCC DTV education in FY2009. P.L. 110-329 provided additional funding for DTV public education through March 6, 2009. The FCC awarded IBM up to $12 million for call center support in January 2009. The FCC used ARRA funding to award TeleTech Government Solutions a contract for a second outsourced call center on April 20, 2009. The Secretary of Commerce approved a transfer of $9.6 million to the FCC on June 4, 2009, enabling the FCC to maintain a fully staffed call center with 4000 operators through June 22 if necessary. The FCC is also spending $20 million on publications, distribution, events, conferences, and awareness sessions. Additionally, the FCC announced it is awarding $8.4 million to grassroots groups for DTV outreach, focusing on seniors, people with disabilities, and Spanish-speaking households in areas with high over-the-air populations. The FCC, with funding from NTIA, is supporting local organizations for DTV public education through walk-in centers, in-home assistance, and free converter box installations. Private sector involvement has raised questions about the government's role in promoting DTV education. In response to criticisms, the FCC released a Report and Order on DTV consumer education, requiring various stakeholders to participate. The FCC issued a Report and Order on DTV consumer education in 2008, mandating stakeholders to provide DTV education. Stations broadcasting analog signals were required to give service loss notices, antenna information, and promote consumer help centers. Private sector stakeholders committed over $1 billion for education efforts, with PSAs being a major component. The National Association of Broadcasters launched a consumer education campaign in 2007. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) launched consumer education campaigns worth $1.4 billion for the digital transition. The FCC imposed education and reporting requirements on broadcast stations, allowing them to follow alternate plans developed by the FCC, NAB, or the Association of Public Television Stations. Broadcasters conducted a voluntary \"soft test\" in May 2009 to interrupt analog programming with DTV education messages. The key issue for Congress is the readiness of American households for the digital transition and the effectiveness of government and private sector measures to prevent TVs from \"going dark.\" Congressional hearings have focused on the adequacy of public education efforts and the role of the federal government in leading them. Limited funding has led the FCC and NTIA to rely on private sector efforts, with incentives for industries like consumer electronics and broadcasters to ensure public readiness for the transition. The electronics industry and broadcasters are working on public outreach campaigns for the digital switch-over. Critics question if these efforts will reach vulnerable groups. Concerns include the effectiveness of the NTIA's converter box program and potential supply and reception issues for consumers. Retail outlets need to stock enough boxes for the transition. The transition to digital television raises concerns about the availability of converter boxes in stores and potential consumer issues with set-up and signal reception. The DTV Test Pilot Program in Wilmington, North Carolina served as a model for the nationwide switch-over. The FCC conducted a pilot program in Wilmington, NC, to test the early DTV transition, gathering feedback and data on the results. After the analog programming cut-off, consumers were informed about the digital transition. The FCC received 1,828 calls to its DTV help line in the first five days following the transition. Following the analog programming cut-off in Wilmington, NC, the FCC received 1,828 calls to its DTV help line within five days. Calls were related to consumer awareness, converter box issues, antenna problems, and out-of-market communities unable to receive the Wilmington NBC affiliate. The Wilmington test highlighted challenges for a successful transition, despite high consumer awareness. The FCC received numerous calls related to consumer awareness, converter box problems, and antenna issues following the analog programming cut-off in Wilmington, NC. Former FCC Chairman Kevin Martin emphasized the need to address technical challenges, while FCC Commissioner Michael Copps suggested various steps to improve the transition to digital TV, including additional field testing and educating consumers on troubleshooting. Following the analog programming cut-off in Wilmington, NC, the FCC received calls regarding consumer awareness, converter box problems, and antenna issues. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce inquired about consumer education plans from the FCC, NTIA, NAB, and television networks. Efforts were made to educate consumers on applying for coupons early, testing converter boxes, and addressing equipment issues before the transition date. Television stations nationwide conducted \"soft\" analog cutoffs to prepare for the transition. Television stations nationwide conducted \"soft\" analog cutoffs to prepare for the DTV transition, temporarily discontinuing analog signals and replacing them with educational messages. Legislation has been introduced to allow stations short-term authority to continue broadcasting on analog channels after the transition deadline. The SAFER Act (H.R. 7013/S. 3663) allows television stations to broadcast digital transition and emergency information on their analog channels. The FCC would develop a program for stations to do so for 30 days after the transition date, considering factors like market needs and avoiding interference with digital signals. The legislation passed in 2008 mandated the transition to digital television signals, with a 30-day analog signal provision for emergency information. The FCC implemented the Analog Nightlight Act, with stations providing \"nightlight\" service in designated areas. The DTV Border Fix Act (S. 2507 and H.R. 5435) was introduced in response to concerns that Spanish-speaking households near the U.S.-Mexican border may continue to watch analog signals from Mexican television stations after the digital transition, impacting access to important information during emergencies. S. 2507 and H.R. 5435 aim to address concerns about Spanish-speaking households near the U.S.-Mexican border accessing analog signals from Mexican TV stations post digital transition. S. 2507 passed the Senate, allowing TV stations near the border to continue analog broadcasting until February 17, 2013, subject to FCC approval and certain conditions. Opposition from English-language TV stations has been noted. Opposition to S. 2507 has been expressed by English-language television stations along the U.S.-Mexico border, citing concerns about a confusing transition, potential competitive pressures to continue analog signals, and unnecessary expenses. Supporters of the bill, including Spanish-language stations, argue that Hispanic households in the border region rely heavily on over-the-air television and may be less prepared for the digital transition, especially since they can still watch analog broadcasts from Mexican TV stations. The legislation is necessary to ensure that certain television stations continue to receive important information during emergencies or natural disasters. Low-power television stations, along with Class A and translator stations, are not required to convert to digital broadcasting by the national transition date. Concerns include the capability of digital-to-analog converter boxes to receive broadcasted analog signals. The NTIA permitted but did not require manufacturers to include an analog signal pass-through capability in certified converter boxes, which could raise costs and cause interference issues. Coupon-eligible converter boxes that receive analog signals are not eligible for the coupon program. The Community Broadcasters Association argues for the use of converter boxes with analog signal capabilities. The Community Broadcasters Association (CBA) argues that converter boxes without analog reception capability could force many stations out of business. They filed a complaint with the FCC, stating that NTIA-certified converter boxes violate the All-Channel Receiver Act of 1962. FCC Chairman Martin urged industries to take steps to lessen the impact of the digital transition on LPTV, Class A, and translator stations. The CBA petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals to enforce the Act and halt the distribution of converter boxes that do not support analog signals. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established grant programs to assist low-power television stations with the digital transition, providing funding for digital-to-analog conversion devices. NTIA announced $8 million in grant money for this purpose on October 29, 2007. In 2007, NTIA announced $8 million in grant money for the LPTV Digital-to-Analog Conversion program to help low-power television stations continue analog broadcasts. The program assists eligible stations in purchasing a conversion device to transmit digital signals from full-power stations in analog. Funding was reduced to $3.5 million in 2008 and further reduced to $1 million after November 17, 2008. The Low-Power Television and Translator Upgrade Program provides funding up to $65 million for stations to upgrade from analog to digital in rural communities. Priority is given to non-profit stations serving areas with less than 10,000 viewers. NTIA announced $44 million in awards for this program. Congress is monitoring the digital transition closely. P.L. 110-161 provides $2.5 million to the FCC for this purpose. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764) allocates $2.5 million to the FCC for DTV consumer education in FY2008. The DTV Transition Assistance Act (P.L. 110-295) makes technical corrections to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, directing NTIA to provide grant money for low-power television and translator station digital upgrades earlier than previously scheduled. Senator Snowe introduced the Act on February 7, 2008. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) authorized additional funding for administrative expenses for NTIA and DTV public education for the FCC. The Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness (SAFER) Act (P.L. 110-459) required the FCC to extend analog television broadcasting authority by thirty days. The DTV Delay Act postponed the digital transition deadline from February 17, 2009, to June 12, 2009. It included $650 million in funds for DTV coupons in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill of 2009. The Reinvestment Bill of 2009 allocated $650 million to NTIA for DTV coupons, education, and outreach. It was introduced on January 26, 2009, passed by the House on January 28, 2009, and by the Senate on February 10, 2009. The bill was signed by the President on February 17, 2009. H.R. 299 (Engel) provided $20 million for a consumer education grant program and $200 million for the converter box coupon program. Introduced on January 8, 2009. H.R. 339 (Platts) extends DTV converter box coupon expiration to March 31, 2009. H.R. 508 (Braley) allows tax credit for converter box purchase. H.R. 661 (Barton) provides additional coupons for converter box program. H.R. 681 (Waxman) extends digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009. The legislation extends the digital transition deadline to June 12, 2009, modifies the coupon program, allows broadcasters to switch off analog signals before the deadline, permits public safety use of vacated analog spectrum, extends license period of recovered spectrum, and directs monthly reports on the coupon program status. Introduced on January 26, 2009. H.R. 2827 (Butterfield) and H.R. 2867 (DeFazio) propose modifications to the DTV converter box coupon program, including the addition of television antennas. H.R. 2867 also authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide an $80 coupon for antenna purchase or installation. H.R. 2903 (Michaud) establishes an assistance program for digital TV construction. The Effect Assistance Act of 2009 establishes a program for digital TV translators to fill coverage gaps from analog to digital signals. S. 25 (Sanders) introduces the Digital TV Transition Fairness Act, providing coupons for antenna purchase and requiring basic broadcast TV service for $10/month. S. 300 (Gregg) proposes the TV Converter Box Coupon Relief Act to increase funding for converter box coupons. The DTV Cliff Effect Assistance Act aims to establish a program for digital TV translators to address coverage gaps caused by the transition from analog to digital signals. Various resources are available to provide information to consumers about the digital transition, including the DTV Hotline and FCC Consumer Center. Various organizations such as NTIA, DTV Transition Coalition, NAB, CERC, CEA, NCTA, Community Broadcasters Association, NARUC, and Consumers Union are providing information on the digital transition."
