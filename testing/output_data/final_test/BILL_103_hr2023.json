    "content": "The Act titled \"Public Pension Equity Restoration Act of 1993\" addresses the treatment of governmental plans under Section 415. The \"Public Pension Equity Restoration Act of 1993\" amends the definition of compensation for governmental plans under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes elective deferrals and employer contributions not included in gross income. The \"Public Pension Equity Restoration Act of 1993\" amends Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code to include special limitation rules for governmental plans and treatment of qualified governmental excess benefit arrangements. Income from a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement is exempt from tax under section 115, and the taxation of participants is determined based on when these amounts are included in their gross income. A qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement is exempt from tax under section 115. It provides participants with benefits exceeding plan limitations. The text discusses limitations on benefits imposed by a section of the Code for qualified governmental excess benefit arrangements. It states that no election is provided to defer compensation and benefits must not be paid from a trust unless it is solely for providing benefits. Coordination with section 457 is also mentioned, exempting qualified governmental excess benefit arrangements from certain sections. Exemption for survivor and disability benefits under section 415(b) of the Code is added, and a conforming amendment is made to section 457(f) for qualified governmental excess benefit arrangements. The new subparagraph exempts survivor and disability benefits from governmental plans from certain tax provisions. The new subparagraph allows for the revocation of a grandfather election under section 415(b)(10) of the Code, with specific conditions regarding the inclusion of benefits in income after revocation. The limitations imposed by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. Governmental plans are considered to meet the requirements of section 415 for years before the Act's enactment."
