    "content": "Since the Immigration Act of 1924, the US has allowed foreign students to study in its institutions through F, M, and J visa categories. Foreign postsecondary students are admitted for \"duration of status,\" lasting as long as they are full-time students or part of exchange programs. The IIRIRA of 1996 mandated the development of a program to collect specific data by January 1, 1998. The IIRIRA of 1996 mandated the development of a program to collect data on foreign students, including their identity, visa classification, academic status, and disciplinary actions. The law required the INS to collect this information electronically and educational institutions to report it as a condition of enrolling foreign students. Additionally, a fee was to be collected from each foreign student. The IIRIRA of 1996 mandated the collection of data on foreign students by educational institutions. The 106th Congress amended the provision to have the INS collect a fee from foreign students. The USA Patriot Act expanded the foreign student tracking system and required the INS to have it fully operational by January 1, 2003. It also included provisions for additional approved educational institutions to be included in the tracking system. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 strengthened the foreign student tracking system by establishing electronic means to monitor and verify documentation of acceptance, visa issuance, admission to the U.S., registration, enrollment, and other relevant acts by nonimmigrant students. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was implemented by the INS to automate data collection for foreign students. SEVIS became operational on February 15, 2003, with institutions required to apply for certification by August 1, 2003. DHS issued an interim regulation on May 23, 2003, to establish verification and reporting procedures for SEVIS. The educational institutions had until August 1, 2003, to enter all continuing students into SEVIS. A fee collection system for foreign students was established by IIRIRA, with INS ultimately collecting the fee instead of the institutions. Interim regulations on fee collection were issued on October 27, 2003. The final regulation for fee collection under the SEVIS program was issued on July 1, 2004, specifying a $100 fee to be paid electronically or by mail. Fees are collected from potential foreign students applying for student visas or changing their nonimmigrant status. The operating budget for SEVIS comes from these fees. Foreign students must apply to a SEVIS certified school, have their information entered into the system, and then apply for a student visa at a US Embassy or Consulate. Foreign students must apply for a student visa at a US Embassy or Consulate after their information is entered into the SEVIS database. The consular officer checks eligibility for the visa and confirms the student's record in SEVIS upon arrival in the US. Schools are responsible for updating SEVIS with student attendance and course information 30 days after the academic term begins. The SEVIS system is used to track student attendance and course information, as well as any changes in student status. Congress has raised concerns about SEVIS, particularly after the division of INS into different components within DHS. ICE is now responsible for maintaining the SEVIS database, policy, and certifying schools, leading to some frustration due to inconsistent information. Inexperienced staff in the new DHS and difficulties in communication between USCIS and ICE have been reported. Few stories in the press have highlighted issues faced by foreign students. Nonetheless, there have been few stories in the press of foreign students facing problems entering the United States due to SEVIS implementation. DHS established a SEVIS Response Team to assist with the transition and address issues promptly. ICE's Interim Director acknowledged potential technical issues with SEVIS but assured quick resolution. Schools have reported technical difficulties with SEVIS operation. Some concerns have been raised about technical difficulties in operating SEVIS, including the need to create incorrect records to bypass issues. There are also worries about the system organizing information by record number instead of names, leading to potential database update challenges. Additionally, schools are burdened with reporting changes of accompanying individuals not enrolled in their institutions, such as spouses and children, in the SEVIS system. Schools are concerned about not being notified when a student enters at a port of entry, leading to worries about potential sanctions for not reporting students who fail to attend classes. SEVIS helps identify visa violators, but there are doubts about DHS's ability to locate all violators and concerns about errors in the system. Concerns have been raised about SEVIS errors potentially leading to unwarranted enforcement actions against innocent students. Payment methods for the SEVIS fee are also a concern, with some foreign students finding it difficult to pay electronically or by mail with a U.S. bank check or money order. DHS argues that the fee payment rules should not be burdensome as most students have experience with similar payments for school applications and standardized tests. They also mention that many foreign banks can issue checks drawn on U.S. banks and are open to exploring alternative payment options in the future. Some concerns have been raised about the SEVIS fee being excessive and potentially discouraging students from studying in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that foreign students, not taxpayers, should fund SEVIS and will reexamine the fee every two years. Reports of delays in issuing student visas are not directly related to SEVIS but are due to increased screening by Department of State (DOS) consular officers. DOS has released a notice addressing the current visa processing situation. In response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, visa applications now undergo increased scrutiny, with personal interviews often required. Applicants are warned of potential delays and unpredictability in the adjudication process. The Government Accountability Office found that the processing time for visas for science students or scholars varies and is difficult to predict. Visa Mantis is a specialized clearance procedure for screening visa applicants for science students or scholars seeking access to controlled technologies. The average processing time for the security check is 67 days, with many cases pending for 60 days or more in certain countries. DOS attributed a backlog in processing to a response mandate in 2002. The DOS response mandate in 2002 led to an overburdened system for SAO requests, including Visa Mantis checks. New regulations implemented in 2003 have increased wait times for visa interviews, affecting students and researchers. Special arrangements are being made to facilitate visa interviews for students and researchers. Special arrangements are being made to facilitate visa interviews for students and researchers, with some posts reserving appointment slots or assigning specific days for student processing."
