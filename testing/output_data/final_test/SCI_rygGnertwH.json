A new clustering analysis method called BBSC was proposed in this paper, which involves binarizing gene expression profiles and using Boolean matrix factorization. BBSC was able to identify distinct cell types or functions in cancer cells more effectively than current methods. Application of BBSC on two cancer scRNAseq datasets successfully revealed both homogeneous and heterogeneous cancer cell clusters, showing potential in cancer prevention. The development of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has allowed for a detailed analysis of cancer cells and their micro-environment. This technology has revealed both homogeneous and heterogeneous cancer cell clusters, showing potential in preventing cancer progression. Despite advancements in cancer treatment, the disease remains a significant threat to human health. The non-linear dimension reduction technique t-SNE is used on high dimensional scRNA-seq data for cell clustering and visualization. The melanoma dataset is analyzed to differentiate cell types in the cancer microenvironment, showing patient-wise heterogeneity in cancer cells. Recent studies have shown that burst frequency (f) is a key factor in cell type-specific gene expression, regulated by enhancers. The uniqueness of each cancer patient contradicts general principles in the medical industry. The expression of gene i inside cell j (y) follows a beta distribution, with f representing the probability to shift expression from off to on and from on to off. While precise fitting of f and k size is challenging, significant frequency changes across different cells can still be captured. The text discusses a novel approach for gene expression analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing data, using a bi-state model. It involves a latent binary matrix representing different cell types, with true expression levels and measurement errors. The approach approximates gene expression levels using a Hadamard product. This method, called BBSC, aims to mine patterns in scRNA-seq data. The novel scRNA-seq pattern mining and analysis pipeline BBSC was developed, implementing data binarization for ON/OFF expression patterns. A fast binary matrix factorization method, PFAST, was proposed for large-scale scRNA-seq data. BBSC revealed cancer homogeneity and increased sensitivity in identifying cell subtypes in head and neck cancer and melanoma data. It identified cancer cell clusters expressing EMT markers, suggesting a common strategy in cancer metastasis. The scRNA-seq analysis pipeline BBSC was developed to study cancer homogeneity and cell subtype identification. A fast BMF algorithm, PFAST, was introduced for large-scale data analysis. BBSC identified common strategies in cancer metastasis, potentially aiding in cancer progression prevention. In this paper, a new strategy is developed using Boolean matrix factorization to analyze differences in cell types and physiological states based on bi-state frequency patterns. This approach aims to retrieve information effectively without the need for substantial prior knowledge, unlike other methods that rely on costly or unsuitable data. Several heuristic solutions have been developed for the completeness of the BMF problem, with two frequently utilized series of works by Miettinen et al. (2008) and Lucchese et al. (2010). The ASSO algorithm generates potential column basis from row-wise correlation and uses greedy searching for BMF fitting. The PANDA algorithm aims to identify top 1-enriched submatrices in a binary matrix, excluding current fittings in each iteration. Bayesian inference has also been involved, with Ravanbakhsh et al. (2016) using message passing for pattern retrieval and Rukat et al. (2017) proposing OrMachine for probabilistic inference in binary matrices. OrMachine, proposed by Rukat et al. (2017), provides full probabilistic inference for binary matrices, representing state-of-the-art performance in BMF. A new analysis pipeline called BBSC involves data binarization and PFAST algorithm to preprocess scRNA-seq data before dimension reduction and cell clustering analysis. The recover matrix is constructed by the Hadamard product of the original expression matrix and the BMF fitted binary matrix. Gene expression is determined by examining Xij on F from scRNA-seq data. The text discusses the binarization procedure applied to two high-quality scRNAseq cancer datasets of head and neck cancer and melanoma. The threshold of ON/OFF state was determined using the 95% quantile of distribution. The justification for this threshold was based on the overall silhouette score, which measures the similarity of data points within clusters. The binarization approach significantly impacted the clustering results in both datasets. The binarization approach significantly improved cluster representation in two scRNAseq cancer datasets. A fast and efficient BMF algorithm called PFAST was developed to handle large-scale data, following the PANDA algorithm framework. PANDA involves core pattern discovery and extension, calculating global loss to find precise patterns amid noise. PFAST is a BMF algorithm that focuses on local loss decrease without the look back property, unlike PANDA. It eliminates 95% of noise during binarization, making it suitable for large-scale scRNAseq data. Each iteration of PFAST has a computational complexity of O(mn) and works iteratively on residual matrices until convergence criteria are met. PFAST is a BMF algorithm with convergence criteria set by identifying top k patterns or covering a certain proportion of non-zero values in matrices. It compares performance with ASSO, PANDA, and MP on simulated datasets using binary matrices. Performance is evaluated based on reconstructed error, sparsity, and time cost. The conditions for guaranteeing a unique solution in binary matrix factorization have not been theoretically derived. To compare algorithms, different parameters were tested and the best performing parameter was used. Convergence criteria were set for all methods. The evaluation compared different methods for binary matrix factorization. PFAST outperformed ASSO, PANDA, and MP in both sparse and dense matrices, with faster running time and better convergence. ASSO tended to find inclusive patterns, PANDA had slow convergence due to low noise tolerance, and MP showed robustness. The evaluation compared different methods for binary matrix factorization. PFAST outperformed ASSO, PANDA, and MP in both sparse and dense matrices, with faster running time and better convergence. PFAST demonstrated balanced computational cost and fitting accuracy, with significant speed improvement. Classic tSNE-based dimension reduction and BBSC analysis were applied on head and neck cancer and melanoma datasets, recovering the bi-state model of data. Convergence criteria were set as top 10 patterns identified and 40% of non-zero values recovered. In analyzing head and neck cancer and melanoma datasets, dimension reduction was conducted using t-SNE with a perplexity setting of 30 and 20000 max iterations. No cell clustering was performed, and cell type annotation was retrieved from the original paper. The 2D embedding separated cells by their phenotypic types, including fibroblast, T-, B-, myeloid, and cancer cells. The 2D embedding separated cells by their phenotypic types, forming distinct clusters of fibroblast, T-, B-, myeloid, and cancer cells. Analysis confirmed that immune and stromal cells from different patients grouped together, while cancer cells clustered by specific patients. The BBSC pipeline identified more subtypes of fibroblast, T cells, and cancer cells compared to the classic pipeline, showing higher association with intra-cancer heterogeneity. Patient origin was also associated with cell groups in the BBSC data. In the 2D embedding of the BBSC data, distinct clusters of fibroblast, T-, B-, myeloid, and cancer cells were observed. Cancer cell groups shared by different patients may indicate common subpopulations with hallmark functions in disease progression. Differentially expressed genes associated with cancer cell groups were identified through clustering methods like k-mean and tSNE. Cluster 1 and 2 consisted of cells from different patients, while clusters 3 to 5 were specific to certain patients. The study identified distinct clusters of fibroblast, T-, B-, myeloid, and cancer cells in the BBSC data. Cluster 1 and 2 showed differences in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker genes compared to clusters 3 to 5. Cluster 1 and 2 had higher expression of mesenchymal markers, while clusters 3 to 5 had higher expression of epithelial markers. This analysis demonstrated that BBSC reduced inter-cancer heterogeneity, enabling better identification of cancer cell subpopulations. The BBSC analysis pipeline substantially reduces inter-cancer heterogeneity, allowing for the identification of cancer cells with common functional characteristics across different patients. This suggests that despite differences between cancer cells in each patient, they share similar strategies in the metastasis process. Targeting the progression strategy revealed in this study could have a significant therapeutic impact on preventing cancer progression. The development of single-cell technology now enables the observation of complex biological processes like cancer with unprecedented resolution. The classic analysis pipeline fails to reveal common characteristics of cancer cells in different patients and intra-cluster heterogeneity, which the BBSC analysis pipeline aims to address by analyzing gene expression frequency changes. The BBSC analysis pipeline utilizes BMF for feature selection, tailored binarizing processes, and the PFAST algorithm for handling large-scale data efficiently. It breaks down big clusters into subclusters in cancer studies, reducing patient-wise heterogeneity and identifying common cancer sub cell clusters. The biological meanings of BBSC-derived insights are also justified. The biological importance of BBSC-derived sub clusters in cancer metastasis is justified by analyzing their expression profiles. Common clusters are involved in the EMT transition process, while patient-specific clusters are in the early EMT process. This insight can lead to targeting common clusters to prevent cancer metastasis and understanding the heterogeneity of cancer. BBSC is a valuable analysis platform for deciphering cancer heterogeneity, particularly in head and neck cancer. It divides cancer cells into sub clusters, providing insightful knowledge for understanding complex biological processes."
