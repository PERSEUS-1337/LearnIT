    "content": "The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 may be cited as the \"Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007\". It provides an energy credit for combined heat and power system property. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007, also known as the \"Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007,\" offers an energy credit for combined heat and power system property. This includes property that uses the same energy source for generating electrical power, mechanical shaft power, and steam simultaneously or sequentially. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 provides an energy credit for combined heat and power systems with specific capacity and energy production requirements. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 offers an energy credit for combined heat and power systems meeting certain capacity and energy production criteria. These systems must have an energy efficiency percentage exceeding 60 percent and be operational before January 1, 2011. The energy efficiency percentage is calculated based on the total useful power produced by the system compared to the higher heating value of the primary fuel. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 provides an energy credit for combined heat and power systems meeting specific criteria. The energy efficiency percentage is determined based on the useful power produced compared to the higher heating value of the primary fuel. The definition of combined heat and power system property excludes energy transportation and distribution equipment. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 offers an energy credit for combined heat and power systems. If a system uses bagasse for 90% of the energy source, certain rules do not apply, but the credit amount is adjusted based on the system's energy efficiency percentage. The Industrial Cogeneration Act of 2007 provides an energy credit for combined heat and power systems. The amendments made by this section apply to periods after December 31, 2007, in taxable years ending after that date."
