    "content": "Congress has been actively establishing federal agricultural policy since the 1930s, revisiting it regularly through farm legislation to address a wide range of areas including conservation, credit, rural development, nutrition assistance, trade, organic agriculture, forestry, and support for farmers. The House approved the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, covering FY2019-FY2023, with a vote of 213-211 on June 21, 2018. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, establishing farm and food policy for the next five years. The bill covers commodity support programs, conservation, nutrition assistance, trade, credit, rural development, research, and extension. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, covering commodity support programs, conservation, nutrition assistance, trade, credit, rural development, research, extension, forestry, horticulture, and various policies. The Senate bill includes a separate title for energy programs, while the House bill integrates agricultural energy programs into the title on rural infrastructure and economic development. The Congressional Budget Office projected spending on mandatory programs in the Senate bill at $867 billion over 10 years and $865 billion in the House bill, compared to the cost of extending the current 2014 farm bill for 10 years at $867 billion. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, with estimated costs of $867 billion over 10 years. The differences in program priorities between the House and Senate bills are reflected in the Budget Impact section. Both versions of H.R. 2 would replace the current farm programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill, with certain programs like crop insurance continuing permanently. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could operate as long as funding is appropriated. If the farm law expires, other programs like revenue support for agricultural commodities would be governed by permanent laws from the 1930s and 1940s, potentially disrupting production and affecting farmers, suppliers, exporters, manufacturers, and consumers. Conservation and rural development programs would also cease to function. Congress has historically acted to address expiring farm legislation without successor legislation. The prospect of expiring farm legislation without enacting successor legislation has led to the extension of existing policies due to the reduced profitability of the U.S. farm economy. The decline in net cash farm income is attributed to declining commodity prices and trade disputes with major agricultural export markets. The tariffs on U.S. farm product exports have led to a decline in prices and uncertainty for farmers. This report compares the House and Senate versions of H.R. 2, analyzing budget implications and changes in agricultural policies. The farm bill authorizes funding for various agricultural programs. The farm bill authorizes funding for agricultural programs, including mandatory outlays and discretionary programs. Mandatory programs dominate the budget debate, with funding based on the CBO baseline projection of future spending. The baseline provides funding for reauthorization, reallocation, or deficit reduction. The farm bill authorizes funding for agricultural programs, with mandatory spending projected at $867 billion over the next 10 years. 77% of this is allocated to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while the remaining $203 billion is for agricultural programs like crop insurance and conservation. Budget enforcement measures are based on these baselines and scores, with changes impacting mandatory spending relative to the baseline. The CBO released scores for H.R. 2, showing a net reduction of $1.8 billion from the federal budget over 10 years. The House-passed bill includes a decrease in projected outlays and new revenue from fees paid by contractors in the SNAP program. The Senate-passed amendment is budget neutral with an overall increase in outlays offset by an increase in revenue. The CBO released scores for H.R. 2, showing a net reduction of $1.8 billion over 10 years. The House bill includes decreases in outlays and new revenue from fees in the SNAP program. The Senate bill has an overall increase in outlays offset by revenue from an oilheat program. The bills have relatively small scores due to varying increases and reductions across different titles. The House bill includes decreases in outlays and new revenue from fees in the SNAP program, while the Senate bill has an overall increase in outlays offset by revenue from an oilheat program. The bills have relatively small scores due to varying increases and reductions across different titles, with some titles showing both increases and decreases from the baseline. In the Senate bill, titles like rural development, horticulture, and research have higher scores compared to the House bill. Both bills provide continuing funding for programs in the 2014 farm bill with mandatory funding but no baseline beyond FY2018. The House bill allocates $470 million for certain trade programs and $472 million for a food insecurity program in the nutrition title. Other programs affected include organic research, beginning farmer programs, organic programs, outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers, and wool and cotton trust funds. In the Senate bill, various agricultural programs receive significant mandatory funding, including organic research, beginning farmer programs, trade programs, farmers market promotion, and food insecurity programs. The total funding amounts to over $2 billion, with some programs receiving permanent baseline funding. The Senate bill includes significant mandatory funding for agricultural programs such as organic research, beginning farmer programs, trade programs, farmers market promotion, and food insecurity programs, totaling over $2 billion. The House- and Senate-passed farm bills authorize support programs for dairy, sugar, and various commodities, including major field-crop programs like Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) programs. Disaster assistance programs for livestock and tree crops were permanently authorized in the 2014 farm bill. Disaster assistance programs for livestock and tree crops were permanently authorized in the 2014 farm bill, providing federal aid for farmers recovering from natural disasters. Title I also includes administrative provisions like payment limits and eligibility criteria. Both House and Senate bills extend authority for commodity programs with some modifications, including changes for covered commodities, dairy, and agricultural disaster assistance. The Senate bill eliminates transition assistance for upland cotton producers, while the sugar program remains unchanged. The House farm bill makes PLC more attractive for producers than ARC by raising effective reference prices and allowing yield updates for severe drought. Producers in ARC would be ineligible for certain crop insurance coverage. The individual ARC program is eliminated in contrast to the Senate farm bill. The Senate farm bill proposes changes to the ARC program, making it more attractive by using trend-adjusted yield, increasing the yield floor to 75% of the transitional county yield, and making ARC the default option. It also specifies using the farm's county for revenue calculations, using a single data source for yield estimates, and requiring USDA to publish payment rates promptly. The Senate farm bill proposes changes to the ARC program, making it more attractive by using trend-adjusted yield, increasing the yield floor to 75% of the transitional county yield, and making ARC the default option. It also specifies using the farm's county for revenue calculations, using a single data source for yield estimates, and requiring USDA to publish payment rates promptly. The House farm bill proposes to expand producer exemptions from payment and income limits, affecting MAL program benefits, payment limits, and treatment of eligible payment entities. The House bill proposes changes to the treatment of corporations, allowing individual payment limits for qualified pass-through entities and expanding the definition of family farm. It also amends agricultural disaster assistance programs, including limits on payments and waiving the AGI requirement for certain producers. The House bill proposes changes to agricultural disaster assistance programs, including expanding payments for livestock losses caused by disease. The Senate bill expands payments for losses of unweaned livestock before vaccination and includes Indian tribes as eligible producers. Both bills rename the dairy Margin Protection Program to Dairy Risk Management Program or Dairy Risk Coverage, with lower catastrophic margin protection levels. Both the House and Senate bills propose changes to agricultural disaster assistance programs, including expanding payments for livestock losses. They also aim to rename the dairy Margin Protection Program to Dairy Risk Management Program or Dairy Risk Coverage, with lower catastrophic margin protection levels and expanded coverage choices for milk producers. Premiums would vary with coverage levels selected across two production tiers, with the percent coverage range extended to 5% to 90% of a farm's milk production history. The Dairy Risk Management Program (DRMP) and Dairy Risk Coverage (DRC) would reinstate premiums for different margin levels under Tier I, with DRMP reducing premiums for some margins and DRC slightly raising premiums for others. DRC would also provide premium discounts for small- and medium-sized dairy operations based on milk production history. The Dairy Risk Coverage (DRC) requires USDA to repay positive net premiums to dairy operations that participated in MPP during 2015-2017. Dairy producers would make annual elections of margin coverage levels and milk production percentages under DRC. Both House and Senate bills would extend Dairy Forward Pricing, Dairy Indemnity, and Dairy Promotion programs. The House bill would allow dairy producers to participate in both DRMP and Livestock Gross Margin-Dairy programs. The House and Senate bills propose changes to the Dairy Risk Coverage program, including repayment of positive net premiums to dairy operations. They also extend Dairy Forward Pricing, Dairy Indemnity, and Dairy Promotion programs. Additionally, the House bill requires USDA to conduct studies on feed cost ratios and alfalfa hay prices in top milk-producing states. USDA administers various agricultural conservation programs to assist landowners with natural resource concerns. The House and Senate bills focus on amending conservation programs, with the House bill repealing the Conservation Stewardship Program and increasing short-term funding by $656 million. The Senate bill increases funding by $185 million in the first five years and reallocates funding within conservation programs. The Senate bill reallocates funding within working lands programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). While the House bill repeals CSP, the Senate bill reauthorizes it with reduced program enrollment. CSP offers financial and technical assistance for conservation practices on producers' operations, with over 70 million acres currently enrolled. The House bill includes a limited version of CSP within EQIP. The House bill repeals the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and integrates a limited version of CSP within the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). This results in a projected decline in spending under the conservation title of the House bill. The House bill increases annual funding for EQIP to $3 billion by FY2023 from $1.75 billion in FY2018. In contrast, the Senate bill reduces EQIP funding to $1.5 billion in FY2019 with incremental increases to $1.6 billion by FY2023. The Senate bill also decreases CSP enrollment to 8.8 million acres annually. The Senate bill amends CSP to focus on water quality, wildlife habitat, and reduces livestock-related practices allocation to 50%. The House bill adds stewardship contract, removes livestock production requirement, and expands options for irrigation. Both bills amend Conservation Innovation Grants, with the House limiting funding and the Senate adding project types. Land retirement and easement programs are also addressed. The House and Senate bills amend the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to increase enrollment limits and reduce payments to participants. Land retirement and easement programs provide federal payments to private agricultural landowners for accepting land-use restrictions. The House and Senate bills propose changes to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), including limiting annual rental payments, allowing for early termination of select contracts, reducing incentives for continuous contracts, and limiting cost-share assistance. The Senate bill differs by limiting rental payments to 88.5% of the rate, deleting the early termination provision, and creating an easement program. Both bills also reauthorize and amend the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). The House and Senate bills propose changes to the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), focusing on agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements. Both bills offer additional flexibilities to ACEP-eligible entities, with differences in planning requirements, eligible land criteria, and funding. The House bill aims to increase funding to $500 million annually by FY2023, while the Senate bill incrementally increases funding to $450 million by the same year. The bill proposes to increase funding for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) to $450 million by FY2023. Both the House and Senate bills amend RCPP, increasing annual funding to $250 million and $200 million, respectively. They also expand the conservation programs covered, allow for partnership agreement renewals, and provide additional funding and flexibilities to partners. The Senate bill includes additional amendments for funding and authorities both inside and outside the omnibus farm bill. The House and Senate bills propose conservation programs and provisions, including watershed and emergency conservation programs. They also address natural resource reports and create new conservation programs. The trade title under both bills focuses on U.S. international food aid and agricultural export programs, such as Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition program. The Food for Peace program receives approximately $1.5 billion in annual appropriations. The Food for Peace (FFP) program, receiving about $1.5 billion annually, has added flexibility to purchase food locally or provide cash/vouchers to recipients. Administered by different agencies, the House and Senate bills aim to reauthorize international food aid programs with operational details. The House bill emphasizes avoiding market disruption in recipient countries and removing a minimum monetization requirement for FFP. Both the House and Senate bills aim to amend the Food for Peace (FFP) program by removing a minimum monetization requirement and increasing the minimum requirement for nonemergency programs. They also seek to extend authority for various international programs and fellowship programs. Additionally, both bills would reauthorize U.S. export promotion programs such as the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP). The House bill combines export programs MAP, FMDP, EMP, and TASC into the International Market Development Program (IMDP) with $255 million in annual CCC funds. It also creates the Biotechnology and Agricultural Trade Program. The Senate bill maintains separate export promotion programs and adds the Priority Trade Fund with $6 million annually. It allows MAP and FMDP funds to be used for projects in Cuba. The Senate bill authorizes $260 million in annual CCC funds for trade programs for FY2019-FY2023, with restrictions on spending in Cuba. It also requires promoting U.S. agricultural products, including tribal products, on trade missions. Funding levels for promotional activities and technical assistance are specified in both the House and Senate farm bills. Both the House and Senate farm bills would reauthorize export credit guarantees for agricultural exports to emerging markets, with differences in nutrition title approaches. The House bill's Nutrition title would reduce spending by $1.4 billion over 10 years but increase revenues by $465 million. The House bill's Nutrition title would reduce spending by $1.4 billion over 10 years but increase revenues by $465 million. This includes savings from eligibility and benefit changes, increased spending on benefit amounts and SNAP administration costs, and revenue from collecting fees from states. The Senate bill estimates an increase in spending by $94 million over 10 years, with savings from integrity policy changes and increased spending on eligibility and SNAP administration. The House-passed bill includes policies affecting SNAP eligibility and benefit calculation, such as limits to categorical eligibility, work-related rules changes, and adjustments to utility calculations. It proposes increasing asset limits, changing how vehicles and savings accounts are counted, and amending income calculations. The Senate-passed bill largely maintains current law but extends certification periods for some households and makes minor changes. Both the House and Senate bills propose policies to improve detection of errors and fraud in the SNAP program. They would establish or expand data systems, make changes to the Quality Control system, and increase USDA oversight. The House bill repeals funding for performance bonuses and allows states to contract out eligibility determination functions. The Senate bill reduces funding for bonuses and limits them to application timeliness. Both bills also include policies for SNAP's EBT system and benefit redemption. Both the House and Senate bills propose policies to improve detection of errors and fraud in the SNAP program, including new limits on fees for processors and increased USDA oversight. The House bill would establish a \"national gateway\" for routing transactions and allow the purchase of multivitamins and dietary supplements with SNAP benefits. Both bills also make changes to existing grant programs, with the House bill providing greater increases in funding. Additionally, both bills would expand SNAP bonus incentives for fruit and vegetable purchases and reauthorize the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program. Both the House and Senate bills propose policies to improve detection of errors and fraud in the SNAP program, including new limits on fees for processors and increased USDA oversight. The House bill establishes a \"national gateway\" for routing transactions and allows the purchase of multivitamins and dietary supplements with SNAP benefits. Both bills also make changes to existing grant programs, with the House bill providing greater increases in funding. Additionally, both bills would expand SNAP bonus incentives for fruit and vegetable purchases and reauthorize the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program, renaming it Gus Schumacher FINI and providing for evaluation, training, and technical assistance. The House bill increases FINI funding by $472 million over 10 years; the Senate bill increases funding by $401 million over two years. On nutrition education, the House bill moves SNAP's nutrition education component from SNAP state agencies to land-grant universities and increases program funding. The Senate bill makes some policy changes but does not change funding. The Senate bill also creates a new grant program that would receive $4 million in mandatory funding each year to fund produce prescription programs serving low-income individuals with diet-related diseases. Both bills would expand certification periods for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program in similar but not identical ways and increase mandatory funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Both the House and Senate bills propose increasing funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), with the House bill allocating more funds. They both authorize new aspects of TEFAP, make changes to the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, and reauthorize the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program. The House bill also amends the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to include all forms of these foods. The House bill includes changes to nutrition standards for school meal programs and eligibility criteria for SNAP benefits. It proposes limits on broad-based categorical eligibility for households. CBO published cost estimates but not participation estimates for the House-passed changes. The House bill proposes additional limits on SNAP eligibility based on receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits, aiming to reduce spending by $4 billion over 10 years. Approximately 400,000 households would lose SNAP eligibility annually, impacting 265,000 children's access to free meals. The bill also suggests work requirements for all states, mandating 20 hours of work per week for nonexempt able-bodied adults starting in FY2021. The proposed changes to SNAP eligibility include requiring 20 hours of work per week for nonexempt able-bodied adults aged 18-59, without exemptions for parents or caretakers of children over six. States can still exempt a portion of the caseload and request waivers based on labor-market measures. States must offer employment or training opportunities to those subject to the requirements. Funding for SNAP Employment and Training would increase from $110 million to $270 million in FY2020 and to $1 billion in FY2021 and beyond, with estimated reductions in SNAP benefits spending. The House-passed work-related changes to SNAP would reduce benefits by $14.1 billion over 10 years and increase program administration spending by $7.3 billion. Approximately 1.2 million recipients would lose benefits in FY2028, with an average annual benefit loss of $1,816 per recipient. LIHEAP payments over $20 would no longer affect benefit calculations for households without elderly or disabled members under the bill. The House-reported provision would reduce 560,000 households' SNAP benefits by an average of $84 per month. Both the House- and Senate-passed farm bills would reauthorize and make changes to provisions in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act governing USDA farm loan programs, including adding conditions for beginning farmers to qualify for loans and raising the maximum loan size for guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans. The Senate bill proposes increasing the farm operating loan limit to $400,000 and the farm ownership loan limit to $600,000. Beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers would be exempt from guarantee fees and have a guarantee percentage of 95%. The State Agricultural Loan Mediation Program would be reauthorized to FY2023 for matching grants for mediation of credit and agricultural disputes. The Senate bill expands the Farm Credit System's jurisdiction, adds socially disadvantaged farmers to reporting requirements, and increases loan limits. The House bill eliminates compensation limits for FCS bank boards of directors and reauthorizes the State Agricultural Loan Mediation Program. The House bill increases the acreage exception for FarmerMac loans and directs FCA to study risks in FCS and FarmerMac portfolios. The Senate bill provides guidance for FCSIC when acting as a conservator or receiver for troubled FCS institutions. The House and Senate bills address rural development programs and policies. The House bill proposes a new subtitle to improve health outcomes in rural communities by reprioritizing rural development loans and grants during a rural health emergency. The emergency would expire after 360 days or when the Secretary determines it has ended. 10% of funds for Distance Learning would be allocated during the emergency. The House bill proposes allocating funds for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program to identify and treat individuals affected by a rural health emergency. Priority would be given to entities providing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. Additionally, changes are made to the Enhancing Broadband Telecommunications Services in Rural Areas Program to establish minimum broadband service standards. The House bill includes provisions for broadband service projections up to 30 years in the future, loan guarantees for infrastructure, incentives for reaching isolated rural areas, and prioritizing applicants serving non-business areas. It also authorizes loans for middle-mile infrastructure, modifies build-out requirements, reduces reporting requirements, and establishes a task force for precision agriculture technology needs. Subtitle C focuses on rural community, business development, and infrastructure provisions. The House bill includes provisions for rural community, business development, and infrastructure. It prioritizes project applications supporting strategic plans on a multi-jurisdictional basis, raises loan amounts for water projects, increases funding for technical assistance, and reauthorizes rural development programs. Three provisions in Subtitle C would change population eligibility criteria for defining rural areas, excluding incarcerated individuals and military personnel from the criteria. The House bill reauthorizes rural development programs, expands 911 access in rural areas, and extends agricultural energy programs. It modifies funding types for these programs and increases discretionary funding for the Value-Added Grants program. Military personnel living on-base are excluded from determining rural area eligibility. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes development commissions and retains the current definition of rural areas until 2030. Unfunded programs like the Rural Telephone Bank are repealed. Technical corrections are made to certain provisions of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. The Senate bill prioritizes broadband projects in unserved rural communities. The Senate bill prioritizes broadband projects in rural communities based on population size, outmigration, low-income residents, and isolation. Grant support is limited to 50% of development costs and 75% in priority communities. The Secretary can allocate up to 5% of funds for technical training. The bill proposes changes to the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, including terminating deposits into the cushion-of-credit account in FY2019 and modifying interest rates for borrowers. It also authorizes new spending of $5 million each in FY2022 and FY2023. Additionally, a new grant program is established to provide technical assistance and training for funding applications under the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. Grants can be used for community business and economic development needs, preparing financial assistance applications, and conducting necessary reports and surveys. The Senate bill reserves 20% of funding for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program and Community Facilities Program for substance abuse disorder prevention and treatment services. It also includes a new grant program for substance abuse education and prevention in rural communities. USDA is authorized to conduct agricultural research and provide support for education programs at federal and state levels. The House bill reauthorizes funding for these activities. The House bill reauthorizes funding for land-grant universities through FY2023, authorizes a new scholarship program for 1890 land-grant institutions, and increases indirect cost recovery for agricultural research. It designates new research areas as high priorities, including macadamia tree health and cattle fever ticks. The Senate bill reauthorizes funding for hen and turkey research, the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative, and the Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI) with increased funding levels. It also includes new programs for 1890 land-grant institutions and 1994 tribal colleges, support for urban and indoor agricultural production, funding for industrial hemp research, and an initiative for advanced agricultural research. Additionally, it reauthorizes national genetic resources programs. The Senate bill reauthorizes funding for various agricultural research programs and initiatives, including creating a new scholarship program for students attending 1890 universities and establishing Centers of Excellence in different areas of research. The Senate bill includes provisions for funding tribal agriculture colleges, expanding research support for industrial hemp production, and conducting a study on the economic viability of hemp production pilot programs. The Senate bill includes provisions for funding tribal agriculture colleges and expanding research support for industrial hemp production. It also aims to conduct a study on the economic viability of hemp production pilot programs, with new provisions creating a \"Hemp Production\" subtitle under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. This would expand eligibility to other producers and groups, including tribes and territories, with states or Indian tribes needing to implement specific regulatory plans for hemp production. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for new programs supporting advanced agricultural research and development. The Chief Scientist will lead advanced research and development in food and agriculture through a pilot program focusing on long-term and high-risk research. This includes accelerating innovative agricultural research, prototype testing, and obtaining licensing and product approval. AGARDA will follow a strategic plan developed by the Secretary, consulting with federal research agencies and the National Academies of Sciences. Provisions are in place to expedite contract and grant awards and appointments of qualified scientists and research program managers. The Senate bill supports the AGARDA agenda by establishing the Agriculture Advanced Research Development Fund with a $10 million annual appropriation for FY2019-FY2023. It also authorizes the Urban, Indoor, and Emerging Agricultural Production Initiative for grants to develop urban and indoor agricultural systems, new markets, and pest management practices. The provision allocates $4 million and $10 million annually for FY2019-FY2023 for pest management, energy-saving technologies, new crop varieties, and agricultural products. An additional $14 million is authorized for a study on urban and indoor agriculture production, including community gardens, rooftop gardens, urban farms, and hydroponic and aquaponic facilities. The Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry issues and some National Forest System lands managed by the USDA Forest Service. Previous farm bills focused on forestry research and programs for nonfederal forest landowners. The House- and Senate-passed farm bills include provisions for forestry assistance and research programs, addressing management of federal forest land and public lands. Forestry programs are authorized under three main laws and receive necessary funding. The House and Senate farm bills reauthorize forestry programs, with the House bill extending four programs through FY2023 and amending two others, while the Senate bill reauthorizes two programs and adds one new program. The Senate bill reauthorizes forestry programs, amending one program with a sunset date of FY2023 and repealing two others. Both House and Senate bills establish new assistance programs, such as the Landscape Scale Restoration program for large restoration projects. The House and Senate bills propose projects to address issues related to biomass accumulation in forests and the risk of wildfires. Both bills provide financial assistance for hazardous fuel reduction projects that cross landownership boundaries. The Senate bill authorizes $20 million annually for funding, while the House bill encourages the use of existing funding for cross-boundary projects. Additionally, both bills aim to promote wood innovation for energy use and building construction. The House and Senate bills propose changes to forest management to address biomass accumulation and wildfire risk. They include financial assistance for fuel reduction projects across land boundaries and promote wood innovation for energy and construction. The bills also alter compliance with environmental laws like NEPA and the Endangered Species Act. The House bill establishes categorical exclusions for certain activities, while the Senate bill focuses on sage grouse and mule deer habitat. The House and Senate bills propose changes to forest management, including expedited ESA consultations and provisions for NFS lands. Both bills address insect and disease treatment areas, hazardous fuels reduction, and the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program reauthorization. The Senate bill requires specific procedures for implementing the CE, while the House bill expands authorities and modifies program terms. Both the House and Senate bills propose changes to forest management, including the conveyance of NFS land through lease, sale, or exchange. The Senate bill also establishes watershed protection programs, authorizes donations for projects, designates wilderness areas in Virginia and Tennessee, and addresses federal and tribal forest management issues such as expanding Good Neighbor Agreements to include Indian tribes and county governments. Additionally, the Senate bill exempts revenue generated from GNA projects from revenue-sharing laws. The House bill would remove exemptions to revenue-sharing laws for revenue from Stewardship Contracts and direct the Secretary of Agriculture to exempt unprocessed dead and dying trees on NFS lands in California from export prohibition for 10 years. It would also amend provisions of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. Both the House and Senate bills modify the energy title, with the Senate bill retaining mandatory funding while the House bill provides none. The House bill does not include mandatory funding for energy programs, unlike the Senate bill which retains mandatory funding. The House bill reauthorizes and modifies energy programs, extending them through FY2023 and changing their placement within the farm bill. In contrast to prior farm bills, the House bill provides discretionary funding instead of mandatory funding for these programs. The House bill provides discretionary funding for energy programs, while the Senate bill includes mandatory funding and establishes new initiatives. Mandatory funding is allocated to seven programs in the Senate bill, totaling approximately $640 million over five years. The two bills have similarities and differences, with the Senate bill repealing certain provisions not addressed in the House bill. The Senate Agriculture Committee bill differs from the House bill by repealing the Repowering Assistance Program and expanding the focus of the Biomass Research and Development Initiative to include carbon dioxide utilization and sequestration. It also establishes a biogas research initiative, an Interagency Biogas Opportunities Task Force, and a Carbon Utilization Education Program for promoting carbon utilization and sequestration benefits. The House and Senate farm bills reauthorize provisions supporting farming operations in specialty crop, certified organic agriculture, and local foods sectors. These provisions cover programs such as block grants to states, support for farmers markets, food safety education, and organic certification. The Senate bill includes provisions for industrial hemp in various titles, while the House bill does not have comparable hemp provisions. The House bill does not include hemp provisions but would amend regulatory requirements under federal statutes not in the Senate bill. Both bills make changes to farmers markets and local foods promotion programs in different ways. The House bill eliminates mandatory CCC funding for FMPP and LFPP, reauthorizing discretionary appropriations of $30 million annually. The Senate bill combines FMPP, LFPP, and Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants to create a new \"Local Agriculture Market Program\" with mandatory funding of $60 million annually. The bill includes provisions supporting urban agriculture development and addresses concerns about organic import integrity by strengthening tracking and investigation of organic product imports. It also amends eligibility requirements for the National Organic Standards Board and reauthorizes appropriations for the National Organic Program. The Senate bill includes provisions for technology upgrades to improve tracking of organic imports and reauthorizes funding for the National Organic Certification Cost Share Program. It also includes provisions from the Hemp Farming Act of 2018 to facilitate commercial cultivation of hemp in the US, including amending the Controlled Substances Act to exclude industrial hemp with low THC levels. Additionally, a new hemp program is created under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The House bill creates a new hemp program under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, expanding the definition of hemp and eligibility to other producers. States or tribes seeking regulatory authority over hemp production must implement a plan. Hemp producers would be eligible for federal crop insurance and USDA research programs. The bill includes exemptions from regulatory requirements in various acts. The House bill amends various acts including the Clean Water Act, Plant Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act. It clarifies federal and state roles in pesticide regulation, exempts certain pesticide discharges from permitting requirements, and extends authority to collect pesticide fees. Additionally, it amends the Plant Protection Act regarding the use of methyl bromide in emergencies and exempts agricultural activities from OSHA regulations. The House bill amends various acts including the Clean Water Act, Plant Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act. It exempts agricultural retailers from process safety management requirements and includes provisions for specialty crop and certified organic sectors in various titles of the bill. Crop insurance is available to cover economic losses from natural causes and adverse market developments for producers who purchase policies. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2 modify provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, which provides subsidized crop insurance to protect against various losses. Section 508(d) of the act, authorizing performance-based premium discounts, is altered in both versions. The House bill repeals this section entirely, eliminating discounts for producers with good insurance or production experience. The Senate-passed farm bill expands FCIC's authority to offer discounts for risk-reducing practices like precision irrigation, fertilization, crop rotations, and cover crops. The House-passed farm bill decreases authorized spending for crop insurance by $70 million by eliminating certain programs. The House farm bill proposes cost-saving measures such as increasing administrative fees for catastrophic risk protection and reducing funding for research and development. It also expands coverage for forage and grazing by allowing separate crop insurance policies for dual-purpose crops. Additionally, it redefines beginning farmers or ranchers as those who have actively operated for less than 10 years, making them eligible for federal subsidy benefits. The House farm bill expands coverage for forage and grazing, redefines beginning farmers, and clarifies requirements for FCIC approval of insurance plans. It also includes subtitles on Livestock, Beginning, Socially Disadvantaged, and Veteran Producers, Textiles, and other related matters. The House and Senate bills cover a wide array of issues related to livestock, agriculture, and food defense. Both bills establish an animal disease preparedness program and a vaccine bank prioritizing foot-and-mouth disease vaccine acquisition. A key difference is the funding, with the House bill providing $250 million in mandatory funding for FY2019 and $50 million for FY2020-2023, while the Senate bill authorizes appropriations as necessary for the programs. The House and Senate bills authorize appropriations for various agricultural programs, including $30 million per year for the NAHLN, funding for beginning, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers, youth agricultural programs, a Commission on Farm Transition, and a Tribal Advisory Committee. The House bill provides $43 million for the Outreach and Assistance to Socially Disadvantaged Producers program, while the Senate bill provides $216 million. The House and Senate bills authorize appropriations for various agricultural programs, including funding for beginning, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers, youth agricultural programs, a Commission on Farm Transition, and a Tribal Advisory Committee. The Senate bill provides $216 million for the Farming Opportunities and Outreach Training program and requires USDA to re-establish the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development. Both bills would also amend parts of the NAP. The House and Senate bills would amend parts of the NAP. The House bill includes changes to crop eligibility and service fees, while the Senate bill adds data collection requirements and raises service fees. The House bill repeals trust funds for Pima Agriculture Cotton and Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers, establishing a Textile Trust Fund instead. The Senate bill reauthorizes certain programs without establishing a new trust fund. The Senate-passed bill reauthorizes the Pima and Wool trust funds and the Wool Research and Promotion grant funding. Both bills include animal welfare provisions and establish a Century Farms Program. The House bill extends provisions banning animal fighting to U.S. territories and adds South Carolina to the Virginia/Carolina region of the Peanut Standards Board. The Protect Interstate Commerce provisions in the House bill prohibit state or local governments from setting standards on agricultural commodities produced in another state if they comply with federal or state laws. The bill allows various entities to challenge standards in court, but this provision is not included in the Senate-passed bill."
