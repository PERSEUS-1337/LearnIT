    "content": "In recent research, deep neural networks can fit randomly labeled data perfectly but perform poorly on held out data, indicating that loss functions like cross-entropy may not reliably predict generalization. A proposed measure based on margin distribution, distances of training points to decision boundaries, shows strong correlation with generalization gap on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Other important factors include normalizing margin values for scale independence and using characterizations. Normalizing margin values for scale independence, using characterizations of margin distribution, and working in log space are important factors in improving generalization of deep neural networks. Our measure can be applied to feedforward deep networks of any architecture, aiming to improve generalization for real-world deployment in domains like autonomous cars and healthcare. Recent research challenges the belief that deep networks generalize well, citing issues with misclassification of perturbed images, overfitting to corrupted data, and sensitivity to geometric transformations. This raises questions about the generalization gap between training and unseen examples. Recent research questions how well deep networks generalize, highlighting issues like misclassification of perturbed images and sensitivity to transformations. This has prompted investigations into predicting the generalization gap using training data and network parameters. Existing methods like cross-entropy and weight decay have proven insufficient, leading to new approaches based on network complexity and noise stability. However, empirical validation of these methods is lacking. This work introduces a new metric for predicting the generalization gap in feedforward neural networks. The study introduces a new metric based on margin in support vector machines and deep networks to predict the generalization gap in feedforward neural networks. The metric shows a strong correlation with generalization gap and outperforms theoretical bounds on test accuracy. The normalized margin distributions are closely linked to test accuracy, indicating the potential use of normalized margins at all layers. The study introduces a new metric based on margin in support vector machines and deep networks to predict the generalization gap in feedforward neural networks. Normalized margins at all layers are shown to be closely linked to test accuracy, motivating their use as features to summarize the distributions. Empirical results on deep networks trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the metric in constructing new loss functions with better generalization. Our proposed measure can handle any feedforward deep network and improves generalization gap prediction by utilizing margin information across layers. Unlike traditional margin definitions, we adopt margin distribution to avoid sensitivity to outliers. The notion of margin distribution is utilized to improve prediction power in deep networks. Normalization is crucial for capturing the generalization gap effectively. Recent research highlights the challenge of measuring generalization from training data, emphasizing the need for proper normalization schemes. BID4 proposes a measure based on the ratio of margin distribution at the output layer and a spectral complexity measure related to the network's Lipschitz constant. Their normalized margin distribution indicates the complexity of the learning task. BID21 develops bounds based on weight norms across layers, while BID1 focuses on noise stability properties for better generalization. These criteria help derive stronger generalization bounds than previous works, with the margin distribution boosting margins across the training set. This connection explains the effectiveness of boosting and bagging in linear models. In linear models, controlling classifier complexity is crucial for measuring margin. Recent work proposes approximations to margin in deep networks, improving generalization by maximizing these approximations. Normalized cross-entropy measures trade off prediction confidence with stability, correlating well with test loss. The proposed normalized loss in deep networks trades off prediction confidence with stability, leading to better correlation with test accuracy and lower output margin. A margin-based measure is introduced, where the margin distribution is constructed and condensed into a small number of statistics. Regression coefficients are used to predict the generalization gap of unseen models based on these statistics. The motivation for using margins at hidden layers is supported by empirical findings, drawing parallels to the success of SVM with kernel methods. The primal kernel SVM problem is separated into a feature extractor and classifier on extracted features. Hidden layers can be treated as feature maps, with preceding layers as feature extractors and succeeding layers as classifiers. Margins at hidden representations are important for generalization, extending theories from input layers. Notation is established for a classification problem with n classes and a classifier f consisting of non-linear functions. The classifier f consists of non-linear functions generating prediction scores for classifying input vectors to classes. Decision boundaries are defined for each class pair, and the l p distance of a point to the decision boundary is expressed as the smallest displacement resulting in a score tie. Unlike an SVM, computing the exact distance for a deep network is intractable, so an approximation scheme is adopted to capture the distance to the decision boundary. The distance of the representation vector x to the decision boundary for class pair (i, j) is approximated by the output of the network logit i given x. This distance can be positive or negative, indicating if the sample is on the \"correct\" or \"wrong\" side of the boundary. The distribution of distances at each layer is referred to as margin distribution. The margin distribution at each layer considers distances with positive sign, ignoring misclassified points. Results with negative margins are included in the appendix. Plain distances can be trivially boosted without changing classifier separation. In a ReLU network, scaling weights in one layer and dividing weights in the next layer by a constant does not affect classification but changes distances to the decision boundary. To offset this scaling effect, the margin distribution is normalized by computing the total variation of the representation vectors and dividing distances by the square root of the total variation to create an invariant margin distribution. The total variation is computed as the trace of the empirical covariance matrix of activations. Normalized margin distributions based on Eq. 5 become heavier tailed and shift to the right as generalization gap decreases. Analyzing the moments of the distribution is a standard way to work with the margin distribution. In experiments, the first five moments are used to analyze the margin distribution. An alternate method involves using quartiles and fences to summarize the normalized margin distribution at a specific layer. These statistics form the quartile description shown in box plots. Our experiments show that margin distribution from all layers of the network contributes to predicting the generalization gap. Quartile signature analysis reveals shifts in margin distributions across different layers, with the second signature performing slightly better in predicting the generalization gap. The quartile signature analysis shows shifts in margin distributions across network layers. A total signature, combining margin signatures from all layers, is used to predict the generalization gap in trained models. A linear prediction model is employed for this purpose. The quartile signature analysis reveals margin distribution shifts across network layers, used to predict the generalization gap in trained models. A linear prediction model is then employed to estimate predictor parameters a, b by minimizing mean squared error. Two metrics are considered to assess prediction quality. The study uses a linear model to estimate predictor parameters a, b by minimizing mean squared error. Two metrics are considered to assess prediction quality, including the coefficient of determination (R 2) measured through k-fold validation on held-out deep networks. The study uses a linear model with k = 10 to estimate predictor parameters. The F-score indicates variable importance, while adjusted R 2 measures model fit without a test pool. R 2 can be negative for non-linear data, penalizing high feature-to-data ratios. A higher R 2 value signifies better model fit, making it a useful metric for linear model fitness. The study tested a measure of generalization gap on deep networks like nine-layer convolutional networks on CIFAR-10 and 32-layer residual networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Various hyperparameters and training techniques were explored, including weight decay, dropout, batch norm, data augmentation, and training with corrupted labels. The trained models and code are available on GitHub. The study by Zhang et al. tested generalization gap on deep networks using various hyperparameters and training techniques. They limited some models' capacities with large weight regularization to decrease the generalization gap. The networks were trained using SGD with momentum, and a 20-dimensional signature vector was computed for each trained network to estimate the parameters of the linear predictor. Further details are available in the supplementary material. The study by Zhang et al. analyzed generalization gap in deep networks using different hyperparameters and training methods. A 20-dimensional signature vector was computed for each network to estimate linear predictor parameters. Comparisons were made with the work of BID4, showing a better fit with an R2 of 0.96 compared to 0.72. The study reduced the signature \u03b8 from 20 dimensions to 4 dimensions, dropping 16 components. The prediction residual was compared with BID4 and other baseline comparisons, showing a poorer fit with an R2 of 0.89. A number of ablation experiments were conducted to quantify the effect of normalization on different layers and feature transformations. The study conducted ablation experiments to analyze the impact of normalization on different layers and feature transformations. Various configurations were tested, including linear/log, spectral, moment, and Jacobian-based margin, among others. In Table 1, R2 values from fitting models based on quartile and moment signatures show similar performance, indicating the importance of margin distribution for generalization. 216 convolutional networks with residual connections were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ranging in accuracy from 83% to 93.5% and generalization gap from 6% to 13.5%. Residual networks were 32 layers deep with different normalization techniques used for generalization gap variation. The Residual networks used in the study were 32 layers deep, with 4 layers chosen for feature-length compatibility with shallower convolutional networks. The design choice aimed to facilitate analysis and avoid depth dependency. The study omitted certain bounds for ResNet due to the presence of residual connections using convolution instead of identity blocks.
