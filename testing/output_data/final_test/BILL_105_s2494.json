    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Multichannel Video Competition Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that despite previous Acts promoting competition in cable and telecommunications services, cable TV operators still lack effective competition in most areas of America. The market power of cable television operators allows them to raise prices for consumers and control the availability of cable programming to other multichannel video service providers. Direct Broadcast Satellite service, with over 8 million subscribers, is the main competitor to cable TV but faces barriers such as the inability to provide local broadcast signals. Direct Broadcast Satellite service faces barriers in providing local television broadcast signals, including higher costs for equipment and installation. Allowing providers to retransmit local signals would enhance their ability to compete effectively. Unlike cable TV, satellite providers cannot carry all local signals in every market they serve. It is in the public interest for satellite providers to comply with mandatory signal carriage rules. The interim period before mandatory signal carriage rules can be fully implemented would harm direct broadcast satellite service providers' ability to compete. Local television broadcast licensees not carried by satellite providers should be compensated for revenue loss. Many satellite subscribers receive network signals from stations outside their local markets. The recent ruling by a federal district court will result in many satellite subscribers losing distant network signals, regardless of whether local network signals are viewable off-air or not. This could harm local affiliates' audience share and revenues, impacting their ability to serve the community. It is in the public interest to only carry distant network stations where local stations cannot be received off-air. The abrupt termination of satellite carriers providing distant network signals would negatively impact direct broadcast satellite subscribers, hindering their ability to compete in the multichannel video services market. It is important for subscribers unable to receive local network signals over-the-air to continue receiving distant network signals temporarily until the FCC can redefine the criteria for permanent carriage of such signals. Improving competition in multichannel video services by removing barriers aligns with Congress' intent in the Cable Act and Telecommunications Act. The Act aims to boost competition in multichannel video services by eliminating barriers for Direct Broadcast Satellite Services to compete with cable TV systems. It includes provisions for satellite carriers to carry local television signals. The purpose of this section is to promote competition in multichannel video services by enabling direct broadcast service providers to offer local television station signals to subscribers and accommodating technical limitations. Mandatory carriage provisions will apply to satellite carriers retransmitting television broadcast signals by January 1, 2002, with rulemaking required within 180 days of the Multichannel Video Competition Act of 1998 enactment. The Multichannel Video Competition Act of 1998 requires direct broadcast satellite service providers to carry all eligible local television stations or compensate those not carried before January 1, 2002. A compensation formula must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Multichannel Video Competition Act of 1998 mandates direct broadcast satellite service providers to carry all eligible local television stations or compensate those not carried. The Commission must establish a formula to determine audience and revenue loss for noncarried stations and set procedural rules for resolving compensation petitions. Local stations can petition for compensation if their signal is not carried, with the burden of proof on the petitioner. Compensation is limited to the formula amount unless unusual circumstances exist. The Commission may only grant compensation for revenue loss according to a prescribed formula unless unusual circumstances warrant additional compensation. If the formula amount is insufficient for the petitioner to operate in the public interest, the Commission will award additional compensation. The Commission must issue a decision on any petition within 150 days of filing. A local television broadcast station eligible for carriage must provide a good quality signal for retransmission by the satellite carrier within 150 days of the petition being filed. The station is responsible for the costs associated with delivering the signal. SEC. 5. CARRIAGE OF DISTANT NETWORK SIGNALS BY SATELLITE CARRIERS. The purpose of this section is to promote competition in multichannel video services by allowing satellite carriers to offer distant network signals to areas with poor local television reception. Satellite carriers can continue retransmitting distant network signals to households within the same network's local affiliate area until February 28, 1999. The Federal Communications Commission is required to make rules regarding this. The Federal Communications Commission must complete a rulemaking proceeding to define unserved areas or households based on a satisfactory signal accessible by common off-air reception devices. This rulemaking must be finished in time for any changes to take effect by February 28, 1999. Any actions taken by the Commission under this rulemaking do not absolve direct broadcast satellite providers from liability for prior violations of title 17, United States Code. SEC. 6. RETRANSMISSION CONSENT. Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 prohibit cable systems from retransmitting broadcasting station signals without authorization. Exceptions include retransmission of non-commercial broadcasting stations. Exceptions to the prohibition on retransmitting broadcasting station signals without authorization include retransmission of non-commercial broadcasting stations, superstations as of May 1, 1991, network stations with at least 500,000 subscribers by December 31, 1997, distant signals to unserved areas, and retransmission by cable operators. The text chunk discusses exceptions to the prohibition on retransmitting broadcasting station signals without authorization, including retransmission of superstations as of May 1, 1991, network stations with at least 500,000 subscribers by December 31, 1997, and retransmission by cable operators in unserved areas. The curr_chunk defines terms related to television broadcasting, including broadcast station, broadcasting network, network station, and local market. The curr_chunk explains that for commercial television broadcast stations in designated markets, all stations within the same market are considered part of the local market. Additionally, for noncommercial educational television broadcast stations, the local market includes any relevant stations. The local market for broadcast stations includes all stations licensed to a community within the designated market area. The term 'designated market area' is determined by Nielsen Media Research. An 'unserved area' is a place that does not receive an off-air signal from a local network station meeting Commission standards. The amendments made are effective January 1, 1999."
