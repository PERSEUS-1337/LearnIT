    "content": "In this work, the focus is on learning a representation useful for clustering tasks. Two novel loss components are introduced to improve cluster quality, applicable to various models without complex training. Extensive experiments on RNNs and CNNs show consistent enhancement in KMeans clustering quality. This research contributes to representation learning in deep neural networks. Deep neural networks excel in transforming input data for specific tasks, such as binary classification. Intermediate representations learned by the network are tailored for the task at hand. However, using these representations for different tasks, like multivariate time series classification, may pose challenges. The model uses a sigmoid activation function in the last FC 2 layer and a ReLU activation function in the layer FC 1. ReLU activation produces non-negative vectors, leading to orthogonal vectors for samples of different classes and parallel vectors for samples of the same class in the FC 1 layer. The output scalar is the result of the dot product between the weights of the final layer FC 2 and the output of the penultimate hidden layer FC 1, with the vectors being orthogonal due to the ReLU activation. In this work, the focus is on learning a better representation of the input for downstream tasks like clustering. Two novel loss components are proposed to force the network to learn diverged representations, applicable in weakly-supervised and unsupervised settings. The proposed components are evaluated on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using different types of input data. Our approach improves KMeans clustering quality using RNN and CNN with various input data types. It outperforms previous methods in terms of mutual information scores. Different categories of approaches have been explored to enhance input data representation for downstream tasks, such as discriminative models and probabilistic generative models. Approaches from the first group propose new loss components like XCov and DeCov to improve network representations. XCov enforces disentangled factors in the network, while DeCov minimizes redundant representations. Experiments show that these methods lead to more meaningful representations for different datasets. The DeCov loss minimizes cross-covariance of hidden activations to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing classification performance across various datasets. Another approach involves modifying training procedures with methods like BID10, which iteratively calculates cluster centroids to achieve parsimonious representations and enhance model generalization and test performance in supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios. The BID17 algorithm focuses on improving clustering accuracy by iteratively updating network weights and cluster centroids. It outperforms previous methods in learning better representations for clustering tasks. Additionally, recent methods aim to disentangle factors of variation and propose deep generative models for semi-supervised learning, showcasing the ability to generate samples with variations in style. The BID12 algorithm proposed a conditional generative model combining Variational Autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Networks for disentangling factors of variations. The training process involves multiple phases, including reconstruction, regularization, and semi-supervised classification. Unlike other methods, the proposed loss components are simpler and can be easily implemented with any cost. The proposed loss components in this study are simpler compared to other methods and can be easily implemented with any cost function. Two novel loss components are introduced to improve clustering quality over model representations. The first component works on a single layer, while the second component affects the entire network to produce disentangled representations in complex networks. The proposed loss components aim to improve clustering quality by forcing divergent representations for samples of the same class. This is achieved by ensuring the rows of the weight matrix of a specific layer are different from each other, leading to varied patterns of activations. The loss component operates directly on the weights of the layer, not on its outputs, with a hyperparameter defining the desired margin of the loss. The loss component operates on the weights of a specific layer to improve clustering quality by creating divergent representations for samples of the same class. In simple networks, it enhances clustering quality significantly, but in complex models, the improvement is less pronounced. The proposed loss component aims to create disentangled representations in the network by influencing all layers before it. It works on the outputs of the target layer to produce divergent representations for samples with the same label, improving clustering quality. The loss components proposed in the experiments affect the entire network beyond the layer they are applied to, enhancing clustering quality by creating divergent representations for samples with the same label. These components can be used in unsupervised learning and easily applied to autoencoder models with a hyperparameter \u03b1 determining their importance. The margin hyperparameter m plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the proposed loss components. A larger value of m creates a larger margin between weights or activations, while a smaller value reduces their influence. In experiments, L single performs better with larger values of m (5-10), while L multi benefits from even small values (0.1-1) for improved disentanglement of representations and AMI score. In experiments, the proposed loss component with a reasonably chosen m does not impact the model's performance in the classification task. Various experiments were conducted using RNNs and CNNs on different types of input data. The models were compared with baseline models and other similar works. KMeans clustering was performed on the output of the penultimate layer after training the models using TensorFlow and Adam optimizer. The experiments were conducted on the MNIST strokes sequences dataset. The experiments involved training models on the MNIST strokes sequences dataset to predict groups of samples without access to underlying classes. The models were then used for KMeans clustering on the penultimate layer output. In experiments with autoencoder and CNN models on MNIST strokes sequences and CIFAR-10 datasets, the penultimate layer output was used for KMeans clustering without label information. For experiments with CNN models on CIFAR-10 dataset, objects were grouped into two categories based on class labels. A CNN model using VGG-16 architecture was modified by adding three convolutional layers. The output was passed through a fully-connected layer of size 15. The text discusses using 1x1 convolutions and fully-connected layers in a CNN model for clustering and binary classification. Additionally, text classification experiments were conducted using an RNN model on the DBPedia ontology dataset. The dataset was split into two groups based on ontology classes for training on binary classification tasks. The text discusses the efficient implementation of loss components in a model using TensorFlow BID0 for clustering and binary classification tasks. The implementation accelerates computation by creating matrices for all combinations of variables and utilizing GPU parallel matrix computations. The code is publicly available on GitHub. The implementation for TensorFlow BID0 for clustering and binary classification tasks is available on GitHub. The loss component L single operates directly on the weights of the target layer, while L multi operates on the activations of the target layer on all samples in the batch. The computational complexity of L single depends on the size of the layer, while L multi depends on the number of samples in the batch. Models with batch size of 512 and higher can be trained without exhausting the GPU's memory. On the MNIST dataset, L single outperforms all other methods. On the MNIST dataset, L single outperforms all other methods, while L multi works best on more challenging datasets. The proposed loss components improve clustering quality in autoencoder settings, with minimal impact on model accuracy. Activation analysis shows the influence of the loss components on network behavior. The proposed loss components L single and L multi improve model representations by forcing diverged patterns of activations in the target layer, as shown in Figures 2 and 3 for MNIST strokes sequences and CIFAR-10 datasets. The models without these loss components tend to learn representations specific to the target binary label, using only a few neurons for discrimination. This behavior is consistent across different models and datasets, such as RNNs on timeseries data and CNNs on image classification. The proposed loss components L single and L multi improve model representations by forcing diverged patterns of activations in the target layer. Despite not having access to underlying classes during training, the network learned to activate different neurons for different classes, leading to a better AMI score on the clustering task. Visualizations of representations from the MNIST strokes sequences dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed loss component in improving model learning. The proposed loss components L single and L multi improve model representations by forcing diverged patterns of activations in the target layer. The L multi loss component led to disentangled representations of input data, with samples from different classes placed more uniformly in space. The stability of the proposed loss component was systematically examined using Adjusted Mutual Information scores on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The study introduces two novel loss components that enhance KMeans clustering quality using data representations from neural networks. Experiments with RNNs and CNNs on image and text data show significant improvements in Mutual Information scores compared to previous methods. Visualization of activation patterns confirms that the proposed loss components encourage diverse representations."
