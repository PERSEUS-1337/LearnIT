    "content": "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a policy for bulk purchase of replacement renewable energy certificates (RECs) for facility energy projects. The provision requires each service to acquire replacement RECs through centralized purchasing authority within the department or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Central purchasing offers efficiency and economy advantages, with DLA-E serving as the executive agent for purchasing energy in bulk. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 mandates the purchase of replacement renewable energy certificates (RECs) for facility energy projects by the Department of Defense. This extends the mission of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA-E) to procure fuel and power for the armed services and federal agencies. Federal renewable energy policies have evolved over decades to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings, with initiatives like the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) has been amended over the years to include Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and renewable energy goals for federal agencies. Executive Order 13423 also mandated increased use of renewable energy sources by federal government agencies. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) advises federal agencies to obtain renewable energy from new sources and implement renewable energy projects on agency property. Executive Order 13423 mandated increased use of renewable energy sources by federal government agencies. The EPAct 2005 requires renewable energy consumption for credit towards goals, but federal agencies lack explicit authority to purchase RECs. U.S. energy demand and generation have decreased in the last decade, with deregulation creating opportunities for renewable energy. RECs are used by federal facilities to meet renewable energy mandates, especially where renewable power is not readily available. The market for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) is complex and evolving, with some states requiring electric utilities to obtain a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources. RECs are created for every megawatt-hour of power generated from eligible renewable sources. They can be traded separately from the power they represent or bundled together. Electricity markets offer capacity, power, and ancillary services, with bundled power representing \"firm power.\" The pricing plan for renewable and non-renewable energy purchases is widely used by commercial and industrial customers, including the Department of Defense (DOD). Federal spending on electricity represents a small portion of total federal energy use and discretionary budget. In 2007, electricity spending amounted to $4.4 billion for 56,497 gigawatt-hours at an average cost of $78 per MWh. DOD reported spending $4.10 billion on energy for its facilities worldwide in FY2012. In FY2010, DOD reported consuming 211,000 billion Btu of energy in its facilities worldwide, with U.S. facilities using 187,759 billion Btu. The energy sources included electricity (45%), natural gas (34%), fuel oil (9%), coal (7%), purchased steam (3%), and other fuels (2%). DOD's U.S. facilities consumed 24,765 thousand MWh of electric power. In order to estimate DOD's power demand by state, CRS aggregated site-delivered energy data reported by DOD. The estimates in Table 1 show that DOD consumed over half of its power demand in 10 states, including Virginia, Maryland, and California. The DOD's estimated power demand in 10 states includes Virginia, Maryland, California, Texas, North Dakota, Alaska, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Washington. Policies promoting renewable energy use vary among these states, with options for DOD to buy power directly from merchant generators. Federal regulations like PURPA, EPAct '92, and FERC Order 888 encourage competition and open access to transmission lines. Only 16 states have fully restructured their power markets to allow retail choice in purchasing power, offering DOD the opportunity to buy RECs and power. In regulated states, DOD may be limited to buying bundled electric service from local utilities. PURPA created a new class of qualifying generating facilities with special rate treatment under FERC, allowing them to sell power to utilities. Under PURPA, Qualifying Facilities (QFs) are small power production facilities generating less than 80 megawatts from renewable sources like solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, or waste. States began requiring utilities to include a portion of renewable-generated electricity in their capacity, offering cost-competitive alternatives to fossil and nuclear power. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) mandate utilities to sell a certain percentage of renewable energy to end-use customers by a specific date. Some states have mandatory RPS rules, while others have voluntary programs. States with mandatory RPS rules require a percentage of energy sales or installed capacity to come from renewable resources. Most states have their own standards, leading to a patchwork of conflicting rules. 29 states and the District of Columbia have binding RPS policies, while 8 states have nonbinding standards. In 2011, RPS rules mandated 133 million MWh of renewable electricity, representing over 3% of total US electricity production. Forecasts predict RPS requirements to increase to 210 million MWh by 2015. States will need 100,000 MW of new renewable capacity by 2035, potentially accounting for 7% of US retail electricity sales. REC products are organized into tiers based on promoted resources, with newer projects typically in higher tiers. Older projects may be phased out as newer projects qualify for higher tiers. The Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) mandate utilities to comply by either competitively soliciting supply or seeking Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) on the market. RECs from older projects may be phased out as newer projects qualify for higher tiers with higher RPS percentage requirements. The market for RECs is divided into voluntary and compliance markets, reflecting the diverse approaches states have taken in creating their own RPS. The market for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) consists of businesses and individuals purchasing renewable energy beyond standard utility service or government requirements. Compliance markets require utilities to provide or purchase renewable energy for their customers. RECs certify that a renewable power generator has produced a certain amount of power according to set standards. RECs have varying attributes depending on the renewable energy source. The Master Renewable Energy Certificate Purchase and Sale Agreement defines three REC products: standard REC, basic REC, and specified REC. Parties can customize the agreement to state laws and delivery requirements. Renewable energy generators can sell RECs through tracking systems. Renewable energy generators have various options to sell RECs, including using tracking systems, aggregators, brokers, or auction platforms. There are 10 regional REC tracking systems in the US and Canada, such as the North American Renewables Registry (NARR). These systems help create, manage, and retire RECs to ensure compliance with state renewable energy policies. Tracking systems also assist load-serving entities in demonstrating regulatory compliance. REC prices are influenced by factors like generation technology, vintage, volume, region, and compliance obligations. Prices are hard to determine without a broker. Only a few sources disclose REC prices, such as PJM-GATS, New Jersey, SRECTrade, and Flett Exchange. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and DC require public disclosure. ICE reports REC futures prices for Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Mandatory RPS markets generally have higher REC prices than voluntary markets. In mandatory RPS markets, REC prices are higher than in voluntary markets, with newer vintage RECs commanding higher prices. Wind prices in voluntary markets ranged from $1 to $2.75, while in compliance markets, prices ranged from a few cents to over $40. Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECS) sold for as low as $15 in Ohio and as high as $320 in Massachusetts. 29 states have not restructured their electric power industries, with 19 adopting RPS goals. DOD's estimated demand in these states represents almost 56% of its renewable energy goal. The opportunity for DOD to buy RECs independently of utility service may be limited. In states with restructured electric power industries and REC markets, DOD has the best opportunity to purchase RECs unbundled from utility service. However, these states only represent 28% of DOD's power demand, limiting its ability to meet overall RPS goals solely through buying RECs in these markets. Transmission grid interconnection may further restrict DOD's REC purchasing opportunities. Transmission grid interconnection may limit DOD's ability to purchase RECs in states with restructured electric power industries, where it has the best opportunity to buy unbundled RECs. States with RPS goals set a decade or more out introduce uncertainty about future REC availability. DOD's utility bills in these states will reflect more renewable-generated power as providers comply with RPS goals, potentially leading to competition for RECs needed to meet these goals. DOD's goal of purchasing RECs aims to promote new renewable energy projects and increase renewable electricity availability. However, DOD's renewable energy goal represents only a small fraction of state RPS sales. Virginia and California have the highest DOD power demand, but utility service in these states already includes renewable-generated power to meet state standards. The ability to buy RECs from outside markets depends on open access to wholesale transmission. DOD's 7.5% renewable energy goal is a small fraction of state RPS sales. Selling RECs separately can make projects more viable and attract investors. DLA-E, DOD's executive agent for purchasing energy commodities, offers assistance in buying renewable energy. DLA-E operates a working capital fund to provide energy commodities to clients with a surcharge for operational costs. It does not receive annual appropriations but instead uses the fund that clients repay when purchasing commodities. DLA-E has procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. Section 2304 and works with brokers to help facilities buy RECs. The working capital fund finances inventories and activities provided by DOD departments. In FY2010, DLA-E purchased 440.5 thousand MWh of RECs, meeting one-fourth of DOD's renewable energy goal. The Air Force accounted for two-thirds of the purchases, while the Army accounted for the remaining one-third. The Navy primarily relies on RECs to meet its renewable energy goals, but will purchase renewable energy if cost-effective. The Air Force is the largest DOD user of renewable electric energy, primarily through the purchase of renewable energy and RECs. Renewable energy generators use brokers to sell and trade RECs, and federal facilities interested in acquiring RECs must go through these brokers. In the past, federal agencies purchased RECs to meet renewable energy goals without buying the associated power. This allowed them to fulfill energy-intensity reduction goals with RECs generated elsewhere. Despite the need for uninterrupted power, federal agencies continued to rely on RECs rather than site-generated renewable energy to meet goals. DLA-Energy offers assistance in purchasing renewable energy through its Renewable Energy Initiatives team. Since 2003, DLA-E has purchased RECs for multiple sources of renewable energy, with wind and biomass being the most prevalent. At present, DLA-E can only respond to individual client requests to buy RECs. Accurate agency reporting on state-by-state electricity consumption might better aid DLA-E in developing a strategy for identifying the regional markets with the best opportunities for buying RECs to meet goals. Individual states have taken a balkanized and uncoordinated approach in adopting renewable portfolio standards. The federal energy-efficiency policy aims to make federal agencies more energy efficient to increase generating capacity for utility ratepayers. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a 30% energy reduction goal for federal buildings, potentially saving $1.1 billion. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a 30% energy reduction goal for federal buildings, potentially saving $1.1 billion. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began rulemaking on limiting CO2 emissions following a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Clean Air Act. In response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, the EPA initiated rulemaking to limit CO2 emissions. The EPA's finding on heat-trapping gases endangering public health was upheld by a federal appeals court. In 2009, Congress debated carbon dioxide emissions in the American Clean Energy and Security Act, but lack of consensus in the Senate ended the debate. The Obama Administration issued Executive Order 13514 in 2009, directing federal agencies to prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2. This led to a shift in focus from reducing building energy-intensity to reducing GHG emissions associated with fossil energy. The NDAA provision aims to reduce GHG emissions by promoting the purchase of RECs for renewable energy, but critics argue it may lead to federal subsidization without a renewable energy portfolio standard. RECs provide a compliance strategy but may not necessarily advance renewable energy development. Emphasis should be placed on encouraging renewable energy projects instead of solely relying on RECs. The NDAA provision promotes the purchase of RECs for renewable energy, but critics argue it may lead to federal subsidization without a renewable energy portfolio standard. RECs provide a compliance strategy but may not necessarily advance renewable energy development. DoD sees minimal benefit in purchasing RECs beyond compliance with mandates and prefers to allocate funds directly to energy projects. The NDAA provision promotes the purchase of RECs for renewable energy, but critics argue it may lead to federal subsidization without a renewable energy portfolio standard. DoD prefers to allocate funds directly to energy projects, and alternative means already exist to stimulate new renewable energy projects. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar have signed a Memorandum of Understanding encouraging appropriate development of renewable energy projects on public lands withdrawn for defense-related purposes. DOD has made underutilized land available for large-scale photovoltaic projects to offset installation electricity costs. The Electric Power Market Industry restructuring and deregulation aim to introduce competition and customer choice by breaking up vertical monopolies held by utility companies. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 dismantled holding company structures to improve engineering efficiency. Prior to 1935, holding companies controlled the nation's electric and gas distribution networks. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 dismantled monopolies in the electric power industry, allowing for competition and customer choice. Local utilities were regulated by state commissions, guaranteeing stable profits and restricting competitors' access to transmission lines. Policy makers considered dismantling this structure in the 1970s due to high energy prices. In the 1970s, high energy prices led to consideration of dismantling the regulated electric power industry to promote competitive pricing. Congress began deregulating the industry with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), allowing new entities to provide electrical energy for sale. In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 888 to encourage wholesale competition by requiring utilities to allow other electric suppliers access to their transmission lines. PURPA defined a new class of qualifying generating facilities (QFs) for special rate and regulatory treatment under FERC. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) defined qualifying generating facilities (QFs) as small power production facilities generating less than 80 megawatts using renewable energy sources. Utilities were required to buy power from QFs at their avoided cost under state authorized power purchase agreements. The FERC order allowed for separate power contracts and states moved towards opening power markets to retail customers, offering the opportunity to contract with the lowest cost supplier of electric power. DLA-E's contract portfolio exceeds 17.1 MWh of electricity valued at $1.2 billion, with the Navy being its largest customer followed by the Army. In 2011, it awarded over $416 million in new electricity contracts in states that have been deregulated or restructured. Intra-governmental revolving funds record collections earmarked for specific purposes within the government. Agencies can perform reimbursable work for each other under authorization allowing the use of advances or reimbursements for goods and services. Various laws establish revolving funds, including franchise funds and working capital funds. Agencies may credit payments to a revolving fund for ordering goods when authorized by law. The DOD was authorized to establish working capital funds to operate commercial and industrial-type activities by directly \"costing\" the activities' products under the 1949 Title IV amendments to the National Security Act of 1947. This aimed to increase efficiency in operations. The DOD operates six working capital funds, including three within the Defense Logistics Agency, two within the Defense Information Systems Agency, and one by Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The Supply Chain Management fund manages DLA materiel from purchase to disposal. The Energy Management fund provides worldwide energy support for military services and authorized customers. Document Services offers products and services produced in-house or procured through the Government Printing Office. DFAS provides pay and financial information for military services. DISA provides command and control capabilities for military services and national leaders. The Army Corps of Engineers uses a revolving fund for expenses related to civil works functions. The Army Corps of Engineers established a fund without fiscal year limitation by capitalizing inventories, plant, and equipment. The Antideficiency Act prohibits government officers from exceeding available funds. The Congressional Budget Act defines spending authority as the authority to obligate the government to make payments. The Economy Act of 1932 authorizes federal agencies to order goods and services from other agencies or units within the same agency, as long as the ordering agency has sufficient funds to cover the costs. Transactions under the Economy Act are limited by the requirement that the ordering agency must deobligate funds if the receiving agency has not incurred expenses. Under the Economy Act of 1932, federal agencies can order goods and services from other agencies or units, with payment made in advance or through reimbursements. The providing agency charges the ordering agency based on the actual cost of goods or services provided."
