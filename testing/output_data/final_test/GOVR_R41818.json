    "content": "The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-292) was enacted on December 9, 2010, requiring federal agencies to establish telework policies to allow employees to work from approved locations without diminishing performance or agency operations. This legislation followed years of legislative activity on the issue, with previous Congresses introducing bills but seeing no further action taken. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to establish telework policies for employees to work from approved locations. Employees must enter into a written agreement with the agency to participate in telework. Those handling secure materials or requiring on-site activities daily are not eligible for telework, except in emergencies. The House and Senate Committees emphasized the importance of telework in their reports. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 emphasizes the importance of telework for federal agencies to ensure continuity of essential government services in emergencies. The legislation aims to integrate telework effectively into agency management plans and cultures, highlighting the need for every agency to have a telework policy in place. Telework is seen as an essential tool for human capital management and continuity of operations. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 emphasizes the importance of telework for federal agencies for human capital management and continuity of operations. Legislation is needed to help agencies overcome resistance to telework. Key areas of focus for oversight include the Telework Managing Officer's role, training programs, evaluations by OPM and GAO, test programs on travel expenses, and documenting outcomes. The law adds a new chapter on telework to Title 5 of the United States Code. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to establish telework policies within 180 days. Eligible employees must be notified of their eligibility, and telework should not impact performance or agency operations. OPM advised all federal employees to be notified of their telework eligibility by June 7, 2011. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 mandates federal agencies to establish telework policies within 180 days. Eligible employees must be notified of their eligibility, and agencies are updating their telework plans. The Department of State and Department of Energy have revised their telework policies. Telework must be part of an agency's continuity of operations plans during emergencies. GAO conducted a performance audit to evaluate OPM and GSA's role in telework implementation. The GAO conducted an audit from 2010 to July 2011 to assess the role of OPM, GSA, FEMA, and FPS in promoting telework during emergencies. The audit found that governmentwide guidance lacked a clear definition of incorporating telework into continuity and emergency planning. OPM's annual survey on telework implementation also lacked clarity on integrating telework into emergency planning. The GAO recommends that the OPM Director, in consultation with other agencies, develop a definition and set of practices for incorporating telework in emergency and continuity plans. They also suggest revising data-collection methodology to ensure reliable reporting on telework integration and establishing an interagency coordination process for issuing guidance. OPM issues new guidance for telework during emergencies, requiring each agency to designate a Telework Managing Officer (TMO) within the office of the CHCO. The TMO, a senior official with direct access to the agency head, develops and implements telework policy, advises agency leadership, and serves as a liaison with OPM. Employees disciplined for unauthorized absences may not telework. Employees may not telework if they have been disciplined for unauthorized absences or ethical violations related to pornography on a government computer.

Employees handling secure materials or on-site activities unsuitable for telework are also ineligible. Employees eligible for telework must receive training, and the agency head must ensure completion before entering into a telework agreement. Exemptions may be granted for employees already teleworking. Performance appraisals and other employee treatments are the same for teleworking and non-teleworking employees. The agency must consult Office of Personnel Management guidelines on performance management when making determinations on employee performance. Each executive agency must consult with OPM in developing telework policies, including pay, leave, agency closure, performance management, recruitment, retention, and accommodations for employees with disabilities. OPM will also provide guidance on establishing telework goals and measures, consulting with other agencies on policies for COOP and emergencies, telework centers, travel, technology, equipment, and dependent care during telework. OPM must maintain a central website on telework that includes links to telework information announcements, guidance, and best practices from public and private sector entities. The OPM Director is directed to research telework use to identify recommendations for the federal government. The OPM Director is tasked with researching telework best practices and outcomes, including effects on energy consumption, job creation, and urban transportation. Federal agency heads must cooperate if coordination is needed, and studies must be made public. The Director may use competitive procedures for contracts to carry out this provision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) must issue guidelines within 180 days to ensure information security for teleworking. Guidelines include controlling access, protecting information systems, limiting vulnerabilities, safeguarding telecommunications, and preventing misuse of official resources. The OMB Director issued a memorandum on information technology purchasing requirements for executive agencies to enable and support telework.

The Comptroller General (CG) must submit a report on the telework program at the Government Accountability Office to Congress, including information on agency goals, progress, and best practices. The report should be submitted annually and review the progress of each executive agency towards their telework goals. Executive agencies must also submit annual reports to the CHCO Council on telework. The agency's TMO must submit an annual report to the CHCO Council on telework management efforts. The council will review and include relevant information in the annual report to Congress. A new section on \"Authority for telework travel expenses test programs\" has been added to the United States Code. This allows agencies to pay for occasional trips for teleworking employees living far from the agency. The agency can use a test program to pay for teleworking employees' occasional trips to the office, with the goal of saving money and increasing efficiency. If an employee relocates and wants to continue teleworking, they may have to make occasional visits to the office at their own expense before becoming eligible for reimbursement. The GSA Administrator can approve a test program for agencies to pay for travel expenses of employees in a telework program instead of regular payments. The program must aim to enhance cost savings or efficiencies for the government and require analysis of costs and benefits. Employees may have the option to waive payments under certain conditions. The agency can establish a maximum number of visits to a pre-existing duty station before employees can receive payment for travel expenses. The GSA Administrator must submit approved test programs to committees before implementation and agencies must report results within three months of completion. The agency can conduct up to 10 test programs simultaneously, with the authority expiring seven years after the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is authorized to conduct a test program on travel expenses, as explained during a Senate hearing on telework. The USPTO is expanding teleworking nationwide to attract top talent, increase retention rates, and manage real estate costs. They are exploring the feasibility of creating a nationwide workplace for examiners to work from anywhere in the country. They aim to transition from local teleworking to a fully integrated nationwide teleworking agency and propose a demonstration project for this purpose. The USPTO is considering a demonstration project to reimburse telework employees for travel expenses to the official Alexandria worksite, aiming to facilitate nationwide teleworking and retain a highly qualified workforce. The USPTO is considering a demonstration project to reimburse telework employees for travel expenses to the official Alexandria worksite. Employees can waive payment if they telework from a location beyond the local commuting area and PTO approves the arrangement for employee convenience. An oversight committee will be established to develop operating procedures for the program. The USPTO is considering a demonstration project to reimburse telework employees for travel expenses to the official Alexandria worksite. The program aims to maximize telework arrangements while minimizing agency travel expenses. The Director of PTO must prepare an analysis of costs and benefits before implementation. Government Reform and the Judiciary. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 allows for occasional visits to the pre-existing duty station before payment of travel expenses. Oversight by the House and Senate may focus on changes in telework administration roles and responsibilities. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 mandates the appointment of a Telework Managing Officer. It focuses on the effectiveness of interactive training programs, fairness in telework implementation, and consultation availability at OPM for executive agencies.

The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 mandates the appointment of a Telework Managing Officer and focuses on interactive training programs, fairness in implementation, and consultation availability at OPM for executive agencies. Congress will examine findings from consultations with FEMA, GSA, and the National Archives and Records Administration, as well as OPM's annual report on telework implementation. Executive agencies are required to report their COOP activities to Congress, and potential amendments may be suggested based on OPM and GAO reports. Coordination among CHCOs in executive agencies is also emphasized. The role of CHCOs in executive agencies is to coordinate with and ensure the effectiveness of TMOs. Test programs on telework travel expenses may facilitate telework programs and employee recruitment. Telework enables federal employees to work more efficiently, leading to cost savings that could be used for other activities in executive agencies."
