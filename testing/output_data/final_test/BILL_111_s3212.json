The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified energy efficiency property for energy credit and grants. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified energy efficiency property, defined as property achieving a minimum energy savings of 50% compared to a reference building meeting specific standards. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified energy efficiency property, which refers to buildings over 150,000 square feet with a floor area ratio of at least 3.0, intended for residential rental purposes and certified by the taxpayer with a reservation from the Secretary. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified energy efficiency property for buildings over 150,000 square feet with a floor area ratio of at least 3.0. In states with more than 35% rural population, the building size requirement is more than 50,000 square feet and must be located near a Fixed Guideway Transit System or part of a rural town center redevelopment project on previously occupied land. The project must be on land previously used for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes in a Census-defined place with at least 5,000 people and 1,000 jobs. Construction must start within 36 months. For residential rental properties, the majority of the building must be for rental use, with a special rule applying if 25% is devoted to residential rental use. The certification requirements for affordable housing in a project include ensuring that at least 5 percent of residential rental units are affordable to households with incomes not exceeding 60 percent of the area median income at the time of initial occupancy. To meet the affordable housing requirement, taxpayers must file a land use restriction agreement with the municipal government where the building is located. The agreement ensures units remain affordable for 99 years or the longest period allowed by state law. The Secretary issues a reservation upon receiving evidence that the project meets the requirements. The project must be designed as qualified energy efficiency property under the Internal Revenue Code. Evidence of timely placement in service is required, including approval from the local municipality, a building permit, and financial support agreements. Maintenance of reservation is necessary. To maintain a reservation for qualified energy efficiency property, construction must begin within 12 months of the reservation issuance. The Secretary will establish regulations within 2 months of enactment. Amendments apply after the enactment date, following rules similar to section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Grants may be provided instead of tax credits under section 1603. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 is amended to include qualified energy efficiency property for a 30 percent grant amount."
