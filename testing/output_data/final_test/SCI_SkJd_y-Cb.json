Word2net is a neural network-based model that outperforms traditional embedding methods by incorporating syntactic information and sharing parameters based on part of speech. It learns interpretable semantic representations and better incorporates syntactic information compared to vector-based methods. Word embeddings are a statistical tool for analyzing language by learning meaningful vector representations of vocabulary based on the distributional hypothesis. Word2net is a word embedding method that introduces a term-specific neural network for each word, replacing the traditional linear assumption. It aims to improve semantic representations by incorporating syntactic information and sharing parameters based on part of speech. The objective involves evaluating the output of each word's network with its surrounding words, resembling a bank of coupled non-linear binary classifiers. Word2net builds on classical word embeddings by capturing non-linear interaction effects between co-occurring words, leading to a better language model. It enables parameter sharing based on word-level meta-data like part-of-speech tags. The word networks share parameters for terms with the same tag, improving semantic representations. Word2net objective is to determine the probability of a binary variable based on its context. It involves a neural network that outputs the probability of a word. Parameter sharing can be used to create a per-word per-tag neural network. Additionally, a method for computing similarities between word representations is proposed. The method involves computing similarities between neural network representations of words to capture semantic and syntactic similarities. Parameter sharing in word2net outperforms word2vec and standard Bernoulli embeddings. Deep Bernoulli embeddings show better predictive log-likelihood compared to other embeddings. Word embedding models learn semantic features by analyzing word co-occurrence patterns in documents. Various extensions and variants of word embeddings exist, mostly based on a log-bilinear model. Our model differs from deep neural network architectures by having separate networks for each vocabulary word and incorporating side information in specific layers. Word embeddings capture semantic properties, but our model allows for additional syntactic structure. The model discussed extends word embeddings to datasets beyond text by using exponential family embeddings. It incorporates a multi-layer network that takes context as input to predict word occurrences. The network reweights latent features based on relevance for prediction. The model extends word embeddings to incorporate syntactic information into word2net, with specific networks for different parts of speech. It outperforms popular embedding methods on predicting held-out words using datasets from Wikipedia articles and U.S. Senate speeches. Word2net is a word embedding method that represents words with functions instead of vectors or distributions. It uses neural networks to replace the embedding vector, outperforming other methods in predicting held-out words and incorporating syntactic information. Word2net utilizes separate networks for each vocabulary word, maintaining a bank of binary classifiers for faster optimization. It extends exponential family embeddings to allow for non-linear relationships, focusing on Bernoulli embeddings that capture semantic properties of words. Word2net introduces a novel extension of Bernoulli embeddings, which are related to word2vec and capture semantic properties of words. It leverages syntactic information to improve word representations by using separate networks for each vocabulary word and binary classifiers for faster optimization. Exponential family embeddings, specifically Bernoulli embeddings, parameterize the conditional probability of a target word given its context using a linear combination of embedding and context vectors. This approach does not require the sum over vocabulary words to be 1, reducing computational complexity. The goal is to learn embedding and context vectors by maximizing the log probability of words given their contexts. The data contains pairs of words and their contexts, forming an objective function as a sum of log probabilities. The objective can be viewed as a bank of binary classifiers, with context vectors coupling them together. In practice, the contribution of zeros in the objective needs to be downweighted or negative examples need to be subsampled. Replacing vectors with neural networks in the word2net objective increases model capacity to capture nonlinear relationships between context and cooccurrence probabilities. The neural network architecture consists of a three-layer feed-forward network, enhancing the transformation of context representations. The neural network architecture in word2net enhances context representation transformation through consecutive layers. The model's increased capacity poses a risk of overfitting, which is addressed through regularization techniques. Empirical studies show word2net outperforms shallow models in fitting text data and capturing semantic similarities. Parameter sharing in the hierarchical structure of neural network representations is utilized for improved performance. Regularization through parameter sharing in word2net involves assigning words to groups and sharing specific layers of neural network representations among words in the same group. This technique helps in reducing overfitting and improving performance by dividing the parameters of a layer by the vocabulary size. The technique of parameter sharing in word2net involves dividing the parameters of a layer by the vocabulary size to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. This structure can be applied to any text corpus without requiring side information. When annotated with tags, parameter sharing can improve word embeddings by capturing semantic structures. However, it is still unclear how to utilize syntactic information for better word embeddings. The text discusses the challenge of capturing different meanings of tags in word embeddings. It proposes a method of incorporating tag information through parameter sharing in neural networks. This approach aims to improve word embeddings by considering the hierarchical nature of network representations. The text discusses incorporating tag information through parameter sharing in neural networks to improve word embeddings. This method reduces the number of parameters needed by sharing parameters between layers based on tag information. Incorporating tag information through parameter sharing in neural networks improves word embeddings by reducing the number of parameters needed. Different combinations are explored to show that word2net with information enhances performance. Semantic similarities between word networks are computed using a metric that accounts for neural network representations of words. The text discusses how neural networks parameterize functions and design a metric to measure the similarity of functions based on mapping similar inputs to similar outputs. It explains the process of evaluating neural networks on a set of inputs, comparing outputs, and using cosine distance to measure similarity.

Different model sizes and parameter sharing approaches were explored. Word2net without parameter sharing performs at least as good as other models. Word2net outperforms shallow models, with improved performance when using parameter sharing. Incorporating information with an augmented vocabulary of tagged words leads to poor performance for -/ and skip-gram. Word2net with parameter sharing provides the best predictions across all methods. In U.S. Senate speeches, skip-gram performs better than -/ and word2net without parameter sharing, but word2net with sharing offers the best predictions. Word2net demonstrates superior performance with parameter sharing, capturing latent semantics and leveraging syntactic information. Results show that word2net outperforms other models in capturing similarities between word networks trained on different datasets.

Additional results comparing word2net with skip-gram and other models are presented in TAB5 for the Wikipedia dataset. Word2net, a method using word networks to predict word occurrences, can benefit from part-of-speech parameter sharing. Skip-gram performs well without tags but is surpassed by word2net with parameter sharing. Word2vec is a widely used method for word vector representations, with choices in objectives and scalable algorithms. Negative sampling is highlighted for scalability. Bernoulli embeddings are compared to continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram objectives. Bernoulli embeddings are equivalent to negative sampling and related to skip-gram through Jensen's inequality. An unbiased estimate is used to compute the summation over negative examples, with downweighting zeros showing better practical results. Theoretical differences include a regularization term for embedding vectors in Bernoulli embeddings, which is not present in negative sampling. Bernoulli embeddings have a regularization term for embedding vectors, while negative sampling does not. In Bernoulli embeddings, negative samples are drawn at each iteration, whereas in negative sampling, samples are drawn once in advance. Despite this difference, both approaches show similar performance for large datasets. Negative sampling breaks the multi-class constraint, allowing for more efficient prediction of target words from context. Negative sampling breaks the multi-class constraint, modeling probabilities of individual entries of one-hot vectors representing words. The skip-gram objective is given by Eq. 11."
