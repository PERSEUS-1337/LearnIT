    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1808.4 of the Vehicle Code in California amends the confidentiality of home addresses for specific individuals, including the Attorney General, State Public Defender, Members of the Legislature, judges, district attorneys, public defenders, and certain attorneys and police dispatchers. Employees eligible for confidentiality of home addresses in California include nonsworn police dispatchers, child abuse investigators, peace officers, employees of correctional facilities, and nonsworn employees of law enforcement agencies who supervise inmates or have prisoners in their care. Employees eligible for confidentiality of home addresses in California include county counsels assigned to child abuse cases, investigators employed by the Department of Justice or county district attorney, city council members, board of supervisors members, federal prosecutors, criminal investigators, National Park Service Rangers, city enforcement officers enforcing Vehicle Code or municipal parking ordinances, trial court employees, psychiatric social workers employed by a county, and police or sheriff department employees designated by the Chief of Police or sheriff as being in a sensitive position. Employees eligible for confidentiality of home addresses in California include specific state employees in various classifications, as well as spouses or children of certain individuals, with exceptions for those convicted of crimes on parole or probation. Employees in California can request confidentiality for their spouse or child, but must declare if they have a criminal record on parole or probation. The home address of the listed person will not be disclosed except to specific entities like a court or law enforcement agency. A governmental agency can access confidential home addresses from department records if required by law. The address must be removed or obscured for public inspection. Following termination of office or employment, a confidential home address shall be withheld from public inspection for three years, unless the termination is due to a criminal offense. If termination is a result of a criminal complaint, the address will remain confidential during the appeal process and until exhaustion, after which confidentiality is at the discretion of the employing agency. Reinstatement to office or employment allows for the protections of this section. (3) A retired peace officer can request permanent confidentiality for their home address, while the surviving spouse or child can have their address withheld for three years after the officer's death. (4) The department must disclose the agency or court of the individual whose address is requested for confidentiality. A violation of disclosing the confidential home address of a peace officer, nonsworn employees, or their spouses/children resulting in bodily harm is a felony. Section 4150 of the Vehicle Code is amended to specify requirements for vehicle registration applications. The Vehicle Code requires vehicle registration applications to include owner's full name, address, driver's license number, county of residence, vehicle description, and any other necessary information for registration determination."
