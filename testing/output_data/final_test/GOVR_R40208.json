    "content": "In 2014, tensions between Vietnam and China escalated over territorial claims in the South China Sea, leading to increased cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam on maritime security. China's CNOOC moved an oil rig near Vietnam's coast, sparking clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese boats. The U.S. State Department issued a response to the situation. The U.S. State Department criticized China's deployment of an oil rig near Vietnam, calling it provocative and part of a pattern to advance territorial claims. The U.S. urged both countries to exercise restraint and remove their ships. The Obama Administration focuses on behavior rather than taking sides in territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Legislative initiatives like H.R. 4495 emphasize refraining from actions that escalate tensions in the region. The U.S. State Department criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, urging restraint and removal of ships. Legislative initiatives like S.Res. 167 condemn coercive tactics in disputed maritime areas and support U.S. military operations in the Western Pacific for freedom of navigation. Negotiations for a Code of Conduct between ASEAN and China began in 2013 amidst rising tensions. Progress on the ASEAN-China Code of Conduct has been difficult due to tensions and disagreements. The US and Vietnam have increased collaboration on security and maritime issues, with the US providing $18 million in assistance to enhance Vietnam's maritime security capacity. The US nominee for ambassador to Vietnam suggested expanding Vietnam's maritime awareness and capacity in dealing with South China Sea challenges. China's move to position an oil rig in disputed waters surprised many policymakers and observers, as Vietnam and Beijing had been expanding high-level ties. Despite agreements signed in 2011 and 2013 to manage maritime disputes, Vietnam values stability and friendship with China for economic development and security. Hanoi is cautious in its response to China's oil rig, avoiding actions that could provoke Beijing due to significant anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam. Peaceful protests have occurred, reflecting the tensions between the two countries. Vietnamese human rights activists organized protests at an oil rig, calling for change in Vietnam. Subsequently, violent unrest broke out in industrial areas, with thousands rioting and damaging foreign-owned factories. Reports suggest casualties, mostly at Taiwanese-owned factories employing Chinese nationals. Korean and Vietnamese factories were also affected. In response to violent unrest in industrial areas, Vietnamese authorities arrested hundreds of rioters. U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation has grown in recent years, including a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement signed in 2014. Three bills have been introduced to approve the U.S.-Vietnam nuclear cooperation agreement, with key details on the bills and the process for approval outlined. Key issues expected to be discussed in Congress include the strength of nonproliferation commitments in the agreement. In May 2014, Vietnam announced participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), a U.S.-led group to interdict shipments of weapons of mass destruction. Vietnamese officials previously hesitated due to PSI operating outside the UN system. Since 2010, the United States and Vietnam have strengthened their partnership, particularly in response to China's actions in the South China Sea. The Obama Administration has identified Vietnam as a key partner in their Asia-Pacific strategy, including efforts to promote maritime freedom and security. Additionally, Vietnam has been encouraged to participate in the Trans Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. Vietnam is a \"full partner\" in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations and is prioritizing cleaning up sites contaminated by Agent Orange. The US and Vietnam have signed agreements on nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation. Disagreements over Vietnam's human rights record are a major obstacle in their relationship. US interest in the relationship is driven by growing trade and investment flows. The relationship between the US and Vietnam includes growing trade and investment flows, a large population of Americans of Vietnamese descent, concerns over China's influence, and shared goals of promoting human rights and democracy. The US aims to open markets, counter China's regional influence, ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, and expand its influence in Southeast Asia through various policy instruments. Strategic concerns about China have become increasingly important in recent years. Since 2010, strategic concerns about China have played a larger role in the Obama Administration's U.S. policy towards Vietnam. Vietnam has pursued economic development, good relations with Southeast Asian neighbors, deepened ties with China, and improved relations with the United States as a counterbalance to Chinese influence. The United States' economic importance and great power status have influenced Vietnam's strategic decisions and domestic developments, such as the signing and ratification of a bilateral trade agreement in 2001. The landmark bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 2001 helped Vietnam break the logjam in economic reforms. Vietnamese policymakers seek to counter Chinese ambitions and preserve interests in the South China Sea by encouraging a sustained U.S. presence. Vietnam sees U.S. support as critical for its economy to expand and achieve industrialization by 2020. Vietnam aims to become an industrialized country by 2020 and sees securing greater access to the U.S. market as crucial for its economy. However, improving bilateral relations is limited by factors such as Hanoi's wariness of upsetting Beijing and U.S. scrutiny of Vietnam's human rights record. Concerns could be lessened if both countries perceive China as overly assertive in Southeast Asia. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about human rights incidents in Vietnam, leading to opposition on certain issues desired by Hanoi. Despite differences over human rights, relations between the two countries have improved overall. Vietnamese leaders are reluctant to change their treatment of dissenters or minority groups to advance relations with the United States. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about human rights incidents in Vietnam, leading to opposition on certain issues desired by Hanoi. Despite differences over human rights, relations between the two countries have improved overall. Congress has played a significant role in shaping bilateral interactions with Vietnam, highlighting human rights conditions and addressing \"legacy issues\" of the Vietnam War. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Members of Congress supported policies to improve relations with Vietnam. However, recent concerns about Vietnam's human rights record have led to a decrease in vocal support. U.S. and Vietnamese participation in TPP talks could influence bilateral relations, with Congress needing to approve implementing legislation. Congress may also consider a U.S.-Vietnam nuclear energy cooperation agreement in 2014. The U.S.-Vietnam nuclear energy cooperation agreement may be discussed by Congress, but the rules limit Congress' influence. The U.S. military involvement in Vietnam started in the 1960s and escalated until U.S. forces were withdrawn in 1973. Following the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973, the Vietnam War had claimed over 50,000 American lives and became increasingly unpopular. In 1973, a Paris Peace Agreement ended U.S. military involvement, leading Congress to reduce military and economic aid to South Vietnam. Diplomatic and economic relations between the U.S. and Vietnam were strained for over 15 years after North Vietnam's victory in 1975. Relations faced obstacles such as U.S. demands for Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia and the return of POW/MIAs. Following the end of the Vietnam War, Vietnam's actions negatively impacted U.S.-Vietnamese relations. Vietnam aligned with the Soviet Union, invaded Cambodia, and faced military pressure from China. The exodus of Vietnamese \"boat people\" also influenced U.S. policy towards Vietnam. In the mid- to late 1980s, Vietnam underwent economic reforms and sought to improve diplomatic relations. The VCP adopted a more pragmatic approach, implemented market-oriented reforms, and began withdrawing forces from Cambodia. U.S.-Vietnam cooperation on the POW/MIA issue improved, leading to a decision by the George H. W. Bush Administration to enhance relations with Hanoi. In April 1991, the United States laid out a \"road map\" for normalization with Vietnam. Later that year, Vietnam allowed the United States to open an office in Hanoi for POW/MIA affairs. President Clinton signaled the end of U.S. opposition to Vietnam receiving international financial assistance in 1993. In February 1994, the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam was lifted by President Clinton. Congress passed a resolution supporting the normalization of relations with Vietnam in 1994. Despite congressional concerns, President Clinton continued to advance U.S. relations with Vietnam. President Clinton advanced U.S. relations with Vietnam by appointing the first post-war ambassador in 1997 and signing the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement in 2000. The normalization process was facilitated by Vietnam's desire to improve relations, ongoing reform efforts, and cooperation on refugee issues. Clinton's visit in 2000 was the first by a U.S. President since 1969, marked by enthusiastic reception from ordinary Vietnamese and discussions on human rights and democratization. Progress towards normal bilateral relations continued under the George W. Bush Administration, despite concerns about Vietnam's human rights record. Congress ratified the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement in October 2001, which went into effect on December 10, 2001. This agreement granted Vietnam conditional normal trade relations, reducing U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam in exchange for market-liberalization measures. Hanoi agreed to market-liberalization measures, leading to Vietnam's permanent NTR status in 2007. The U.S. and Vietnam upgraded diplomatic relations, but some issues remain unresolved, such as compensation for Agent Orange victims. During the last decade, leaders in Hanoi and Washington sought to enhance their bilateral relationship through increased high-level visits. Annual summits were held during George W. Bush's second term to promote economic and political reforms in Vietnam. The Obama Administration further expanded high-level meetings, with exceptions until 2013 at the leaders' level. Despite multiple trips to Southeast Asia, a summit between the U.S. President and Vietnamese leaders did not occur in the first five years of Obama's presidency. President Obama did not visit Vietnam or meet with Vietnamese leaders in his first five years in office due to concerns about human rights conditions. However, in July 2013, he hosted a meeting with Vietnam's President Sang at the White House, marking the start of a bilateral \"comprehensive partnership\" that included increased high-level exchanges, TPP agreement conclusion, and discussions on new embassies. The two presidents discussed progress in TPP negotiations, maritime disputes in the South China Sea, Vietnam's human rights situation, people-to-people ties, and war legacy issues. President Obama agreed to visit Vietnam before the end of his term. Progress in creating an official partnership had stalled due to concerns about human rights and perceptions of closeness to China. The United States resisted Vietnam's push for a \"strategic partnership,\" citing concerns over human rights and closeness to China. Tensions between Vietnam and China have escalated over territorial claims in the South China Sea, with both countries taking actions to assert their claims. Vietnam has increased its presence in disputed waters, actively seeking bids for offshore oil and gas exploration since 2005. Both Vietnam and China have seized fishing boats and harassed ships in the area. Vietnam is seeking international support, particularly from the United States, to pressure China on its claims in the South China Sea. The Obama Administration increased involvement in the South China Sea disputes in 2010, emphasizing adherence to common principles like transparency, the rule of law, and freedom of navigation. Secretary of State Clinton stated that freedom of navigation is a U.S. national interest and opposed the use of force by any claimant. This was seen as a challenge to China's claims in the region. The Obama Administration's policy in the South China Sea disputes since 2010 has focused on working with Asian countries like Vietnam to address the issues in regional fora. China prefers to handle maritime security matters bilaterally and has objected to multilateral discussions. The U.S. has also upgraded defense ties with Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, through initiatives like the Lower Mekong Initiative. The Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) is a U.S.-led platform for promoting development and cooperation among Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It focuses on areas such as agriculture, connectivity, education, energy security, environment, water, and health. The group also aims to monitor and coordinate responses to dam construction in the Mekong region. The Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) has had five meetings, with the latest in July 2013 during Secretary Kerry's visit to Brunei for the ASEAN Regional Forum. Initially, LMI overlapped with existing U.S. aid programs but expanded with the creation of the Asia Pacific Strategic Engagement Initiative in July 2012. The first phase, LMI 2020, is a $50 million program coordinated by USAID in Bangkok, with the Obama Administration allocating $16.2 million for FY2014 and requesting $10.4 million for FY2015. The United States allocated $16.2 million for LMI programs in FY2014 and requested $10.4 million for FY2015. Economic ties between the U.S. and Vietnam have strengthened, with the U.S. being Vietnam's largest export market and a significant source of foreign direct investment. Vietnam has a trade deficit with the world but saw strong export growth in 2012 and 2013. U.S.-Vietnam trade reached nearly $30 billion in 2013, showing significant growth since the early 2000s. Since the early 2000s, U.S.-Vietnam trade has significantly increased, reaching nearly $30 billion in 2013. The growth in trade flows was driven by Vietnam's market-oriented reforms, resulting in growth in foreign-invested and privately owned sectors. Most of the increase in trade came from imports from Vietnam, particularly clothing items. Vietnam has become the second-largest source of imported clothing for the United States, after China, and is also a major source for footwear, furniture, and electrical machinery. Vietnam has applied for acceptance into the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and is in negotiations for a Bilateral Investment Treaty. The United States has expressed interest in closer economic relations with Vietnam, but requires changes in the legal, regulatory, and operating environment for a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) and Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to link Vietnam's entry into the GSP program to improvements in human rights and trafficking issues. Negotiations for a multilateral free trade agreement under the TPP with Vietnam face challenges due to its developing economy and government intervention. Vietnam is seeking greater access to the U.S. market through TPP talks, pushing for more liberal rules of origin for clothing and textiles. This move could open up a significant market for U.S. exports and investments, potentially accelerating economic reforms in Vietnam. Trade disputes with the U.S. include issues with clothing, catfish, Vietnam's \"non-market economy\" designation, and intellectual property rights protection. In 2008, the 110th Congress transferred catfish regulation from FDA to USDA due to increased imports of catfish-like fish from Vietnam. The Agricultural Act of 2014 confirmed this transfer and defined catfish to include basa and tra from Vietnam, leading to protests from the Vietnamese government. Bilateral trade disputes have not affected relations as of mid-2014. The United States has increased aid to Vietnam significantly since the normalization process began, with assistance rising from $1 million in 1991 to over $140 million in FY2011. The George W. Bush Administration raised aid to over $100 million by the late 2000s, making Vietnam one of the largest recipients of U.S. aid in East Asia. Aid levels declined in recent years due to reduced spending on HIV/AIDS and market-oriented reform programs. The U.S. has increased aid to Vietnam significantly since the normalization process began, with assistance rising to over $140 million in FY2011. The aid program has focused on health-related assistance, particularly HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. Some question the allocation of funds to Vietnam, which does not have a severe HIV/AIDS problem. Other U.S. assistance includes programs for economic reform, governance, combating trafficking, and de-mining. Congress has appropriated over $100 million for dioxin removal and related health care since 2007. Since 2007, Congress has allocated over $100 million for dioxin removal and health care services in Vietnam. The U.S. and Vietnam have educational exchange programs totaling around $10 million annually. Vietnam is an authoritarian state with extensive surveillance by government security organs. The Vietnamese Communist Party has allowed some personal and religious expression while selectively repressing perceived threats to its power. Since Vietnam's economic reforms in 1986, there has been a gradual loosening of restrictions allowing private enterprise and religious freedom. However, the government harshly cracks down on anti-government activities, intensifying suppression of dissent since 2007. The government selectively targets individuals and organizations calling for change, despite releasing some political prisoners in 2014. The Vietnamese government targets individuals and organizations advocating for democratic reforms and criticizing government policies, especially towards China. Bloggers and lawyers representing human rights activists are also targeted. Dissident groups have emerged since 2006, but analysts believe they pose no significant threat to the government. The government's crackdown may be due to concerns about growing public discontent. The Vietnamese government's intensified crackdown and stiffened response may be linked to public discontent over alleged corruption, land seizures, and economic conditions. Power struggles among top leaders and differences in human rights with the U.S. have not hindered overall cooperation. The situation sets a limit on potential accomplishments, but short-term cooperation continues. Criticism of Vietnam's human rights record has influenced the US Administration's decisions on arms sales and TPP negotiations. The Obama Administration's use of TPP negotiations to push for human rights reforms in Vietnam remains unclear. Vietnam's press, mostly controlled by government or party organizations, has shown more willingness to cover controversial stories like corruption allegations. However, journalists or publications crossing the line face retribution such as job loss, closure, fines, or imprisonment. The Vietnamese government targets journalists, bloggers, and lawyers who criticize its policies or have links to pro-democracy groups. Ethnic minorities make up the majority in certain regions of the country. In Vietnam, ethnic minorities in various regions face discrimination and repression, often due to clashes with government authorities over land seizures and religious beliefs. Corruption related to land issues is a significant problem, with protests against inappropriate land use being a common trigger for tensions. In Vietnam, the state owns land on behalf of the people, allowing residents and investors to buy and sell \"land-use rights.\" However, the government can reclaim land with low compensation, leading to tensions with minority groups. Government officials profit from seizing land used by these groups, causing discrimination and harassment. Efforts have been made to improve opportunities for minorities in the Central Highlands region, where abuses against the \"Montagnards\" have decreased since 2004 protests. Some human rights advocates criticize the U.S. government for not advocating enough for the release of imprisoned Montagnards in Vietnam and those seeking asylum in other countries. Montagnard Americans have faced restrictions and interrogation when visiting Vietnam. In the Northwest Highlands, protests by ethnic groups were forcibly suppressed in 2011. In 2011, Vietnamese authorities suppressed protests by ethnic Hmong in the Highlands. Reports of abuses against ethnic Khmer in the Mekong Delta peaked in 2007 and 2008. Buddhism is the dominant religion in Vietnam, followed by Roman Catholicism and other religious groups like Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Protestants. Most Vietnamese can practice their religion of choice within the laws, but the government closely monitors and regulates religious organizations. The constitution allows for religious freedom, but groups must be officially recognized or registered, leading to restrictions on some groups. The legal status of unofficial religious groups in Vietnam can lead to vulnerability to arrest and harassment. Human Rights Watch has reported harassment against unrecognized branches of various faiths, including the Cao Dai church, Hoa Hao Buddhist church, independent Protestant house churches, Khmer Krom Buddhist temples, and the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. Disputes with the government over land seizures for civic reasons or resale have been increasing, causing tensions between authorities and religious groups. Some religious figures in Vietnam, like Father Nguyen Van Ly, face official abuse for their political activism. Vietnam was designated a \"country of particular concern\" due to reports of harassment of ethnic minority Protestants and Buddhists. After negotiations with the Bush Administration, an agreement on religious freedom was reached with Hanoi agreeing to improve conditions. In May 2005, Vietnam reached an agreement on religious freedom to improve conditions for people of faith, particularly in the Central Highlands, avoiding sanctions associated with its CPC designation. Despite criticism from human rights groups, Vietnam was removed from the CPC list in 2006 due to positive steps taken by the government, including a decline in religious persecution and the release of religious prisoners. In 2006, Vietnam made efforts to improve religious freedom, release religious prisoners, and enact new laws. The U.S. removed Vietnam from the CPC list after the government released dissidents and promised to repeal a decree allowing detention without trial. However, concerns remain about ongoing abuses, leading some to call for Vietnam to be relisted as a CPC. Vietnam's involvement in TPP trade negotiations was also noted. Vietnam's participation in TPP trade negotiations and application to join the GSP program have raised concerns about labor conditions. The government's efforts to maintain one-party rule while adapting to social and economic changes explain the contradictory trends in Vietnam's labor rights regime. Despite improvements in labor laws, issues persist with local government enforcement and business compliance. The State Department's 2013 human rights report on Vietnam highlighted problems with suppression of independent labor unions and child labor. Vietnamese workers have the legal right to collective bargaining but are restricted from forming independent unions. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL) must organize unions within six months of new business establishments. Efforts to organize independent unions have been suppressed by the government, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of union leaders. This has hindered the improvement of labor rights in Vietnam. Restrictions on the right of association in Vietnam have hindered labor rights improvement. Despite limitations, progress has been made with the emergence of unofficial labor associations and a more assertive VGCL. Workers have gone on strike due to feeling unrepresented by official unions. The Vietnamese government took no action against these developments in the first half of 2013. In the first half of 2013, the Vietnamese government did not take action against over 150 illegal strikes. Vietnam is a hub for human trafficking, with workers sent overseas facing abuse and exploitation. Vietnamese workers have high debts due to recruitment fees, and the country has been designated as \"Tier 2\" or \"Tier 2 Watch List\" in the Trafficking in Persons Report since 2001. In 2012, Vietnam's tier ranking improved to \"Tier 2\" in the TIP report, maintained in 2013 and 2014. The country adopted a new law in 2011 to combat human trafficking, leading to its elevation. The 2014 report highlighted the government's efforts in prosecuting and convicting sex trafficking offenders. The Vietnam Human Rights Act aims to link U.S. assistance to Vietnam's human rights situation, proposing to cap assistance if substantial progress is not certified. Since the 107th Congress, legislative attempts have been made to address concerns about Vietnam's human rights record, including the 2012 trafficking law. The Vietnam Human Rights Act (H.R. 1897 / S. 1649) aims to link U.S. assistance to Vietnam's human rights situation by prohibiting increases in non-humanitarian aid unless improvements are certified or a waiver is issued. The bill exempts certain assistance programs and grants the President waiver authority. It also emphasizes maintaining Vietnamese language services and redesignating Vietnam as a country of particular concern for religious freedom. The Vietnam Human Rights Act (H.R. 1897 / S. 1649) aims to link U.S. assistance to Vietnam's human rights situation by prohibiting increases in non-humanitarian aid unless improvements are certified or a waiver is issued. The act requires the State Department to file an annual report to Congress on various items. Proponents argue for additional pressure on the Vietnamese government to improve its human rights record, while critics fear it could harm bilateral ties and weaken economic reformers in Vietnam. In the 1990s, military cooperation between the US and Vietnam focused on legacy issues from the Vietnam War. Efforts to deepen security relations began in the early 2000s, leading to agreements like IMET in 2005 and non-lethal defense item sales in 2007. The Defense Policy Dialogue was established in 2010 for direct military discussions. The U.S. and Vietnam have been deepening their military relationship through various activities such as joint naval engagements, repair of naval vessels, peacekeeping and search-and-rescue training, and sending Vietnamese officers to U.S. military institutions. Despite these efforts, progress in bilateral military ties has been slow. The United States-Vietnam military relationship has been progressing slowly, with Vietnamese officials cautious about alarming China. The US-Vietnam IMET agreement allows Vietnamese officers to receive English language training in the US. In 2007, the US modified ITAR to allow trade licenses for non-lethal defense items to Vietnam. FMF was provided to Vietnam for the first time in FY2009. The State Department licensed the export of $98.5 million of defense articles and $3.7 million of defense services to Vietnam from 2007-2010. In FY2009, the United States extended foreign military financing (FMF) to Vietnam for the first time. Most of the approved FMF has been spent on English training labs, spare parts for helicopters, and ship radios. In December 2013, the US announced $18 million in assistance to Vietnam, including five fast patrol vessels for maritime security. Vietnamese leaders have urged the US to lift restrictions on lethal weapons sales for normalized bilateral relations. Ted Osius, during his confirmation hearing to be Ambassador to Vietnam, mentioned that Vietnam's progress in improving human rights conditions could lead to exploring lifting the ban on lethal weapons sales. The legacy of Agent Orange from the Vietnam War remains unresolved, with significant damage to the people and environment of Vietnam. Between 1961 and 1971, 2.1 to 4.8 million Vietnamese were exposed to Agent Orange, causing serious health issues. The U.S. and Vietnam are now addressing this issue in bilateral discussions, with Congress allocating $110 million for dioxin removal and healthcare services in Da Nang since 2007. The Vietnamese government and people want the United States to do more to remove dioxin and help victims of Agent Orange. Estimates show that 5-7.8 million tons of ordnance were dropped on Vietnam during the war, with 800,000 tons of unexploded ordnance remaining. This has led to over 105,000 Vietnamese casualties from UXO since the war ended, with only a small percentage having access to rehabilitation programs. International donors have spent $8.7 million on clearance efforts. International donors, including the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, and Germany, have spent $8.7 million on clearance and related activities in Vietnam in 2012. The United States has provided significant funding for demining efforts and programs for war victims, with annual spending of $4.5 million on demining programs. Additionally, USAID's Leahy War Victims Fund has supported various programs for war victims in Vietnam since 1989. In December 2013, the United States and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on overcoming the effects of wartime ordnance in Vietnam. The Vietnamese government takes a leading role in demining efforts and funding, with a five-year plan approved in 2010 to clear UXO from 5,000 square kilometers in six provinces. International assistance could increase if Vietnam accedes to international treaties, establishes a civilian-led authority on UXO, and maintains a comprehensive database. U.S. NADR funding has supported capacity building for the Vietnam Bomb and Mine Action Center and creating a centralized database. Cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam has increased since the early 1990s, leading to efforts to account for nearly 700 missing U.S. service personnel from the Vietnam War era. The Vietnamese government has allowed access to archives and records related to POW/MIA cases, while the U.S. Defense Department has reciprocated by providing access to records and maps for the search for Vietnamese MIAs. Despite these efforts, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese are still missing from the Vietnam War. Vietnam has expressed interest in receiving U.S. help to locate and identify the remains of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers missing from the Vietnam War. In 2010, USAID and Vietnam's MOLISA agreed on a $1 million program for this purpose. Vietnamese leaders shifted to a more pragmatic approach in the mid-1980s with economic reforms under doi moi. In 1986, Vietnam implemented economic reforms under doi moi, giving farmers more control, cutting subsidies to state enterprises, and opening up to foreign direct investment. Political and social repression decreased, but human rights conditions worsened for dissenters. Factional battles among Vietnamese leaders intensified since 2011. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has been in office since 2006. Since the implementation of economic reforms in 1986, Vietnam has experienced significant growth, becoming a major exporter of rice and coffee. Poverty levels have decreased, and the government aims to achieve middle-income status by 2020. However, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung faces criticism for corruption allegations and economic challenges, with growth slowing after the 2007 global financial crisis. Following the global financial crisis of 2007, Vietnam's economy suffered due to its reliance on trade and foreign direct investment. Despite some stabilization in macro-economic conditions, concerns about economic stability persist. In 2013, Vietnam's real GDP grew by 5.4%, with inflation around 6%. Income and wealth disparity have increased, leading to discontent among the poor. Per capita GDP in 2013 was approximately $4,000. In 2013, Vietnam's GDP was around $4,000 on a purchasing power parity basis. The country faces challenges such as unprofitable state-owned enterprises, a weak banking sector, bureaucratic corruption, and energy demands growing by 15% annually in the early 2000s. Many SOEs are functionally bankrupt and require government subsidies to operate. Despite partial privatization efforts, the government still owns substantial stakes in most firms. Vietnam plans to build nuclear power plants to meet its growing energy demand, with projections indicating nuclear power could provide nearly a third of the country's electricity by 2050. Construction on the first plant in Ninh Thuan province was delayed until 2020, potentially pushing back completion to the mid-2020s. Vietnam's nuclear power program faced delays until 2020, possibly extending completion to the mid-2020s. Training staff for the program was a challenge. Two more reactors are planned in Vinh Hai, expected to be operational by 2026. Despite economic changes, political reforms in Vietnam have been slow, with the Communist Party maintaining a central role in governance. The Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) has major decision-making bodies like the Central Committee and the Politburo. Leadership positions include the VCP general secretary, prime minister, and president. Decision-making is based on consensus within the Politburo, leading to delays on contentious issues. The Party holds National Congresses every five years to discuss major policy issues. At the 11th Party Congress, Nguyen Phu Trong was selected as the VCP General Secretary, while Nguyen Tan Dung remained in the Politburo and as Prime Minister. Truong Tan Sang was chosen as Vietnam's next president, with Dung's power base believed to have been reduced. Trong and Sang are seen as assertive rivals. The National Assembly in Vietnam has increased its influence over the past decade, gaining the power to veto Cabinet appointments, revise legislation, and dismiss the president and prime minister. Despite the dominance of the VCP, the Assembly's growing authority raises questions about its impact on policymaking. The National Assembly in Vietnam has gained more power in recent years, including the ability to veto Cabinet appointments and dismiss top officials. The Communist Party carefully screens candidates for elections, and the latest elections were held in May 2011. Vietnam's relationship with China has been complex for centuries, with China ruling Vietnam for over 1,000 years until Vietnam gained independence in 939. Despite this, China's influence on Vietnamese culture persisted. In the 20th Century, Ming China's influence on Vietnamese culture and governance continued even after Vietnam gained independence. China supported Vietnamese communists in their fight against French colonial rule and later against South Vietnam and the United States. Tensions between China and Vietnam escalated in the 1970s due to territorial disputes and competition in Cambodia. The turning point came in late 1978 when Vietnam formed an alliance with the Soviet Union, leading to clashes with China. In early 1979, China attacked Vietnam in a brief but bloody border conflict, leading to severed relations. Vietnamese forces inflicted heavy casualties on Chinese troops. Despite continued military skirmishes in the 1980s, relations between the two countries improved in the 1990s. Currently, China is Vietnam's most important bilateral and trading partner, crucial for Vietnam's economic development and security. Vietnam's neighbor, China, is crucial for its economic development and security. Hanoi carefully considers Beijing's likely reaction before making diplomatic moves. Despite historical ties and economic partnership, Vietnam has growing concerns about China's expanding influence in Southeast Asia. This has led Vietnamese leaders to take steps to mitigate the impact on Vietnam. Vietnamese leaders have taken steps to reduce dependence on Chinese influence by strengthening relations with the United States and Japan, purchasing military equipment from Russia, and increasing defense budget. They must navigate carefully between Washington and Beijing to avoid any perceived threats. Vietnamese leaders are facing rising domestic criticism for being overly solicitous toward China due to a soaring trade deficit. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to environmental challenges such as water pollution, deforestation, and inadequate sewage treatment facilities. Vietnam faces environmental challenges including water pollution, deforestation, and inadequate sewage treatment facilities. Despite having environmental laws, enforcement is a problem. The country's vulnerability to storms and flooding in the central coastal region leads to significant asset losses annually. Balancing economic growth goals with environmental concerns remains a challenge, as growth often takes precedence over environmental regulations compliance. Vietnam faces environmental challenges such as water pollution and deforestation, with inadequate enforcement of environmental laws. The country is vulnerable to climate change effects due to its long coastline and low-lying coastal areas. Rising sea levels and increased precipitation worsen issues like salt-water intrusion and flooding, impacting poorer communities. Rapid economic growth has led to increased energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Vietnam's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption doubled between 2002 and 2011.
