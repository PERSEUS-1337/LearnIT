    "title": "SB 326",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges that penalty assessments have been used to fund programs that should be funded by broader financing mechanisms, which disproportionately affects individuals with lower incomes. It is crucial to ensure sufficient funding for emergency medical air transportation services for Medi-Cal beneficiaries and all individuals in California. The Legislature aims to find new funding sources for emergency medical air transportation services and stop relying on penalty assessments for funding. They plan to end the collection of penalty assessments by January 1, 2018, as per the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act. The Act defines terms like \"Department,\" \"Director,\" \"Provider,\" and \"Rotary wing.\" (5) \"Fixed wing\" refers to airplanes that generate lift through forward motion and have wings fixed to the fuselage.\n(6) \"Air mileage rate\" is the reimbursement rate for services provided by fixed-wing and rotary-wing providers.\n(c) (1) A $4 penalty is imposed for violations of the Vehicle Code or local ordinances, excluding parking offenses. The penalty imposed for violations of the Vehicle Code or local ordinances is in addition to the state penalty. The county or court collecting the fine must transfer the funds to the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund. The Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services. Moneys in the fund are used for administrative costs, offsetting Medi-Cal reimbursement rates, and augmenting emergency medical air transportation reimbursement payments through the Medi-Cal program. The department aims to secure federal matching funds from the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund to increase Medi-Cal reimbursement for emergency medical air transportation providers. The director is tasked with meeting with providers to determine the best distribution method, implementing it promptly, collaborating with providers on the methodology, and submitting any necessary state plan amendments or waiver requests. The director will seek federal approvals or waivers to implement the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund and increase Medi-Cal reimbursement for emergency medical air transportation services. The needs of providers will be considered in developing the methodology for distribution. Upon legislative appropriation, funds will be used to reimburse providers up to their normal charges. The department will increase Medi-Cal reimbursement for emergency medical air transportation services if funds in the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund cover the cost and no General Fund expense is incurred by the state. Penalties assessed under this section will end on January 1, 2018. Any penalties collected before this date will be distributed until June 30, 2019, after which any remaining funds in the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund will be transferred to the General Fund for Medi-Cal reimbursement for emergency medical air transportation. The department can implement this section without regulatory action through various instructions. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. Section 10752 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. The department must develop a funding plan by March 1, 2017, to ensure adequate reimbursement to emergency medical air transportation providers after penalty assessments end on January 1, 2018."
