The Civil Service Retirement System under title 5, United States Code, is amended to include definitions for \"agency\" and \"limited time appointee.\" The head of an agency in certain cases shall be determined as provided under subsection (j) or (k). The head of any agency may waive subsection (a) or (b) for an annuitant employed as a limited time appointee, with limitations on hours of service. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may establish regulations for this provision. The Office of Personnel Management may promulgate regulations for the administration of subsection (B), including standards for record maintenance, requiring organizations to provide records to ensure compliance, allowing alternative compliance periods, and other administrative provisions. The Office of Personnel Management may establish additional administrative requirements for the effective operation and compliance of subsections, while amendments are made to Section 8468 of title 5, United States Code, regarding the Federal Employee Retirement System. The term 'agency' includes Executive agencies, the United States Postal Service, the judicial branch, and certain employing authorities. A 'limited time appointee' is an annuitant appointed for a temporary period of 1 year or less. The head of an agency can waive certain provisions for annuitants employed as limited time appointees, but not for all annuitants. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may issue regulations for the administration of subsection (a) regarding the hours of service allowed for annuitants. These regulations can include standards for record-keeping and may require organizations to provide employment records. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may issue regulations for the administration of subsection (a) regarding annuitants' hours of service, including record-keeping standards and employment record requirements. Technical amendments are made to Section 1005(d)(2) of title 39, United States Code, by changing references from \"(l)(2)\" to \"(m)(2)\" and from \"(i)(2)\" to \"(j)(2)\"."
