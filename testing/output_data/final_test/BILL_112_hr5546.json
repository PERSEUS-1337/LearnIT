    "content": "The Act, known as the \"Relief for Educators To Adjust if Necessary Act\" or the \"RETAIN Act,\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide funding flexibility for states and high-need local educational agencies. This subpart may be cited as the 'State and Local Funding Flexibility Act'. The purpose of this subpart is to allow States and high-need local educational agencies flexibility in using Federal funds to support student achievement and prevent teacher layoffs. State educational agencies can use federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs in high-need local educational agencies by notifying the Secretary of their intention by June 1 each year. State educational agencies can use federal funds for various State activities under specific provisions, with limitations outlined in the subsection. State educational agencies can utilize federal funds for specific State activities under outlined limitations in the subsection, excluding funds reserved for required activities, allotment to local educational agencies, or technical assistance. The Secretary disburses the applicable funding for alternative uses to State educational agencies simultaneously with other funding disbursements. High-need local educational agencies can use federal funding to prevent teacher layoffs or staff terminations, notifying the State educational agency of their intention to do so by a specified date. The term \"applicable funding\" refers to funds provided for local activities under specific provisions of various titles and laws. Each State educational agency receiving applicable funding must disburse it to local educational agencies for alternative uses as specified in the Act, excluding funds reserved for required activities, allotment to eligible entities, or technical assistance. The State educational agency disburses applicable funding to high-need local educational agencies for alternative uses specified in the Act, excluding administrative costs. The State educational agency provides funding to high-need local educational agencies for specific purposes outlined in the Act, without exempting them from various requirements related to funding usage, civil rights, and school selection. The term 'high-need local educational agency' refers to an agency serving a significant number of low-income children or with specific teacher qualifications. The term 'other staff' excludes administrators or administrative personnel. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Subpart 2 provides funding flexibility for State and Local Educational Agencies through various sections such as short title, purpose, and flexibility to use Federal funds."
