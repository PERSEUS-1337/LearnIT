    "content": "The Act titled \"Middle-Income Savings and Investment Act of 1999\" exempts certain interest and dividend income from tax under section 116 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act excludes dividends from domestic corporations and interest from gross income, with limitations on the maximum amount excluded per taxable year. Certain dividends are also excluded, and the term \"interest\" is defined for this purpose. The term \"interest\" for tax purposes includes interest on deposits with banks, amounts paid on deposits by various financial institutions, and interest on evidences of indebtedness. The curr_chunk discusses various types of evidences of indebtedness issued by domestic corporations, including bonds, debentures, notes, and certificates. It also mentions interest on obligations of the United States, states, or political subdivisions, as well as interest attributable to participation shares in a trust established by a corporation. The curr_chunk discusses distributions from regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, as well as distributions by a trust to beneficiaries. Nonresident alien individuals may have limitations on exclusion. The curr_chunk discusses tax implications for nonresident alien individuals in relation to dividends and interest connected to US trade or business, as well as conforming amendments to the tax code. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the tax code regarding the exclusion of dividends and interest for individuals, common trust funds, and section 643. The amendments to the tax code include the redesignation of paragraph (7) to (8) in section 643, and the addition of a new subsection in section 854 regarding the treatment of dividends under section 116. The tax code specifies that dividends and interest received by a company will be treated as a dividend if they equal or exceed 75% of its gross income. If this does not apply, only a portion of the dividend will be considered based on the ratio of dividends and interest received to gross income. Gross income and interest received are reduced by deductions allowable under section 163. The tax code specifies that dividends and interest received by a company will be treated as a dividend if they equal or exceed 75% of its gross income. If this does not apply, only a portion of the dividend will be considered based on the ratio of dividends and interest received to gross income. Gross income and interest received are reduced by deductions allowable under section 163. Additionally, a regulated investment company's distribution designated as a dividend for exclusion under section 116 should not exceed the aggregate interest received for the taxable year. The company must notify shareholders in writing within 60 days after the close of the taxable year. The tax code specifies that dividends received from a real estate investment trust must meet certain requirements for exclusion under section 116 and deductions under section 243. Dividends from a real estate investment trust meeting specific requirements are not considered as dividends but treated as interest if certain conditions are met. The amount of dividend received is treated as interest based on the relationship between interest received and gross income. Adjustments to gross income and interest received are made by excluding net capital gain, deducting allowable deductions, and reducing gross income by certain taxes. The amendments made by section 857(b) define 'interest' and specify the notice requirements for real estate investment trusts. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
