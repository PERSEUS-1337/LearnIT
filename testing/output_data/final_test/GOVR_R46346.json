    "content": "The FMAP rate varies by state based on per capita income, with higher rates for lower income states and lower rates for higher income states. Rates range from 50% to 83%, with states receiving federal reimbursement based on their FMAP percentage. The formula is tied to each state's per capita personal income compared to the national average. The FMAP rate is determined by states' per capita income compared to the national average, with higher rates for lower income states and lower rates for higher income states. State responses to economic changes can affect the national economy, but the balancing of positive and negative changes usually results in only small annual percentage changes in U.S. per capita personal income. This leads to annual FMAP rate changes for states, with most changes being less than one percentage point but still significant in dollar amount. The FMAP rate is used to reimburse states for the federal share of Medicaid expenditures. The FMAP rate determines the federal share of Medicaid expenditures and is based on states' per capita income compared to the national average. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. It is also used to determine the federal share of other federal programs like foster care, adoption assistance, and Child Care Entitlement to States. The FMAP rate determines the federal share of Medicaid expenditures based on states' income compared to the national average. Exceptions exist for certain states, populations, and services. The E-FMAP rate is provided for CHIP services, calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. Medicaid expenditures are influenced by economic, demographic, and programmatic factors. During recessions, Medicaid enrollment and expenditures increase due to the rise in unemployment rates, while state revenues decline. This can strain state financing of Medicaid programs, especially with the continued growth in enrollment even after the recession ends. Reduced incomes from job loss or reduced hours can make individuals eligible for Medicaid during economic downturns. During economic downturns, job losses increase, especially among low-income workers, leading to more individuals eligible for Medicaid. Those experiencing reduced hours or job loss may lose access to employer-sponsored health insurance, potentially qualifying for COBRA continuation coverage, which can be costly. Some individuals may already be Medicaid eligible and have employer-sponsored health insurance. The increase in the cost of or loss of employer-sponsored health insurance during economic downturns may lead individuals to enroll in Medicaid. The ACA Medicaid expansion is expected to amplify the impact of a recession on Medicaid enrollment, which follows economic cycles. The U.S. Government Accountability Office analyzed federal Medicaid enrollment data during the 2001 recession. During the 2001 recession, national unemployment rose from 4.3% to 5.5%, increasing Medicaid enrollment by 2 million (5.6%). In the Great Recession, unemployment grew from 5.0% to 9.5%, with Medicaid enrollment rising by 4.3 million (9.7%). The ACA Medicaid expansion is expected to further impact Medicaid enrollment during recessions. The Medicaid expansion increased eligibility for nonelderly adults without dependent children. This expansion allows more adults to qualify for Medicaid during periods of high unemployment. The federal matching rate for the Medicaid expansion is 90%, higher than the regular FMAP rate, making it less of a burden on state budgets. The Medicaid expansion increased eligibility for nonelderly adults without dependent children, with a federal matching rate of 90%. During economic downturns, Medicaid enrollment growth can strain state budgets due to increased expenditures. Unemployment spikes lead to higher Medicaid enrollment and expenditures, impacting state tax revenue negatively. During the Great Recession, state tax revenues declined by 10.2%, varying from 1% to 23% across states. Medicaid, accounting for 20% of state general fund expenditures, faces challenges in financing during economic downturns with increasing enrollment and expenditures. During economic downturns, states may face budget pressures due to reduced tax revenues and increased Medicaid expenditures. This can lead to states increasing taxes, reducing expenditures (including for Medicaid), or both. In response to past recessions, states have frozen or reduced Medicaid provider payments, eliminated optional services, increased premiums, and raised copayments for prescription drugs. The impacts of recessions on Medicaid enrollment, expenditures, and state tax revenues have persisted even after the recessions officially ended. The impact of national recessions on states varies based on economic conditions, revenue structures, industries, and resources. Despite recessions officially ending, states continued to feel effects with high unemployment rates and Medicaid enrollment growth. Some states still felt recession effects in 2011 and 2012. Laws like JGTRRA have provided fiscal relief through temporary FMAP rate increases during recessions. During recessions, laws like JGTRRA and ARRA have provided fiscal relief through temporary FMAP rate increases. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act also increased FMAP rates to help states maintain their Medicaid programs during economic downturns. This allows states to use the state funding that would have been used for the state share of Medicaid for non-Medicaid purposes. The recession-related FMAP increases, including JGTRRA, ARRA, and FFCRA, had across-the-board increases to regular FMAP rates. Differences include varying percentage point increases, phase-out periods, and provisions like hold-harmless clauses. FFCRA's increase did not exclude certain Medicaid expenditures using the regular FMAP rate. The ARRA FMAP increase included an unemployment-related additional increase, while the JGTRRA and FFCRA FMAP increases did not. All three recession-related FMAP increases have requirements for states to qualify, such as maintaining Medicaid eligibility standards and not increasing local government contributions. The JGTRRA, ARRA, and FFCRA FMAP increases had varying requirements for states to contribute to Medicaid. JGTRRA provided relief for FY2003 and FY2004 with a $10 billion limit, increasing FMAP rates across the board by 2.95 percentage points. The JGTRRA FMAP increase raised rates by 2.95 percentage points for each state, excluding certain Medicaid payments. Hold-harmless provision prevented rate decline. States had to meet specific criteria to qualify for the increase. The JGTRRA FMAP increase raised rates by 2.95 percentage points for each state, excluding certain Medicaid payments. States had to meet specific criteria to qualify for the increase, including maintaining eligibility levels from September 2, 2003, and ensuring local governments did not contribute more than required. Additionally, territories received a 5.9% increase in federal Medicaid funding. The JGTRRA FMAP increase provided all states with a uniform increase, not based on need. States reported that this increase prevented cuts to Medicaid and state budgets. ARRA extended the FMAP rate increase, totaling $89 billion over nine quarters, with an additional $16.1 billion extension. The ARRA FMAP rate increase extended for 11 quarters, totaling $16.1 billion from October 2008 to June 2011. All states received a 6.2 percentage point increase in their regular FMAP rates, gradually decreasing to 1.2 percentage points in the last two quarters. States were protected from declines in their regular FMAP rates during the recession adjustment period. The ARRA FMAP rate increase lasted for 11 quarters, totaling $16.1 billion from October 2008 to June 2011. States received a 6.2 percentage point increase in their regular FMAP rates, gradually decreasing to 1.2 percentage points in the last two quarters. Territories had the option to choose between two different FMAP rate increase options. The temporary ARRA FMAP rate increase applied to most Medicaid expenditures, excluding certain Medicaid payments like DSH payments and E-FMAP matched payments. States had to meet specific requirements to receive ARRA FMAP rate increases, including maintaining Medicaid eligibility standards, prompt payment to providers, and not depositing funds into reserve funds. They also had to ensure local governments did not pay a larger percentage of nonfederal Medicaid expenditures. States had to meet specific requirements to receive ARRA FMAP rate increases, including maintaining Medicaid eligibility standards, prompt payment to providers, and not depositing funds into reserve funds. P.L. 111-226 added a requirement for states to certify their request and use of additional federal funds resulting from the temporary FMAP increase. FMAP rate increases reduced state funding needed for Medicaid services, allowing states to avoid cuts or use savings for various purposes beyond Medicaid. States used ARRA FMAP rate increases for purposes beyond Medicaid, such as closing budget shortfalls and stimulating the economy. The effects varied based on how the funds were used, with one study showing a positive effect on employment. The timing of the ARRA FMAP increase was considered better than previous increases. The ARRA FMAP increase was better timed and targeted than previous increases, beginning during the recession and including unemployment-related adjustments for certain states. FFCRA provides a 6.2 percentage point increase to the FMAP rate for all states, DC, and territories during the COVID-19 public health emergency period. States used ARRA FMAP rate increases for various purposes beyond Medicaid. The FFCRA provides a 6.2 percentage point increase to the FMAP rate for states, DC, and territories during the COVID-19 public health emergency period. To receive this increase, they must meet certain conditions related to Medicaid eligibility standards, coverage continuity, and COVID-19 testing and treatment coverage. Additionally, they cannot require local governments to fund a larger percentage of nonfederal Medicaid expenditures than previously required. The FFCRA FMAP increase applies to Medicaid state plan or Medicaid DSH payments, with exceptions for ACA Medicaid expansion, family planning, and home health services. It also applies to Community First Choice services and certain FMAP exceptions like breast and cervical cancer, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, and Money Follows the Person. Territories also receive increased federal Medicaid funding under FFCRA in FY2020 and FY2021. The FFCRA increases federal Medicaid funding for territories in FY2020 and FY2021 from $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, respectively. While not automatic, the FFCRA FMAP increase precedes an expected economic downturn, providing fiscal relief during times of recession and high unemployment rates. During economic downturns, states may see growth in unemployment leading to increased Medicaid enrollment and expenditures. Recession-related FMAP increases have similarities but also differences, such as hold-harmless provisions in JGTRRA and ARRA FMAP increases. The FMAP increases under the ARRA, JGTRRA, and FFCRA had varying impacts on states. The JGTRRA FMAP increase did not have additional requirements for states, unlike the ARRA and FFCRA increases. States noted that these increases provided fiscal relief, preventing cuts to Medicaid programs and state budgets. The JGTRRA FMAP increase was part of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The FMAP rates were increased by 2.95 percentage points for each state under JGTRRA and ARRA. The ARRA FMAP increase lasted from FY2009 to FY2011, providing temporary relief to states. Under the ARRA FMAP increases in June 2011, all states received a percentage point increase to their regular FMAP rates, with additional unemployment-related increases for states with certain unemployment rate increases. The increases phased down from 6.2 to 1.2 percentage points throughout FY2011. These increases were subject to specific requirements for states. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA; P.L. 116-127) provides a 6.2 percentage point increase to the FMAP rate for states, DC, and territories from January 1, 2020, until the end of the public health emergency period. See \"FFCRA FMAP Increase\" for details. The last day of the public health emergency period marks the end of the FFCRA FMAP increase. Refer to the \"FFCRA FMAP Increase\" section for state requirements. Table C-1 displays states' FY2020 FMAP rates and rates with the 6.2 percentage points added by FFCRA."
