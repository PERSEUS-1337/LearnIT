    "content": "The Navy's planned replacement for its Ticonderoga class cruisers is the CG(X) cruiser, emphasizing air defense and ballistic missile defense. It will feature a new radar for BMD operations, potentially more missile-launch tubes than the DDG-1000, and one 155mm Advanced Gun System. The Navy plans to procure 19 CG(X) ships, with the first expected in FY2011 and the second in FY2013. The shipbuilding plan includes building 17 more CG(X)s between FY2014 and FY2023. The Navy plans to build 17 more CG(X) cruisers between FY2014 and FY2023, with two CG(X)s per year from FY2015 to FY2021. The Navy is currently assessing design options for the CG(X) in the Maritime Air and Missile Defense of Joint Forces (MAMDJF) AOA study, with plans for reviews and milestones in the coming years. The Navy aims to base the CG(X) design on its new DDG-1000 destroyer. The Navy plans to base the CG(X) design on the DDG-1000 destroyer, with common hull mechanical and electrical components. The design variations include weapons systems and sensors, with potential for 60 to 70 percent commonality with the DDG-1000. The CG(X) design will have common hull components with the DDG-1000 destroyer, with variations in weapons systems and sensors. The differences between CG(X) and DDG-1000 will include radar arrays, communication apertures, Combat Information Center, and missile launchers. The unit procurement cost of CG(X) based on DDG-1000 design may be comparable. Placeholder figures for procurement in FY2011 and FY2013 are around $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion respectively. The Navy's plans for CG(X) procurement may be limited to one ship per year due to affordability concerns, potentially reducing the total number of ships from 19 to as few as 8. Concerns have been raised about the affordability and executability of the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan by the Congressional Budget Office and some Members of Congress. The Seapower and Expeditionary Forces subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee supports expanding nuclear propulsion to more Navy surface ships, starting with the CG(X). Design options for the CG(X) include conventionally powered ships based on existing hull designs or new designs, as well as nuclear-powered versions. The CG(X) design options include conventionally powered ships based on existing hull designs or new designs, as well as nuclear-powered versions. A CG(X) design based on the current DDG-51 hull could displace roughly 9,000 tons, while lengthening the hull with a mid-hull plug could result in a design displacing roughly 11,000 tons. This design would be about 24% smaller than the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 and similar in size to the California and Virginia class nuclear-powered cruisers from the 1960s and 1970s. Redesigning the deck house and lower decks of the DDG-51 hull would be necessary to accommodate new technologies and missile-launch tubes for BMD operations. The DDG-51 hull design, developed in the 1980s, may have limitations in accommodating new technologies like reducing crew size. A 9,000- to 11,000-ton CG(X) based on DDG-51 could cost more than 62% to 76% of a 14,500-ton DDG-1000-based CG(X). Production of a DDG-51-based CG(X) could benefit from prior DDG-51 production experience. A CG(X) based on the DDG-51 hull may have limitations in reducing crew size compared to the DDG-1000. The DDG-51 hull design is more detectible by radar due to its conventional flared shape. Larger ships like the DDG-1000 generally have more capability and larger payloads. A DDG-51-based CG(X) may be less capable than a 14,500-ton CG(X) due to space, weight, and energy requirements. A new-design hull for a CG(X) ship smaller than the DDG-1000 hull could displace 9,000 to 11,000 tons. The unit procurement cost might be similar to a DDG-51-based design, or slightly less if it incorporates advanced producibility features. A new-design hull for a CG(X) ship smaller than the DDG-1000 hull could displace 9,000 to 11,000 tons, potentially offering a smaller crew and lower costs. The hull could be conventional or a reduced-size version of the DDG-1000's tumblehome hull, making the ship stealthier. This design could be more capable than a DDG-51-based design but still less capable than a DDG-1000-based design. The Navy's preferred approach for the CG(X) ship is to accommodate a large and powerful BMD-capable radar in a 9,000 to 11,000-ton hull design, similar in size to the DDG-1000 or potentially larger. This option would have higher procurement costs but could benefit from production efficiencies and lower system integration costs by reusing elements of the DDG-1000 combat system. The Navy is considering a new ship design with a large BMD-capable radar in a 9,000 to 11,000-ton hull, potentially larger than the DDG-1000. This option would be more capable and cost-effective, offering more capability per dollar. Production costs may be higher than the previous option due to hull-design and system-integration costs. The Navy is considering a new ship design with a large BMD-capable radar in a 9,000 to 11,000-ton hull, potentially larger than the DDG-1000. Production costs may be higher than the previous option due to hull-design and system-integration costs. Adding a nuclear propulsion plant to any of the options could increase unit procurement cost by $600 million to $700 million. The fourth option could easily accommodate a modified version of a new nuclear propulsion plant developed for the Navy's new aircraft carriers. The Navy is considering a new ship design with a large BMD-capable radar in a 9,000 to 11,000-ton hull, potentially larger than the DDG-1000. Production costs may be higher due to hull-design and system-integration costs. Adding a nuclear propulsion plant could increase unit procurement cost by $600 million to $700 million. Designing a new nuclear propulsion plant would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, while modifying the Ford-class plant would cost less. A nuclear-powered ship would offer mobility advantages, such as long-distance transits at high speeds without refueling. Building the CG(X) as a nuclear-powered ship might require construction at different shipyards due to certification limitations. The Navy is considering building nuclear-powered ships with a large BMD-capable radar in a 9,000 to 11,000-ton hull. The decision on whether to procure fewer, more expensive and capable ships or more, less expensive and less capable ships is a recurring issue. Larger ships offer advantages in unit capability and capability per dollar, influencing the Navy's preference for larger designs. The Navy's preference for larger ship designs is influenced by the advantages in unit capability and capability per dollar. However, the issue of unit procurement affordability arises when procuring an insufficient quantity, potentially leading to a lack of ships in service when needed. Congress may question the consideration of design options other than those based on the DDG-1000 in the CG(X) AOA, the relative costs and capabilities of different options, and the tradeoff between unit capability and procurement cost. Additionally, the Navy's assessment of basic CG(X) design options may need to balance the value of sunk costs in designing the DDG-1000 hull. The House-reported version of the FY2008 defense authorization bill (H.R. 1585) proposes building cruisers and large Navy ships with nuclear power unless the Secretary of Defense deems it not in the national interest. This provision is discussed in the House Armed Services Committee's report on H.R. 1585."
