The Congress acknowledges the importance of America's activities in space, which have expanded human knowledge and consciousness. Various commissions have recognized space settlements as a long-term goal of the American space program. The American space program aims to explore and settle new areas, with long-term goals and strategic direction. Developing means to diversify the human population beyond Earth is essential due to planetary-scale risks. Space development will create new jobs, industries, technologies, and resources, enhancing national security and providing limitless opportunities. The establishment of space settlements will inspire future generations of Americans and is consistent with the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Adopting a pioneering orientation by NASA is crucial for enabling the establishment of space settlements. Amendments to the National Aeronautics and Space Act are proposed. The proposed amendments to the National Aeronautics and Space Act include a declaration by Congress to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit for the development of permanent space settlements. The proposed amendments to the National Aeronautics and Space Act aim to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit for the development of space settlements that can sustain their population economically and expand as needed. The proposed amendments aim to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit for the development of space settlements that can sustain their population economically and expand as needed. The community can expand its habitable real estate as international law permits. The Space Settlement Activities section (SEC. 4) aims to facilitate the development of space settlements that can sustain their population economically and expand as needed, in accordance with international law. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in cooperation with various entities, will gather information on space development and settlement for the advancement of a space economy and human settlements. Every two years, a report will be submitted on progress towards establishing human presence beyond low-Earth orbit for settlement and economic growth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will include metrics in its reports to measure progress towards space settlement and economic growth. These metrics may be updated over time to reflect changes in technology and trends. The President should review national space policy to include expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit for settlement and a thriving space economy."
