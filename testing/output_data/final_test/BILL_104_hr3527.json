    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NAFTA Infrastructure Responsibility Act of 1996\". Congress finds that the United States Customs Service collects over $600,000,000 per year in duties, fees, excise taxes, and fines from crossings of the border of the United States and Mexico. Despite increased revenues from the North American Free Trade Agreement, there has been a lack of federal funding for improving transportation facilities along the border to ensure the free and safe flow of trade. All 4 States along the border will require significant investments. The United States and Mexico need investments in highway infrastructure and motor carrier safety enforcement to reduce border delays and accommodate increased trade from NAFTA. Increased revenues should fund transportation improvements beyond regular federal funding. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions for terms like \"commercial motor vehicle,\" \"major Mexican border crossing facility,\" \"Mexican border crossing facility,\" \"Mexican border state,\" and \"minor Mexican border crossing facility\" are provided. (5) Minor Mexican border crossing facility defined as a facility used by less than 150,000 northbound commercial motor vehicles in a year. (6) NAFTA defined as the North American Free Trade Agreement. (7) Secretary defined as the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 4. DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR BORDER CONSTRUCTION AND CONGESTION RELIEF. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible recipients for transportation projects to relieve traffic congestion and improve motor carrier safety laws enforcement due to increased traffic from NAFTA implementation. Grants will also be given to Mexican border States and local governments to connect the National Highway System with Mexican border crossing facilities and upgrade existing connectors. The Secretary will provide grants to Mexican border States for commercial motor vehicle enforcement facilities within 60 miles of the US-Mexico border, apportioning funds based on the number of major border crossing facilities in each state. The Secretary will determine the allocation of grants to Mexican border States for commercial motor vehicle enforcement facilities based on the number of major and minor border crossing facilities in each state. The determinations will be made annually using the most recent calendar year information from the United States Customs Service. The United States Customs Service provides information. Grants will cover 80% of project costs. $100,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 1997-2002. SEC. 5. BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE INNOVATIVE FINANCING. The section aims to promote State infrastructure banks and advance transportation projects for international trade. It authorizes a federal line of credit for the Secretary to enter agreements with Mexican border. The section authorizes the Secretary to enter agreements with Mexican border States to provide lines of credit through infrastructure banks. The amount of credit for each State is based on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The Secretary can provide lines of credit through infrastructure banks to Mexican border States based on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The line of credit is available to support projects constructing Federal-aid highways for traffic resulting from NAFTA, with limitations on when it can be drawn. The infrastructure bank may not have enough funds to pay a claim related to a project, and third-party creditors of entities eligible for assistance from the bank cannot hold the Federal Government liable for any line of credit. The infrastructure bank provides funds for projects with a 30-year repayment period and interest based on US market rates. Funds for this program are separate from state apportionments and Mexican border states are defined as California, Arizona, New Mexico. The term 'border State' refers to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas."
