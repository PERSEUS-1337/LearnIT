Tax treatment of accelerated death benefits under life insurance contracts: Section 101 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subsection regarding the treatment of accelerated death benefits for terminally ill individuals. Any amount received under a life insurance contract for a terminally ill individual is treated as an amount paid upon the insured's death, subject to certain conditions. The text discusses the reduction in death benefit and cash surrender value of a life insurance contract due to a distribution, with guidelines on determining the present value of the reduction. The text outlines the interest rates used to compute the cash surrender value of a life insurance contract, including the 90-day Treasury bill yield and Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average. The text explains the rate used to calculate cash surrender values in a life insurance contract, along with special rules regarding liens imposed on the contract. Liens reduce the death benefit or cash surrender value, and interest rates may affect the amount received. The text defines a terminally ill individual as someone expected to die within 12 months, and exempts business-related policies from certain rules. The amendment regarding insurable interest applies to amounts received after the enactment date, with a delay in discount rules application. Issuance of a rider is not considered a material change for tax purposes. For tax purposes, issuing a qualified accelerated death benefit rider under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code will not be seen as a modification or material change to the contract. Tax treatment of companies issuing qualified accelerated death benefit riders will not be considered a modification or material change to the contract under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified Accelerated Death Benefit Riders are now treated as life insurance under the Internal Revenue Code. This includes any rider on a life insurance contract that provides for a distribution to an individual upon the insured becoming terminally ill. The amendments made by this section regarding Qualified Accelerated Death Benefit Riders will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
