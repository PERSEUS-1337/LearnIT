    "content": "The Act titled \"E. coli Traceability and Eradication Act\" is introduced. It includes an amendment to the Federal Meat Inspection Act to address the eradication of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in ground beef. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates testing for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli at slaughterhouses, processing establishments, and grinding facilities. Tests are required at various points including source trim production, receiving facilities, and final ground product. Lot size limitations and sampling protocols are established based on peer-reviewed, science-based requirements. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates testing for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli at establishments, with requirements including lot size limitations, sample size methodology, peer-reviewed sampling protocols, and validation standards for laboratory tests. Sampling protocols must be peer-reviewed every two years, and positive samples trigger further actions. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates investigation to identify the original source of contamination of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in establishments by collecting documentary evidence and analyzing meat samples from source lots. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates investigation to identify the original source of contamination of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in establishments by collecting documentary evidence and analyzing meat samples from source lots, which may include establishments that tested, processed, produced, or received the contaminated meat products. The Secretary of Agriculture mandates testing of each lot for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli before entry into commerce. Regulations require slaughterhouses to take corrective action and prevent reoccurrence. Independent testing facilities accredited by the establishment must be used for testing. Independent testing facility accredited by the Secretary must use methods equivalent to those used by the Secretary to test beef trimmings. The establishment must contract with the facility annually and cannot terminate the contract based on positive test results. Laboratories testing beef for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli must contract with a testing service to verify proficiency. Transmission of testing results must be delivered within 24 hours to designated individuals at slaughterhouses, processing establishments, or grinding facilities. Positive results must be reported to the Secretary electronically within 24 hours. Establishments with trim exceeding allowable positive results for 3 consecutive days or 10 instances per year will be listed as habitual violators. The Secretary will take regulatory action for non-compliance. Imported ground beef must meet the same requirements as domestic products. Verification is required for importation. To import into the US, foreign facilities must provide compliance certification to domestic slaughterhouses, processing, or grinding facilities. These domestic facilities must verify certification through secondary testing before processing into final ground beef products. This requirement applies to all slaughterhouses and processing establishments 180 days after the enactment of this section. Effective December 1, 2011, new regulations apply to slaughterhouses and processing establishments based on the amount of trim produced per day. The requirements vary depending on the volume of trim, with different thresholds for compliance. Effective December 1, 2013, new regulations apply to slaughterhouses, processing establishments, and grinding facilities regarding the production or grinding of trim or bench trim. The Secretary of Agriculture will award grants to assist entities in complying with the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Grants are limited to slaughterhouses and processing establishments producing not more than 1,000 pounds of trim per day. The grant program established under this section provides funding up to $10,000 for slaughterhouses and processing facilities that produce or grind not more than 1,000 pounds of trim per day. Grants are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and the program will end on December 1, 2013. SEC. 3. Protection against adulterated and contaminated meat or meat food products. Congress finds it essential to protect consumers by ensuring meat products are wholesome and free from contamination. Federal meat inspection programs must identify sources of adulteration and contamination in cases of positive lab samples or contaminated meat in commerce. The term 'enteric foodborne pathogen' refers to live bacteriological matter commonly found in animals for slaughter, such as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and salmonella, indicating unsanitary conditions at slaughter. 'Establishment' is defined as any person, firm, meat broker, renderer, or animal food manufacturer. Amendments to the Federal Meat Inspection Act aim to protect against adulterated and contaminated meat products. Protection against adulterated and contaminated meat or meat food products is addressed in Section 8. The Secretary shall implement sampling protocols to trace potential adulteration and contamination of meat products to their original sources. The Secretary shall implement sampling protocols to trace contamination in meat products back to the original source through the collection of documentary evidence and analysis of meat samples from identified lots. The Secretary will implement sampling protocols to trace contamination in meat products back to the original source by collecting documentary evidence and analyzing meat samples from identified lots, including those from the original product lot, intermediary processors or warehouses, the establishment that produced the original lot, and federally inspected or retail establishments that received part of the original lot. Certification by the onsite inspector is required at the time of sample collection. The Secretary will conduct tracing of adulterated and contaminated meat products by identifying all sites of contamination and the original source. Certification of complete and accurate documentation is required by the onsite inspector and establishment representative. If raw ground meat tests positive for adulteration or contamination, subsequent sampling is required at the establishment and its suppliers for 15 consecutive days."
