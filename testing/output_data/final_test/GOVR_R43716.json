    "content": "The INA's protections for refugees and asylees are based on the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. The Convention defines a refugee as someone with a well-founded fear of persecution for specific reasons, excluding those who have committed certain crimes. Nations party to the Convention cannot return refugees to their home country if they fear persecution and must grant them freedom of religion. The 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol define refugees as those fearing persecution, granting them rights like freedom of religion and work. The United States, while not a party to the Convention, signed the Protocol and enacted the Refugee Act of 1980 to align domestic law with its commitments. The Refugee Act of 1980 aligned US law with the Convention and Protocol, defining refugees as those outside their country due to persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It added Sections 207, 208, and 209 to the INA for refugee admissions, asylum granting, and status adjustment to LPRs, while also amending Section 243 to prevent the return of aliens to life-threatening countries. The prohibition on returning aliens to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened forms the basis for withholding of removal under Section 241 of the INA. The United States, as a party to the Protocol, is obligated to not remove aliens to a country where they would face persecution. Granting asylum is discretionary, and courts have upheld its denial. The granting of asylum is discretionary under the INA, and courts have upheld its denial even when the statutory definition of refugee is met. The United States' obligations to individual aliens are governed by domestic law, not international law. Aliens seeking asylum must prove they are \"refugees\" under the INA by showing persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. Terms like persecution and particular social group may have different interpretations in the Convention and Protocol compared to the INA. The meaning of terms like persecution and particular social group in the context of asylum is determined by the Board of Immigration Appeals through case-by-case adjudication. The courts generally defer to the BIA's interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the INA. Regulatory interpretations by the executive branch are also considered in defining well-founded fear for asylum seekers. The application of the INA's definition of refugee to aliens seeking asylum in the United States due to gang-related violence is complex, involving statutes, regulations, and court decisions. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the INA to require a protected ground to be a central reason for persecution. Federal courts may have differing opinions on interpretations advanced by the BIA. The BIA's interpretations on asylum applications can vary by jurisdiction, affecting how former gang members are considered as a social group. Persecution, a key aspect for refugees and asylees, is not defined by the Convention or INA but was outlined by the BIA in Matter of Laipenieks in 1983. Persecution is the infliction of harm or suffering, condemned by civilized governments, upon individuals who differ in a way considered offensive. This harm can be economic, deprivation of liberty, or other essentials of life. The distinction between persecution and other types of harm is based on the extreme nature of the harm inflicted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the denial of asylum to an alien who claimed harassment by gang members in Honduras, stating that the harm suffered did not rise to the level of persecution. The alien alleged being asked for money and to join the gang, but the court deemed these actions as \"minor assaults\" and \"ordinary criminal\" behavior. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also considered gang actions as \"ordinary criminal activity\" not rising to persecution levels in a 2013 case. The court emphasized the lack of targeting based on protected grounds and the importance of the nexus requirement in asylum cases. Instructed asylum officers to separate motivation analysis from harm evaluation to clarify decision basis. Harm must be connected to governmental action or inaction, showing government toleration or inability to control private party harm. BIA and courts may recognize harm as persecution if government tolerates or is unable to control private party actions. Reluctance to find inability or unwillingness based solely on ineffective efforts. In its 2005 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the denial of asylum to two brothers fleeing gang recruitment in Honduras, citing the government's efforts to control lawlessness. Similarly, the Seventh Circuit upheld the denial of asylum to a woman in Albania, stating that her situation involved criminal racketeering beyond government control, a departure from typical asylum grants based on government conduct. In gang-related cases, proving persecution can be challenging due to the prevalence of gang activity in society. Past persecution creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum eligibility. Otherwise, applicants must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of nationality or last habitual residence. The test for whether aliens have a well-founded fear of persecution is subjective and objective. It focuses on genuine fear of persecution as the primary motive for seeking asylum, with a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if they return to their country. The fear of persecution for asylum seekers is based on a \"reasonable possibility\" of suffering harm if they return to their home country, as established by the Supreme Court in INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca. This determination is not solely based on statistical probability but on whether a reasonable person in the alien's position would fear persecution. Federal courts generally defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals on defining a reasonable possibility of persecution. Courts have found that a one-in-ten chance of harm can constitute a reasonable possibility of persecution. In gang-related asylum cases, a well-founded fear of persecution may be lacking if past harms are not considered persecution. The genuineness of the alien's fear is usually not questioned, but it may be deemed unreasonable given the circumstances. The refugee definition requires a \"nexus\" between the harm or fear of harm and the alien's protected characteristics, such as race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership. Evidence must show that the persecutor is motivated by the victim's protected characteristic. The alien seeking asylum must show that their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group was a central reason for their persecution, as per the REAL ID Act of 2005. This central reason must be more than incidental or tangential to the harm they face. Mixed motive claims, where persecution is based on a protected characteristic along with other factors, can still be made post-REAL ID Act. Lack of nexus between persecution and a protected ground can lead to failure of gang-related asylum claims, as seen in court cases like Bueso-Avila v. Holder and Carreanza-Vargas v. Holder. The First Circuit's decision in Carreanza-Vargas v. Holder upheld the denial of asylum to an alien fearing persecution by gangs in El Salvador. The court noted that gangs were motivated by economic gain, not the alien's social group membership. Courts consider typical gang activities like robbery and extortion in asylum cases, where the refugee definition includes protected grounds such as race, religion, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. Gang-related asylum claims have been made based on these grounds. The executive branch and federal courts have been hesitant to consider \"particular social group\" as a broad category for asylum claims, despite it being a common ground for gang-related asylum claims. This reluctance has led to a development in the interpretation of the term over the years. The BIA has defined \"particular social group\" through case-by-case adjudication, starting with the 1985 Matter of Acosta decision. In this case, an alien's asylum claim was denied because the proposed group was not recognized under the INA. The BIA concluded that \"particular social group\" in the context of asylum claims should describe a group with a common, immutable characteristic, such as race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. This interpretation was based on the doctrine of eiusdem generis, which considers general words in conjunction with specific words to determine their meaning. The BIA defined \"particular social group\" for asylum claims as a group with a common, immutable characteristic like race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. The BIA's interpretation was considered reasonable by federal courts and the UNHCR, but the BIA revisited and reformulated the meaning in 2006. In 2006, the BIA redefined the meaning of a \"particular social group\" for asylum claims, emphasizing the requirement that the group be \"recognizable\" with \"social visibility.\" The BIA rejected the asylum application of noncriminal informants against the Cali drug cartel in Columbia, stating they do not constitute a particular social group under the INA. The BIA rejected the asylum application of noncriminal informants against the Cali drug cartel in Columbia, stating they do not constitute a particular social group under the INA due to lack of social visibility and particularity. The BIA applied social visibility and particularity requirements to siblings fleeing MS-13 persecution in El Salvador. The proposed group lacked recognition in Salvadoran society and well-defined boundaries, leading to the denial of asylum. The BIA's decision in Matter of C-A- and Matter of S-E-G- prompted varied responses, with some federal courts deferring to the revised interpretation of particular social group while others, like the Seventh Circuit, rejected the \"social visibility\" requirement. The Seventh Circuit found the change inconsistent with prior BIA decisions and questioned the lack of a principled reason for the shift. The Third Circuit rejected the particularity requirement in Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. Attorney General, viewing it as a reworked definition of the discredited 'social visibility' requirement. The UNHCR objected to the BIA's construction of particular social group in Matter of C-A- and Matter of S-E-G-, calling for the elimination of 'social visibility' and 'particularity' requirements. The UNHCR challenged the executive branch's interpretation of particular social group, leading to the BIA revisiting and revising the requirements in 2014. The BIA emphasized the need for common, immutable characteristics and introduced the concept of \"social distinction\" as recognition by society. The BIA emphasized the requirement of social distinction for a group to be considered a particular social group under the Act. This distinction does not necessarily require visibility but rather recognition by society. The BIA cited examples such as \"young tribal women opposed to female genital mutilation\" and \"homosexuals in Cuba\" as particular social groups. Despite differing from UNHCR guidelines, the BIA's approach aligns with that of the European Union. It remains to be seen how federal courts will interpret the BIA's \"social visibility\" requirement. The BIA's recent shift from \"social visibility\" to \"social distinction\" may make it harder for aliens to obtain asylum, requiring evidence of social recognition. This change has led to limited success in gang-related asylum claims, with social groups lacking visibility and particularity. The courts have generally deferred to the executive branch's interpretation of particular social groups for asylum claims. Proposed social groups include those resistant to gang recruitment, former gang members, witnesses against gangs, and their family members. Most courts have not recognized these groups as eligible for asylum, but they may be considered in some cases. Courts have generally deferred to the executive branch's interpretation of particular social groups for asylum claims, including those resistant to gang recruitment, former gang members, witnesses against gangs, and their family members. However, in some cases, courts have denied asylum based on the lack of social visibility and particularity of the proposed groups, as seen in the 2012 Mayorga-Vidal v. Holder case where asylum was denied to an alien claiming persecution for resisting gang recruitment. The U.S. Court of Appeals has deferred to the BIA's view that proposed social groups like \"youths who resist gang recruitment\" and \"El Salvadoran women between the ages of 12 and 25 who have resisted gang recruitment\" lack particularity and social visibility, leading to denial of asylum in certain cases. The BIA and federal courts have found that proposed social groups resisting gang recruitment lack social visibility, making it difficult to obtain asylum based on membership in such groups due to the pervasiveness of gang violence in certain societies. Gangs target individuals regardless of personal attributes, making it challenging to show that those targeted or resistant to recruitment are perceived as a distinct group by society. Granting asylum to former gang members is complex as some courts view them as a particular social group, while others argue it goes against the humanitarian purpose of asylum. For instance, the Sixth Circuit stated that gang membership is difficult to change, and the Seventh Circuit used similar reasoning in a previous case. The Seventh Circuit and other tribunals have differing views on whether former gang members can be considered a particular social group for asylum purposes. The Ninth Circuit excludes former gang members from this category to uphold the legislative purpose of the INA, while the First Circuit agrees that criminal organization affiliation should not be equated with membership in a social group. The BIA's decision in Matter of W-G-R- in 2014 could complicate asylum claims based on former gang membership, as it suggested that such claims may need further definition to qualify as a particular social group. The Ninth Circuit excludes former gang members from this category for asylum purposes, while the First Circuit agrees that criminal organization affiliation should not be considered membership in a social group. The Ninth Circuit excludes former gang members from qualifying as a particular social group for asylum purposes, while the First Circuit agrees that criminal organization affiliation should not be considered membership in a social group. In some cases, witnesses and informants against gangs have been recognized as comprising a particular social group, as seen in the Henriquiz-Rivas v. Holder case where asylum was granted to a group of individuals who testified against gang members in El Salvador. The BIA's decision in Matter of C-A- was seen as inconsistent with the view that witnesses against gangs could form a particular social group for asylum purposes. The majority emphasized the persecutor's perception in determining social group cognizability, while Judge Kozinski's dissent in Henriquiz-Rivas raised concerns about this approach. Judge Kozinski raised concerns about defining a social group based on visibility to persecutors, noting that groups of witnesses or informants have failed on nexus grounds. Family has been recognized as a prototypical example of a particular social group by the BIA. Some courts recognize families affected by gang violence as a social group for asylum purposes, while others are skeptical. The group must have a common characteristic and be socially visible. Recognition from society can be challenging unless the family is well-known. The \"nexus\" between the feared persecution and the social group is crucial. The INA prohibits granting asylum to aliens involved in persecution based on various grounds. This includes those convicted of serious crimes, posing a danger to the US, or with terrorist affiliations. Additionally, aliens firmly resettled in another country are also barred from asylum. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) prohibits granting asylum to aliens involved in persecution based on various grounds, including those convicted of aggravated felonies or crimes of violence. Former gang members may face significant issues due to these bars, while those not affiliated with gangs are generally less affected."
