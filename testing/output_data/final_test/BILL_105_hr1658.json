    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997\" and it amends the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. The Act is also known as the \"Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act\" and includes findings and purposes. The Congress finds that Atlantic striped bass are historically important for commercial and recreational purposes, but lack full management authority. The population faces risks of depletion due to various factors, making effective conservation measures necessary for national interest. The Congress aims to support interstate action for effective conservation and management of Atlantic striped bass. \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The Magnuson Act refers to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Atlantic striped bass are members of the species Morone saxatilis that migrate seaward of specific coastal waters. Coastal waters include all waters shoreward of the baseline and seaward to the exclusive economic zone for coastal states, and within the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia. The term 'coastal State' includes Pennsylvania, Atlantic Ocean bordering states north of South Carolina, the District of Columbia, and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. The 'Commission' refers to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The 'exclusive economic zone' is defined within the context. The term 'fishing' includes catching Atlantic striped bass, attempting to catch them, and any sea operations in support of these activities, excluding scientific research. 'Moratorium area' refers to coastal waters under a specific declaration. The term 'moratorium period' refers to the period when a moratorium is declared for a coastal State until appropriate action is taken. The term 'Plan' refers to a management plan for Atlantic striped bass. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Commerce or their designee, and 'Secretaries' refers to the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior or their designees. \"SEC. 4. Monitoring of implementation and enforcement by coastal states.\" During December of each fiscal year, the Commission determines if coastal States have fully implemented the Plan in their waters and if enforcement is satisfactory. Unsatisfactory enforcement may lead to adverse effects on Plan implementation. The Commission notifies Secretaries of any negative determinations. Upon receiving a negative determination from the Commission regarding a coastal State's compliance with the Plan, the Secretaries will jointly decide within 30 days whether the State is in compliance. If not, a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass will be declared in that State's coastal waters. During the moratorium, it is illegal to fish for or land Atlantic striped bass in the designated area. During a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass in a coastal State, it is prohibited to land lawfully harvested bass or fail to return them to the water if caught incidentally. Violators may face civil penalties or forfeitures under the Magnuson Act. Any equipment, stores, cargo, or fish obtained unlawfully may be subject to forfeiture under the Magnuson Act. Seized fish can be disposed of by court order or according to regulations. Enforcement of fishing moratoriums can be carried out by authorized individuals. The Magnuson Act allows for enforcement through agreements with other federal agencies and states, utilizing their personnel, equipment, and facilities. The Secretaries are authorized to issue regulations to implement this enforcement. SEC. 6. CONTINUING STUDIES OF STRIPED BASS POPULATIONS. The Secretaries will conduct ongoing studies of Atlantic striped bass stocks, including annual assessments, investigations into population fluctuations, and the effects of environmental factors on population dynamics. The Secretaries will conduct investigations on the interactions between Atlantic striped bass and other fish species, as well as the effects of predation and competition on the population. They will also conduct a socio-economic study in consultation with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and issue a report to Congress by September 30, 1998. Additionally, biennial reports will be made by the Secretaries. The Secretaries will make biennial reports to Congress and the Commission on the progress and findings of studies conducted on Atlantic striped bass, including recommendations for sustainable management. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1998-2000: $800,000 to the Secretary of Commerce and $250,000 to the Secretary of the Interior. Cooperative agreements can be made with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission or States for financial assistance. Public participation is required in the preparation of management plans and amendments. The Commission shall prepare management plans and amendments for Atlantic striped bass with public participation according to established standards. This applies to plans adopted after a 6-month period from the enactment of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997. Protection of striped bass in the Exclusive Economic Zone is also addressed. The Secretary will regulate fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the exclusive economic zone to ensure conservation and compliance with national standards and state regulations. Consultation with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission will be conducted for periodic review of regulations. The Secretary will regulate fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the exclusive economic zone in consultation with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and other government entities. Regulations will be periodically reviewed to ensure compliance with national standards. Provisions of the Magnuson Act regarding enforcement will apply to these regulations. SEC. 3. REPEALS. The Anadromous Fish Conservation Act, the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River Basin studies, and the Regulation of Fishing in Exclusive Economic Zone are repealed. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
