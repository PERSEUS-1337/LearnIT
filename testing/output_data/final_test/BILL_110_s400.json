    "content": "The Act titled \"Michelle's Law\" ensures coverage for dependent students on medically necessary leave of absence under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The term 'medically necessary leave of absence' refers to a leave from a postsecondary educational institution due to severe illness or injury, causing the dependent child to lose full-time student status. A group health plan must continue coverage for a dependent child on medically necessary leave of absence under Michelle's Law. The group health plan must continue coverage for a dependent child on medically necessary leave of absence. The child must be a dependent of a participant or beneficiary, 18 years or older, enrolled in the plan as of the first day of the leave, and a full-time student at a postsecondary educational institution. The group health plan must continue coverage for a dependent child on medically necessary leave of absence from a postsecondary educational institution. The child must provide certification from their attending physician to qualify for coverage. Breaks in the school semester will not disqualify the child from coverage. No additional coverage is provided beyond what is outlined in the section. The group health plan must continue coverage for a dependent child on medically necessary leave of absence from a postsecondary educational institution. If the employer changes group health plans during the leave but before the child's return, the new plan must offer coverage for dependent children as well. No additional coverage is provided beyond what the child was entitled to at the start of the leave. The text introduces a rebuttable presumption for dependent children's coverage in administrative or judicial proceedings. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are also discussed.
