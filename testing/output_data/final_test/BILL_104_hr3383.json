It also includes provisions for a Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The Act \"Minimum Wage Increase and Work Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 1996\" amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage.

The term 'qualified IV-A recipient' refers to an individual certified by a local agency as part of a family receiving assistance under a program for at least 9 months. The program provides aid under a State plan approved under the Social Security Act for needy families with minor children. The term 'qualified veteran' refers to a veteran certified by a local agency as part of a family receiving assistance under a IV-A program for at least 9 months or under a food stamp program for at least 3 months. A \"veteran\" is defined as an individual certified by a local agency as having served on active duty in the Armed Forces for more than 180 days or being discharged for a service-connected disability, and not having any extended active duty in the 60 days before the hiring date. The term 'qualified ex-felon' refers to an individual certified by a local agency as having been convicted of a felony, with a hiring date within 1 year of the conviction or release from prison, and belonging to a family with income in the preceding 6 months. The term 'high-risk youth' refers to individuals aged 18 to 25 living in an empowerment zone or enterprise. Their income must be 70% or less of the Bureau of Labor Statistics lower living standard. This determination is valid for 45 days. The term 'vocational rehabilitation referral' refers to individuals certified by a local agency as having a physical or mental disability that hinders employment and who have been referred to an employer. The term 'qualified summer youth employee' refers to individuals who perform services for an employer between May 1 and September 15, and are certified by a designated agency. Qualified summer youth employees must be certified by a designated local agency as being between the ages of 16 and 18 on the hiring date or May 1 of the calendar year, have not been employed by the employer in the 90 days prior to hiring, and have their primary residence in an empowerment zone or enterprise community. Special rules apply for determining the amount of credit for wages paid to these employees. The text discusses the requirements for qualifying as a summer youth employee and the special rules for calculating the credit for wages paid to them. The rules include specific timeframes for employment, substitution of periods, and limitations on the credit amount. The term 'hiring date' refers to the day an individual is hired by the employer. A 'designated local agency' is a State employment security agency established in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933. Special rules for certifications state that an individual must have certification from a designated local agency as a member of a targeted group before beginning work for the employer. The employer must complete a pre-screening notice for an individual before offering employment, and submit it to the designated local agency within 14 days of the individual starting work. The notice must be signed by both the employer and the individual under penalties of perjury. The pre-screening notice contains information provided by the individual for certification purposes. The employer must submit a pre-screening notice to the designated local agency within 14 days of the individual starting work. If an individual is incorrectly certified as a member of a targeted group based on false information provided by them, the certification will be revoked, and wages paid after the revocation notice will not be considered qualified wages. The designated local agency must provide a written explanation if they deny a request for certification of membership in a targeted group. The minimum employment period for individuals to be considered for certain benefits is either 180 days of employment or 500 hours of service performed for the employer. The term 'wages' excludes payments to individuals starting work for the employer after specific dates. Sections are amended to replace 'targeted jobs credit' with 'work opportunity credit'. The table and headings in part IV are amended to replace \"targeted jobs credit\" with \"work opportunity credit\". Technical amendments are made to sections 51(c) and 51(i). The effective date for these changes is for individuals starting work after December 31, 1996."
