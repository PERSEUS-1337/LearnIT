    "content": "President Obama signed Executive Order 13514 on October 5, 2009, to prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability in federal agencies. The order mandates setting emission reduction targets, increasing energy efficiency, reducing petroleum consumption, conserving water, and supporting sustainable communities. Federal agencies are also directed to leverage purchasing power for environmentally-responsible products. This is crucial as the federal government is the largest energy consumer in the U.S. economy, with numerous buildings, vehicles, and annual purchases. Executive Order 13514, signed by President Obama in 2009, prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability in federal agencies. The order mandates setting emission reduction targets, increasing energy efficiency, and supporting sustainable communities. Federal agencies must evaluate project performance based on economic and social benefits, with actions disclosed on federal websites. Military and national security activities are exempt from some requirements. The order establishes new goals, expands existing provisions, and extends compliance dates. The new Executive Order 13514, signed by President Obama in 2009, prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainability in federal agencies. It establishes new goals, expands existing provisions, and extends compliance dates without revoking any previous provisions. Previous administrations issued executive orders addressing energy and environmental goals of federal agencies, with EO 13423 replacing earlier orders and setting goals for environmental, energy, and transportation management. Executive Order 13514 directs federal agencies to establish GHG reduction targets for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by FY2020. Agencies must report targets to CEQ and OMB Director, considering energy efficiency, renewable energy use, and fossil fuel reduction. Agencies must also develop and implement a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan within 240 days of the order. The Executive Order requires agencies to establish GHG reduction targets for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by FY2020. Agencies must report targets to CEQ and OMB Director, and integrate the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan into strategic planning and budget processes. Each agency must designate a Senior Sustainability Officer accountable for achieving the goals. Within 15 months, agencies must report a comprehensive inventory of emissions to CEQ and OMB Director. EO 13423 did not have specific GHG reduction targets but aimed to improve energy efficiency. The new Executive Order 13514 sets a goal to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions by 30% through \"energy intensity\" by 2015. It requires federal agencies to measure their GHG footprint before recommending reduction strategies. Federal contractors may need to report GHG emissions, and water use efficiency goals are increased to reduce potable water consumption by 2% annually through FY2020. The new Executive Order 13514 aims to reduce potable water consumption by 2% annually through FY2020 for federal agencies, incorporating water reuse strategies and storm water management. This goal extends the deadline for meeting water efficiency targets and emphasizes the importance of improving water use efficiency to address water shortages in various regions. The Executive Order 13514 sets goals for pollution prevention and waste elimination, including diverting construction demolition debris and non-hazardous solid waste from landfill disposal to recycling or recovery operations. It also focuses on reducing toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials used by agencies. EO 13423 did not have specific quantitative goals but directed agencies to reduce the quantity of toxic chemicals and increase solid waste diversion. The Executive Order 13514 mandates federal agencies to implement cost-effective waste prevention and recycling programs, achieve zero net-energy use in new buildings by 2030, reduce energy, water, and material consumption in existing buildings, and prioritize sustainable site selection for federal buildings. It also emphasizes the use of innovative strategies like reflective or vegetated roofs to minimize water and energy consumption. Additionally, the order promotes the rehabilitation of historic buildings using best practices and technologies for long-term viability. The Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding requires at least 15% of each agency's federal building inventory to incorporate sustainable practices by the end of FY2015. The new order aims for zero net-energy buildings by incorporating solar photovoltaic technology and modular design for long-term productivity. New standards may be necessary to ensure functionality and safety in public buildings. To ensure full functionality and safety in public buildings, new standards may be required to consider human comfort and productivity levels in zero net-energy environments. Sustainable acquisition practices mandated by EO 13514 require 95% of new contracts to prioritize energy-efficient, water-efficient, biobased, environmentally-preferable, non-ozone depleting, recycled content, and non-toxic products and services. This includes a preference for Energy Star or FEMP-designated electronic equipment and best management practices for energy-efficient servers and federal data centers. The management practices for energy-efficient servers and federal data centers include environmentally sound disposal of excess electronics. Agency electronic products must enable power management, duplex printing, and other energy-efficient features. Sustainable acquisition practices require the use of biobased, environmentally preferable, and recycled content goods. Paper used by agencies must contain at least 30% post-consumer fiber. Electronic products must meet EPEAT and Energy Star requirements. Agencies are directed to extend the useful life of electronic equipment and use environmentally sound disposal practices. EO 13514 establishes an interagency committee to advise on the implementation of environmentally sound practices for disposing of electronic equipment. It creates a management structure similar to EO 13423, guiding federal agencies on meeting goals and holding them accountable. The committee will determine appropriate federal actions to achieve policy goals and facilitate each agency's Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP) implementation. The Sustainability Strategic Plan (SSP) for federal agencies, as directed by EO 13514, must be approved by the OMB Director and include agency activities, policies, and goals. It should consider environmental, economic, and social factors, evaluate projects based on return on investment, and assess climate change risks in the short and long term. The Department of Energy, in coordination with other federal agencies, is tasked with developing reporting recommendations and procedures. The Executive Order 13514 directs federal agencies to develop recommendations and procedures for reporting and accounting greenhouse gas emissions within 180 days. It emphasizes accuracy and consistency in quantifying emissions from all sources. Agencies can choose an alternative baseline if needed. The Department of Energy is directed to coordinate with other agencies to issue guidance on federal fleet management, including acquiring alternative fuel vehicles and reducing fleet petroleum use by 30% by 2020. The guidance under EO 13514 aims to improve fleet fuel economy and reduce fleet petroleum use by 30% by 2020. It involves coordinating with EPA and the Department of Defense to reduce scope 3 emissions from the supply of products and services to the federal government. Market-based solutions like ESPCs and UESCs can help federal agencies meet sustainability goals while conserving financial resources. Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Savings Contracts (UESCs) allow federal agencies to improve energy efficiency through private sector financing. An ESCO develops and installs energy improvements, with the federal agency repaying the capital expenditure over a maximum of 25 years from energy savings. ESPCs have been widely used in the federal sector, with approximately $2.3 billion invested through more than 460 contracts in 47 states. Facility managers can use the cash benefit of energy savings for other improvements or programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) views ESPCs as imposing a future financial obligation on the federal government. The CBO scores ESPCs as mandatory spending, reflecting future commitments to appropriations. GAO suggests upfront funding could achieve benefits similar to ESPCs, but agencies often lack sufficient funds. UESCs offer energy efficiency improvements with the utility recovering costs from customer rates. The utility benefits from reducing customer energy demand, increasing spare capacity for peak periods. Facility managers can stipulate terms for energy cost savings. EO 13514 requires federal agencies to assess environmental and social impacts for sustainability. Sustainability definition from EO 13423 is maintained without private sector discussion. EO 13514 prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Federal agencies are required to reduce energy consumption and fossil fuel use, considering potential impacts on missions and technological advancements. The mandate to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions may lead to telecommuting for employees and upgrades in security and communication equipment. CEQ and OMB will approve agency recommendations for achieving goals. The federal actions that agencies may employ are overseen by CEQ and OMB, who weigh mission criticality and potential conflicts between priorities. For example, increased electricity demand for electric vehicles could impact water-use goals and GHG emissions. The Steering Committee addresses conflicts and impacts on other agencies, focusing on resolving issues. Executive Order 13423, signed by President George W. Bush, emphasizes strengthening federal environmental, energy, and transportation management. President George W. Bush revoked earlier executive orders on federal agencies' energy and environmental management, consolidating and strengthening goals, practices, and reporting requirements. Executive Order 13423 implemented provisions of the 2005 Energy Policy Act, defining energy efficiency objectives for federal agencies. Executive Order 13423, under the Bush Administration, mandated federal agencies to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It set specific energy reduction targets for new construction and renovations, and directed agencies to meet objectives outlined in the Sustainable Buildings MOU. The MOU called for new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient than industry standards. The Sustainable Buildings MOU required new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient than industry standards and renovations to be 20% more efficient than a 2003 baseline. Federal agencies were encouraged to incorporate sustainable practices and dispose of unneeded assets. Bush's EO 13423 focused on energy efficiency but did not have a specific greenhouse gas reduction target. EO 13423 required federal agencies to meet renewable energy requirements, with at least half coming from new sources. Non-electric renewable energy could also be used, but not towards the electricity requirement. Credits for renewable energy purchases phased out starting in FY2008. EO 13423 mandated federal agencies to meet renewable energy requirements, with half from new sources. Credits for renewable energy purchases phased out by FY2008 and reduced to zero by FY2011. Agencies had to report annually to the President, with guidance from OMB Circular No. A-11 and a 2008 DOE memorandum for detailed reporting."
