    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Combined Sewer Overflow Control and Partnership Act of 1999\". It addresses combined sewer overflows. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require permits, orders, and decrees for discharges from combined storm and sanitary sewers to conform to the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy signed in 1994. The term of the permit, order, or decree can be issued by the Administrator or the State, regardless of compliance schedules or permit limitations. The permit, order, or decree for discharge from combined storm and sanitary sewers must include a compliance schedule not exceeding 15 years, with a possibility of extension if the owner demonstrates satisfaction. The compliance schedule for discharge from combined storm and sanitary sewers must demonstrate reasonable progress towards compliance with a long-term plan under the Control Policy. Compliance within 15 years may not be economically feasible for the owner, or a longer period may be deemed appropriate by the Administrator or the State. No permit, order, or decree should require compliance with water quality-based requirements in a long-term plan. The long-term control plan under the Control Policy must meet water quality standards and consider site-specific wet weather impacts of combined sewer overflows. Reviews may be conducted on a watershed basis when appropriate. The Administrator will develop guidance for water quality and designated use reviews by March 15, 2000, as recommended by H. Rept. No. 105-769. Grants may be provided for the planning, design, and construction of facilities for stormwater management. The Administrator will develop guidance for water quality and designated use reviews by March 15, 2000, as recommended by H. Rept. No. 105-769. Grants may be provided for the planning, design, and construction of facilities for stormwater management. The Federal share of the cost of activities for intercepting, transporting, controlling, or treating combined storm and sanitary sewer flows shall be at least 55 percent as determined by the Administrator. The non-Federal share may include public and private funds and in-kind services. Reports on recommended funding levels for the following fiscal years must be submitted to Congress every two years starting from January 1, 2004. Authorization of appropriations for activities related to combined storm and sanitary sewer flows: $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $1,000,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004."
