The \"Compassionate Care Act of 1999\" mandates that healthcare facilities receiving federal funds must protect residents from abuse and restraints, which can only be used for safety reasons with a physician's written order specifying the duration. The \"Compassionate Care Act of 1999\" requires healthcare facilities to protect residents from abuse and restraints. Restraints can only be used with a physician's written order specifying the duration and circumstances, excluding emergency situations. Chemical restraints involve psychopharmacologic drugs for discipline or convenience, while physical restraints restrict movement for the same reasons. Seclusion is defined as separating a resident from the facility's general population for discipline or convenience, preventing them from returning when desired, and not for treating a medical symptom. This is in accordance with the \"Compassionate Care Act of 1999\" which regulates the use of restraints in healthcare facilities. \"SEC. 582. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\" The Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 requires facilities to notify the appropriate system of each death within 7 days, including the resident's name and circumstances of death.
