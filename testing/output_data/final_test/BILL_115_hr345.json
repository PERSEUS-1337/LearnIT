The \"Stop Foreign Influence Act\" amends Section 207 of title 18, United States Code, to add restrictions on lobbying for countries of concern to influence decision-makers in government positions. Positions subject to restriction include the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and covered appointee positions. An individual serves in a 'covered appointee position' if appointed by the President with Senate consent, as an active duty officer in a high rank, or in specific positions like Deputy Director of National Intelligence. Definitions for key positions within the intelligence community are provided, including Deputy Director of the CIA, Associate Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National Clandestine Service, and Chief of Station for the CIA at an embassy or consulate. The term 'Executive agency' is defined as per section 105 of title 5, encompassing the Executive Office of the President. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms related to individuals serving in positions within the intelligence community, including the meaning of 'Member of Congress' and 'country of particular concern' as designated under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. The curr_chunk amends a law regarding individuals leaving positions within the intelligence community, applying to those connected to governments of specific countries. The amendment is effective for individuals leaving positions covered by the law after the enactment date of the Act. The amendment eliminates the 20-percent exemption for former presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, and other executive branch officers engaging in lobbying on behalf of countries of particular concern. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to redefine a lobbyist as an individual who is compensated for services involving more than one lobbying contact, with an exception for those whose lobbying activities make up less than 20 percent of their services to a client over a 3-month period.
