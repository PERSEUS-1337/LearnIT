    "content": "In the United States, the removal of unauthorized aliens and those who violate their admission conditions is crucial for immigration enforcement. This issue is a key policy concern for Congress and a topic of debate in immigration reform discussions. In 2012, there were an estimated 11.4 million unauthorized aliens in the US, with over 600,000 foreign nationals repatriated in FY2013. In FY2013, over 600,000 foreign nationals were repatriated from the United States, with about 440,000 formal removals. The Immigration and Nationality Act grants authority to DHS and DOJ to remove certain aliens based on inadmissibility or deportability. The IIRIRA of 1996 established new mechanisms for removing aliens who violate immigration laws. The Immigration and Nationality Act grants authority to DHS and DOJ to remove certain aliens based on inadmissibility or deportability. Different processes are used based on an alien's immigration status and activities. Lawful permanent residents go through the standard removal process, while arriving aliens or those who committed specified criminal offenses may face streamlined removal processes like reinstatement of removal or expedited removal of criminal aliens. This report outlines the statutory framework for removal, describes the standard removal process, streamlined forms of removal, and alternative forms of removal exempting aliens from certain penalties. The report discusses exemptions for aliens from penalties associated with formal removal, recent trends in removals and returns, and potential relief from removal. It does not provide legal analysis on court cases related to removal or discuss how removable foreign nationals are identified and located. The Immigration and Nationality Act identifies reasons for removal based on inadmissibility or deportability. Prior to the IIRIRA, the Act included provisions for the exclusion of ineligible aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act includes provisions for the exclusion and deportation of aliens, creating grounds for removal based on inadmissibility or deportability. The IIRIRA established a single proceeding for removable aliens, with separate grounds for removal for those who have not been admitted and those who have been admitted legally. The grounds for inadmissibility and deportability are similar but not identical. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines grounds for removal based on inadmissibility or deportability, with procedures for making such determinations and conditions for waivers. DHS officials have discretion in pursuing removal orders, and some aliens may be eligible for relief. However, certain grounds like criminal or terrorist activities may render aliens ineligible for relief and subject to streamlined removal processes. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines grounds for removal based on inadmissibility or deportability, with procedures for making such determinations and conditions for waivers. Certain individuals, such as those with criminal offenses or national security concerns, may be subject to streamlined removal processes if they have not been lawfully admitted to the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act specifies grounds for deportation, including violations of immigration status, criminal offenses, failure to register, security risks, becoming a public charge, and unlawful voting. INA \u00a7241 outlines the consequences of a removal order, requiring aliens to depart the United States. Aliens under a final order of removal must depart the United States within 90 days and may be detained until removal. INA \u00a7241 mandates that aliens under a removal order be detained until they are removed from the country. After removal, aliens are inadmissible to the US for at least five years. The length of inadmissibility for aliens is determined by the reason for removal and the type of removal process used. It ranges from five years to indefinite, depending on the circumstances. Removal proceedings are civil proceedings, and aliens generally do not have the right to appointed counsel. Congress can pass legislation that imposes immigration consequences retroactively. Certain DHS personnel may initiate a removal process against an alien by presenting a notice to appear (NTA) outlining the INA provisions violated. Foreign nationals may be detained during removal proceedings, with some subject to mandatory detention. Those not mandatorily detained may be released on bond or recognizance. Eligible aliens can request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge to lower or obtain bond. During the hearing, the alien must prove they are not a flight risk or danger to society. Bond hearings are crucial in immigration proceedings. The standard removal process under INA \u00a7240 is a trial-like proceeding where DHS presents the case for removal, and an immigration judge determines if the alien should be removed. Aliens may concede removability or undergo streamlined removal procedures with limited relief opportunities. The standard removal process is a civil administrative proceeding where an immigration judge determines if an alien is removable. Relief from removal may be granted during the proceeding, and decisions are subject to review. An alien who fails to appear for a removal hearing can be removed in absentia and may face inadmissibility and ineligibility for relief for a certain period. Cases can be decided at the preliminary hearing stage or set for an individual merits hearing. During the individual merits hearing, the government's attorney tries to prove charges on the NTA. The judge rules on the foreign national's removability and eligibility for relief. Appeals can be made to the BIA and then to a federal court. INA \u00a7240(d) allows for a removal order without a standard proceeding if the alien concedes removability. DHS approval is required for a detailed form submission. In 1996, Congress amended the INA to establish streamlined removal procedures with limited judicial review. These procedures have led to a higher percentage of total removals and limited relief options for aliens. Expedited removal allows for removal without proper documentation or for committing fraud. Expedited removal under INA \u00a7235(b) allows for the removal of aliens without proper documentation or for committing fraud, without further hearings or review, unless the alien intends to apply for asylum. Aliens from certain countries like Cuba are excluded from expedited removal, and unaccompanied minors are only placed in expedited removal in limited circumstances. Detention is required until removal, with exceptions for medical emergencies or law enforcement purposes. Expedited removal is applied to aliens who have not been admitted or paroled into the United States and cannot prove continuous presence for two years. It is also used for those encountered within 100 air miles of the U.S. international land border without admission or parole. Aliens in expedited removal can request asylum and undergo a \"credible fear\" hearing to determine the validity of their claim. Aliens who pass the credible fear hearing are placed into standard removal proceedings under INA \u00a7240. Those with negative determinations can request an immigration judge review. Those convicted of certain crimes face bars on relief and accelerated removal. Criminal aliens are subject to mandatory detention. Removal on criminal grounds can result in reentry bars ranging from 10 years to indefinite. INA \u00a7238(a)(1) allows for removal proceedings for aliens convicted of certain crimes to be conducted at federal, state, and local correctional facilities to expedite removal after completing their criminal sentence. INA \u00a7238(b) authorizes the government to deport certain noncitizens convicted of aggravated felonies without a hearing before an immigration judge, but they are entitled to notice of charges and an opportunity to rebut them. Foreign nationals convicted of aggravated felonies can be removed from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge. They are entitled to notice of charges, an opportunity to rebut them, and legal counsel at no cost to the government. Reinstatement of a previous removal order can occur if a foreign national reenters the U.S. illegally after being removed or leaving voluntarily. This reinstatement is not reviewable by an immigration judge, and the individual is ineligible for most forms of relief from removal. Until FY2013, aliens apprehended along the Southwest border were not subject to standard removal procedures. Instead, they were allowed to undergo voluntary departure or withdraw their applications. Voluntary departure is considered a type of relief from removal as it does not carry the consequences of a formal removal order. Some view voluntary departure as a form of relief from removal, as it avoids certain consequences like time bars for reentry or criminal penalties. However, those granted voluntary departure cannot stay in the US for an extended period. The INA allows for voluntary departure before or at the conclusion of removal proceedings, with different requirements and restrictions. Regulations have established three periods for seeking voluntary departure and set conditions for each. Voluntary departure can be requested before or at the end of removal proceedings. Aliens convicted of aggravated felonies or on terrorist grounds are not eligible. Those who fail to depart within the specified time are ineligible for 10 years. It is available to aliens from contiguous territories at the border, and costs less than most removal procedures. DHS CBP inspectors can allow aliens to withdraw their applications for admission at a point of entry. The government may permit an applicant to withdraw their application for admission to the United States and depart immediately without facing a five-year reentry bar. This decision must be voluntary and in the best interest of justice. The alien must have the intent and means to depart immediately. If the application is withdrawn, the alien must be detained until departure. There are two sets of statistics regarding removals and returns of aliens. The government allows applicants to withdraw their application for admission to the US and depart immediately without a reentry bar. Two sets of statistics on removals and returns of aliens exist, one from DHS' Office of Immigration Statistics and another from ICE. Both sets show an increase in total removals, driven by expedited removal processes and a decrease in returns. ICE provides data on the grounds for removal, not captured in OIS data. The decrease in returns is likely due to a policy change placing more aliens in removal processes rather than allowing them to withdraw their applications. Since FY2011, the number of removals has surpassed returns, with removals increasing significantly due to changes in IIRIRA that expanded grounds for removal. The number of removals of aliens increased significantly after FY2002, possibly due to enforcement efforts post-9/11 and increased funding for immigration enforcement. The number of removals remained stable between FY2009 and FY2011, then increased again until FY2013 before declining. Funding for immigration enforcement increased during this period, with the highest number of removals occurring in FY2013. The number of returns has fluctuated over the past 25 years and is currently at its lowest level since the late 1960s. Returns are closely tied to border patrol apprehensions, with a divergence between the two since FY2012 possibly due to a rise in apprehensions of individuals from countries other than Mexico. Additionally, CBP has focused on \"high consequence\" enforcement for unauthorized Mexicans apprehended at the border. Since 2005, CBP has limited voluntary returns for unauthorized Mexicans apprehended at the border in favor of formal removals and criminal charges. The number of returns exceeded 1 million persons a year between FY1997 and FY2006 but has steadily decreased since FY2004 to a low of 162,814 in FY2014. FY2011 marked the first year since FY1941 that the number of returns was less than removals. Removal proceedings under INA \u00a7240 are the exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien should be removed from the United States. The number of removals of aliens from the United States has fluctuated over the years. OIS data shows a significant increase in removals between FY2002 and FY2012, with a peak in FY2013. ICE data presents a slightly different perspective, showing a threefold increase in removals between FY2002 and FY2012, with decreases in FY2013 and FY2014. The largest proportional increases in removals occurred between FY2005 and FY2008. Between FY2007 and FY2008, removals increased by 27%. However, between FY2012 and FY2014, removals decreased by 23%, reaching the lowest level since FY2007. ICE was responsible for the majority of removals between FY2007 and FY2012, but this changed in FY2013 and FY2014. The decline in removals in FY2013 and FY2014 was due to a decrease in removals by ICE. Both OIS and ICE data show a trend towards more streamlined removal processes and fewer removals processed by immigration courts. Overall, all types of removals increased between FY2004 and FY2013. The numbers of expedited removals of arriving aliens and reinstatements have significantly increased since FY2004, reaching their peak in FY2013 with 193,032 expedited removals and 170,247 reinstatements. The total number of removals has been mainly driven by the rise in expedited removals of arriving aliens and reinstatements since FY2010. Standard removals, voluntary departures, and expedited removals of criminal aliens accounted for 17% of all removals in FY2013, while expedited removals made up 44% of those removed. In FY2013, expedited removals comprised 44% of all removals, while reinstatements accounted for almost 39%. The increase in expedited removals and reinstatements has been driving the rise in removals over the past decade. In FY2013, ICE removed 332,538 aliens, with 35% removed for deportability and 65% for inadmissibility. Returns decreased between FY2008 and FY2012, driving the overall decrease in removals between FY2012 and FY2013. The majority of aliens removed since FY2008 were for inadmissibility rather than deportability. Mexican nationals accounted for 70.5% of removals from FY2004 to FY2013, with four countries making up 96% of removals in FY2013: Mexico (71.8%), Guatemala (10.7%), Honduras (8.3%), and El Salvador (4.8%). There was a significant increase in the number of people removed to these countries over the 10-year period. The number of people removed from Honduras more than tripled, and from Guatemala increased more than four-fold over a 10-year period. In immigration proceedings, an immigration judge decides whether to sustain charges against an alien or terminate the case. Cases can result in removal, voluntary departure, relief, or administrative closures. In FY2013, the majority of completed immigration cases resulted in removals, with 18% being administrative closures. Approximately 13% of decisions were terminations, and 15% were grants of relief. Various mechanisms under the INA allow removable aliens to stay in the US temporarily or permanently. This section outlines the types of relief available, some leading to lawful permanent resident status, while others allow aliens to stay temporarily without conferring permanent immigration status. Aliens in removal proceedings can apply for multiple types of relief. Among the proceedings initially decided by an immigration judge in FY2013, 40% of aliens had applications for relief from removal, including cancellation of removal which confers LPR status on certain removable noncitizens with ties to the US or humanitarian concerns. Requirements differ for LPRs, nonimmigrants, and unauthorized aliens applying for relief. Cancellation of removal is a form of relief available to nonimmigrants or unauthorized aliens who can demonstrate extreme and unusual hardship to their families in the United States. This relief is not available to LPRs and the eligibility criteria are broader for nonpermanent residents. Applications for cancellation of removal are made in removal proceedings and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by immigration judges. The burden is on the alien to prove eligibility and deserving of relief as it is a discretionary form of relief. Grants of cancellation of removal are limited. Foreign nationals seeking asylum in the United States must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. Asylum can be sought either through affirmative claims with USCIS after arrival or defensive claims before an immigration judge during removal proceedings. Defensive asylum applications are raised when a foreign national is placed into removal proceedings. Foreign nationals in removal proceedings can raise defensive applications for asylum as a defense. Asylum can be sought through affirmative claims with USCIS or defensive claims before an immigration judge. Asylum may be granted to those not involved in persecution, with conditions for mandatory denials including serious crimes, nonpolitical crimes, resettlement in another country, or posing a security threat to the US. Conviction of an aggravated felony leads to automatic denial of asylum. In FY2013, 21,717 foreign nationals requested asylum before immigration judges during removal proceedings. Judges granted asylum in 30% of the 8,833 cases where asylum was requested. Adjustment of status allows non-lawful permanent resident aliens to become LPRs in the US without leaving the country, if certain requirements are met. In FY2013, 3,868 foreign nationals received adjustment of status in immigration proceedings, allowing them to stay in the US temporarily. Withholding of removal prevents the US government from deporting an alien to a country where their life would be threatened. Unlike asylum, withholding of removal is mandatory if the alien meets the requirements under the INA. An alien applying for asylum is also considered for withholding of removal under INA \u00a7241(b)(3). Withholding of removal is not a path to LPR status and is temporary relief. In FY2013, there were 1,518 grants and 9,983 denials of withholding of removal, with a 13% grant rate. The United States, as a party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture, prohibits the removal of aliens to countries where they would likely face torture. If country conditions change and the risk of torture decreases, the foreign national can be removed. Certain categories of foreign nationals are ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal, but CAT protections prevent removal based on torture risk. CAT protections prevent the removal of foreign nationals to countries where they would likely face torture. In cases where decisions were made by immigration judges, CAT was granted in 506 cases and denied in 9,575 cases. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) can be granted under certain conditions, such as ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary conditions in a foreign state. The Secretary of Homeland Security can issue TPS for 6 to 18 months and extend if conditions do not change. Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is a relief measure that does not confer immigration status and is granted based on the Executive Branch's authority. Unlike TPS, individuals covered by DED do not register with USCIS but receive it during removal proceedings. The President determines the designated period for DED recipients. Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is granted by the President and does not confer immigration status. Only Liberians currently have DED, set to expire on September 30, 2016. It is a form of administrative discretion where no action is taken against apparently removable aliens. DACA allows certain individuals brought to the US as children to receive deferred action for two years. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides processes for removing aliens and allowing some to stay in the US. Recent administrations have focused on increasing removals and limiting voluntary departure. If Congress reforms immigration, criteria for removal and authorization to stay may be key issues. Cancellation of removal, established in the IIRIRA of 1996, replaced other forms of relief. The IIRIRA of 1996 established cancellation of removal as a form of relief for aliens in the US. Eligibility requirements are stricter for non-LPR aliens. Certain aliens are ineligible, including those with security or terrorism concerns. The Attorney General can cancel removal for aliens who have been LPRs for at least five years, resided continuously for seven years, and have no aggravated felony convictions. Cancellation of removal is a form of relief for aliens in the US, with stricter eligibility requirements for non-LPR aliens. The Attorney General may cancel removal for battered alien spouses or children who have been physically present in the US for at least three years and establish exceptional hardship to a US citizen or LPR family member. To be eligible for cancellation of removal, an applicant must have been physically present in the US for at least three years, demonstrate good moral character, not have criminal or security issues, and show extreme hardship to themselves, their child, or parent. Extreme hardship is assessed individually, considering specific circumstances. Applicants should provide evidence of all relevant factors as any one factor alone may not determine extreme hardship. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) provides a special cancelation of removal provision for certain Central Americans and Eastern Europeans, similar to the pre-1996 suspension of deportation relief. USCIS has reportedly adjudicated nearly all qualifying NACARA applications."
