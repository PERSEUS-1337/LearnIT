    "title": "AB 1918",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44332 of the Education Code is amended. Each county board of education or city and county board of education may issue temporary certificates for certified employees while their credential applications are being processed. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in basic skills and make a statement under oath that they have applied for a credential or permit. The certificate or permit issued shall be valid for up to one calendar year from the date of issuance, with no known reason for denial. The county board of education shall cancel the temporary certificate or permit if the applicant lacks academic qualifications or has a disqualifying criminal record. The temporary certificate is only valid until the commission issues or denies the requested permit or credential. A county board of education or city and county board of education cannot issue a temporary certificate to an applicant with a revoked or suspended teaching credential. A school district may register a valid certification for a position requiring certification qualifications only after obtaining a certificate of clearance from the commission. An applicant for an initial credential, certificate, or permit cannot be employed in a certification-required position without meeting the requirements for a temporary certificate of clearance, including full disclosure of identity and a statement of no relevant criminal convictions under penalty of perjury. An applicant for a teaching credential must disclose only relevant information related to their fitness to teach. They must also pay a fee for a criminal history check by the FBI. Before issuing a temporary teaching certificate, the education board must obtain a clearance certificate from the commission and cannot issue it if the applicant has a violent or serious felony conviction. Upon FBI confirmation of no criminal history or clearance by the Committee of Credentials, a temporary clearance converts to a regular one. Before issuing a temporary teaching certificate, the education board must obtain a clearance certificate from the commission and cannot issue it if the applicant has a violent or serious felony conviction. This section applies to any violent or serious offense punishable as a felony in the state, with definitions provided for violent and serious felonies based on Penal Code sections. A person cannot be denied a temporary teaching certificate solely based on a violent or serious felony conviction if they have obtained a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon according to the Penal Code. A person may not be denied a temporary teaching certificate or clearance based solely on a serious felony conviction, if they can prove rehabilitation to the sentencing court or the court in their resident school district for at least one year. A county board of education or city board may issue a temporary certificate to an employee with a valid credential renewing or applying for an additional credential without a clearance from the commission. A new Article 15 is added to the Education Code, focusing on Nonpublic, Nonsectarian Schools. Section 44405 outlines the details. Article 15 of the Education Code allows county boards of education to issue temporary certificates for certified employees of nonpublic, nonsectarian schools while their credential applications are being processed by the commission. The certificate is valid for one year and requires proficiency in basic skills. The county board of education can cancel a temporary certificate or permit if the applicant lacks academic qualifications or has a disqualifying criminal record, as certified by the commission in writing. A temporary certificate or permit issued to an applicant is only valid until the commission either approves or denies the original request. A county board of education cannot issue a temporary certificate to an applicant with a revoked or suspended teaching credential. The term \"nonpublic, nonsectarian school\" is defined as in Section 56034. Before issuing a temporary certificate, a county board of education must obtain a clearance certificate from the commission. The conditions for revoking, issuing, or denying a temporary certificate are the same for nonpublic, nonsectarian schools as for schools operated by local educational agencies. The commission will expedite processing applications for teacher credentialing from nonpublic, nonsectarian schools to the same extent as requests from other employing agencies. The department recognizes teacher permits, credentials, and certificates issued by the commission or authorized boards. This article will be inoperative on July 1, 2024, and repealed on January 1, 2025, unless extended by a later statute."
