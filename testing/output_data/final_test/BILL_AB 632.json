    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 21628 of the Business and Professions Code requires secondhand dealers to report daily on all secondhand tangible personal property they acquire, excluding firearms, to law enforcement. The report must include the seller's name and address. The curr_chunk discusses the verification of the identification of the seller or pledger of property using specific documents like a passport or driver's license. Verification can be done remotely using technology like cameras or software. The curr_chunk lists acceptable forms of identification for verification, including a United States identification card, a passport from any country with another form of identification showing an address, and a Matricula Consular with another form of identification showing an address. The curr_chunk specifies the requirements for describing serialized property, including serial numbers, identifying marks, and manufacturer details. It also clarifies that watches do not need to be disassembled unless requested by a peace officer, and the cost of opening a watch is the responsibility of the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, or customer. When a secondhand dealer receives or purchases a handheld electronic device, they must report the serial number, which can be the IMEI, MEID, or another unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer. If these numbers are not available at the time of reporting, they must be updated within 10 working days. A handheld electronic device is defined as any portable device capable of creating, receiving, accessing, or storing electronic data, including cell phones, smartphones, and tablets. When describing nonserialized property, include size, color, material, manufacturer's pattern name, owner-applied numbers, personalized inscriptions, and identifying marks. Watches do not need to be disassembled unless requested by a peace officer. Special tools are required for disassembly, and the cost of opening the watch is covered by the pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, or customer. When selling or pledging property, the seller must provide certification of ownership or authority, confirm the accuracy of information, and submit a legible fingerprint as required. Compliance with these requirements deems the secondhand dealer to have received adequate evidence of authority for all relevant purposes. Any person conducting business as a secondhand dealer at a gun show or event outside their jurisdiction may need to submit a duplicate transaction report to the local law enforcement agency. The Department of Justice, in consultation with local law enforcement agencies, will develop descriptive categories for personal property subject to reporting requirements. A statewide electronic reporting system will be created for secondhand dealers to transmit reports. Until the statewide electronic reporting system is implemented by the Department of Justice, secondhand dealers can continue to submit reports in paper format approved by the Department. Each secondhand dealer must electronically report information using the statewide system once implemented by the Department of Justice. For the first 30 days after implementation, dealers must also submit information in paper format. Coin dealers are required to report daily using a form provided by the Attorney General, either by facsimile or mail, with each transaction limited to one item. For secondhand dealers, an \"item\" refers to a single physical article, or a commonly accepted grouping like a pair of earrings. The fingerprinting requirement still applies. Firearms dealers licensed under Penal Code Sections 26700 to 26915 must report firearm deliveries as required by law. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
