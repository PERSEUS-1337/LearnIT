    "content": "In Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, the Supreme Court addressed the preemption of state law claims regarding light or low-tar nicotine descriptors in cigarette advertisements under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA). The Court affirmed that the FCLAA did not preempt the respondents' state common law fraud claim. This decision builds on previous cases discussing the preemptive effect of the FCLAA. This report provides an overview of the doctrine of preemption, the history of the FCLAA, and major Supreme Court decisions interpreting the preemption provision. It discusses lower court decisions, the split among circuit courts, and the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good on future tobacco litigation. The report also examines the development of preemption provisions in the FCLAA, the preemption doctrine, and previous Supreme Court cases discussing the preemptive effect of the FCLAA. The 1965 Act mandated a warning on cigarette packages to inform the public about the hazards of smoking. It temporarily barred the FTC from requiring the warning in cigarette advertising until June 1969. The act aimed to protect commerce and the national economy by avoiding confusing regulations on cigarette labeling and advertising related to smoking and health. The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 strengthened health warnings on cigarette packages and prohibited the FTC from requiring warnings in advertising until June 1971. State regulations were also modified to prevent requirements or prohibitions based on smoking and health in cigarette advertising. The preemption provisions in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 were at issue in cases like Cipollone, Reilly, and Good, where conflicts between state and federal laws were explored. The preemption doctrine is based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which establishes federal laws as supreme over state laws. The Court starts a preemption analysis with a presumption against preemption, recognizing both express and implied forms of preemption. Congressional intent is the key factor in determining whether state action is preempted by federal law. Express preemption occurs when a federal statute explicitly supplants existing state law. Federal law may preempt state law either explicitly or implicitly. The Court has identified three categories of implied preemption: field preemption, conflict preemption, and frustration of purpose. Predicting how these standards will be applied by the courts is speculative. The Supreme Court has noted that predicting how courts will apply preemption standards is speculative. In Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc. (1992), the Court ruled that the FCLAA preempts certain tort actions against cigarette manufacturers under state common law. The plaintiff alleged failure to provide adequate warnings, breach of express warranties, and fraudulent attempts to neutralize warning labels. The defendants in the case fraudulently attempted to neutralize warning labels and conceal medical data. The court had to determine if the FCLAA preempted state law claims, comparing the 1965 and 1969 Acts to analyze the preemption provisions. The 1965 Act did not preempt state damages actions, but the language differed in the 1969 Act. The court found that the provision of \u00a75 in the 1965 Act did not preempt state damages actions but only prohibited specific cautionary statements on cigarette labels and advertising. The 1969 Act had a broader preemption provision in \u00a75(b) compared to the 1965 Act, with the court treating the two provisions separately. The 1969 Act did not amend the provision of \u00a75 in the 1965 Act, which only prohibited specific cautionary statements on cigarette labels and advertising. The Court found that \u00a75(a) did not preempt state courts from awarding damages that could lead to additional warning labels. However, a plurality in the Court interpreted \u00a75(b) more broadly, stating it intended to preempt some common law claims related to cigarette advertising or promotion. This interpretation extended preemption to common law claims, emphasizing that \"State law\" includes common law, statutes, and regulations. The plurality in the Court developed the \"predicate duty\" test to determine when common law claims are preempted by state regulation. They concluded that failure-to-warn claims related to advertising were preempted, but not those based on testing or research practices. Fraudulent misrepresentation claims were also found to be preempted to the extent they relied on state law prohibitions against minimizing health risks in advertising. The plurality in the Court developed the \"predicate duty\" test to determine when common law claims are preempted by state regulation. They concluded that failure-to-warn claims related to advertising were preempted, but not those based on testing or research practices. Fraudulent misrepresentation claims were also found to be preempted to the extent they relied on state law prohibitions against minimizing health risks in advertising. Against statements in advertising that tend to minimize health hazards associated with smoking, known as \"warning neutralization\" claims, the plurality concluded that certain claims were not preempted by the FCLAA. These included claims of fraudulent misrepresentation by false representation of material fact, claims of fraudulent misrepresentation through concealment of material fact, breach of express warranty claims, and claims of conspiracy to misrepresent or conceal material facts. In Cipollone, two dissents were authored regarding common law claims against tobacco companies. Justices Blackmun, Kennedy, and Souter believed such claims could be brought, while Justices Scalia and Thomas concluded all common law claims were preempted. Justice Scalia suggested a test of \"practical compulsion\" to determine preemption. The Supreme Court also addressed the FCLAA's preemptive effect in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, invalidating cigarette regulations by the Massachusetts Attorney General. The Massachusetts Attorney General's regulations prohibited outdoor cigarette advertising near schools and playgrounds. The Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were preempted by the FCLAA, stating that a complete ban on all cigarette advertising would undermine Congress's intent. The Supreme Court found that Massachusetts regulations on outdoor cigarette advertising near schools and playgrounds were preempted by the FCLAA. The Court determined that Congress prohibited state cigarette advertising regulations related to smoking and health concerns, including those targeting youth exposure. While states can still regulate other aspects of tobacco use, restrictions on advertising location fall under preemption. The FCLAA does not preempt state laws prohibiting sales to minors or restricting smoking in public places. The Supreme Court examined its preemptive scope in Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, addressing deceptive practices under state statutes. The FTC has the power to regulate deceptive acts in cigarette advertising, proposing the FTC or Cambridge Method for measuring tar and nicotine levels in 1966. In 2006, long-time smokers of Marlboro Lights Cigarettes filed a class action suit against Altria Group, claiming deception about the harmful nature of light cigarettes, violating the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act. The FTC test for tar and nicotine content had limitations, as it couldn't accurately measure the actual intake by human smokers. Some light cigarette smokers engaged in compensatory behavior to maintain tar and nicotine levels. The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA) seeking the return of money paid for Marlboro Lights cigarettes. PMUSA argued that federal law preempts the state claims. The district court ruled in favor of PMUSA's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs alleged unfair and deceptive practices in the design, manufacture, and sale of Marlboro Lights cigarettes, as well as fraudulent concealment. The district court found that cigarette companies engaged in fraudulent concealment in violation of the MUTPA. The court noted instances where companies disclosed nicotine content voluntarily instead of facing FTC regulations. Regarding light and low-tar descriptors, the court stated that the FTC has not forbidden their use. The court questioned whether plaintiffs' claims would require Philip Morris to disclose the inaccuracies of the FTC Method in real life. The court found that claims related to cigarette companies' fraudulent concealment were not preempted by the FCLAA or FTC oversight, reversing the district court's ruling. The court of appeals disagreed with the district court's ruling, stating that the FCLAA only preempts claims based on a \"requirement or prohibition\" under State law, not claims based on smoking and health. Therefore, the plaintiffs' allegations against PMUSA for fraudulent misrepresentation were not preempted by the FCLAA. The court rejected PMUSA's argument that additional warnings could have prevented alleged false misrepresentation, stating it would extend FCLAA's reach. The court emphasized that Cipollone allows fraudulent misrepresentation claims to survive preemption and refuted PMUSA's preemption arguments. The court examined PMUSA's implied preemption argument based on the \"frustration of purpose\" theory, citing conflicts with FTC regulations on low-tar cigarettes. PMUSA argued that state-law actions would create a different standard of deceptiveness. The court rejected PMUSA's argument that state-law actions would conflict with Congress' goals of uniform standards for cigarette advertising. It also dismissed implied preemption theories based on the FCLAA, citing the Cipollone majority's holding that \u00a75(b) governs the preemptive scope of the act. Additionally, the court addressed PMUSA's implied preemption arguments based on the authority granted to the FTC by the FTC Act to oversee cigarette advertising. The court considered whether the FTC's oversight of tar and nicotine claims could displace conflicting state law. It found that while the FTC has the authority to displace state law through formal rulemaking, it has only taken action on a case-by-case basis so far. The court also discussed how FTC actions, such as consent orders, could potentially preempt state law in some cases. The court determined that the plaintiffs' state-law claims regarding tar and nicotine advertising did not pose a threat to federal regulatory objectives and were not impliedly preempted. Additionally, the court rejected PMUSA's argument that its advertising practices were permitted under federal law, finding that they were not exempt from state law under the MUTPA. The court disagreed with the FTC's use of consent orders with tobacco companies, stating they were not a blanket approval. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in Brown v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp that claims under LUTPA were not preempted by the FCLAA, regarding deceptive marketing of light cigarettes. The court found that the district court erred in applying the predicate duty test in ruling that the FCLAA did not preempt the plaintiffs' state law claims. The Fifth Circuit examined the FTC Method and its role in regulating cigarette advertising, reaffirming that \"descriptors were not deceptive if substantiated by FTC method results.\" Despite acknowledging that fraud claims are not preempted, the court stated that the use of \"FTC-approved descriptors cannot constitute fraud.\" The court ruled that manufacturers cannot be held liable for fraud based on the use of FTC-approved descriptors like \"light\" and \"lowered tar and nicotine levels\" in cigarette advertising. The court found that such claims are preempted under \u00a75(b) and the predicate duty test. The court addressed the plaintiffs' claims of fraudulent concealment based on failure to disclose information related to smoking and health. It considered whether these claims could be preempted under state law duty to disclose facts through advertising and marketing channels. The court rejected a Ninth Circuit case that the plaintiffs relied on, which held that failure-to-warn and fraudulent concealment claims were not preempted by the FCLAA. The court in Brown disagreed with the notion that cigarette manufacturers must conform their advertising to federal standards while also disclosing dangers through other means. The court held that the FCLAA preempts state law claims requiring additional communication with consumers but allows concealment claims based on duty to disclose to certain organizations. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that the FCLAA does not preempt state-law claims related to fraudulent concealment. The U.S. Supreme Court emphasized that state law claims are not preempted by the FCLAA unless Congress clearly intended it. The Court discussed the purposes of the FCLAA and stated that limiting states' authority to prohibit deceptive statements in cigarette advertising would not serve those purposes. The Court would need to determine if the text of \u00a75(b) requires preemption of state fraud rules. The predicate duty test is used to decide if common law claims are preempted. The Court held that the respondents' claims alleging a violation of the duty not to deceive under MUTPA are not preempted by common law. PMUSA's argument that the claim is similar to preempted warning neutralization claims was dismissed. The Court stated that the distinction between misleading and inherently false statements does not determine preemption. The extent of the alleged falsehood may affect the fraud claim's proof but does not impact the suit's merits. The Court distinguished the respondents' claims from preempted Massachusetts regulations, stating that the FCLAA pre-empts only rules based on smoking and health. The MUPTA, a general rule against deception, is not preempted. PMUSA's argument that the Cipollone opinion is inconsistent was dismissed. The Court dismissed PMUSA's argument that the Cipollone opinion is inconsistent with previous decisions in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens and Riegel v. Medtronic, stating that both cases are inapposite. The Court concluded that the phrase \"based on\" in Cipollone describes a more direct causal relationship than the phrase \"relating to\" in Wolens, which is broader and synonymous with \"having a\". The Court in Riegel v. Medtronic held that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 preempts certain state tort law suits. The plaintiffs' products liability claims were found to fall within the core of the preemption provision, which prohibits state requirements relating to safety or effectiveness that differ from federal requirements. The Court distinguished this from Cipollone where a fraud claim was not preempted because it did not seek to impose a prohibition based on smoking and health. The Court in Good held that claims related to smoking and health, like those in Cipollone, are not preempted due to the narrow scope of the phrase \"based on smoking and health.\" PMUSA's argument of implied preemption based on FTC policy promoting low tar cigarettes was rejected by the Court, which found that the Government does not authorize the use of \"light\" and \"low tar\" descriptors. The Court rejected PMUSA's argument on implied preemption based on FTC policy promoting low tar cigarettes and found that the FTC does not authorize the use of \"light\" and \"low tar\" descriptors. The Court also stated that the FTC has never required cigarette manufacturers to disclose tar and nicotine yields or condoned representations of those yields through descriptors. The Court held that respondents' claims were not preempted as the FTC's inaction on correcting descriptors does not justify preemption of state deceptive practices claims. The majority found that despite surviving preemption claims, respondents still need to prove that PMUSA's use of descriptors violated state deceptive practices laws. Justice Thomas dissented, criticizing the Court's reliance on Cipollone and advocating for a clear test that aligns with Congress' goals. He suggested adopting the proximate application test and abandoning the plurality's predicate duty test. The dissent criticized the Cipollone framework for preemption under \u00a7 5(b) and argued for its abandonment. Justice Thomas highlighted the Court's doctrinal shift on express preemption and the lack of consideration of the presumption against preemption in post-Cipollone cases. The dissent criticized the Court's use of the presumption against preemption, highlighting its decline since Cipollone. Justice Thomas noted the rejection of the presumption in Riegel, which undermined Cipollone's framework. The dissent also pointed out that Reilly further eroded Cipollone's analysis of preemption under \u00a75(b). The dissent in the case criticized the Court's use of the presumption against preemption, noting that Reilly expanded the preemptive reach of regulations based on smoking and health concerns. Justice Thomas applied the proximate application test and concluded that the respondents' claim would be preempted because it was based on the effects of smoking on health. This would result in a requirement for petitioners to represent the effects of smoking in their advertising and promotion of light cigarettes. The dissent in the case argued that the FCLAA only preempts claims that impose requirements or prohibitions related to smoking and health. They pointed out that claims arising from false advertising unrelated to smoking and health, such as claims about the origin of the product, would not be preempted. The Court's decision in Good may lead to more lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers under state fraud statutes for misleading descriptors like \"light\" and \"low-tar,\" as Congress did not intend to preempt these types of claims. Plaintiffs seeking to recover sums spent on light cigarettes may face future litigation to determine if manufacturers will have to represent smoking effects in advertising. The FTC's formal rules on light and low-tar descriptors could preempt state-law claims for deceptive practices. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act may limit the FTC's authority to regulate such descriptors. The FTC may lack authority to regulate light and low-tar descriptors in cigarette advertising. The Court clarified the FCLAA's preemptive effect on state common law fraud claims but lower courts may struggle with determining preemption of other claims. PMUSA's failure-to-warn claim was rejected, but the Court acknowledged the potential for a warning neutralization claim. Plaintiffs suing tobacco companies may need to assert a broad range of causes of action to avoid legal pitfalls. Tobacco companies must assert a broad range of causes of action to avoid preemption pitfalls. The Court's decision relied on the presumption against preemption, which may impact preemption jurisprudence. The dissent noted a decline in the Court's reliance on this doctrine in recent preemption cases. The Court's decision in cases like Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm. and United States v. Locke has raised questions about the presumption against preemption. The House passed H.R. 1256, giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, potentially impacting lawsuits post-Good decision. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act requires FDA approval for marketing \"modified risk\" tobacco products, regulates advertising and labeling to inform the public about risks, preempts state regulations on modified risk products, and allows states to regulate cigarette advertising's time, place, and manner. H.R. 1256 addresses preemption issues related to cigarette advertising and promotion, allowing states to regulate the time, place, and manner but not the content. It also introduces a new preemption provision and framework for approving modified tobacco risk products. The new general preemption provision in H.R. 1256 may impact future cases involving claims about light cigarettes conveying less tar and nicotine. This provision could preempt state requirements regarding modified risk tobacco products, including common law duties. Persons who purchase and smoke products approved as modified risk tobacco products may be preempted from asserting common law claims involving light or low-tar descriptors."
