If a default occurs within specific time frames after the mortgage is insured, the Secretary is entitled to a percentage of the principal amount: 60% in Year 3, 40% in Year 4, and 20% in Year 5. After the 5-year period, if a default occurs, the Secretary will not be entitled to repayment of the principal amount. Repayment of the loan will be secured by a lien on the insured residence with priority over other liens. Premiums will be established and collected for each eligible insured mortgage. The Secretary will establish annual premiums for insured mortgages based on credit risk, ranging from 0.55% to 0.75% of the remaining balance. Premiums may be reduced or discontinued during the mortgage term in line with established policies. The Secretary may not insure new or refinanced eligible mortgages after a 3-year period from the enactment of the Act.
