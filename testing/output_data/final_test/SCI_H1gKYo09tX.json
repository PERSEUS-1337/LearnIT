    "content": "Code2seq is an innovative approach that utilizes the syntactic structure of programming languages to encode source code by representing it as compositional paths in its abstract syntax tree (AST) and using attention for path selection during decoding. In this work, the Code2seq approach demonstrates its effectiveness for various tasks, programming languages, and datasets. The model surpasses previous models designed for programming languages and general NMT models. The relation between source code and natural language can be utilized for code summarization, documentation, retrieval, and generation. The problem of generating a natural language sequence from source code is framed as a machine translation task. The model's online demo and resources are available for access. The CODE2SEQ approach leverages the syntactic structure of programming languages by representing code snippets as compositional paths over abstract syntax trees. During decoding, it attends over path-vectors to produce each output token, similar to NMT models. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated on code-related tasks. The CODE2SEQ model demonstrates its effectiveness on code summarization and code captioning tasks in Java and C#. It outperforms other models designed for code, such as BID2, CodeNN, and TreeLSTMs. The model represents code snippets as compositional paths over abstract syntax trees and attends over path-vectors during decoding. The importance of structural encoding of code is examined through an ablation study, showing significant improvement over token-level information alone. This work directly uses paths in the abstract syntax tree for end-to-end sequence generation, a first in the field. The Abstract Syntax Tree uniquely represents code snippets, with terminals representing user-defined values and nonterminals representing language structures like loops and expressions. The importance of structural encoding of code is demonstrated through an ablation study, showing significant improvement over token-level information alone. This work utilizes paths in the abstract syntax tree for end-to-end sequence generation, a novel approach in the field. The AST uniquely represents code snippets, with terminals representing user-defined values and nonterminals representing language structures like loops and expressions. In the language, loops, expressions, and variable declarations are represented in the AST. Pairwise paths between terminals are considered, represented as sequences of terminal and nonterminal nodes, to capture the code snippet's essence. The effectiveness of syntactic encoding of code is demonstrated through structural observation, highlighting common paths in methods. A syntactic encoder can generalize better to unseen examples by normalizing surface form variance in the AST. Sampling k paths as the representation of a code snippet provides regularization and improves results. Runtime-sampling of new paths in every training iteration is shown to be beneficial compared to sampling the same k paths for each example in advance. The model uses a unique encoder-decoder architecture for NMT, where the encoder creates vector representations for each AST path separately. The decoder then attends over these encoded AST paths to generate the target sequence. This approach differs from traditional NMT models that map input sequences of tokens to continuous representations. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture for NMT, where the encoder creates vector representations for each AST path. In the decoding phase, a context vector is computed by attending over these representations to predict the target tokens. Different approaches exist for combining the context vector with the decoding state to generate the next token probabilities. The model utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture for NMT, creating vector representations for AST paths. Each path is encoded using a bi-directional LSTM and sub-token embeddings. AST paths consist of nodes and child indices, represented by an embedding matrix. Code tokens are split into subtokens to capture their compositional nature. The value ArrayList is decomposed into Array and List using learned embedding matrices. The LSTM decoder predicts subtokens and concatenates path representations with token representations for a combined representation. The decoder is provided with an initial state by averaging the combined representations. The decoder in the model is initialized by averaging the combined representations of all paths. The decoder then generates the output sequence by attending over these representations, similar to how seq2seq models attend over source symbols. The attention mechanism dynamically selects the distribution over the combined representations during decoding. The model is evaluated on code-to-sequence tasks, such as predicting Java methods' names from their source code. Our model demonstrates the ability to predict Java methods' names and generate natural language descriptions of C# code snippets. Additionally, it can accurately generate Javadocs. The parameters are initialized using the BID16 heuristic, and the number of sampled paths is set to 200 in the final models. Lower values than 100 for k showed worse results, while increasing to over 300 did not consistently improve performance. In practice, k = 200 was found to be a reasonable sweet spot for capturing enough information while keeping training feasible in GPU memory. A number as high as 200 is beneficial for large methods in predicting a Java method's name given its body. The target method name is predicted as a sequence of sub-tokens, with an average sequence length of about 3. Precision, recall, and F1 score are measured over the target sequence. We experiment with training and predicting on three datasets of Java projects: Java-small, Java-med, and Java-large. Java-small contains 11 Java projects, Java-med has 1000 projects, and Java-large has 9500 projects from GitHub. Each dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets with varying numbers of projects and examples. The dataset used for training and testing consists of 9000 projects from GitHub created since January 2007, with 16M examples. Various baselines were compared, including BID2, BID4, BID5, BID38, BID23, and BID39, to evaluate the performance of CODE2SEQ. The study compared different models for code summarization, including the Transformer BID39, which achieved state-of-the-art results. Efforts were made to strengthen NMT baselines by splitting tokens to subtokens, keeping original casing, and replacing UNK tokens during inference. The models used different hyperparameters, resulting in varying numbers of parameters. Performance results for the code summarization task are shown in the table. Our model significantly outperforms baselines in precision and recall for code summarization, improving by 4 to 8 F1 points on all benchmarks. It outperforms models like ConvAttention and TreeLSTMs, leveraging syntactic paths for long-distance relationships. Additional comparison with code2vec on the code2vec dataset is available in Appendix A. An additional comparison to code2vec on the code2vec dataset can be found in Appendix A. BID15 reported lower performance than our model on Java-large without specifying the exact F1 score. They achieved slightly higher results on Java-small by extending their GNN encoder with a subtoken-LSTM, Transformer with GNN, or LSTM decoder with a pointer network. Data Efficiency ConvAttention BID2 performed better than the Transformer on the Java-small dataset but could not scale for larger datasets. Paths+CRFs showed poor results on the Java-small dataset due to the sparse nature of their paths and the CRF. Our model outperforms baselines on Java datasets of varying sizes, with relative improvements of 7.3% on Java-large, 13% on Java-med, and 22% on Java-small. Compared to the Transformer, our model shows a relative improvement of 23% on Java-large and 37% on Java-small, demonstrating data efficiency across different dataset sizes. Additionally, our model excels across all code lengths, with the best results for short code snippets. The experiment on code summarization task for Java-med test set involved predicting natural language sentences from short C# code snippets using various models. The dataset used consisted of 66,015 pairs of questions and answers from StackOverflow, with a target sequence length of about 10 on average. The models showed stable results for code lengths of 9 and above, with the best performance for short code snippets. The dataset for code summarization task is from StackOverflow with a target sequence length of about 10. The code snippets are short and incomplete, aiming to answer specific questions. Results show that the model achieved a BLEU score of 23.04, outperforming CodeNN and other baselines. The authors introduced a dataset for code summarization task, outperforming CodeNN and other baselines like BiLSTMs, TreeLSTMs, and the Transformer. The model generalizes better to unseen examples with short and incomplete code snippets, thanks to its syntactic representation of the data. Additionally, a comparison was made with BID18, showing better results in BLEU score computation. Our model achieved a BLEU score of 14.53, a 62% relative gain over BID18, by representing code structurally instead of linearizing the AST. An ablation study was conducted to analyze the model's components, with experiments performed on the Java-med dataset's validation set. The model achieved a BLEU score of 14.53, showing a 62% relative improvement over BID18 by structurally representing code instead of linearizing the AST. An ablation study analyzed different components, with results showing that not encoding AST nodes led to a decrease in precision and recall compared to other methods. The Transformer can capture pairs of tokens using self-attention, but focusing on AST leaves increases the focus on named tokens. The AST provides this information without needing additional transformer layers. Limiting path length to 9 leads to pairs of leaves close in the AST but not necessarily in the sequence. Transformers' attention is skewed towards sequential proximity due to positional embeddings. Using a single prediction with no decoder reduces recall. The method name prediction task should be addressed as a sequential prediction, encoding both subtokens and syntactic paths is significant. Despite poor results with no tokens, the model can still achieve around half the score of the full model. The contribution of attention in the model is close to that in seq2seq models. Sampling different paths afresh during training shows a positive contribution. The experiment demonstrates the benefits of sampling k different paths afresh on every training iteration, providing data-level regularization and improving model performance. Open source repositories offer new opportunities for machine learning in processing source code. Existing code representation models often treat code as a sequence rather than a tree, leading to the need for implicit relearning of syntax and reduced accuracy. The models evaluated on tasks like \"filling the blanks\" or semantic classification of code snippets lack compositional syntactic relations, leading to high memory consumption. Representing AST paths node-by-node using LSTMs allows for any syntactic path to be used in unseen examples, unlike models with fixed syntactic relations. This approach can generate unseen sequences and has an open vocabulary compared to code2vec. Our model differs from previous approaches by taking a whole code snippet as input and producing a shorter sequence as output. It can capture multiline patterns in the source code, unlike line-by-line translation models. Additionally, our encoder assumes the input is tree-structured, unlike models that linearize the AST before using a standard seq2seq model. Our model, unlike previous approaches, assumes the input is tree-structured and does not require expert semantic knowledge or manual feature design. It outperforms existing models by 62% in BLEU score. Nodes in the graph represent identifiers, and edges represent syntactic and semantic relations in the code. Our model can be easily implemented for various input languages. Our model utilizes Tree-RNNs for code translation, considering the unique syntactic structure of source code. By sampling paths in the Abstract Syntax Tree, encoding them with an LSTM, and attending to them during sequence generation, we achieve superior performance in predicting method names, generating natural language captions, and method documentation compared to previous works. This approach can be applied to a variety of tasks involving source code and natural language. The paper presents a model that utilizes Tree-RNNs for code translation, achieving superior performance in predicting method names and generating natural language captions. The model's code, datasets, and trained models are publicly available. A comparison to code2vec shows that the model achieves a higher F1 score due to differences in dataset splitting methods.
