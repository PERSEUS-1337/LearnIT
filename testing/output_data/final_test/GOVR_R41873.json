    "content": "The child tax credit, established in 1997, reduces tax liability dollar for dollar. Initially nonrefundable, it has evolved to be refundable, benefiting more low-income families. The child tax credit allows taxpayers to reduce federal income tax liability by up to $2,000 per qualifying child. The refundable portion, known as the additional child tax credit, can result in a full or partial refund if the credit exceeds the amount of tax owed. The refund is calculated as 15% of earnings exceeding $2,500, up to $1,400 per child. The credit phases out for higher-income taxpayers. The child tax credit can offset a taxpayer's Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability and is not indexed for inflation. The maximum credit per child is $2,000, and eligible families can claim it for each qualifying child. Legislative changes have expanded the credit, especially for upper-income taxpayers. The child tax credit can be up to $2,000 per qualifying child, with the maximum credit based on the number of qualifying children a taxpayer has. It can be received as a reduction in tax liability, a refundable credit, or a combination of both. Starting in 2026, the maximum credit amount is set to decrease to $1,000 per qualifying child. Taxpayers with little or no federal income tax liability may be eligible for the refundable portion of the credit. The refundable portion of the child tax credit, known as the additional child tax credit (ACTC), is calculated using the \"earned income formula\" up to a maximum of $1,400 per qualifying child. The formula allows a taxpayer to claim 15% of the family's earned income above $2,500, with the credit increasing by 15 cents for every dollar earned above the threshold. Earned income includes wages, tips, and other compensation. Beginning in 2026, the refundability threshold for the additional child tax credit (ACTC) is set to increase to $3,000, with the maximum ACTC per child decreasing to $1,000. The child tax credit phases out for higher-income families, with the credit decreasing by $50 for every $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) above a certain threshold. The threshold amounts are $200,000 for single parents and married taxpayers filing separately, and $400,000 for married couples. The child tax credit phases out for higher-income families based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) above certain thresholds. The thresholds are $200,000 for single parents and married taxpayers filing separately, and $400,000 for married couples. The credit completely phases out for a married couple with two children if their MAGI exceeds $480,000. To claim the credit, the child must be under 17 years old for the entire year. The child tax credit has specific eligibility criteria including the child being a dependent, living with the taxpayer for more than half the year, and not providing more than half of their own support. Additionally, the child must be a U.S. citizen or resident. These requirements differ from other tax benefits and can be confusing for taxpayers. Taxpayers claiming the child tax credit must provide a valid taxpayer identification number (TIN) for each qualifying child on their tax return. From 2018 to 2025, the child's TIN must be a work-authorized Social Security number (SSN) issued before the tax return due date. Failure to provide the child's SSN may result in denial of the credit. Starting in 2026, valid TINs for qualifying children will include individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) and Social Security numbers (SSNs). ITINs are issued by the IRS to noncitizens for tax compliance, not affecting immigration status. Taxpayers must provide their own taxpayer identification number to claim the child tax credit, with a permanent ID requirement. A 10-year bar is imposed for fraudulent claims, and a 2-year bar for reckless claims. Estimates show significant growth in the total dollar amount of the child tax credit over time, with the majority of the benefit in 2018 going to taxpayers with income between $75,000 and $500,000. In 2018, the child tax credit benefits taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 the most, with over $3,000 on average. The majority of taxpayers with children across income groups will receive the credit, except for those with income over $1 million. The child tax credit has more than doubled in size since 1998, reaching approximately $54 billion in 2015. The refundable portion of the credit now makes up about half of the total amount received by taxpayers. The child tax credit has more than doubled since 1998, reaching $54 billion in 2015. Legislative changes made to the credit by P.L. 115-97 are estimated to cost $573.4 billion between 2018 and 2026. The new SSN requirement is expected to save $29.8 billion during the same period. The Tax Policy Center estimated the distribution of the child tax credit by income level for 2018. The Tax Policy Center estimated the distribution of the child tax credit by income level for 2018 under current law. Nearly one-third of all child tax credit dollars will go to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000, while slightly more than one-quarter will go to taxpayers with income under $50,000. Lower-income taxpayers will generally receive a credit of $1,400 or less per child, while higher-income taxpayers will receive a credit of $2,000 per child. The Tax Policy Center estimated the distribution of the child tax credit by income level for 2018. Among taxpayers with children, almost all will receive the credit, with over 90% of those earning between $40,000 and $500,000 eligible. However, only half of those earning under $10,000 will receive the credit, and less than one-fifth of those earning between $500,000 and $1 million will qualify. The child tax credit varies based on income levels, with those earning between $100,000 and $200,000 receiving the largest credit on average ($3,100). Lower-income taxpayers may receive up to $1,400 per child, while the wealthiest taxpayers (income over $1 million) may receive $10 per child on average. Higher-income taxpayers can receive up to a $2,000 credit per child, but the highest-income taxpayers will be ineligible due to the phaseout."
