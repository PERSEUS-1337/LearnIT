    "content": "Congress has granted federal agencies the authority to issue regulations with the force of law, raising accountability issues. One method is requiring agencies to conduct regulatory analysis, including cost-benefit analysis, before implementing new regulations. This analysis demonstrates reasoned consideration of the rule's necessity and effects on society. Financial regulators, known as independent regulatory agencies, operate with a high degree of independence from the President and Congress. This independence allows experts to write technical rules without political influence. Some argue that subjecting financial regulators to increased requirements could hinder necessary regulation, while others believe it is appropriate. The debate over subjecting financial regulators to increased requirements has drawn attention in recent years, especially with the implementation of rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. This report examines issues related to financial regulators and cost-benefit analysis (CBA), including potential difficulties they face, current analytical requirements, and arguments for and against increasing requirements. Proposed legislation aims to change the regulatory landscape. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) can assist financial regulators in making informed decisions during rule development, issuance, and implementation. Economists and experts use various tools to estimate the outcomes of regulations, comparing benefits like saved lives and habitat with costs such as compliance expenses for companies. This analysis helps determine the overall societal benefit of a regulation. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is essential for financial regulators to make informed decisions during rule development, issuance, and implementation. It involves estimating outcomes of regulations, considering benefits like saved lives and costs such as compliance expenses for companies. Externalities should also be included in the analysis. However, accurately estimating, quantifying, and monetizing societal costs and benefits can be challenging, leading to subjective human judgement and uncertainty in predicted results. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for financial regulation involves subjective human judgement and uncertainty, with results often presented as a range of values. The debate over CBA requirements highlights challenges in determining regulatory costs and outcomes, questioning the appropriate scope, level of detail, and quantification needed in the rulemaking process. Striking a balance is crucial to prevent overly burdensome regulations without due consideration of consequences, while also serving as an informational tool to estimate rule effects and inform stakeholders. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for financial regulation involves subjective human judgement and uncertainty, with results often presented as a range of values. The debate over CBA requirements highlights challenges in determining regulatory costs and outcomes, questioning the appropriate scope, level of detail, and quantification needed in the rulemaking process. Striking a balance is crucial to prevent overly burdensome regulations without due consideration of consequences, while also serving as an informational tool to estimate rule effects and inform stakeholders. Concerns arise about the potential for policies to exaggerate or minimize risks, costs, or outcomes of regulations, as well as the risk of impeding necessary regulation due to onerous analytic requirements. Agencies may resort to less accountable methods if faced with burdensome requirements, and the cost and funding of CBAs are also considerations. Uncertain and contestable CBAs could allow self-interested parties to challenge agency analysis and impede socially beneficial regulation. The analysis discusses the challenges of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for financial regulation, emphasizing the subjective nature and potential costs of stringent CBA requirements. It reviews current CBA requirements, including those under Executive Order 12866, and examines government reports on recent regulatory CBAs. Executive Order 12866, signed by President William Clinton, mandates that covered agencies submit significant rules to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review, including a cost and benefit assessment. For rules with an annual economic effect exceeding $100 million, agencies must conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis, including an assessment of feasible alternatives. Other provisions of the order encourage agencies to consider costs and benefits in the rulemaking process. E.O. 12866, signed by President William Clinton, requires agencies to submit significant rules for review, including a cost-benefit analysis. E.O. 13563 reaffirmed these principles in 2011 by President Barack Obama, emphasizing the need for regulations to justify their costs and maximize net benefits. Circular A-4 provides guidance for agencies on conducting cost-benefit analysis accurately. Circular A-4 provides guidance for agencies on conducting cost-benefit analysis accurately, defining good regulatory analysis and standardizing the measurement and reporting of benefits and costs of Federal regulatory actions. It includes specific information agencies should include in their analyses, such as statutory directives, regulatory alternatives, and cost-effectiveness analysis. This guidance remains the current OMB guidance for agencies preparing CBAs under E.O. 12866 requirements. The exception for independent regulatory agencies in E.O. 12866 is similar to the exception found in E.O. 12291, established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. President Reagan's decision in 1981 exempted certain independent regulatory agencies from OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis, citing their statutory independence. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 designated special procedures for these agencies, which were later referenced in E.O. 12291 and E.O. 12866. The list of exempted agencies includes financial regulators like the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. President Clinton, President Reagan, and President Obama exempted independent regulatory agencies from cost-benefit analysis requirements. President Obama's Executive Order 13579 encouraged these agencies to comply with certain principles. The executive order E.O. 13579 encouraged independent regulatory agencies to comply with principles such as public participation, innovation, and science, with respect for their independence. It did not directly apply cost-benefit principles from E.O. 12866 and 13563 to these agencies, nor require them to conduct CBA before issuing rules. Financial regulators are exempt from many analytical requirements applicable to executive agencies, but may still need to conduct CBA under other statutes. Financial regulators may need to conduct CBA or other regulatory analyses under specific statutes, with requirements that may be less stringent than those under E.O. 12866. While the degree of quantification and monetization is not always specified, the importance of thorough analysis is evident as financial regulations have been overturned due to deficient CBAs. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 imposes analytical requirements on all federal regulatory agencies, including financial regulators. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies, including financial regulators, to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities. This includes small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and not-for-profit organizations. The agencies must prepare a \"regulatory flexibility analysis\" for proposed and final rules, describing reasons for the action, affected small entities, compliance requirements, and alternatives to minimize impact on small entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 aims to reduce the paperwork burden on individuals and small businesses resulting from federal regulations. It includes information collections, recordkeeping requirements, and third-party disclosures authorized by regulations. The PRA is separate from the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) requires agencies to justify information collection from the public by showing need, burden estimation, and least burdensome method. Agencies need OIRA approval for each collection request, with renewals every three years. OIRA can disapprove any information collection. The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act imposes analytical requirements on rulemaking for federal banking regulators to reduce administrative burdens for insured depository institutions. Independent regulatory agencies can override OIRA disapproval of information collections by majority vote. When imposing regulations on depository institutions, federal banking regulators must consider the administrative burden on institutions and customers, as well as the benefits. Certain agencies like the SEC are required to analyze the impact of their rules on market efficiency and competition. The SEC and CFPB are required by various acts to consider the impact of their rules on market efficiency, competition, and consumer costs and benefits. The CFTC must evaluate costs and benefits of new rules, considering protection of market participants, market efficiency, price discovery, risk management practices, and other public interest considerations. Reports on agency-performed CBAs can show practical rulemaking analyses. The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act requires OMB to report to Congress on regulatory costs and benefits, including CBAs for major rules. In 2016, independent financial regulatory agencies issued 8 major final rules, with only 6 rules monetizing costs and none monetizing benefits. Executive departments and agencies subject to E.O. 12866 implemented 30 major rules, with varying levels of monetization for benefits and costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) releases an annual report on Dodd-Frank regulations, examining analyses by financial regulators. Regulators aim to follow OMB Circular A-4 guidance in their rulemaking, with GAO finding their analysis consistent with the guidance. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) annual report examines financial regulators' adherence to OMB Circular A-4 guidance in regulatory analyses. Five major rules were reviewed, all found consistent with the guidance, despite challenges in accurately assessing regulation effects. The new regulation poses challenges in quantification and monetization of outcomes. Variants of cost-benefit analysis, such as cost-effectiveness analysis, breakeven analysis, qualitative analysis with expert judgement, and retrospective analysis, address these difficulties. One challenge in cost-benefit analysis is accurately predicting human behavioral responses to regulations, especially in financial regulation CBA. The debate revolves around the difficulty of determining the effectiveness of different types of analysis in solving these problems. The \"Financial Regulator Requirements Debate\" section explores arguments related to CBA requirements for financial regulators. For instance, estimating the benefits of additional disclosures to customers about a certain loan type involves predicting how many potential customers would read and act on the information. The analysis involves estimating customer reactions to disclosures in financial regulations, modeling consumer behavior, and predicting outcomes with uncertainty. Additional reporting requirements for lenders could decrease loan profitability and reduce credit availability, impacting economic growth. Estimating the cost of economic growth contraction due to credit tightening involves macroeconomic modeling, statistical interpretation, and uncertainty. Monetizing the effects of regulations, especially non-market outcomes like emotional distress from home foreclosures, poses challenges. Regulatory benefits are often harder to quantify than costs. Monetizing regulatory benefits, such as emotional distress from home foreclosures, can be challenging. Quantifying and monetizing estimates provide a clear measurement of costs and benefits, but variations of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can be used when full quantification is not possible. Variants include cost-effectiveness analysis and breakeven analysis. Cost-effectiveness analysis, breakeven analysis, and qualitative analysis with expert judgement are some variants used in regulatory analysis. Retrospective analysis is also sometimes conducted. Cost-effectiveness analysis is valuable when benefits are difficult to quantify, focusing on outcomes like preventing cancer or preserving wetlands. It compares different regulations to determine the most effective and efficient approach. Breakeven analysis is useful for comparing the effectiveness of regulations by determining the point at which the costs equal the benefits. It is particularly helpful when there is uncertainty in estimating costs and benefits. This analysis can reveal the circumstances under which a regulation would benefit society and identify the most effective regulations. For example, a hypothetical regulation to reduce a disease may cost $50 million with an estimated range of cases avoided between 10,000-50,000. The breakeven value of avoiding one case of a disease is estimated to be between $1,000 and $5,000. When benefits and costs cannot be quantified, qualitative analysis can be used to assess the regulation's welfare effects. Retrospective analysis evaluates the realized costs and benefits after the implementation of rules. Retrospective analysis evaluates costs and benefits after rule implementation, providing insights on outcomes. Performing cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is considered useful for regulatory processes, but the requirement for financial regulators to conduct CBAs with specified parameters is a debated topic. The debate over financial regulators conducting cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has intensified in recent years, especially after the Dodd-Frank Act. Some argue for more discretion due to unique characteristics of the finance industry, while others advocate for stricter requirements to prevent interested parties from hindering beneficial regulations. Some argue for stricter requirements on financial regulators to conduct cost-benefit analysis for regulation, while others believe that the uncertainty and contestability of financial CBAs make it challenging to apply standard CBA requirements to the finance industry. Some argue for stricter requirements on financial regulators to conduct cost-benefit analysis for regulation, while others believe that the uncertainty and contestability of financial CBAs make it challenging to apply standard CBA requirements to the finance industry. Financial CBA is complex due to human behavioral responses and the interactions of individuals and financial firms in markets for intangible financial goods, unlike regulations in other sectors governed by biological, chemical, and physical laws. The effects of new financial regulations are harder to predict due to human behavioral changes. For example, the cost to banks of holding more liquid assets is uncertain as it depends on various factors. Uncertainty in estimating the effects of financial regulations is also attributed to the complexity of the financial system and the interactions within it. The complexity of the financial system and the rapid pace of innovation in finance make it challenging to estimate the long-term effects of regulations on the economy. Unlike industries with physical constraints, the financial sector can change quickly, leading to uncertain estimates of how regulations implemented today will impact markets in the future. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, private label sub-prime mortgage securitizations and collateralized debt obligations grew rapidly, becoming crucial in the financial system. There is often debate on whether outcomes of financial regulations are benefits or costs, unlike in other industries where it is clearer. For example, the impact of consumer protection provisions on high-interest-rate lending can be seen as both a benefit and a cost. The extent to which financial regulation reduces abusive practices can also limit access to credit sources. The effects of financial regulation often involve wealth transfers between different groups, with Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) used to measure net economic effects. Proponents of greater agency discretion argue that stricter CBA requirements could lead to delays in issuing regulations, potentially resulting in less stringent regulation over time. Some argue that Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) requirements may not discipline agencies effectively, potentially disguising agency judgement as objective measurement. Others believe financial regulators need more stringent regulatory analysis requirements, as the challenges they face are not significantly different from those of other regulators. Regulators argue that all regulation triggers uncertain human responses, including antitrust regulation which relies heavily on firms, consumers, and markets. They dispute the notion that financial innovation is uniquely rapid, pointing to advancements in other industries. They suggest that the effects of financial regulations are easier to quantify due to their focus on monetary transactions. Critics of lenient requirements reject the idea that finance's importance justifies exemption from CBA, emphasizing that estimating financial impacts is not inherently more complex. Proponents argue that financial regulation CBA is crucial due to its potential for large economic effects, despite facing challenges from exemptions and lack of oversight. They believe that similar requirements can lead to the development of expertise and methods for performing CBA in financial regulation. Some academics propose methods for financial industry-specific questions. Proponents argue uncertainty shouldn't deter financial CBA, as it helps evaluate regulations transparently. Despite uncertainties, CBAs can assess the likelihood of regulation benefits and cost minimization, identifying justifications for regulations. Financial regulators should face requirements similar to those of other industries, with bills being introduced to impose additional regulatory impact analysis requirements. The Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) includes Section 312, which mandates certain analyses in the rulemaking process. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 5) and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act (H.R. 1009) aim to amend the rulemaking process by requiring agencies to assess costs and benefits, consider alternatives, and extend cost-benefit analysis requirements to all agencies. The OIRA authority bill (H.R. 1009) and SEC Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 78) passed the House, imposing cost-benefit requirements and retrospective assessments for agencies. The CFTC Commodity End-User Relief Act (H.R. 238) expanded considerations for CBAs. The Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act of 2015 (S. 1607) aimed to authorize the President for regulatory oversight. The Agency Regulatory Analysis Act of 2015 (S. 1607) would authorize the President to subject independent regulatory agencies to cost-benefit analysis requirements. Other bills like the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act (H.R. 113) and the CFPB Dual Mandate and Economic Analysis Act (H.R. 5211) also aimed to impose new analysis requirements on financial regulators. Congress faces challenges in determining appropriate CBA requirements for financial regulators to ensure good regulation. Calibrating requirements for cost-benefit analysis in financial regulation is complex due to the difficulty and uncertainty involved. Excessively lenient requirements may lead to bad regulation, while excessively stringent requirements could hinder good regulation. Experts disagree on the challenges of CBA in financial regulation, making it difficult to determine the appropriate requirements for financial regulators."
