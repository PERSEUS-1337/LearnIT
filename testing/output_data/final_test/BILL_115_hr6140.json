The Secretary will establish a program through the Office of Nuclear Energy to support the availability of HA-LEU for domestic commercial use. This program includes providing financial assistance for transportation package designs for HA-LEU and encouraging certification by the Commission by January 1, 2021. The Secretary will submit a report on the Department's uranium inventory by January 1, 2020, for HA-LEU processing. A survey of stakeholders will estimate HA-LEU quantity for domestic commercial use biennially through 2025. Options for acquiring HA-LEU for the program will be assessed. The Secretary will establish a consortium to partner with the Department in acquiring HA-LEU for domestic commercial use. A schedule for cost recovery of HA-LEU will be developed in coordination with the consortium before acquisition. The consortium, established by the Secretary, can acquire HA-LEU for members starting from 3 years after its establishment. Criticality benchmark data will be developed to assist the Commission in regulating nuclear material facilities. The Secretary can sell or transfer HA-LEU to a consortium member, with regulations and certification requirements under part 71 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations. Funding for transportation package design requires a 20% cost share from a non-Federal entity, with appropriations authorized for design and license activities. Funds totaling $1,500,000 for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021 are authorized for subsection (b)(1). The Secretary cannot make commitments for HA-LEU acquisition without advance funding in subsequent appropriations Acts. The Secretary must record obligations upfront for the program, using authorized amounts. The program authority will expire on September 30, 2033. The Commission is required to submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment, detailing necessary updates to regulations, certifications, and policies for commercially available HA-LEU. This includes guidance for material control, certifications for transportation packaging, and licensing of facilities for HA-LEU. The report must also include a timeline for completing these updates. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as Commission (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), Department (Department of Energy), HA-LEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium), high-assay low-enriched uranium (uranium with 5.0-20.0% U-235 enrichment), and Secretary (Secretary of Energy)."
