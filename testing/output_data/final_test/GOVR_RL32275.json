    "content": "Firm size does not affect the federal tax code organization, which does not differentiate between small and large firms. However, there are scattered provisions in the code that provide preferential tax treatment to small businesses through deductions, credits, and lower tax rates. Existing small business tax benefits not only reduce tax burdens but also lower tax compliance costs, which tend to be higher for smaller firms. Some provisions offer tax relief in exchange for providing fringe benefits to employees. The federal tax code lacks a formal distinction for small firms and varies in eligibility criteria for small business tax benefits. Some tax benefits for small businesses are limited by annual gross receipts, assets, or employment size. Employment size is rarely a factor in eligibility criteria for tax preferences, unlike the Small Business Administration which uses it for data collection and support programs. Small business tax benefits vary in scope, with some specific to certain industries while others apply broadly to all small firms. The rules for taxing passthrough entities have the widest impact outside of agriculture. The tax benefits for small businesses, including rules for passthrough entities, corporate tax rates, expensing allowances, and more, have a broad impact. These benefits result in a loss of federal revenue in the short term, but there is disagreement on which provisions constitute small business tax benefits. The revenue cost of existing small business tax preferences is difficult to estimate accurately, but recent estimates suggest a cost exceeding $8 billion in FY2005. Only two bills enhancing small business tax benefits were enacted in the 109th Congress: the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in 2007, extended provisions for pensions and tax credits for small employers. Various proposals for small business tax preferences have been introduced in Congress, with some playing a role in legislation to increase the federal minimum wage. Notable proposals include H.R. 2 / S. 349, H.R. 976, H.R. 1591, and H.R. 2206 (P.L. 110-28). The House passed H.R. 2 on January 10 to increase the federal minimum wage. The House passed H.R. 2 on January 10, 2007, to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 over two years. The Senate responded by passing an amended version of H.R. 2 on February 1, which included tax benefits for small firms affected by the wage increase. The Senate passed H.R. 2 with a package of revenue raisers totaling $8.3 billion from FY2007 to FY2016. The increase in the minimum wage was combined with small business tax benefits to secure 60 votes for passage. Some tax preferences in the bill would benefit small firms more than others, such as the expensing allowance extension and cash accounting method threshold increase. The House passed H.R. 976, which included tax preferences like an extension of the 15-year depreciation life for certain improvements and an extension of the work opportunity tax credit. This was done to pave the way for a conference with the Senate over H.R. 2, although it did not address the minimum wage. H.R. 976, passed by the House on February 16, included tax benefits for small firms such as an extension of the WOTC and expensing allowance. The revenue raisers in H.R. 976 differed from those in H.R. 2 and would not disproportionately affect small firms. The House passed H.R. 976 on February 16, which included tax benefits for small firms like an extension of the WOTC and expensing allowance. The bill proposed various changes, including an increase in the maximum allowance to $125,000, a freeze in the minimum wage for determining tax credits, and revisions to tax filing requirements for married couples owning unincorporated businesses. House Democratic leaders added minimum wage provisions from H.R. 2 and business tax provisions from H.R. 976 to bill H.R. 1591 for supplemental FY2007 appropriations. The House passed the measure on March 23, and the Senate passed its version on March 29, including minimum wage provisions and business tax benefits with revenue raisers to offset costs. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 1591 included business tax benefits similar to H.R. 2, with some exceptions such as extending the cost recovery period for leasehold and restaurant improvements through 2008. It also expanded the WOTC and expensing allowance to \"rural renewal counties.\" The estimated revenue cost was $12.6 billion from FY2007 through FY2016. House and Senate leaders agreed to a conference to resolve differences between the two versions of H.R. 1591. The House and Senate agreed to a conference to resolve differences in H.R. 1591. A conference report was filed with business tax benefits costing $4.8 billion from FY2007 through FY2017. President Bush vetoed the measure due to an unacceptable timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq. A second bill, H.R. 2206, was passed without a timetable for troop withdrawal but included the same tax benefits and revenue raisers. The new law signed by President Bush included small business tax benefits such as increased expensing allowance, modifications to subchapter S status rules, and changes in tax filing requirements for married couples owning unincorporated businesses. None of the revenue raisers in the law disproportionately affected small firms. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 324 was introduced to gradually raise the federal minimum wage and provide tax preferences for small business owners. One key element is the extension of the enhanced small business expensing allowance. Other benefits include a reduction in depreciation allowances for new restaurant buildings and a repeal of the surtax for the federal unemployment trust fund. H.R. 324 aims to raise the federal minimum wage gradually and offer tax benefits to small businesses. It includes extending the small business expensing allowance, reducing depreciation allowances for new restaurant buildings, and repealing the surtax for the federal unemployment trust fund. Additionally, H.R. 46 introduced by Representative Nadia Velazquez includes provisions such as amortizing intangible assets, increasing capital gains exclusion, raising the home office deduction, and expanding the maximum number of shareholders for subchapter S corporations. Senator John Kerry's bill, S. 99, proposes creating additional benefits for small businesses. Senator John Kerry introduced bill S. 99 to create a tax credit for small firms providing health insurance, ranging from 50% to 20% based on employee count. Senator Max Baucus introduced bill S. 41 to enhance the research tax credit and offer a non-refundable personal tax credit for equity investment in small firms focused on research and development. The proposed legislation includes a tax credit for small businesses providing health insurance and a tax credit for equity investment in research-focused small firms. Additionally, there are proposals to enhance small business tax benefits, such as allowing business taxpayers to write off the cost of qualified assets in the year they are placed into service under IRC Section 179. The proposed legislation includes a tax credit for small businesses providing health insurance and equity investment in research-focused small firms. It also allows business taxpayers to write off the cost of qualified assets in the year they are placed into service under IRC Section 179, including motor vehicles. Taxpayers can recover the cost of assets through depreciation deductions, with expensing being the most accelerated form. The maximum allowance for most firms is $125,000 in 2007, indexed for inflation from 2008 to 2010. Starting in 2011, the allowance will drop to $25,000, with a phaseout threshold of $500,000 in 2007, falling to $100,000 in 2011 and beyond. The current legislation extends the expensing allowance for qualified assets through 2010, with a maximum allowance of $125,000 and a phaseout threshold of $500,000 in 2007. However, starting in 2011, the allowance will decrease to $25,000 with a phaseout threshold of $100,000. The legislation would permanently increase the maximum expensing allowance to $200,000 and the phaseout threshold to $800,000, with inflation adjustments. It would also include off-the-shelf business software as eligible assets and modify the phaseout to reduce by $0.50 for each dollar spent above the threshold. The legislation would permanently increase the maximum expensing allowance to $200,000 and the phaseout threshold to $800,000, with inflation adjustments. It would also include off-the-shelf business software as eligible assets and modify the phaseout to reduce by $0.50 for each dollar spent above the threshold. Business taxpayers have flexibility in choosing accounting methods, with cash basis and accrual basis being widely used. Accrual accounting records income and expenses when transactions are completed, providing a more accurate measure of economic income. Cash accounting is simpler but may not match income with expenses as effectively. Certain entities are restricted from using cash accounting under IRC Section 448, except for firms engaged in farming or commercial activities. Under IRC Section 471, the IRS may require firms to maintain inventories using the accrual method to ensure accurate income reporting. Exceptions are made for firms with average annual gross receipts not exceeding $1 million, allowing them to use the cash method. The bill would raise the threshold for using cash accounting to $10 million for certain businesses and index it for inflation. S corporations, unlike C corporations, do not pay entity-level tax and pass income or loss to shareholders. The attribution of income in S corporations is passed on to shareholders for individual tax returns. Shareholders' basis in stock is adjusted for income or loss. S corporations are not taxed on earned income but may face taxation on passive investment income and accumulated earnings. S corporations are subject to a tax on accumulated earnings and profits under IRC Section 1375. To qualify as an S corporation, a firm must be a small business corporation with no more than 100 qualified shareholders and only one class of stock. Shareholders must be individuals who are residents or citizens of the United States, certain trusts, estates, or tax-exempt organizations. Partnerships and C corporations cannot be S corporation shareholders. A qualifying corporation must elect S corporation status, and all shareholders must consent to the decision. Failure to meet the criteria can result in losing S corporation status. A corporation can lose its S status by failing to meet small business criteria or having excess passive income for three consecutive years. Once lost, a firm must wait five years to elect S status again. S corporations offer advantages like avoiding double taxation, but other tax considerations may impact this. For example, S corporation earnings are not taxed as dividends at the current 15% rate. S corporations have advantages over C corporations, such as greater flexibility in utilizing corporate losses and immediate offsetting of losses with other income sources. Proposed changes in taxation rules aim to create a more level playing field for S corporations. The proposed changes in taxation rules for S corporations aim to create a more level playing field among S corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships. One provision would eliminate gains from sales or exchanges of stock as passive investment income for S corporations, while another provision would clarify the status of bank stock owned by directors of banks operating as S corporations. The bill proposes various changes for S corporations, including allowing banks converting to S status to discontinue the reserve method of accounting for bad debts, allowing non-resident aliens to be beneficiaries of electing small business trusts owning stock in S corporations, and modifying the tax treatment of the sale of stock in qualified S corporation subsidiaries. These changes aim to create a more level playing field among S corporations, LLCs, and partnerships. The provision in the bill addresses the tax treatment of the sale of stock in qualified S corporation subsidiaries by the parent S corporation. It would be considered as a sale of an undivided interest in the subsidiary, followed by a transfer of assets to a new corporation subject to IRC Section 351 rules. Additionally, the bill aims to increase the maximum number of qualified shareholders for an S corporation from 100 to 150. Under S. 270, S corporations and partnerships could choose a tax year ending in any month from April to November if they meet certain criteria. This exception applies to firms with average annual gross receipts of $5 million or less in the past three years or start-up firms. Current federal tax law does not provide tax credits to employers for providing health insurance, but there are tax incentives for individuals to purchase health insurance. Employees do not pay federal income or payroll taxes on employer contributions to health and accident plans they participate in. Employees do not pay federal income or payroll taxes on employer contributions to health and accident plans they participate in. This exclusion also applies to certain health benefits received through cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts. Self-employed individuals can deduct health insurance payments for themselves and their dependents from taxable income. Individual taxpayers who itemize can deduct qualified medical care expenses. Individual taxpayers who itemize on their tax returns can deduct the total amount paid for qualified medical care, including health insurance premiums, for themselves, spouses, and dependents above 7.5% of their adjusted gross income. Certain individuals may claim the health coverage tax credit (HCTC), a refundable credit equal to 65% of the amount paid for qualified health insurance by specific groups, such as those receiving trade adjustment allowances or over age 55 receiving pension benefits. Eligible individuals with qualified high-deductible health insurance plans can establish health savings accounts under IRC Section 223. In 2007, health insurance plans can establish health savings accounts (HSAs) with minimum deductibles and out-of-pocket limits. Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible, with limits on annual contributions. Withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free, but non-qualified withdrawals are taxed. Employer contributions to HSAs are excluded from income and payroll taxes. The bill H.R. 1802 proposes a new tax credit for small firms offering health insurance to employees. The credit would be 60% for firms with 25 or fewer employees and 40% for firms with 26 to 100 employees. Firms with over 100 employees would not be eligible. Eligible employers must meet certain criteria to claim the credit. The bill S. 99 proposes a new permanent refundable tax credit for qualified small employers offering health benefits to eligible employees. The credit would be based on employer size and cover 50% of health insurance spending, up to $4,000 for single coverage and $10,000 for family coverage for firms with fewer than 10 employees. The credit rate decreases for firms with 10-24 employees and 25-49 employees. Eligibility criteria include offering insurance to all employees, paying at least 50% of the cost, having average annual gross receipts of $5 million or less, and employing an undisclosed number of qualified employees. The bill proposes a new permanent non-refundable tax credit for qualified small employers with average annual gross receipts of $5 million or less and employing 2 to 49 qualified individuals. Qualified employees must not be eligible for certain health insurance plans and receive no more than $50,000 in compensation. The credit would be available for employers offering health insurance to eligible employees starting in 2008. The bill proposes a new permanent non-refundable tax credit for qualified small employers with average annual gross receipts of $5 million or less and employing 2 to 49 qualified individuals. The credit would be equal to 50% of qualified employee health insurance expenses for eligible employers starting in 2008. The credit would have different percentages based on the number of qualified employees, with limits on expenses for single and family coverage. Eligible employers must meet certain criteria to claim the credit, including offering health insurance to all qualified employees and having an average of 25 or fewer qualified employees in the previous calendar years. The bill proposes a new tax credit for small employers with 2 to 49 employees, based on health insurance expenses. Qualified employees are defined as those with annual wages of $5,000 or more. Business acquisitions involve transferring assets, including intangible assets, which can be amortized over 15 years under IRC Section 197. Amortization is similar to straight-line depreciation, with equal deductions each year. The bill proposes a new tax credit for small employers based on health insurance expenses. It also includes a provision to allow business taxpayers to amortize up to $5 million of intangible assets over five years, instead of the current 15 years, when acquiring firms with certain criteria. The bill proposes a new tax credit for small employers based on health insurance expenses. It includes a provision to allow business taxpayers to amortize up to $5 million of intangible assets over five years when acquiring firms with certain criteria. This would reduce the tax burden of the buyer in the first few years after the acquisition. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude 50% of any gain from the sale of qualified small business stock issued after August 10, 1993, and held for more than five years. QSBS can only be issued by C corporations with assets not exceeding $50 million or specialized small business investment companies. Taxpayers can exclude a portion of the gain on Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) issued by qualified entities that conduct business in federal empowerment zones. The provision aims to encourage investment in small start-up firms. H.R. 46 proposes a permanent increase in the exclusion of capital gains on the sale of QSBS. The proposed changes aim to increase the share of capital gains excluded under IRC Section 1202 for QSBS issued by qualified entities operating within or outside empowerment zones. Tax incentives exist to encourage equity investment in small start-up firms, including the exclusion of capital gains and deductions for losses from investing in small business investment companies. The bill proposes a new non-refundable tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified equity investments up to $500,000. Individual taxpayers can deduct losses from the sale of SBIC stock or stock issued by certain firms under IRC Section 1244. The bill proposes a new non-refundable tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified equity investments up to $500,000. Investors must be accredited and the business must meet size standards to qualify for the credit. The business must use at least 80% of its assets in a qualified trade or business to be eligible for the credit. The bill proposes a new non-refundable tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified equity investments up to $500,000. Investors must be accredited and the business must meet size standards to qualify for the credit. Activities related to research and development would meet the test of a qualified trade or business for the credit. A new tax credit under IRC Section 45N would be established for individuals who invest indirectly in small research-intensive companies. The bill proposes a new non-refundable tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified equity investments up to $500,000. Investors must be accredited and the business must meet size standards to qualify for the credit. A qualified research entity is defined as any domestic corporation or partnership dedicated to serving small business innovation companies and maintaining accountability to research professionals. A qualifying small business innovation company is defined as a corporation or partnership with specific financial criteria and devotes at least 50% of its expenditures to research qualifying for expensing under IRC Section 174. To qualify for the credit, an individual must purchase stock of a qualified research entity at its original issue. The bill proposes a new non-refundable tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified equity investments up to $500,000. Investors must be accredited and the business must meet size standards to qualify for the credit. A qualified research entity is defined as any domestic corporation or partnership dedicated to serving small business innovation companies and maintaining accountability to research professionals. The entity must use \"substantially all of such cash ... to make qualified research investments\" by investing \"at least 85% of (its) gross assets\" in qualified research investments. Annual limits on the aggregate credit that could be claimed in 2007 through 2011 are set at $500 million in 2007, $750 million in 2008 and 2009, and $1 billion in 2010 and 2011. The bill proposes a new tax credit for equity investment in small firms, allowing a 25% credit on qualified investments up to $500,000. The Treasury Secretary would allocate annual limits among research entities, with a maximum of $25 million per entity per year. Priority would be given to entities with a successful track record. Current federal tax law lacks incentives for employers to support military reservists or hire replacements for activated employees. The bill proposes a new non-refundable business tax credit for eligible small employers that employ military reservists. The credit would cover the difference between the compensation paid to activated reservist employees and their military pay, as well as compensation for replacements hired during active duty. The credit would be 40% of qualified compensation exceeding military pay, up to $25,000. The maximum credit an eligible small employer could claim for a single qualified employee in a tax year would be $10,000, while for a qualified replacement employee it would be $6,000. Eligible small employers can claim a credit for compensation paid to activated reservist employees and their replacements, up to $25,000. An eligible small employer with 100 or fewer employees can claim a tax credit for compensating qualified employees above their military pay during active duty. Self-employed taxpayers can also claim the credit, equal to 40% of the excess of their self-employment income over military pay. The credit applies to any excess up to $25,000 for members of the Ready Reserve."
