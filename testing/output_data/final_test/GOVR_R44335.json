After NPOESS ended, NOAA and NASA created the JPSS program for next-generation polar-orbiting weather satellites, with Suomi-NPP launched in 2011 as the first satellite in the series. Originally part of NPOESS, Suomi-NPP was a demonstration satellite for new instruments and spacecraft. The Suomi-NPP satellite, originally part of the NPOESS program, now serves as an operational satellite in the JPSS program, providing weather and climate information. Its life-cycle costs, along with the JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 satellites, will total approximately $11.3 billion. Suomi-NPP operates in the afternoon orbit, offering global coverage twice a day to enhance weather forecasts three to seven days in advance of severe weather events. The current polar-orbiting constellation includes Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites that collect weather data primarily for use by the Department of Defense and provide data to NOAA. There is a risk of a data gap in weather information due to the possibility of Suomi-NPP satellite failure before the launch of JPSS-1 in March 2017, potentially causing an 11-month gap in data if Suomi-NPP fails at the end of its expected life. The potential data gap in weather information due to Suomi-NPP satellite failure before the launch of JPSS-1 in March 2017 could last 6 months if Suomi-NPP fails early or if JPSS-1 is delayed. The gap duration could be shorter if Suomi-NPP operates longer than expected and JPSS-1 launches on schedule. The uncertainty of a data gap is highlighted in Figure 1, showing the schedule for JPSS satellites and partner polar-orbiting satellites. The NOAA witness stated that there is a high probability that Suomi-NPP will continue operating beyond the launch of JPSS-1, potentially avoiding a data gap. However, the GAO reported that if Suomi-NPP were to fail, there could be a gap of up to 23 months before JPSS-1 becomes operational. The launch and operation of the JPSS-1 satellite is crucial to avoid a potential data gap. If JPSS-1 fails on launch, there could be a gap until JPSS-2 is operational in mid-2022, leading to a data gap ranging from zero to seven years. NOAA's strategy for mitigating such a gap and long-range planning for polar-orbiting weather satellites is essential. A 2013 report highlighted the fragility of the current JPSS program and the lack of robustness in the future polar program. The future polar program is deemed not robust, with specific definitions provided in the report. A robust program requires two failures before a gap occurs, while a fragile program is one failure away from catastrophe. The currently fragile JPSS program is described as a single string system with potential gaps lasting months to years. The report emphasizes the need for a robust program with multiple overlapping spacecraft to prevent data gaps. The IRT report recommends establishing a robust polar weather program focused solely on high-priority weather instruments to prevent data gaps in the JPSS program. Inclusion of non-weather instruments is discouraged to avoid schedule risks. The IRT report recommends focusing on high-priority weather instruments to prevent data gaps in the JPSS program. A \"gap-filler\" program with only ATMS and CrIS instruments is suggested to cover potential gaps in data collection. The IRT report recommended a gap-filler plan to prevent data gaps in the JPSS program and move closer to the goal of robustness. NOAA's strategy for addressing data gaps and ensuring continuity of polar-orbiting weather data includes the Polar Follow On (PFO) program with a $380 million funding request in FY2016. The PFO program aims to mitigate possible instrument failures and secure long-term data continuity. NOAA's mitigation strategy for potential instrument failures in the JPSS program includes the development of the Earth Observing Nanosatellite-Microwave (EON-MW) to measure atmospheric temperature and moisture. The budget request for EON-MW in FY2016 was $10 million. In the event of premature failure of JPSS-2, JPSS-3 would be launched with only two instruments, ATMS and CrIS, as a gap-filler measure. NOAA's mitigation strategy for potential instrument failures in the JPSS program includes the development of the Earth Observing Nanosatellite-Microwave (EON-MW) to measure atmospheric temperature and moisture. The budget request for EON-MW in FY2016 was $10 million. In case of a contingency, a two-instrument satellite would replace the full JPSS-3 mission, with the other instruments likely flying aboard JPSS-4. Additionally, NOAA proposed procuring six radio occultation (RO) sensors as part of the COSMIC-2 mission to mitigate data loss from ATMS or CrIS sounders on weather satellites. NOAA allocated an additional $9.9 million in FY2016 to purchase a second set of six sensors for launch in 2019. The budget justification defines a robust polar-orbiting weather satellite program as one that can withstand two failures without data gaps and can restore functionality within a year of a failure. The goal is to achieve robustness by 2023 and manage JPSS-2, JPSS-3, and JPSS-4 as an integrated program. The PFO plan aims to achieve a resilient and fault-tolerant position by 2023 and secure it through 2038 with a minimum budget request of $380 million in FY2016. The EON-MW free flyer satellite would test cutting-edge microwave technology on a CubeSat platform, potentially lowering costs and enabling more robust systems in the future. Launching EON-MW in 2019 would provide near-term data-gap mitigation if JPSS-1 experiences issues before JPSS-2 launch, aligning with the IRT 2013 report recommendation for a gap filler satellite. Members of Congress expressed concerns about a possible data gap during budget appropriations discussions. Members of the House and Senate expressed concerns about a data gap in polar-orbiting weather satellites. House appropriators did not fund PFO in H.R. 2578, but instructed NOAA to develop solutions for possible data gaps in polar-orbiting satellites. The bill fully funded COSMIC-2 at $20 million for FY2016, emphasizing its value as a potential gap filler for the JPSS program. The committee also required a plan for six additional COSMIC satellites. Launch of the second set of sensors was delayed to FY2019. The launch of the second set of six sensors was delayed to FY2019, with concerns raised about potential data gaps in polar-orbiting weather satellites by members of the House and Senate. Chairman Shelby expressed concerns about NOAA finishing satellite programs on time and on budget, as well as the lack of specific details in the FY2016 PFO request. Senator Rubio requested more information about program costs beyond FY2016. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker emphasized the need for full funding of the Polar Follow-On (PFO) program to avoid a data gap in polar-orbiting weather satellites. Despite her warning, the Senate subcommittee allocated $135 million for PFO, $10 million less than the Administration's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, ultimately funded PFO at $370 million and directed NOAA to conduct an independent cost estimate of the program within 180 days. The bill funded the Polar Follow-On (PFO) program at $370 million for FY2016, reflecting congressional support for NOAA's polar-orbiting weather satellite program. Congress will closely monitor the program's cost and schedule changes due to past issues with NPOESS and JPSS. The success of the PFO program depends on Congress appropriating funding to meet program needs without disrupting the satellite development process. Appropriators may need to adjust funding levels to prevent major delays in program development, as seen in the FY2016 CRs for NOAA. In the FY2016 omnibus appropriations bill, Congress disagrees with the Administration's proposal for a free-flyer EON-MW satellite to address a potential data gap after the launch of JPSS-1. The House favors using RO technology as a short-term solution. NOAA is exploring the feasibility of commercial data services for weather information. If Suomi-NPP remains operational and JPSS-1 launches on schedule, there may be no data gap in afternoon orbit coverage. Despite the fragility of the current program, there will be no data gap in the afternoon orbit coverage. The path to a robust program will take many years, with potential achievement by 2023 if Congress continues to support and fund PFO. Congressional oversight will be a priority for ensuring robustness versus fragility in the polar-orbiting weather satellite system."
