    "content": "The Employee Benefits Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000 may be cited as the \"Employee Benefits Eligibility Fairness Act.\" The Employee Benefits Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000 aims to protect workers' pension and welfare benefits by addressing the mislabeling of employees to exclude them from benefit plans. Mislabeled employees, such as temporary or part-time workers, are denied benefits that should be available to them. (2) Mislabeled employees are often paid through staffing or temporary firms to appear as if they do not work for their actual employer. This violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. (3) Employers are adjusting benefit plans to include mislabeled employees. Employers are amending benefit plans to exclude mislabeled employees from participating, even if they are eligible. Mislabeled employees are often required to sign documents waiving their rights to participate in benefit plans, which violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 clarifies provisions to prevent employees from being wrongly excluded from benefit plans due to mislabeling of their employment status. SEC. 3.
