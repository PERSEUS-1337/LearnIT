They have endorsed the 2009 U.S.-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, focusing on defense, security, trade, energy, and democratization cooperation. Georgia has supported NATO and the U.S. with troops for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, serving as a key transit route for personnel and cargo. Georgia's strategic location in the \"Northern Distribution Network\" and as part of the \"Southern Corridor\" for gas and oil pipelines is exemplified by its role in trade and transit routes. The 2013 presidential election saw a shift in power to the Georgia Dream party coalition led by Giorgi Margvelashvili after a contentious legislative election. President Mikheil Saakashvili cooperated with the new government led by Bidzina Ivanishvili, despite some opposition to GD policies. The 2013 presidential election in Georgia marked a shift in power to the Georgia Dream party coalition led by Giorgi Margvelashvili. President Mikheil Saakashvili opposed some GD actions, including investigations and arrests of former officials, leading to calls for cooperation between the president and prime minister. Saakashvili retired after completing two terms, resulting in a transfer of executive powers to the prime minister and legislature as per constitutional amendments approved in 2010. The president previously nominated the prime minister, but now the majority party in the legislature has the right to choose and approve the nominee, cabinet selectees, and policy program. The prime minister now has powers such as appointing local governors and nominating ambassadors, and the president must consult with the prime minister on certain issues. The president can no longer dismiss the prime minister or submit bills to the legislature. The constitutional changes were seen as a way for Saakashvili to become a powerful prime minister after stepping down as president. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) praised Georgia's presidential elections as democratic. Amendments to the electoral code were made to improve the process, including banning the use of government resources for candidates and requiring candidates to resign from government posts. Twenty-three out of 54 candidates were registered by the Central Election Commission (CEC).

The media environment was considered more balanced, with TV9 closed down by Ivanishvili and Rustavi-2 providing more neutral coverage. The Central Electoral Commission reported a 46.6% voter turnout. Some observers attributed the low turnout to the relatively low participation compared to past elections.

Despite some dissatisfaction with GD's economic stewardship, Prime Minister Ivanishvili remained popular. UNM activists claimed party support, but the election reaffirmed GD's power shift. UNM activists claim the party's popularity increased since late 2012, surviving arrests and investigations. Prime Minister Ivanishvili criticized Bakradze's support, attributing it to a lack of political culture. Nino Burjanadze's third place finish raised doubts about her plans, with claims of fraudulent voting due to an uneven playing field. Some candidates disputed election results, alleging fraud and an uneven playing field. Despite concerns, observers noted a relatively peaceful campaign compared to past violence. There were demands for recounts and protests, indicating ongoing political tensions in Georgia. Concerns have been raised about potential political instability in Georgia following Saakashvili's exit and Ivanishvili's planned resignation. This instability could lead to fractures within political coalitions, intense competition, and even violence during local elections in mid-2014. NDI has highlighted trends such as coercion against opposition members, harassment of minorities, and political polarization as threats to democratization progress. During the election campaign, Georgians questioned if Ivanishvili would step down as prime minister after Margvelashvili's election. Ivanishvili proposed Interior Minister Garibashvili as the new prime minister, who was accepted by the legislative majority. Garibashvili will be formally designated as the nominee by the president after approval by the legislature. Ivanishvili plans to move to the civil sector but will maintain a significant influence.

Observers predict that he aims to play an influential role in future politics, as seen in his intention to suggest a candidate for the 2014 Tbilisi mayoral election. Garibashvili, who has worked for Ivanishvili, is expected to continue his policies if confirmed as prime minister. Concerns arise that Georgia may become more like other plutocratic developing countries if Ivanishvili continues to dominate politics. Some observers raise concerns about the political environment in Georgia where former leaders Ivanishvili and Saakashvili may still wield influence without being held accountable. Ivanishvili has made conflicting statements about Saakashvili's potential prosecution, suggesting forgiveness on one hand and possible arrest on the other. Saakashvili may face arrest if crimes are proven, with concerns raised by London's Financial Times that the EU may delay an association agreement with Georgia. Before stepping down, Saakashvili pardoned nearly 250 officials and activists. Former defense minister Bacho Akhalaia was convicted of abuse of office and later pardoned. After being pardoned by outgoing President Saakashvili, Margvelashvili remains in detention pending trial on other charges.
