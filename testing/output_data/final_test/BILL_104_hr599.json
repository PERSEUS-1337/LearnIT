    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations Refinancing Act\". The \"Administrator\" in this Act refers to the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. \"Capital investment\" is a cost funded by Federal appropriations for a project or facility that the Administrator must establish rates to repay to the United States Treasury. This excludes Federal irrigation investments and investments financed by current revenues or bonds issued by the Administrator. The \"Administrator\" under the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act is defined as the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. \"New capital investment\" refers to investments made after September 30, 1995, while \"old capital investment\" refers to investments made before October 1, 1995. The \"repayment date\" is the deadline for repaying the principal amount of a capital investment, and the \"Treasury rate\" is defined as well. The \"Treasury rate\" is the interest rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for old and new capital investments based on prevailing market yields. The Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for capital investments based on prevailing market yields. The rate is used for outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States with maturity periods comparable to the repayment date for new capital investments. SEC. 3. NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. Effective October 1, 1995, old capital investments have new principal amounts calculated based on the present value of old payment amounts and a fraction of $100,000,000. The Administrator, with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury, determines new principal amounts and interest rates. For the purposes of this section, \"old payment amounts\" refer to the annual interest and principal that the Administrator would have paid to the United States Treasury from October 1, 1995, if this Act were not enacted. The principal is repaid based on assigned repayment dates, and interest is also paid accordingly. The Administrator assigned interest rates before October 1, 1993, for old capital investments. For investments without assigned rates, the Secretary of the Treasury determines rates based on prevailing market yields. The Administrator assigned interest rates for old capital investments before October 1, 1993, based on prevailing market yields. The periods to maturity are comparable to the fiscal year's beginning and the repayment date. SEC. 4. INTEREST RATE FOR NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS\n\nEffective October 1, 1995, the unpaid balance on the new principal amount for old capital investments accrues interest annually at the Treasury rate until repayment.\n\nSEC. 5. REPAYMENT DATES\n\nThe repayment date for new principal amounts is no earlier than the repayment date for the old capital investment assumed in section 3(c)(1).\n\nSEC. 6. PREPAYMENT LIMITATIONS\n\nFrom October 1, 1995, to September 30, 2000, the Administrator can prepay up to $100,000,000 of new principal amounts for old capital investments established under section 3. SEC. 7. INTEREST RATES FOR NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENTS DURING CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 7. INTEREST RATES FOR NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENTS DURING CONSTRUCTION. The principal amount of a new capital investment includes interest in each fiscal year of construction at a rate equal to the one-year rate for the fiscal year on construction expenditures and accrued interest. The Administrator is not required to pay the interest during construction. The 'one-year rate' is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The one-year rate is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States with periods to maturity of approximately one year. SEC. 8 states that the unpaid balance on a new capital investment bears interest at the Treasury rate until repayment. SEC. 9 amends the Confederated Tribe of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act by addressing appropriated amounts. The Administrator is appropriated varying amounts annually without fiscal year limitation, starting from $15.25 million in fiscal year 1996. This is for payments to the Tribes under a settlement agreement resolving their claims. The settlement agreement was signed in 1994 between the United States and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The curr_chunk states that \"Tribes\" refers to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a federally recognized Indian Tribe. SEC. 10. CONTRACT PROVISIONS. In contracts of the Administrator for selling electric power, transmission, or related services after September 30, 1995, rates and charges shall be based on the new principal amount and interest rate established by the Act. In contracts for selling electric power, rates and charges are based on the new principal amount and interest rate established by the Act. Payments of principal on old capital investments reduce the outstanding balance, while interest payments on the unpaid balance are credited against the appropriate interest account. No additional charges may be imposed for repayment to the United States Treasury. The Act specifies that payments for old capital investments to the United States Treasury must be made through various means, and funds from section 1304 of title 31 are designated for judgments or settlements related to contract breaches. The Act does not prevent the Administrator from recovering taxes from electric utilities or affect their authority under applicable laws. The Act allows for the allocation of costs and benefits, including fish and wildlife costs, to rates or resources, and the design of rates under applicable law. SEC. 11. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not affect the obligation of the Administrator to repay the principal and interest on capital investments from the Administrator's net proceeds. The Administrator retains the authority to pay off a portion of the principal amount before the repayment date."
