It also addresses elder abuse prevention and nutrition services for older individuals. The \"RUSH Act\" includes provisions for defining, organizing, and implementing programs to assist Holocaust survivors, addressing elder abuse prevention, and providing nutrition services for older individuals. The purposes of the Act include providing preference for services to older individuals who are Holocaust survivors, designating a responsible individual within the Administration on Aging for these individuals, ensuring meals meet special dietary needs, and supporting programs for mobility and self-sufficiency. During the Holocaust, an estimated 6,000,000 Jews and millions from other targeted groups were murdered by the Nazis. Over 200,000 Jews found refuge in the United States from 1933 to 1945, with more settling in the following years. Jewish refugees continued to immigrate to the US from Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany's 2011 Worldbook provides estimates on the Nazi victim population. According to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany's 2011 Worldbook, the estimated Nazi victim population in the United States is 120,935, with 3 in 5 victims being women. The average age of a Nazi victim is 80, and nearly one-quarter are age 85 or older. Holocaust survivors continue to live with mental and physical scars, and institutionalization can have adverse effects on them. Holocaust survivors may experience panic, anxiety, and re-traumatization in institutionalized settings due to past experiences. Findings show that survivors are economically and socially vulnerable, have poorer health, more disabilities, and rely heavily on social service programs compared to non-victims. Holocaust survivors require various services like personal care, meals, transportation, counseling, and mental health support to improve their health and quality of life. Community organizations note that two-thirds of survivors live alone, which increases the risk of hospitalization, poverty, depression, and other health issues. Many survivors, especially those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union after 1965, have low incomes. Holocaust survivors, especially those from the Soviet Union after 1965, have low incomes below the poverty threshold in the United States. Community organizations emphasize the importance of transportation for survivors to access medical appointments, shop, visit family, and participate in social events. Providers serving older adults, including Holocaust survivors, require additional capacity to meet the growing demand for services. The Administration for Community Living in the Department of Health and Human Services plays a key role in supporting these populations. The Department of Health and Human Services focuses on increasing access to community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. The Administration for Community Living aims to enhance the well-being of older adults and individuals with disabilities. Social service agencies funded under the Older Americans Act provide specialized meals for diverse seniors with unique dietary needs.
