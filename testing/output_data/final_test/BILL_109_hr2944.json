    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gross Overcharging Undermines Gasoline Economics Act\". The findings of the Act are also included. Congress finds that from May 2004 to May 2005, US gasoline prices rose by 24 percent, with most oil companies showing huge profits, some as much as 200 percent. Despite consumer protection statutes in 24 states, concerns about being \"gouged\" persist. Gas prices spike at the pump, concerns about gouging persist. Federal Trade Commission has not found antitrust violations. Investigation needed to determine if charges are due to collusion or market influences. Gas prices expected to rise indefinitely, impacting transportation costs and consumer finances. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Defines \"base price index\" as the average closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for gasoline contracts and \"rate of inflation\" as the average consumer price index. The Act prohibits selling gasoline at retail above a certain price determined by the base price index and inflation rate. A regional price structure index will be developed to account for regional differences. Violations will result in civil penalties ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 per offense, with each day of violation considered a separate offense. The section, except for subsection (b), will take effect 90 days after the enactment of this Act. The Federal Trade Commission will provide Congress with an annual report on gasoline price collusion, antitrust practices in the oil industry, and consumer protection policies. Additionally, the Act will implement changes related to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 90 days after enactment. Congress finds that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created to enhance the physical and economic security of the United States, provide relief during oil and gasoline supply shortages, offer gasoline price relief to families, and counterbalance OPEC's supply management policies. Despite being over 98 percent full, the current policy of filling the reserve continues. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, over 98 percent full, could worsen rising crude oil prices and record high gasoline prices. Price protection measures include halting new acquisitions for 30 days and releasing 1,000,000 barrels of oil per day. Additional measures may be taken to alleviate the economic burden of high gasoline prices in the US. To counteract the efforts of OPEC to profit from crude oil and support the US economy, the Secretary can extend measures for an extra 30 days. SEC. 7. PRICING AND ECONOMIC IMPACT COMMISSION.
