The \"Children First SCHIP Improvement Act of 2002\" allows the use of retained and redistributed SCHIP allotments for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 through fiscal year 2003. Amendments are made to section 2104(g) of the Social Security Act regarding fiscal year 2000 allotments. The \"Children First SCHIP Improvement Act of 2002\" allows states to use unspent funds from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003. High unemployment states have a special rule for the allocation of funds. The \"Children First SCHIP Improvement Act of 2002\" allows states to use unspent funds from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003. A high unemployment state is defined as a state with an unemployment rate of at least 6 percent in two consecutive months in 2002. The \"Children First SCHIP Improvement Act of 2002\" allows states to use unspent funds from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003. A new amendment prioritizes the use of unexpended funds from fiscal years 1998 through 2000 for child health assistance under the title. The \"Children First SCHIP Improvement Act of 2002\" allows states to use unspent funds from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003 for child health assistance under title XIX. The amendments made by this section are effective as if enacted on September 30, 2002, with amounts from fiscal years 1998 through 2000 available for expenditure on and after October 1, 2002. SCHIP coverage extended for children above Medicaid mandatory level in certain states meeting additional requirements. Section 2110(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for eligible States with family income exceeding the Medicaid applicable income level. An eligible State is defined as one that meets specific conditions, including expanded eligibility of children under Medicaid. Title XIX allows children under 19 with family income below 185% of the poverty line to receive medical assistance. The State child health plan must have the highest income eligibility standard, no waiting lists, and provide benefits to all children. The State's plan for medical assistance and child health plan must not deny coverage or care due to inability to pay premiums or cost-sharing. A uniform, simplified application form should be used for eligible children. The State must not impose an asset test for eligibility under this title or section 1902(l) for children. The State must also provide a 12-month continuous enrollment option and coordinate the enrollment process with the State child health plan. The enrollment process under this title is coordinated with title XIX to ensure families only need to interact with one agency to determine eligibility for benefits. Transfers of enrollment occur without a gap in coverage for children whose family income changes. Automatic reassessment of eligibility and verification policies are also in place. The State ensures initial and redeterminations of eligibility for children eligible for medical assistance are done using the same verification policies and forms as under title XIX. Automatic reassessment of eligibility is also conducted for such children."
