    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004\". The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and thunderstorms on life, property, and the economy. The United States faces billions of dollars in damages annually due to windstorms, exacerbated by rapid development in high-risk areas. Implementing cost-effective design, construction methods, and mitigation programs at various levels can help reduce these losses. The Federal Government acknowledges the impact of windstorms on life, property, and the economy. There is a need for improved data collection, engineering research, and public education to reduce windstorm impact. Federal support and interagency coordination are essential for effective windstorm impact reduction programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Director: Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n(2) State: Each state of the United States, including territories and possessions.\n(3) Windstorm: Storm with damaging wind component like hurricanes, tornadoes.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (referred to as the \"Program\") aims to achieve significant reductions in losses of life and property from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort. An Interagency Working Group will be established to collaborate with various organizations in improving understanding of windstorms and developing cost-effective mitigation measures. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program establishes an Interagency Working Group to coordinate federal efforts in reducing losses from windstorms. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will lead the group and oversee planning, management, and budget coordination. Agency roles will be defined in an implementation plan, with responsibilities including research on building codes and standards by NIST and engineering and atmospheric sciences by the National Science Foundation. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program aims to improve understanding of windstorms and their impact on buildings, structures, and lifelines through research and development of risk assessment tools and mitigation techniques. The program consists of three primary mitigation components focused on enhancing knowledge of windstorms. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program includes mitigation components such as improved understanding of windstorms, impact assessment, and reduction activities like data collection, risk assessment, outreach, technology transfer, and research. Research activities should be peer-reviewed, and efforts should complement existing hazard reduction initiatives. Activities to enhance understanding of windstorms involve research on severe wind impacts on buildings and infrastructure. Activities for windstorm impact assessment aim to improve assessment techniques. The windstorm impact assessment involves collecting information on building performance, improving loss estimation systems, and enhancing simulation modeling. Reduction activities include outreach development. The development of cost-effective and affordable windstorm-resistant systems, structures, and materials for new construction and retrofitting existing buildings, along with outreach and information dissemination on construction techniques and risk assessment to officials and the construction industry. The Interagency Working Group will develop and submit an implementation plan to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment. The plan will assess past and current efforts to reduce windstorm impacts, describe technology transfer and coordination plans, outline strategic goals and priorities for each Program component area, and explain how the Program will achieve its objectives. The Interagency Working Group will submit a biennial report to Congress on the windstorm impact reduction program, detailing progress made in the preceding two fiscal years and including recommendations for legislative action. The report will consider Advisory Committee recommendations and describe plans for cooperation with public and private sector entities in each program component area. The National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction is established. The Director establishes a National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction with 11-15 non-Federal members. The Committee assesses trends in windstorm impact reduction, Program effectiveness, the need for revisions, and Program management. A biennial report is required. The Advisory Committee must report to Congress and the Interagency Working Group every two years on the assessment conducted. The Committee established under this section is exempt from Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not override the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Any new design or construction method developed under this Act is not mandatory for homes certified under the 1974 Act without following the consensus development process. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- Federal Emergency Management Agency: $8,700,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n- National Science Foundation: $8,700,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $9,400,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n- National Institute of Standards and Technology: $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2007. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized $2,100,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2007. SEC. 8. BIENNIAL REPORT. Amends the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act to require a report by January 30 of each odd-numbered year. Passed the House of Representatives on July 7, 2004."
