The administration has consistently pursued barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border as a high priority. On April 4, 2018, citing a surge in border activity, the President directed key officials to coordinate action to stop the flow of drugs, criminals, and illegal aliens into the country. The President directed the mobilization of the National Guard to support DHS at the border and requested $5.7 billion for a steel barrier. A partial government shutdown ensued over the funding, leading to the declaration of a national state of emergency to redirect $6.1 billion in DOD funds for border barrier construction. The Administration's plans for border barrier construction included $2.5 billion in defense funds for counterdrug activities and $3.6 billion for construction authority in case of a national emergency. This report provides a summary of internal and interagency communication related to DOD's execution of President Trump's border wall funding plan, based on court exhibits and declarations in legal proceedings. In early 2018, DOD froze $947 million for possible border barrier projects using 10 U.S.C. \u00a7284 funds. A new office called the Border Security Support Cell was created in April 2018 to manage border issues, led by ASD(HD&GS) Kenneth Rapuano. In response to DHS's request for support in impeding illegal entry and drug smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border, DOD approved $2.5 billion for seven border barrier projects in March-April 2019. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will handle planning and construction, transferring custody to DHS upon completion. In April 2019, DOD approved $2.5 billion for seven border barrier projects requested by DHS. The funds were transferred in two tranches, with $1 billion for three projects in March and $1.5 billion for four projects in May. Court injunctions temporarily suspended the funds' obligation between May and July 2019, but the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the injunction in July, allowing work to proceed. Litigation related to the reprogramming actions remains ongoing. DHS requested anticipated savings from lower construction costs to fund three additional projects, but DOD later terminated the plan due to insufficient savings. On September 30, 2019, DOD announced the transfer of $129 million in expiring FY2019 appropriations for border barrier projects. Additionally, USACE would need an extra $90 million in FY2020 funds for project management. Unlike previous transfers, the Administration plans to fund costs in FY2020 directly from counternarcotic account appropriations. DHS requested DOD assistance for 38 new border barrier projects along drug smuggling corridors. DOD approved 31 projects and reprogrammed $3.8 billion from FY2020 military procurement funds. The funds were drawn from congressional special interest items in the final FY2020 defense appropriation. DOD's use of emergency statute 10 U.S.C. \u00a72808 followed eight months of deliberations, including assessments by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff conducted two assessments to determine if border barriers met the requirements of 10 U.S.C. \u00a72808 for use during a national emergency. The preliminary assessment acknowledged challenges in quantifying the effectiveness of barriers but suggested they could reduce the demand for DOD resources over time. The construction of physical barriers along the southern border is expected to reduce challenges for CBP and decrease DHS requirements for DoD support. DOD requested a prioritized list of projects to support military personnel, which DHS characterized as force multipliers. This will likely reduce DHS's reliance on DoD for various types of support. The Secretary of Defense requested a detailed analysis of proposed border construction projects in April 2019. General Joseph Dunford delivered his final assessment in May 2019, based on the presumption that barrier construction would have ripple effects supporting the use of emergency authority. The Secretary of Defense requested a detailed analysis of proposed border construction projects in April 2019. General Joseph Dunford delivered his final assessment in May 2019, based on the presumption that barrier construction would have ripple effects supporting the use of emergency authority. The analysis assessed border barrier projects requested by DHS under specific statutes, with a prioritization scheme developed by the CJCS team lacking key details related to land jurisdiction. The final recommendations were later revised and included in an action memorandum to the Secretary of Defense on August 21, 2019. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper directed the Acting Secretary of the Army to proceed with border barrier construction on September 3, 2019, as it would serve as a \"force multiplier\" for reducing DHS's demand for DOD personnel and assets. The Acting Secretary of the Army was directed to proceed with the construction of 11 DHS border barrier projects and defer approximately 127 existing military construction projects ($3.6 billion). The plan includes deferring military construction projects located at non-U.S. locations first, followed by projects within the United States, to prioritize funds and provide time to work with Congress and allies on restoring funds and improving burden sharing for overseas projects. The use of military construction funds for border barrier projects depends on the project location, with delays possible for projects on land under other federal jurisdictions or private land. The Department of the Interior transferred jurisdiction of land for five projects to the Department of Defense for three years. The section provides an overview of key documents related to the Administration's use of 10 U.S.C. 284 and 10 U.S.C. 2808 to fund border barriers. Tables include summaries, citations, and links for access by congressional users. Table 1 contains reference documents compiled by CRS, while Table 2 and Table 3 detail decision-making processes related to 10 U.S.C. 284. Table 2 and Table 3 summarize decision-making processes for 10 U.S.C. 284 and 10 U.S.C. 2808, respectively, showing separate tracks for interagency deliberations."
