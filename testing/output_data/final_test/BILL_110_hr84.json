    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Buildings Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a grant program for energy-efficient buildings. The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program, established by the Secretary of Energy, awards grants to businesses and organizations for constructing energy efficient buildings or renovating existing ones to showcase innovative energy efficiency technologies. Grants are awarded competitively based on proposals demonstrating the likelihood to meet or exceed specified standards. The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program awards grants for energy efficient buildings, considering cost-effective opportunities, advanced technologies, and private investment leverage. The Secretary gives consideration to buildings serving low and moderate income populations. Grants cover up to 50% of design and energy modeling costs, capped at $50,000 per building, with a limit of 3 grants per year per grantee. The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program pays 50% of the grant upon selection and the remaining 50% after certification of energy efficiency by a professional. Failure to comply results in no payment unless certified within 6 months. The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program requires buildings to be certified for energy efficiency within 6 months of completion of renovations. The Secretary must report to Congress on grants awarded and estimate cost and energy savings. Administrative expenses cannot exceed 10% of funds. Energy efficient building is defined as a building that... The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program requires buildings to be certified for energy efficiency within 6 months of completion of renovations. The term \"energy efficient building\" means a building that achieves a reduction in energy consumption of at least 30% for new construction or at least 20% for major renovations, constructed or renovated according to current voluntary consensus standards. The Energy Efficient Building Pilot Grant Program mandates that buildings use HVAC systems meeting Energy Star standards or Federal Energy Management Program recommendations after construction or renovation. $10,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary annually from 2008 to 2012 for implementation."
