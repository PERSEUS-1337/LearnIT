This resulted in electricity shortages, affecting manufacturing and global shipping in the auto supply chain. The Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan caused disruptions in the global auto supply chain due to the fragility of some elements. With over 15,000 parts in a typical motor vehicle, the lack of essential components halted vehicle production and assembly lines. Japanese suppliers, known for their automotive technologies, struggled to meet commitments, impacting global supply chains for months. The Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan caused disruptions in the global auto supply chain, impacting industries like autos, telecommunications, and consumer electronics. U.S. auto production facilities may experience slowdowns, affecting employment and paychecks in the Midwest and South. The motor vehicle industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with concerns about the future of auto manufacturing in the United States. Toyota and Volkswagen have opened new plants in Mississippi. In 2011, Toyota and Volkswagen opened new plants in Mississippi and Tennessee, respectively, while Nissan is building a new plant in Tennessee. U.S. auto production has seen a recovery since the recession of 2009, with vehicles sourced globally and containing parts from various countries. Automakers have seen a recovery in production, with forecasts indicating a potential increase in North American production and U.S. sales to about 13 million units in 2011. The supply chain in the automotive industry includes raw materials, parts, financing, advertising, management, and distribution. Assembly plants are primarily located from Ontario to central Mexico, with numerous parts suppliers serving final assemblers like General Motors and Honda under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, parts and finished vehicles move freely between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Automakers, including Toyota and VW, have plants in right-to-work states in the South. Foreign automakers and major suppliers have established plants in the South, impacting local economies beyond the Great Lakes region. The close proximity of suppliers and automakers is due to the need for motor vehicles and their main parts to be near assembly plants. The automotive industry implements \"lean\" production techniques to keep parts production close to final assembly, reducing transportation costs. Just-in-Time (JIT) parts deliveries are crucial for lean production, cutting costs and waste in the manufacturing process. Foreign direct investment in the automotive sector has also impacted local economies. Foreign direct investment and global sourcing of auto parts have increased significantly since the 1980s due to falling trade barriers. About one-fourth of all auto parts used in the United States are imported from Asia or Europe, especially electronics. Japan, Canada, and Mexico are major non-U.S. auto parts suppliers, with Japan exporting tires, seat belts, air bags, and more to the U.S. The automotive supply chain operates globally, with supplier firms taking on more responsibilities. The automotive supply chain is regional and near major markets, with assembly and parts production concentrated geographically. Unlike other industries, the auto industry is more regionally integrated, with few companies in a few countries leading the market. The concentration of the auto industry in few companies in a few countries has hindered the establishment of industry-level standards, leading to widespread customization of parts and vehicles. Suppliers often provide specific parts unique to particular vehicle models, which can cause disruptions in final auto assembly. The recent earthquake/tsunami and nuclear events in Japan have disrupted the auto parts supply chain, especially for certain electronics used in vehicles. The growing role of electronics in cars presents a challenge for manufacturers, as traditional mechanical components are now supplemented with electronic mechanisms. For example, modern car keys have both mechanical and electronic functions, with a semiconductor sending signals to the car's computer. The semiconductor in the plastic key molding sends a signal to the car's computer, enabling the key to open the door and start the ignition. Electronics have become a significant part of auto design since the 1970s, providing fuel economy, emissions control, safety features, and more. Electronics comprised about 19% of vehicle cost in 2004. Electronics in vehicles have become increasingly important, with estimates suggesting they may make up 40% of vehicle cost by 2015. Computing capacity has also significantly increased, with microcontrollers becoming 100 times more powerful in just three generations. All vehicles in developed countries now have some level of computerization, even low-end models. Critical automotive applications like electronic fuel injection and airbags are now standard technology in all cars. The advancement of electronics in vehicles has led to the integration of critical technologies such as airbags, antilock braking systems (ABS), all-wheel drive (AWD), and global positioning systems (GPS). These technologies rely on electronic sensors and microcontrollers to enhance safety and performance on the road. Global positioning systems (GPS) in vehicles provide driving directions, track vehicle location, speed, and assist in theft recovery. Computer diagnostics monitor vehicle systems, assist in diagnosing issues, and reduce guesswork in maintenance. Electronics in hybrid and all-electric vehicles manage engine-electric motor transitions and regulate battery temperatures and performance. The Japan disasters have impacted North American production and sales, with analysts predicting a significant decrease in second quarter U.S. production. Automotive products like microprocessors and a unique paint pigment have been affected, causing shortages for all major automakers. Specialty paints like Xirallic pigments are among the products impacted. The Japan disasters have impacted automakers globally, with specialty paints like Xirallic pigments being affected due to the shutdown of the only plant that produces them near the Fukushima nuclear reactor. This led to temporary unavailability of paint colors for automakers like Ford, Chrysler, Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, and GM, resulting in less shiny new cars and lost markups for dealers and carmakers. Ford, Hyundai, and Honda faced temporary unavailability of certain paint colors due to the shutdown of the plant producing Xirallic pigments near the Fukushima nuclear reactor. Japanese electronics suppliers like Renesas, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Hitachi were also affected by the disaster, impacting the global automotive industry's supply chain. Renesas Electronics, a major vehicle chip maker, had its production disrupted, causing a ripple effect in the industry. Renesas Electronics, a major vehicle chip maker, faced production disruptions after the merger with NEC Electronics in 2010. The Renesas plant is expected to be out of commission until mid-June at the earliest, operating at only 10% capacity when production resumes. Transferring production to other plants may take several months, leading to a potential four-month delay in meeting demand. Freescale Semiconductor's Japanese plant near Sendai was too damaged to reopen, further impacting the auto industry's supply chain. Parts like microcontrollers are in short supply due to the customized nature of the industry's supply chain. The shortage of microcontrollers is causing difficulties in finding replacements, as the software for these chips is not standardized. Smaller suppliers in Japan are facing challenges due to power shortages and some have yet to reopen, affecting larger firms like Keihin Corp. operating at reduced capacity. Some Japanese suppliers remain closed, causing larger firms like Keihin to operate at less than full capacity. This has led to supply chain issues for Keihin's U.S. plants, with 10% of components coming from Japan. Kawasaki Motors in the U.S. faced layoffs due to faulty parts from a Japanese supplier post-earthquake. Toyota is experiencing shortages of rubber components, with Denso Corp. lending a plant to help smaller suppliers like Fujikura Rubber. Denso Corp., a Tier 1 supplier, is lending one of its plants to Fujikura Rubber, a smaller supplier affected by the earthquake. Toyota prioritizes restoring industrial rubber products over Denso's plans to assemble automotive air conditioners. The March 11 disasters temporarily closed plants producing 17 of the top 20 Japanese vehicle models in the US, leading to closures at General Motors and Peugeot. Japan's motor vehicle manufacturing facilities are spread across Honshu, with Nissan and Toyota operating plants in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures. The government of Japan announced the closure of the Chubu nuclear plant due to earthquake vulnerability, impacting power supply to major auto manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki, Honda, and Mitsubishi. Japan's electricity system with different cycle frequencies poses challenges for manufacturers in accessing power. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry warned of a potential 25% electricity capacity cut during the summer. The closure of the Chubu nuclear plant in Japan due to earthquake vulnerability has led to a potential 25% electricity capacity cut during the summer. This is having a significant impact on Japanese automakers in both Japanese and North American auto plants, with disruptions forecasted to last until the end of the year. Japanese automakers could see a drop of 2.2 million units in production in Japan and 1.6 million units outside of Japan. Non-Japanese automakers outside of Japan are also expected to lose about 450,000 units this year. Japanese automakers are facing production losses due to the closure of the Chubu nuclear plant in Japan, with disruptions expected to last until the end of the year. Globally, a total of 4.2 million units are projected to be lost, with 450,000 units expected to be lost outside of Japan. Dealerships are also affected, with shortages of vehicle parts like shock absorbers and body panel assemblies anticipated. AutoNation, the largest dealership group in the US, may receive only half as many vehicles as ordered from Japanese manufacturers. Inventory disruptions are likely to start in May and continue throughout the summer. The Japanese automaking supply chain shortages due to the Chubu nuclear plant closure are creating opportunities for non-Japanese automakers like the Detroit 3 and South Korean companies. Toyota, heavily reliant on Japanese production, is facing production cutbacks and sales declines, likely losing its position as the world's largest auto company. Its net income fell 77% in the quarter following the earthquake, and ongoing uncertainties in Japan are hindering full-year forecasts. Most of Toyota's Japanese plants were closed for nearly a month after the disasters. Toyota's plants were closed for nearly a month after the disasters, operating at half capacity due to parts shortages. Production will continue at half volume until early June, with Lexus line facing inventory shortages. Toyota aims to resume 70% of worldwide production in June 2011, with full recovery by year-end. Some models may have delayed production due to parts availability issues. European and Chinese facilities will run on a reduced basis until late summer. In early May, Renault-Nissan's CEO, Carlos Ghosn, announced that the company had reduced supplier problems by half since March. Nissan's quarterly net income for January-March 2011 was $380 million, compared to a $140 million loss the previous year. The Iwaki plant, which produces engines for popular models, was directly affected by the earthquake/tsunami. Nissan may import engines from its Decherd, TN, plant to address supply chain disruptions. Nissan's U.S. and Mexican plants were initially closed for several days in April. Nissan and Honda faced production disruptions due to parts shortages after the March disasters in Japan. Nissan prioritized production of best-selling models for the U.S. and Chinese markets, with U.S. dealers expecting significantly fewer units in May compared to March. Honda's quarterly income fell by 38% in January-March 2011, leading to production suspensions at plants in the U.S. and Japan. Parts shortages were expected to last for 60 to 90 days, impacting production at various global plants. Honda and GM faced parts shortages after the disasters in Japan. Honda's U.S. businesses will feel the impact mostly in the July-September period due to long shipping times from Japan. GM closed its Shreveport plant and had layoffs at its Tonawanda plant. GM sent experts to Japan to help suppliers reopen. GM and Ford faced parts shortages, leading to plant closures and production disruptions. GM's CEO reached out to Freescale Semiconductor for chip supply diversification. Ford closed assembly plants in multiple countries to conserve parts.

The disasters in Japan had immediate impacts on U.S.-based automakers, leading to plant closures and production disruptions as they scrambled to find new parts sources. The disasters in Japan had immediate impacts on U.S.-based automakers, leading to plant closures and production disruptions. Japanese automakers in the United States will be the most affected due to their stronger supply chain connection with facilities in Japan. IHS Global Insight forecasts that 90% of the 4.2 million vehicles not built in 2011 will be from Japanese OEMs. The IHS model predicts that 497,000 units will be lost to Japanese OEMs in North America, with vehicle production losses peaking in the second quarter. A.T Kearney suggests that 200,000 U.S. customers may switch brands this year due to the unavailability of many Japanese models. The loss of production will be felt most keenly at Japanese transplant facilities and suppliers in the Midwest and South. According to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, the production drops in Japanese-owned assembly plants in 2011 may affect thousands of American workers. Japanese automakers spent $38.3 billion in U.S. parts purchases in 2009, with up to 75% of their parts produced domestically. The March disasters in Japan caused immediate concern among automakers due to the global nature of the motor vehicle supply chain. The global motor vehicle industry, highly integrated with parts from many countries, may reevaluate its practice of customizing parts after events in Japan. The industry may develop standards and diverse sources for certain parts to mitigate future supply chain interruptions. For example, the shortage of Xirallic pigments after the earthquake/tsunami prompted Merck Chemicals to supplement Japan production with a new facility in Germany. Geographic diversity in sourcing is crucial for automotive manufacturers. The automotive industry is evolving rapidly with the increasing importance of electronics in vehicles. New technologies like \"drive by wire\" (DbW) are being developed to manage vehicle operations, potentially eliminating traditional components like steering columns and belts.
