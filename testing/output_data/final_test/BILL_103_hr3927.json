The Information Classification Act of 1994 amends the National Security Act of 1947 by adding a new title on the classification of information. Information may be classified if the public interest in knowing it is outweighed by the damage to national security. If there is doubt about the need to classify information, it should not be classified. Classification considerations include the ability of the military to defend the nation and the vulnerability of government personnel and facilities. The Information Classification Act of 1994 amends the National Security Act of 1947 by adding a new title on the classification of information. Information may be classified to protect against armed attack, loss, compromise, or measures that weaken effectiveness. It should not be classified to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error, prevent embarrassment, restrain competition, or delay information release. The Information Classification Act of 1994 allows for the classification of information to protect national security interests, but not to conceal violations of law or prevent the release of non-sensitive information. The Information Classification Act of 1994 allows for the classification of information based on different levels. The Information Classification Act of 1994 allows for the classification of information based on levels of damage to national security, with provisions for information obtained from foreign governments. Information obtained directly from a foreign government not on the list published under section 805(b)(3) may only be classified under this title. Original classification authority can only be exercised by the President and designated officials, who are published annually in the Federal Register. Sec. 804 outlines the declassification process for classified information, specifying timeframes for declassification based on the sensitivity of the information. Information classified under section 802(a)(1) must be marked for declassification within 10 years, while information classified under section 802(a)(2) must be marked for declassification within 6 years. The original classification authority can extend the period of classification for information not earlier than 180 days before declassification. The extension cannot exceed the original classification period, and additional extensions can be made. When classified information is requested for release under another law, the classification authority must review the basis for the original classification decision. The original classification authority can extend the period of classification for information not earlier than 180 days before declassification. The extension cannot exceed the original classification period, and additional extensions can be made. Upon the expiration of the period applicable to information, it shall be declassified unless the classification period is extended. The information will be declassified 180 days after the approval of the joint resolution under section 806, unless the classification period is extended. The information security oversight office is responsible for overseeing classified information. The Information Security Oversight Office, headed by a director appointed by the President, is responsible for overseeing classified information and conducting periodic reviews of information classification. It also has the authority to refer classification questions back to the original authority for reconsideration. The Information Security Oversight Office oversees classified information and conducts reviews. Foreign governments with public classification procedures will be listed annually. This section takes effect upon joint resolution approval. The President must submit a proposal for implementing actions to Congress for approval. The proposal cannot take effect until approved by Congress through a joint resolution. The process for considering and enacting joint resolutions is expedited in the House of Representatives. The text defines \"information\" as any knowledge owned or controlled by the US Government and \"original classification\" as the initial determination to protect information in the interest of national security. It also includes a conforming amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 adding a new title on the classification of information. The text outlines the classification criteria, levels, authority, duration, oversight office, congressional approval, and definitions related to information classification."
