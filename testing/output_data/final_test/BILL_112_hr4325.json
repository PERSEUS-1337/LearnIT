    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep America's Oil Here Act\". The Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to increase fuel economy standards and establish renewable fuel standards. The administration of President Obama is accelerating the implementation of these standards to reduce domestic oil consumption. The President issued rules in 2010 and 2011 to increase fuel economy and decrease global warming emissions for light-duty vehicles. These rules aim to reduce oil consumption by 1.9 million barrels per day by 2030 and 2.3 million barrels per day by 2040, and by 1.5 million barrels per day by 2030 and 2.4 million barrels per day by 2040, respectively. The Federal Government is taking actions to reduce domestic oil consumption as an exhaustible resource. Domestic oil production has increased significantly, reaching its highest levels since 2003 and 1997 for oil and natural gas liquids. Export restrictions on public lands' oil production are seen as necessary to complement energy efficiency measures. The Federal Government is implementing measures to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of oil and refined products. The Secretary of the Interior may only accept bids for new oil and gas leases of Federal lands from bidders certifying that all oil and refined products produced must be sold only in the United States. The President has the authority to waive section 3 of a lease if it is in the national interest and meets certain criteria to ensure it does not increase domestic oil consumption from hostile countries, raise costs for oil refiners, or lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. The President can waive a lease's section 3 if it is in the national interest and meets specific criteria, including no net loss of domestically consumed crude oil or refined petroleum products, constitutional necessity, or compliance with a North American trade agreement. The term \"refined petroleum product\" in the Act includes finished motor gasoline, aviation gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oil, lubricants, waxes, petroleum coke, and asphalt."
