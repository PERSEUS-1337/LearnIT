    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Complete America's Great Trails Act\" and introduces the National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Complete America's Great Trails Act\" introduces the National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing a tax credit for contributions towards National Scenic Trails. The National Scenic Trail Conservation Credit is defined as any trail authorized under the National Trails System Act, at least 200 miles in length, with a trail corridor of 150-2,640 feet wide on each side. The trail corridor for a taxpayer's property must include the entire distance if it is less than 150 feet on either side of the trail. If the property includes a residence or structure within 150 feet of the trail, the trail corridor for that side of the trail will be determined by the taxpayer. The terms 'qualified conservation contribution' and 'qualified real property interest' are defined by section 170(h), with special rules for determining fair market value of National Scenic Trail conservation contributions. An election under this section for a qualified conservation contribution is irrevocable and denies a double benefit deduction. The business credit is treated as part of the general business credit, while the personal credit applies for tax purposes. The personal credit allowed under subsection (a) is treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for the taxable year. Any excess credit can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a) for that year. No credit can be carried forward beyond the tenth taxable year after it arose. Credits are used on a first-in first-out basis. Contributions of real property for conservation purposes are not affected by continued use if it does not harm conservation interests or the National Trails System Act's purposes. The Secretary of the Interior will study the efficacy of the National Scenic Trail conservation credit under the Internal Revenue Code in completing, extending, and increasing the number of National Scenic Trails. The study will also assess the feasibility and costs of making the credit refundable and allowing its transfer. A report is due within 4 years. The Secretary of the Interior will submit a report to Congress on the results of the study conducted on the National Scenic Trail conservation credit within 4 years of the enactment of this Act. A conforming amendment will be made to the table of sections for subpart B of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section regarding the National Scenic Trail conservation credit will apply to contributions made after the enactment of this Act."
