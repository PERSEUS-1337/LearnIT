    "content": "By the late 19th century, the railroad industry had a significant impact on the U.S. economy by connecting the coasts, aiding in settlement of the western United States, and facilitating the transportation of goods and products across the nation. The industry was a major consumer of U.S. goods, using a large portion of steel and coal produced in the country. As the public relied more on railroads, labor-management disputes arose, leading to the enactment of the Railway Labor Act in 1926 to regulate labor relations in the industry. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 aimed to regulate labor relations in the railway industry by promoting labor-management peace and preventing work stoppages. It established collective bargaining between labor and management, ensuring employees' rights to organize, select bargaining representatives, and settle disputes promptly. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 established collective bargaining between labor and management, with mediation by the National Mediation Board and voluntary arbitration. Special adjustment boards were created to resolve disputes over contract interpretation or application. The National Railroad Adjustment Board was formed in 1934 to handle disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiations. The National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB) resolves disputes through direct negotiations or with a referee if deadlocked. Congress replaced the Board of Mediation with the National Mediation Board (NMB) to handle disputes not referable to NRAB. The Railway Labor Act was amended to strengthen provisions for selecting representatives, allowing employees to organize and bargain collectively. Carriers are prohibited from interfering with employees' rights to join a union, and a majority support is required for union recognition. The Railway Labor Act was amended to prevent carriers from interfering with employees' right to organize or join a union. The amendments also included provisions for enforcing the act, prohibiting unilateral changes to pay rates and working conditions, and extending coverage to airline carriers in 1936. In 1936, Congress extended the Railway Labor Act to include airline carriers, recognizing their importance to the national transportation system. Labor preferred the RLA's dispute resolution mechanisms over the NLRA's. Congress made significant changes to the RLA between 1951 and 1981, allowing carriers and unions to enter union security agreements. In 1966, Congress amended the Railway Labor Act to establish Public Law Boards (PLBs) for dispute resolution. PLBs consist of two members, one selected by the carrier and one by the union, with a neutral third party designated in case of deadlock. If no agreement on a neutral party is reached, the National Mediation Board (NMB) steps in. In 1981, Congress established emergency procedures for publicly funded carriers providing commuter rail services. The Railway Labor Act was most recently amended in 2012, changing the requirements for NMB certification of unions for unrepresented employees. The amendments increased the minimum percentage of signed authorization cards needed for certification from 35% to 50% and altered the rules for runoff elections. The 2012 amendments to the Railway Labor Act changed the rules for runoff elections, now including the choice not to be represented by a union. It also mandated periodic NMB evaluations and audits to prevent labor-management disputes that could disrupt railroad and airline services. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) regulates labor-management relationships in the railway and airline industries, providing a standard process for choosing a union for collective bargaining. It governs negotiation subjects, behavior during processes, and prohibits unfair actions. The National Mediation Board (NMB) administers and enforces the act, offering mediation services for disputes. The National Railway Adjustment Board (NRAB) and Special Boards of Adjustment (SBAs) arbitrate disputes in the railway industry. System Boards handle disputes in the airline carrier industry. The President can create a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) for unresolved disputes. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) regulates collective bargaining rights and duties in the railway and airline carrier industries. Under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), a carrier is defined as any company involved in transportation services related to property transported by railroad. The act regulates collective bargaining rights and duties in the railway and airline carrier industries. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) applies to carriers in the railroad and airline industries, as well as companies controlled by or under common control with them. It excludes trucking services and certain electric railways but may apply if a trucking company primarily serves a rail carrier. The RLA defines an employee broadly and sets rules for labor-management disputes. The Railway Labor Act grants employees the right to organize and bargain collectively. It outlines procedures for selecting a union as an employee representative and governs the relations between the union, carrier, and employees. Certain conduct is prohibited, including interference with employees' right to organize and select a union representative. Carriers can only bargain with the employee-selected union, and self-help is only allowed after reaching an impasse. The Railway Labor Act allows employees to select a union free from carrier interference. The National Mediation Board certifies unions based on majority votes in a secret ballot election. Self-help, such as strikes and lockouts, can only be used after negotiations reach an impasse. The National Mediation Board (NMB) certifies unions based on majority votes in a secret ballot election and has exclusive jurisdiction to determine crafts or classes of employees. The NMB considers factors like historical crafts and job functions similarity. Union certification is system-wide and includes all eligible employees, even at different locations. Employees in a craft or class can vote in a secret ballot election for union representation. Furloughed, on leave, or probationary employees are also eligible. Contractors, retirees, and managers cannot vote. Part-time, temporary, and dismissed employees may be eligible on a case-by-case basis. The NMB can use various methods to determine a union after investigating a representation dispute. Petition for an investigation requires a majority showing of interest from workers. The NMB investigator compares authorization cards with the list of potentially eligible voters to determine if enough cards were submitted. If a dispute exists, the General Counsel will establish how it will be resolved, possibly through a secret ballot election. The NMB may conduct elections by various methods, and a union needs a majority of votes to be certified as the employees' bargaining representative. This rule replaced a 75-year practice that required a majority of eligible workers to vote for representation. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) no longer counts workers who do not vote in the election as \"no union\" votes. If no choice receives a majority of votes, a runoff election may be conducted. The RLA allows carriers to voluntarily recognize a union. The NMB can certify a union based on authorization cards signed by a majority of employees. Voluntary recognition does not control NMB's determination in later disputes. Union certification can be revoked. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) allows carriers to voluntarily recognize a union based on authorization cards signed by a majority of employees. Union certification can be revoked through decertification, which occurs when less than 50% of voting employees cast ballots for the incumbent union or when the existing union freely renounces its certification. The RLA mandates \"every reasonable effort\" to create and maintain agreements on pay rates, rules, and working conditions, and to settle disputes through direct negotiations. The NMB looks to general considerations of fair dealing to define the bounds set by the RLA. \"Fair dealing under the Railway Labor Act includes unions' and carriers' responsibility to bargain in good faith, respect each other's representatives, and refrain from interference. The act protects employees' right to organize by prohibiting coercion and interference. Carriers cannot deny employees' right to organize or use funds to influence union membership. Violations may result in penalties, including rerun elections ordered by the NMB.\" After certification of a union, a carrier must bargain only with the union and not directly with employees. Self-help, such as peaceful striking and picketing, can be used by parties outside of formal dispute resolution processes, but only after exhausting the RLA's mechanisms. Employees have the right to engage in actions like picketing, intermittent striking, and selective striking. Employees have the right to engage in picketing, striking, and secondary activities. A carrier can hire permanent replacements during a strike but cannot retaliate by eliminating jobs. Courts can issue injunctions to stop self-help if the status quo is violated. The RLA established entities like the National Mediation Board and National Railroad Adjustment Board for enforcement and mediation. The National Mediation Board (NMB) administers and enforces the Railway Labor Act (RLA) by creating arbitration tribunals like the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB) for grievances in the railway industry. Parties can also form Special Boards of Adjustment (SBAs) or request a Public Law Board (PLB) for arbitration. In the airline industry, System Boards of Adjustment (System Boards) arbitrate disputes. The NMB is an independent agency with a three-member board appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for three-year terms. Federal courts can review decisions of these entities in limited circumstances. The National Mediation Board (NMB) delegates its powers to investigate and adjudicate representation disputes to its General Counsel. The NRAB, SBAs, and System Boards are adjustment boards that arbitrate disputes in the railway and airline industries. The NRAB, consisting of 34 members, arbitrates grievances in the railroad industry. District courts can enforce or challenge NRAB decisions. In the railway industry, parties can create an SBA or a PLB to settle disputes. The NMB provides a list of potential arbitrators for parties to choose from. If a party fails to agree on the creation of a PLB, the NMB can designate an arbitrator. The NMB covers the expenses of arbitrators in railway arbitration proceedings. In railway arbitration proceedings, the NMB covers arbitrators' expenses. The RLA was amended to include airline carriers, but the National Air Transit Adjustment Board was never created. Airline carriers and unions use System Boards for disputes, which lack formal procedures and NMB funding for arbitrators. The judicial review process for carrier industry disputes is limited. NMB orders can be overturned if outside jurisdiction or against RLA prohibitions. Adjustment board awards can be impeached for fraud, jurisdiction overstep, or not conforming to RLA. Parties can file a petition to impeach within 10 days of the final judgment for various reasons outlined in the RLA. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) governs disputes in the carrier industry. Adjustment board decisions are final and enforceable in U.S. district courts. If negotiations fail, RLA procedures can be invoked for major or minor disputes. The President can intervene in major disputes that may disrupt interstate commerce. The Railway Labor Act governs disputes in the carrier industry, including collective bargaining on pay rates, rules, and working conditions. Agreements in the railway industry do not have expiration dates but can be subject to change on a specified date within the original agreement. Major disputes involve bargaining on initial labor-management agreements and any subsequent changes. Parties must give 30 days' notice of intended changes, known as a \"Section 6 notice,\" and must agree on a conference within 10 days. Once a Section 6 notice is served, parties must maintain the status quo during direct bargaining. The Railway Labor Act governs disputes in the carrier industry, including collective bargaining on pay rates, rules, and working conditions. Parties must maintain the status quo during direct bargaining. If parties cannot reach an agreement, the NMB may offer arbitration, which is voluntary-but-binding. If arbitration is refused, a 30-day \"cooling-off\" period follows before any changes can be made to the agreement. After the cooling-off period, parties may exercise self-help if no mutual agreement is reached, including strikes, lockouts, and imposition of new rules. Arbitration involves a three-member board, with each party selecting one arbitrator and the third selected if needed. The arbitrators' decision is final on all issues. Minor disputes involve interpretation or application of an existing agreement, with carriers able to act on their interpretation while waiting for resolution by an Adjustment Board. The Railway Labor Act mandates compulsory arbitration for minor disputes in front of the NRAB or System Boards of Adjustment. Parties can also form a Special Board of Adjustment or request a Public Law Board to resolve disputes. Compliance with the board's orders is required. If parties cannot agree on an arbitrator for a Public Law Board (PLB), the National Mediation Board (NMB) will appoint one. If PLB members cannot agree on an issue, they must select a neutral board member to decide. If they fail to agree on a neutral member, the NMB can appoint one. If a dispute remains unresolved, the NMB may recommend the creation of a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) to investigate and report on the issue within 30 days. Parties must maintain the status quo during this period. Parties must maintain the status quo for 30 days after a PEB report, unless an agreement is reached. If no resolution is reached within 60 days, a public hearing is conducted by the NMB. If still no resolution after 120 days, a second PEB can be requested. In the midst of the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) to stabilize the economy and reduce unemployment by guaranteeing workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. Congress may intervene in labor disputes for commuter and noncommuter rails, imposing agreements on parties if necessary. The NIRA aimed to increase purchasing power and lower unemployment by allowing workers to negotiate for higher wages. However, it did not prevent company-dominated unions, leading to strikes. The U.S. Supreme Court later deemed the NIRA unconstitutional, leading to the enactment of the Wagner Act, which prohibited company-dominated unions and established worker representation and negotiation principles. The Wagner Act was more effective in protecting employee rights than the NIRA. The Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, placed restrictions on unions, guaranteed freedoms to employers, enumerated unfair labor practices, required notification before striking, prohibited closed shops and secondary boycotts, allowed states to enact right-to-work laws, and gave employers the right to request an election to determine the employee representative. It also prohibited supervisors from joining unions and gave employees the right to petition to decertify a union. In 1959, Congress passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act, in response to union corruption allegations. The act established a union member \"Bill of Rights\" with five basic rights, increased internal union transparency, and applied to parties under the NLRA and RLA. The NLRA promotes transparency in unions through financial disclosures and election procedures to prevent corruption. It aims to prevent labor-management disputes that could harm the economy by granting rights to workers and employers and providing mechanisms to resolve disputes. The NLRA regulates the labor-management relationship in the private sector, excluding railway and airline carrier industries, by establishing a standard process for choosing a union representative in collective bargaining. The NLRA governs the process of union selection and collective bargaining, regulating behavior between workers, employers, and unions. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administers and enforces the act, investigating representation disputes, unfair labor practices, and contract disputes. The General Counsel prosecutes unfair labor practice claims, with authority delegated to regional directors. The President can create a board of inquiry for dispute resolution in cases of threatened strikes or lockouts. The NLRA regulates collective bargaining rights and duties for employers, employees, and unions in the private sector, excluding the railway and airline carrier industries. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers whose operations affect interstate commerce, with established administrative standards limiting its jurisdiction to cases involving employers with a substantial effect on commerce. The NLRB has jurisdiction over employers with a substantial effect on commerce based on annual sales or revenue. The definition of employer includes agents but excludes certain entities like the United States and international organizations. An employee is anyone working for hire, including those in labor disputes without equivalent employment. The NLRA excludes certain categories like agricultural workers, domestic workers, independent contractors, and supervisors from being considered employees. Nonresident aliens and hospital resident physicians are considered employees, but graduate students in teaching positions and unpaid volunteers are not. A supervisor is defined by their authority to make key employment decisions. The NLRA grants employees the right to organize and bargain collectively, setting procedures for selecting a union as a representative. Employees in supervisory positions are considered employees and have NLRA protections, while managerial employees are exempt due to their role in formulating management policies. Employers and unions must bargain in good faith over working conditions. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union, chosen through a secret ballot or employer recognition. Bargaining topics are categorized as mandatory, permissive, or illegal subjects. Employers and unions cannot interfere with employees' right to organize. If an impasse is reached, parties can use self-help methods. Employees have the right to choose their union representative through a majority vote in an appropriate bargaining unit. Unions must be certified by the NLRB or voluntarily recognized by the employer before collective bargaining can begin. Union security agreements allow for mandatory union membership for employees, with exceptions for job applicants. A union shop agreement requires newly hired employees to become dues-paying members after 30 days, while agency shops allow non-union employees to pay a fee for union services. Employees who do not join the union pay a fee for its services as a bargaining agent. The union's authority for security agreements can be revoked by a majority vote. Deauthorization elections can be held once per year with 30% employee support. Right-to-work laws allow employees to choose employment without union membership or dues. A bargaining unit is a group of employees represented by a union, determined based on a \"community of interest\" including historical units, employee wishes, and similar interests. It may include employees from one or multiple locations, professional and nonprofessional employees, with a majority vote required for professional employees to join. Employees in a bargaining unit can vote in elections if they are employed during the eligibility period set by the NLRB. Economic strikers and unfair labor practice strikers have voting rights, with different rules for their replacements. A union can become an employee representative through a secret ballot election initiated by filing a representation petition with the NLRB. Employees can request union representation or challenge the current union's majority status. Petitions must be supported by authorization cards signed by 30% of employees. Consent agreements outline election terms and require NLRB approval. The regional director's rulings in election disputes are final and subject to review by the NLRB. Parties can enter into stipulated or full consent agreements for the regional director to resolve pre- and post-election disputes. If no consent agreement is reached, a formal representation hearing is held where parties can present arguments and evidence. The regional director makes decisions on election issues, including directing secret ballot elections and certifying unions with majority votes. If no union receives a majority, a runoff election is held. Parties can object to elections if NLRB standards are not met, and interference with employee freedom of choice can invalidate an election. Employers must bargain in good faith with NLRB-certified unions for one year. The NLRA allows for voluntary recognition of unions by employers. The NLRA allows for voluntary recognition of unions by employers based on majority employee authorization cards. A card check agreement may be used, requiring more than a majority of cards. If a union is voluntarily recognized, employees can request representation by another union after at least six months, but no more than one year. The NLRB may require an employer to recognize and bargain with a union if a majority of employees signed authorization cards and unfair labor practices occurred. The employer must bargain in good faith for one year. A secret ballot election is needed for decertifying unions. A decertification petition can be filed by employees or the union with at least 30% of employees' signatures. Union recognition can be withdrawn if no contract agreement is reached after one year of certification. The NLRA mandates that employers must bargain with unions regarding \"rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment.\" Bargaining subjects are divided into three categories: mandatory, permissive, and illegal. Recognition can be withdrawn if no contract agreement is reached after a reasonable amount of time and the employer doubts majority support of the certified union based on objective information. The NLRA mandates that employers must bargain with unions over mandatory subjects such as wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment. Employers cannot take unilateral action on these subjects or make agreements with individual union members. The NLRB defines terms like \"wage,\" \"hours of employment,\" and \"other conditions of employment,\" which include various aspects like overtime pay, work schedules, and grievance procedures. Permissive bargaining subjects are optional for negotiation. The NLRA prohibits illegal subjects of bargaining, such as separation by race and preference for union members. Unfair labor practices are defined and prohibited to protect both employees and employers. The NLRB can issue cease-and-desist orders to stop ULPs. The NLRA prohibits illegal subjects of bargaining and unfair labor practices, protecting both employees and employers. The NLRB can issue cease-and-desist orders to stop ULPs, require reinstatement and back pay for improperly discharged employees, and restrict employers and unions from interfering with employees' right to organize. Punitive damages are generally unavailable. Employers are prohibited from interfering with employees' right to organize and cannot discriminate against them for unionizing. Unions are also prohibited from interfering with employers' choice of representation. Employers and unions must bargain collectively and in good faith over wages, hours, and working conditions. Good faith is determined by factors like proposal justifications and willingness to compromise. Unilateral changes and direct bargaining with employees are considered refusals to bargain. Employers and unions cannot coerce employees in exercising their right to bargain collectively. Unions cannot coerce employees in exercising their right to bargain collectively. Employers cannot discriminate against employees based on union membership or activities. Unions can fine and discipline members within NLRB policy guidelines. The NLRA protects employees when they use self-help, and employers cannot take adverse action against them for doing so. Employees have protected activities under the NLRA, including peaceful strikes and filing grievances. Unprotected activities, such as violent or unlawful behavior, can lead to adverse action. During an economic strike, employees cannot be discharged but can be replaced by employers. If replacements are hired, striking employees are not entitled to job reinstatement. During a strike, employees have the right to be recalled to their jobs when available, unless they engaged in serious misconduct. Employers can conduct a lockout but cannot change terms for nonstriking employees without a bargaining impasse. The NLRA established the NLRB to oversee labor relations. The NLRA established the NLRB to administer and enforce labor laws. The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to investigate and adjudicate disputes. It is comprised of a five-member Board and a General Counsel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Board traditionally consists of two Democrats, two Republicans, and a fifth member aligned with the President's party. If a position is vacant, the President can make a recess appointment. The NLRB has authority over objections and challenges to secret ballot elections, bargaining unit composition, and ULP cases. The General Counsel oversees ULP investigations and complaints, delegated to regional offices. Board orders are not laws and can only be enforced through U.S. courts of appeals. District courts can review representation cases if the Board exceeds its jurisdiction or violates the NLRA. The NLRB has authority over objections and challenges to secret ballot elections, bargaining unit composition, and ULP cases. The General Counsel oversees ULP investigations and complaints, delegated to regional offices. Board orders are not laws and can only be enforced through U.S. courts of appeals. District courts can review representation cases if the Board exceeds its jurisdiction or violates the NLRA. The Board and federal courts cannot review General Counsel decisions not to issue a ULP complaint, unless in connection with a review of a Board final order. A ULP charge can be initiated by an employee, employer, union, or any other person by filing a charge with the NLRB within six months of the alleged incident. The regional director investigates the charge and decides whether to issue a formal complaint, which can be appealed to the General Counsel. The General Counsel may try to settle charges informally or formally. In an informal settlement, parties agree to withdraw the charge upon remedial action. If terms are violated, the settlement is withdrawn, and the case prosecuted. Formal settlements are for persistent violations, where the charged party agrees to a remedial order. Failure to comply may lead to judicial proceedings or contempt. If no settlement is reached, a complaint is issued, and hearings follow. The regional office issues a complaint if a settlement is not reached in a meritorious case. Hearings are held before an ALJ, who makes recommendations to the Board. The General Counsel ensures compliance with the Board's orders. Arbitration is used to resolve contract disputes, with federal law prevailing over state law in case of contradiction. The Board can interpret collective bargaining contracts, but courts do not always defer to its decisions. The President has the authority to appoint a \"board of inquiry\" to investigate strikes or lockouts that may endanger national health or safety. The board issues a report to the President, who can direct the Attorney General to petition a U.S. district court to end the strike or lockout if necessary. If a strike or lockout affects a substantial portion of an industry and threatens national health or safety, a court can order parties to end the dispute. The court's orders can be appealed to a federal court of appeals. A board of inquiry reconvenes after an injunction is issued, and after 60 days, reports to the President on the state of relations between the parties. The NLRB then conducts a secret ballot election for employees to accept a final settlement offer. The President submits a report to Congress on the process and any recommendations for action. In the 1920s and 1930s, private sector employees gained collective bargaining rights, but public sector employees didn't have these protections until the 1960s. By the 1960s, federal public employees faced job insecurity due to changes. President Kennedy formed a Task Force in 1961 to address union recognition for federal employees, after previous opposition from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. In 1961, President Kennedy established the Task Force on Employee-Management Relations in the Federal Service, leading to Executive Order 10988 in 1962 granting federal employees limited rights to join unions and bargain collectively. President Nixon later expanded federal labor-management regulations with Executive Order 11491 in 1969. In 1969, Executive Order 11491 established federal labor-management relations framework, including majority union recognition, the Federal Labor Relations Council, and prohibited unfair labor practices. It also allowed limited \"official time\" for negotiating collective bargaining agreements. Congress later codified these provisions in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) was established in 1978, following the principles of Executive Orders but with some changes. President Obama's Executive Order 13522 in 2009 created the National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations to improve service delivery. The Council advises the President on labor-management issues in the executive branch and set up pilot forums for nonadversarial discussions between agency managers and unions. Several federal agencies were excluded from FSLMRS. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) was established in 1978, excluding some federal agencies from its coverage. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) employees have separate labor-relations statutes or policies. TVA employees can organize and bargain over wages, while U.S. Postal Service employees gained collective bargaining rights through the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Congress incorporated NLRA provisions into the Act, preventing labor-management disputes in the federal sector. The FSLMRS aims to prevent labor-management disputes in federal government operations by granting rights to workers and employers, regulating the labor-management relationship, and providing mechanisms for dispute resolution. It establishes a standard process for choosing a union for collective bargaining and governs the negotiation subjects. The statute also regulates behavior during union selection and bargaining processes and prohibits unfair actions. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) administers the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), regulating collective bargaining rights and duties for federal agencies, employees, and unions. The FLRA investigates and adjudicates representation disputes, ULP complaints, and contract disputes. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) offers voluntary mediation services, while the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) provides additional assistance in resolving disputes. The FSLMRS defines \"employer,\" \"employee,\" and \"labor organization\" for federal executive agencies. State and local laws govern state and local public employees. The FSLMRS applies to most federal executive agencies, the Library of Congress, the Government Printing Office, and the Smithsonian Institution. Excluded agencies include the Government Accountability Office, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the FLRA, the FSIP, and the U.S. Secret Service. The President can exclude agencies involved in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work from the FSLMRS. The President has the power to exclude certain agencies and agency subdivisions from the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), including the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Federal Air Marshall Service, and various military branches. The definition of an employee under the FSLMRS excludes noncitizens, members of the uniformed services, supervisors, management officials, Foreign Service officers, and individuals who participate in a strike in violation of the statute. A labor organization is defined as a group of employees who pay dues and deal with an agency. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants employees the right to organize and bargain collectively. Labor organizations must deal with an agency regarding employment conditions and grievances. Unions and agencies can negotiate working conditions but not topics governed by other laws. Employees in the federal sector must share a \"community of interest\" to form a union for representation. The union selection process is limited to secret ballot elections, and union-security agreements are illegal. Employers and unions must bargain in good faith, and employers can only negotiate with an employee-selected union. Strikes are prohibited for federal employees in case of a bargaining impasse. Federal employees are prohibited from participating in strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or picketing that interferes with agency operations when a bargaining impasse is reached. The FSLMRS grants federal employees the right to collectively bargain over conditions of employment, excluding certain matters like political activities, position classification, and wages. Management retains nonnegotiable rights such as determining the organization's mission, budget, and employee assignments. Grievance procedures for affected employees can be negotiated. The parties can bargain over grievance procedures, management authority, and the number of employees assigned to a project. Federal employees have the right to choose their union, and unions must represent all unit employees. Union security agreements are not allowed under the FSLMRS. Units for representation must meet three criteria: a community of interest, effective relationship with the agency, and promotion of employee interests. Under the FSLMRS, the bargaining unit must have an effective relationship with the agency and promote efficient operations. Management officials and supervisors can only be included if historically part of the unit. Employees prohibited from the unit include those administering FSLMRS provisions and those affecting national security. The FLRA determines eligible employees for secret ballot elections, including regularly scheduled intermittent and temporary employees with a reasonable expectation of continued employment. Temporary employees can vote if they expect employment beyond six months and share a community of interest with permanent employees in the unit. Under the FSLMRS, a union can only be certified through a secret ballot election by filing a representation petition with a showing of interest from 30% of unit employees. The FLRA's General Counsel determines the sufficiency of the showing of interest, conducts investigations, and resolves disputes before ordering a secret ballot election. After an investigation, the regional director can order a secret ballot election. Parties can enter consent-election agreements, but if not, the director issues a \"direction of election.\" The election procedures are set out, and nonprocedural issues can be brought before the director. A union is certified if it receives a majority of votes. In case of multiple unions on the ballot, a runoff election is held between the top two choices. Objections to procedural aspects or conduct can be filed within five days. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) requires parties to report any conduct that may have affected an election within five days of the vote tally. National Consultation Rights (NCRs) allow unions to provide input on agency-proposed changes in employment conditions, even without exclusive recognition. Unions gain NCRs if they represent at least 3,500 or 10% of employees in an agency without an exclusive representative. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) allows for elections to determine if a bargaining unit no longer wants union representation. A petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees alleging the union no longer represents the majority. The FLRA can revoke certification if a union disclaims interest or if there is a substantial change in the unit. Unfair labor practices are prohibited, and the FLRA can issue cease-and-desist orders. The FLRA can issue cease-and-desist orders to stop unfair labor practices, reinstate employees wrongly discharged for union activities, and require renegotiation of contracts. The FSLMRS protects employees' right to organize and prohibits interference or coercion by employers and unions. Prohibited conduct includes threats of discharge, discrimination by unions causing employer actions, and agencies assisting unions in organizing. Employers and unions must negotiate in good faith over conditions of employment, including entering into a written collective bargaining agreement if requested. This duty does not require concessions but does require willingness to reach an agreement and meeting at reasonable times and places. Employers cannot unilaterally change working conditions. Employers and unions must negotiate in good faith over conditions of employment, including entering into a written collective bargaining agreement if requested. This duty does not require concessions but does require willingness to reach an agreement and meeting at reasonable times and places. Additionally, employers cannot unilaterally change working conditions. Working conditions might include work hours or allocation of employee offices. Neither employers nor unions can refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and decisions, including failing to comply with a final order from the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP), the FLRA's dispute resolution entity. Employers cannot discipline or discriminate against employees who file complaints under the statute. A union cannot coerce, discipline, fine, or attempt to coerce a union member as punishment or to hinder their work. Employees are protected from union harassment when they are performing their official work duties. Unions cannot discriminate against employees regarding union membership based on various factors. Federal employees have limited self-help options compared to the private sector under federal labor relations laws. They can engage in peaceful picketing but cannot participate in strikes or work stoppages that interfere with agency operations. Unions can lose exclusive recognition status if they support such actions. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) enforces the statute and has the power to investigate and address unfair labor practices. The FLRA administers and enforces federal labor relations laws, investigating and adjudicating representation disputes, ULP complaints, and contract disputes. The FMCS offers voluntary mediation services, while the FSIP provides additional assistance in resolving disputes. The FLRA's General Counsel handles ULP complaints, and its decisions can be reviewed by federal courts in limited circumstances. The FLRA is an independent agency composed of a three-member Authority, the General Counsel, and the FSIP. The FLRA, FMCS, and FSIP are key agencies in federal labor relations. The FLRA handles ULP cases and conducts elections, with members appointed by the President. The FMCS offers mediation services for negotiation impasses, while the FSIP provides additional dispute resolution assistance. In the federal sector, parties can request FSIP intervention or opt for binding arbitration if unable to resolve disputes through FMCS. FSIP, a part of FLRA, assists in resolving disputes between agencies and unions over working conditions. It has seven members appointed by the President for staggered five-year terms. If parties cannot resolve an impasse, FSIP can make recommendations or impose an agreement. Issues can be reviewed and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Authority. The FLRA Authority can review and make decisions on cases brought before it, which can be further appealed to a court if deemed necessary. ULP investigations can be initiated by filing a charge with an FLRA regional director, with a time limit of six months after the alleged ULP occurred. The regional director may issue a complaint for a hearing before an ALJ, with the option to appeal to the General Counsel if no complaint is issued. Throughout the process, the Authority offers alternative dispute resolution services to parties involved. The FLRA Authority offers voluntary alternative dispute resolution services at its CADRO office. If parties are unable to settle a dispute, the General Counsel prosecutes the complaint before an ALJ. The ALJ's decision can be reviewed by the Authority, and if a ULP is found, actions can include reinstating an employee with backpay or issuing cease-and-desist orders. District courts can also provide temporary relief during complaint processing. In negotiability and bargaining obligation disputes, the General Counsel may order a status quo to be maintained if necessary. Negotiability disputes involve disagreements over proposed contract terms, while bargaining obligation disputes involve arguments over the necessity to negotiate. The union can appeal to the Authority in negotiability disputes, while agencies may argue against bargaining in obligation disputes. The union can resolve disputes through ULP resolution procedures, negotiated grievance procedures, or negotiability appeal procedures. To initiate a negotiability appeal, the union must file a petition with the Authority's Office of Case Control. Collective bargaining agreements must contain negotiated grievance procedures that include binding arbitration if a grievance cannot be settled. Arbitration is used if a grievance cannot be settled through negotiated grievance procedures. Excluded issues include retirement, life insurance, health insurance benefits, and national security-related suspensions or removals. Other procedures exist for disputes involving removal or demotion for unacceptable performance, adverse actions, employment discrimination, personnel actions prohibited by statute, and unfair labor practices. Either party can file an exception to arbitration awards with the Authority within 30 days. The Authority can review arbitration awards within 30 days and take action if necessary. Parties have various options to resolve disputes, including private arbitration or seeking assistance from FMCS. If voluntary attempts fail, FSIP can intervene and recommend resolution procedures or assist in resolving the impasse. FSIP's procedures are informal but may include hearings. FSIP can intervene to assist in resolving impasses by holding hearings, issuing subpoenas, and making final binding decisions.
