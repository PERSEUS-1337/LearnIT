    "content": "Enactment of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) was the result of years of effort by nonfederal government officials and advocates to control federal imposition of unfunded mandates. Supporters argue that the statute is necessary to prevent costly and inefficient federal legislation and regulations, while opponents believe mandates may be needed in certain cases. UMRA was signed into law in March 1995 during the 104th Congress. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) was signed into law on March 22, 1995 during the 104th Congress. UMRA distinguishes between intergovernmental mandates imposed on state, local, or tribal governments, and private sector mandates. Intergovernmental mandates include provisions that reduce federal services or funding for existing programs with entitlement authority of $500 million or more. Exclusions and exemptions are also discussed in the statute. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) distinguishes between intergovernmental mandates and private sector mandates. Under UMRA, an intergovernmental mandate is considered unfunded unless the legislation meets its costs by providing new budget authority or authorizing appropriations. The act consists of five prefatory sections and four titles, addressing matters such as purpose, short title, and exclusions from coverage. Title I of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 allows Congress to identify and reject legislation proposing unfunded intergovernmental mandates. Title II requires federal agencies to assess the financial impact of proposed rules on nonfederal entities and choose the least costly regulatory option. Title III mandated a review of federal mandates within 18 months, assigned to the now-defunct Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. The final report was never completed. Title IV of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act authorizes judicial review of federal agency compliance with Title II provisions. The act, also known as \"Legislative Accountability and Reform,\" establishes requirements for committees and the Congressional Budget Office to study and report on the impact of mandates in proposed legislation. Congressional committees are responsible for identifying federal mandates in measures under consideration, with the ability to block measures containing unfunded intergovernmental mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires committees to study and report on the impact of mandates in proposed legislation. Committee chairs must have the Congressional Budget Office estimate costs for any legislation containing federal mandates exceeding certain thresholds. CBO must provide full quantitative estimates for costs exceeding $59 million for intergovernmental mandates or $117 million for private sector mandates in the first five fiscal years. For measures with costs over the thresholds, CBO must submit estimates of the direct costs of federal mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires committees to study and report on the impact of mandates in proposed legislation. Committee chairs must have the Congressional Budget Office estimate costs for any legislation containing federal mandates exceeding certain thresholds. CBO must provide full quantitative estimates for costs exceeding $59 million for intergovernmental mandates or $117 million for private sector mandates in the first five fiscal years. If reported legislation authorizes appropriations to meet the estimated costs of an intergovernmental mandate, the CBO report must include a statement on the new budget authority needed, for up to 10 years, to meet these costs. For a measure that reauthorizes or amends an existing statute, the direct costs of any mandate it contains are to be measured by the projected increase over those costs required by existing law. The calculation of increased costs must include any projected decrease in existing federal aid that provides assistance to nonfederal entities. The committee is to include the CBO estimate in its report or publish it in the Congressional Record. The committee's report on the measure must also identify the direct costs to the entities that must carry out the mandate. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires committees to study and report on the impact of mandates in proposed legislation. Committees must assess costs and benefits, competitive balance, and preemption effects of mandates. A point of order may be raised for unfunded intergovernmental mandates exceeding $59 million. Intergovernmental mandates must detail federal funding for costs. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires committees to assess costs and benefits of mandates in proposed legislation. A point of order may be raised against consideration of a measure if CBO estimate of mandate costs is not published. The chair consults with the Committee on Governmental Affairs on intergovernmental mandates. The unfunded costs of the mandate are determined based on estimates by the Committee on the Budget. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires committees to assess costs and benefits of mandates in proposed legislation. If a point of order is raised against a measure due to missing CBO estimates, the House votes on whether to consider it. The chair can consolidate multiple points of order into a single vote. Special rules waiving points of order are also subject to challenge. These procedures aim to ensure the House's compliance with UMRA. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) ensures that the House, like the Senate, can vote on whether to consider a measure containing unfunded mandates. UMRA allows Members to offer amendments to remove unfunded intergovernmental mandates. Points of order can be raised against bills, amendments, conference reports, or motions that exceed the specified threshold for unfunded costs. Amendments or motions do not have to be required under UMRA. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) allows Senators to request cost estimates for mandates in amendments they prepare. If a bill contains new mandates or cost increases, supplemental estimates can be requested. UMRA points of order do not apply to appropriations bills, but can be raised against provisions creating unfunded mandates. If sustained in the Senate, these provisions are removed from the bill. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) exempts certain subject matters from point-of-order procedures, such as individual constitutional rights, discrimination prohibitions, emergency assistance, national security, emergencies designated by the President and Congress, and Social Security. Title I provisions do not apply to federal regulatory agencies, and Title II requires federal agencies to prepare written statements identifying costs and benefits of federal mandates imposed through rulemaking. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) requires federal agencies to prepare written assessments for regulatory actions with costs of $117 million or more in any one year. The assessments must include the law authorizing the rule, anticipated costs and benefits, share of costs borne by the federal government, disproportionate costs on regions or private sector components, impact on the national economy, consultations with nonfederal government officials, evaluation of comments, and identification of impacts on small governments. Additionally, UMRA mandates consideration of \"a reasonable number\" of policy options and providing notice and technical assistance to small governments. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) requires federal agencies to consider a reasonable number of policy options and select the most cost-effective alternative. Title II mandates the preparation of a mandate assessment statement and notification of impact on small governments, which are subject to judicial review. Court orders can compel agency compliance with these requirements but cannot invalidate the rule."
