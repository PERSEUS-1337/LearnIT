    "content": "Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution sets the President's compensation, currently at $400,000, which is subject to income tax. An additional $50,000 allowance is provided for official expenses, with any unused amount reverting back to the U.S. Treasury. Upon leaving office, the President receives a pension equal to the salary for Level I of the Executive Schedule. The President's pension is currently $300 short of being one-half of the President's current salary, which is $400,000. The compensation for the President is exempt from sequestration to reduce budgetary resources. The President's salary has been adjusted five times since 1789, with the most recent increase in 1949 to $100,000 per annum. This was a $25,000 increase from the previous rate of $75,000. Senator Herbert O'Conor provided a brief history of the proposal during Senate consideration of the legislation. After months of study, a subcommittee appointed by the chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee in July 1947 submitted recommendations to the Senate Committee on Civil Service. The committee reported favorably on bill S.1537, but the portion related to top-bracket officials was deleted due to time constraints. Following hearings on a redrafted bill, S.103 was introduced, reflecting input from various sources. The Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries recommended increasing the President's salary from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1968. Congress passed H.R. 10 in 1969, raising the President's salary to $200,000, effective when Richard Nixon was inaugurated on January 20, 1969. Congress needed to consider legislation quickly to adjust the President's salary before Nixon's inauguration on January 20, 1969. Speaker McCormack emphasized the urgency of passing the bill before noon on that day to ensure the President could benefit from the salary increase during his term. The urgency to pass legislation adjusting the President's salary before Nixon's inauguration on January 20, 1969 was emphasized by Speaker McCormack. Efforts were made by congressional leaders to push a bill through before that date, with the aim of allowing the President to benefit from the salary increase during his term. During consideration of H.R. 10 on January 6, 1969, House Majority Leader Carl Albert reiterated the Constitution's proviso against a sitting President's salary increase. Senator Hiram Fong expressed the need for more time to discuss the bill in the Senate on January 15, 1969, but Majority Leader Mike Mansfield explained the Senate's traditions prevented immediate consideration. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum when Congress passed H.R. 2490 and President Clinton signed it into law on September 29, 1999. This occurred more than 15 months before George W. Bush was sworn in as President on January 20, 2001. The House Subcommittee on Government Management conducted a hearing on the President's salary on May 24, 1999, with testimony from former White House officials. Former White House officials and public interest groups testified in favor of increasing the President's salary to at least $400,000, citing the need to reflect the prestige of the office and align with salaries of other top government officials. The Congressional Accountability Project was the only organization against the increase, arguing that it would raise the salary cap for other officials. Legislation to increase the salary of the 44th President, Barack Obama, would have needed to be enacted before his inauguration on January 20, 2009. No legislation was introduced in the 110th, 111th, or 112th Congress to increase the salary of the President who assumed office on January 20, 2013."
