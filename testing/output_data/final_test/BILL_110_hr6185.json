    "content": "The Act titled \"TRICARE Continuity of Coverage for National Guard and Reserve Families Act of 2008\" provides TRICARE Standard coverage for certain members of the retired reserve and their family members who qualify for a non-regular retirement but are not yet age 60. TRICARE Standard coverage is extended to certain members of the Retired Reserve who qualify for non-regular retirement before age 60. Eligibility is provided under specific conditions, excluding those enrolled in another health benefits plan. TRICARE Standard coverage for Reserve component members terminates at age 60. Immediate family members are eligible as dependents. Coverage continues for family members if the member dies during coverage. Premiums may apply. Members of a Reserve component covered by TRICARE Standard must pay a monthly premium determined by the Secretary of Defense based on actuarial calculations. Premiums apply uniformly to all covered members, with separate rates for those with and without dependents. The Secretary also establishes requirements and procedures for premium payments. Amounts collected as premiums are used for coverage under this section. Amounts collected as premiums for TRICARE Standard are credited to the Defense Health Program Account, merged with available funds, and used for coverage in the same fiscal year. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other administering Secretaries, will establish regulations for this section. Definitions include 'immediate family' and 'TRICARE Standard' for Reserve component members. The text discusses medical care and health benefits for dependents under specific sections of the title. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. TRICARE standard coverage for certain Retired Reserve members eligible for non-regular retirement before age 60, effective from October 1, 2009."
