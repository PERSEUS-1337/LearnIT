    "content": "From the mid-1980s to the end of FY2003, federal agencies could enter into Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) with contractors who privately financed and installed energy conservation measures in federal buildings. The contractors, known as Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), provided design, installation, and maintenance services for energy-efficiency improvements. The ECMs included equipment for energy and water savings, as well as renewable energy systems like solar panels. ESCOs guaranteed fixed energy and cost savings, bearing the risk of failure to meet projections. The Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) allowed federal agencies to partner with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to implement energy conservation measures in federal buildings. Over 340 ESPCs have been awarded, with no ESCO failing to produce energy and cost savings. A recent Department of Defense proposal aimed to expand ESPCs to mobile systems, such as replacing engines in the Air Force's B-52 bomber fleet for energy conservation. Congress is currently considering ESPC reauthorization despite the expiration of authorizing legislation. The report reviews the legislative history of ESPCs, federal program promotion, CBO's scoring rationale, cost and benefits, and policy considerations for Congress. ESPCs were authorized in 1992, building on earlier mandates to improve federal building energy efficiency. Legislation required audits, allowed agencies to retain savings, raised notification thresholds, and extended authorization temporarily. EPAct directed DOE to develop rules for federal ESPC use consistent with Federal Acquisition Regulations. DOE developed regulations for federal use of ESPCs in line with Federal Acquisition Regulations, superseding FAR provisions. Federal agencies were encouraged to utilize ESPCs for energy-efficiency improvements without prior appropriations. Agencies had to submit annual reports documenting progress towards energy-saving goals to the President and Congress. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) established a \"Qualified List of Energy Service Companies\" for implementing NECPA requirements and achieving energy-efficiency goals. They also created streamlined \"Super ESPCs\" to simplify the process of awarding ESPCs to federal agencies. Agencies reported new ESPC commitments through an annual Energy Scorecard. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) established a \"Qualified List of Energy Service Companies\" for implementing NECPA requirements and achieving energy-efficiency goals. They also created streamlined \"Super ESPCs\" to simplify the process of awarding ESPCs to federal agencies. Agencies reported new ESPC commitments through an annual Energy Scorecard, showing the value of ESPCs awarded between FY1998 and FY2003 in nominal dollars. Few conventional ESPCs were awarded after 2001, indicating a drop-off in projects. ESPCs have contributed significantly to federal energy reduction goals, with federal projects achieving 30% higher energy savings compared to municipal/state governments, universities, schools, and hospitals. The median energy savings for federal projects is 18,000 Btu/ft2 compared to 14,000 Btu/ft2 for MUSH. Annual federal government electricity consumption decreased by 1.14 billion kilowatt-hours from 1992 to 2002. A study of 214 federal projects projected $550 million in benefits for taxpayers with a 7% discount rate. However, actual savings may vary depending on the building or facility's usage post-energy improvement. ESPCs' savings freed up funds that would have been used for O&M, with contract terms averaging 14 years. ESPC cost savings typically pay the contractor first and then offset other expenses. DOD used an unconventional approach to defer some ESPCs' cost savings until contract completion, reducing energy consumption but not total operation costs until expiration. This approach reduced future financial obligations and interest charges passed on to the government by ESCOs. The federal market for ESPCs has seen over 340 projects valued at $1.6 billion in private sector investments, compared to $3.17 billion in appropriated funds for energy projects between FY1985 and FY2001. Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted a cost evaluation comparing ESPCs and appropriated funds, finding favorable pricing under ESPCs. ORNL's evaluation compared pricing under Super-ESPCs and appropriated funds for energy projects, finding that ESPCs were as cost-effective as traditional projects. Super ESPCs took 27 months on average for implementation at $3.26 million, while appropriated projects averaged 63 months. Only 12 out of 39 ECMs studied were funded. ORNL compared project financing between ESPCs and appropriations-funded contracts. ESCOs recover costs over the life cycle of the ESPC, while appropriations-funded projects have shorter financing periods. ORNL developed parametric tables to help federal managers decide between funding ECMs through ESPCs or waiting for appropriated funding. ORNL compared project financing between ESPCs and appropriations-funded contracts, finding that appropriations-funded projects had lower life-cycle costs if survey/study costs stayed below 18% of design/completion costs. However, a decrease of just 2% in annual energy savings made appropriations-funded projects less competitive with ESPCs. The Budget Enforcement Act imposed constraints on discretionary spending from FY1991 through FY2002. CBO began scoring ESPCs as mandatory spending after the BEA expired, reflecting future commitments to appropriations. The extension of ESPCs in H.R.6 could commit over $2.5 billion in the next 10 years, based on a $252 million commitment in FY2003. Energy efficiency within federal agencies has been promoted by both the executive branch and Congress since the 1970s. The federal government has been promoting energy efficiency within agencies since the 1970s. Energy conservation programs faced budget cuts in the 1980s, leading to the development of Shared Energy Savings and Energy Savings Performance Contracts to meet energy reduction goals. Federal managers have increasingly used ESPCs to fund energy conservation measures since FY1995. ESPCs require appropriations for O&M funds, with CBO scoring them as future commitments to appropriations. Upwards of $2.5 billion could be committed in the next 10 years through ESPCs. The federal government borrows money for energy-efficiency improvements through ESPCs, which require appropriations for O&M funds. Up to $2.5 billion could be committed over the next 10 years. Proponents argue that ESPCs are financially smart due to guaranteed cost coverage by cost savings from new ECMs, making the real cost zero. ESPCs were created by Congress to reduce future obligations by cutting energy operation and maintenance costs. While ESPCs may lead to future financial obligations, Congress could consider keeping the sunset provision. Despite reduced appropriations for energy-efficiency projects, Congress may still promote improvements in federal facilities by extending the sunset provision. Congress may consider extending the sunset provision for ESPCs in federal facilities to promote early payback strategies and expand their application to mobile systems for additional energy-savings potential."
