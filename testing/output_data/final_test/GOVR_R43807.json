    "content": "In response to the Ebola crisis and the Islamic State threat, Congress considered new funding requests from the President in 2014. The President requested $6.18 billion for various departments to address these global issues. In November 2014, the President increased the FY2015 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request by $5.5 billion to combat IS and address Ebola. The omnibus appropriations bill provided a total of more than $10.8 billion in emergency funds. The funding bill was signed into law on December 16, 2014, with $6.18 billion allocated for U.S. government efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak and enhance global preparedness. The $112 million allocated for research and technologies to end the Ebola outbreak and other infectious diseases, along with an additional $1.54 billion for a Contingency Fund, were designated as emergency requirements to bypass spending limits. Congress approved $5.41 billion in total, with funds allocated to Health and Human Services, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense. Transfer authority was included for HHS and State, but not for the Contingency Fund. The President's request for Ebola preparedness and response activities in the Department of Health and Human Services sought $2.426 billion for immediate needs and an additional $751 million in contingency funding. The FY2015 consolidated appropriation provided $2.767 billion for immediate needs, more than requested, but did not include contingency funding. The funds are intended to support both domestic and international activities. The entire appropriated amount was designated as emergency spending. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requested $2.426 billion for Ebola response activities, with $1.77 billion provided in FY2015. $176 million was requested for domestic Ebola responses, with $576 million provided through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund account. Funding was also provided for Hospital Preparedness Program grants. The FY2015 consolidated appropriation provided funding for Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) grants to establish additional domestic Ebola Treatment Centers, improve readiness to detect cases of Ebola infection, purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), and training. $157 million was allocated to the HHS PHSSEF for BARDA to develop Ebola vaccines and treatments, $238 million for NIH clinical trials on experimental Ebola vaccines and treatments, and $25 million for FDA. $25 million was requested and appropriated for the FDA for the development, review, and regulation of Ebola vaccines and treatments. The HHS funds were to be used for preventing, preparing for, and responding to Ebola or other infectious diseases domestically or internationally. The FY2015 appropriations language provided broad authority to CDC and HHS/ASPR to address Ebola and other infectious disease threats. Additional spending flexibility was granted for renovation of private facilities, reimbursement of uninsured healthcare costs for Ebola patients treated in the US, and other related matters. The FY2015 consolidated appropriation did not provide broad transfer authority for Ebola response within HHS or to other departments. Congress did not provide the requested contingency funding for HHS. Title IX, Division J, of the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriation Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), provided $2.5 billion but did not provide contingency funding for Ebola efforts within the Department. Amounts appropriated to CDC, PHSSEF, NIH, and FDA have specific availability timelines. The FY2015 consolidated appropriation provided $2.5 billion without contingency funding for Ebola efforts within the Department of State and USAID. The President requested $2.89 billion for Ebola preparedness and response activities, with $2.1 billion for immediate responses and $792 million for a Contingency Fund. Funds were drawn from various accounts to address the Ebola crisis in West Africa. In FY2015, $376.8 million from State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs were used for Ebola response efforts, including funding for labs, medical supplies, ETUs, burial teams training, and health care worker training. Additionally, Congress provided $1,436.3 million for International Disaster Assistance, exceeding the requested amount, to support various Ebola response activities. In FY2015, $376.8 million was used for Ebola response efforts, including funding for labs, medical supplies, ETUs, burial teams training, and health care worker training. An additional $269.1 million was allocated for personal protective equipment procurement, transport, and warehousing. $190 million was designated for addressing food insecurity in Ebola-affected areas. $16.1 million would fund increased staffing of DART and RMT, and support for 20 additional staff. Congress appropriated $312 million for Global Health Programs, $28 million below the requested amount. In FY2015, $376.8 million was used for Ebola response efforts, including funding for labs, medical supplies, ETUs, burial teams training, and health care worker training. An additional $269.1 million was allocated for personal protective equipment procurement, transport, and warehousing. $190 million was designated for addressing food insecurity in Ebola-affected areas. Congress appropriated $711.7 million for ESF, $500 million above the request of $211.7 million. $71.7 million of ESF emergency funding was requested to address second-order impacts in Ebola-affected countries and critical innovations in responses to the epidemic. $60 million was for rebuilding non-Ebola health services in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea; and $66 million was for longer-term strengthening of basic.

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR) \u2014$5.3 million was requested and enacted for existing NADR expertise of securing dangerous pathogens to be used for training of local law enforcement on imposing quarantines and securing facilities that store the Ebola virus; handling and disposing of Ebola-contaminated items; and for biosecurity and related capacity building. Diplomatic Engagement \u2014$36.4 million was enacted rather than the $71.4 million requested for Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP), U.S. Contributions to International Organizations (CIO), and Repatriation Loans. The request was to pay for evacuations of U.S. government patients, oversight of the department efforts, outreach and reporting by VOA, U.S. contributions to the U.N. Mission for Emergency Ebola Response (UNMEER), and repatriation loans.

Mission for Emergency Ebola Response (UNMEER), and repatriation loans. Contingency Fund \u2014 P.L. 113-235 provided none of the requested $792 million of ESF funds as a Contingency Fund to be available until expended. This amounted to 27% of the SFOPs emergency request. The Contingency Fund was to be available for critical needs related to the Ebola outbreak and global health security. The request included broad transfer authority of these funds to other accounts in the Department of State, USAID, or other federal agencies, provided that transfers were done in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), only for amounts designated by the President to address critical Ebola crisis needs, in addition to existing transfer authority, and with a 10-day advance notification to the House and Senate Appropriations. In FY2015, $376.8 million was used for Ebola response efforts, including funding for labs, medical supplies, ETUs, burial teams training, and health care worker training. An additional $269.1 million was allocated for personal protective equipment procurement, transport, and warehousing. $190 million was designated for addressing food insecurity in Ebola-affected areas.

President Obama announced an increase in the U.S. response to the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa on September 16, 2014. DOD requested to reprogram excess funds for additional research on ways to treat and prevent the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. DOD requested to reprogram $1 billion of excess funds for the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Committees approved up to $750 million for transportation of personnel and supplies, coordination of delivery, and construction. The Administration sought $112 million in emergency funds for DARPA in FY2015 to support medical research for developing Ebola treatments and preventive measures, including utilizing antibodies of survivors for temporary immunity and accelerating vaccine development. DARPA's Biological Technologies Office has funded similar initiatives in the past. The Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 authorized $112 million in appropriations. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, allocated the funds as an emergency requirement for defense purposes. Additionally, $5.4 billion in OCO funds were included in the FY2015 appropriations for the Department of Defense for Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The FY2015 appropriations included $5.4 billion in OCO funds for the Department of Defense to combat the Islamic State, with $520 million designated for the State Department. The OCO request for State Department was not provided in the appropriations act, but some accounts were increased with broader explanatory language. The Administration had amended its OCO request to add funds for both DOD and State Department to combat the Islamic State. The FY2015 appropriations included $5.4 billion in OCO funds for the Department of Defense to combat the Islamic State, with additional funds allocated for State Department. The total government-wide OCO request was $71.7 billion, with $7.8 billion for State and $63.9 billion for DOD, compared to $91.5 billion appropriated in FY2014. The OCO funds are not subject to discretionary spending limits and were approved in the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. The Department of Defense received $5.4 billion in OCO funds in FY2015 to combat the Islamic State, with additional funds allocated for the State Department. DOD's cost of operations against the Islamic State totaled $1.5 billion as of January 30, 2015, averaging $8.4 million per day. Funds were used for airstrikes, deployment of military personnel, and training Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces. Starting October 1, 2014, DOD tapped OCO-designated funds in the FY2015 Continuing Resolution for incremental costs. Starting October 1, 2014, incremental costs of Operation Inherent Resolve were funded from Congress's FY2015 CR. The CR appropriated $85.4 billion in OCO funds for DOD, $26.6 billion above the FY2015 request. Congress approved $500 million to train Syrian opposition forces from the Counterterrorism Partnership Response Fund, with limitations on training and equipping forces worldwide. Temporary new authority to train Syrian opposition forces was granted to DOD in the FY2015 CR (P.L. 113-164) until December 13, 2014. The FY2015 CR granted new authority for DOD to train and equip Syrian opposition forces, with reprogramming of funds required for approval by congressional defense committees. Congress reduced CTPF funding and narrowed authorities, requiring detailed reporting and approval for fund usage. In November 2014, DOD's reprogramming request was approved by the four congressional defense committees. In November 2014, congressional defense committees approved a $225 million DOD reprogramming request to train vetted Syrian forces. DOD announced plans to train Syrian opposition forces with U.S. personnel and support troops starting in March 2015. The $4.94 billion budget includes expenses for military personnel, supplies, and operational costs for air strikes against IS. In FY2015, $5.4 billion was allocated for combatting the Islamic State, including training and equipping Syrian opposition forces and Iraqi security forces. The funds were designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and exempt from budget caps. The FY2015 NDAA changed DOD's authorities for training Syrian opposition forces and Iraqi security forces. The FY2015 NDAA set a $500 million cap on funds for training and equipping Syrian opposition forces, reducing the DOD request from $4.0 billion to $1.3 billion. Congress limited DOD's authority and increased oversight, requiring partnerships to rely on existing authorities and restricting the geographic scope to Central and Africa Commands unless U.S. security was at risk. The FY2015 NDAA required specific reprogramming requests for DOD approval by congressional defense committees, set vetting requirements for Syrian opposition forces, and limited the fund duration to December 2016. It allowed limited waiver authority for the Secretary of Defense and the President for national security reasons. The $1.6 billion approved for Iraq train-and-equip account had revisions, including a sunset date of December 31, 2016. The FY2015 NDAA endorsed revisions to DOD's proposal, setting a sunset date of December 31, 2016. It endorsed the definition of purposes for training and equipping Iraqi and other security forces, with a cost-sharing provision capping U.S. obligations at 60% until Iraqi, Kurdish, and tribal security forces contribute 40% of the $1.6 billion total. The act also deleted the exclusion of arms sales proposed. The FY2015 NDAA set a 40% contribution requirement for Iraqi, Kurdish, and tribal security forces towards the $1.6 billion DOD request, excluding arms sales. A 25% cap on obligations and expenditures was also established, with a specific plan needed for assistance distribution. The plan includes goals, timelines, training, and assistance details for U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress approved expanding coalition support authorities and providing additional funding for emergencies and intelligence support. DOD requested an increase of 4,000 troops for FY2015. The DOD estimated 3,100 U.S. personnel for training in Iraq and 800 for training Syrian opposition forces. Troop strength in Iraq and Afghanistan would total 79,047, with 64,482 providing in-theater support. Congress did not provide OCO funds specifically for the $520 million request, but did allocate additional funds for international broadcasting to Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq. Increased ESF OCO funds were provided for the \"extraordinary costs of contingency operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq and other assistance.\" The D&CP OCO account is the only one to decline compared with both the total FY2015 request and FY2014 actual funding levels. For FY2015 Department of State efforts against IS, the $520 million amendment requested $8.6 million for D&CP to expand the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications' counterterrorism messaging. The D&CP requested $100 million for ESF to engage the moderate Syrian opposition, $250 million for FMF to support Jordan and Lebanon, $65 million for PKO to increase the capacity of the moderate Syrian opposition, $90 million for IDA to provide humanitarian support in Syria and Iraq, and $6.3 million to increase VOA broadcasting in Kurdish and Turkish languages. Muslims are urged to speak out against extremism through various media platforms. An amendment was proposed to allow funds to be used for aid to the Syrian opposition, despite concerns about the lack of organization and infighting within the opposition. Congress had previously granted authority for funding in the FY2014 appropriations act. Congress did not provide requested contingency funds for the Ebola outbreak in FY2015, despite concerns about the $1.54 billion request. Limited transfer authority for OCO funds was included in P.L. 113-235, but broader transfer authority was not granted. The SFOPs ESF Contingency Fund included notwithstanding language to provide funds to countries prohibited by law. The Administration sought flexibility in providing funds for the Ebola outbreak, aiming to address unforeseen outbreaks quickly. Only critical funds designated by the President would be used, with a 10-day advance notification to Congress required before any transfers. This approach was intended to support a whole-of-government response while allowing HHS and State Secretaries to act swiftly. The Ebola Emergency Response Act (H.R. 5710) introduced by Representative Christopher Smith authorized $1.801 billion for FY2015 emergency aid for countries affected by Ebola. It allowed the President to use funds for natural or manmade disasters and humanitarian concerns. The bill authorized the President to use resources from any agency on a non-reimbursable basis for Ebola response, with notification and reporting requirements to congressional committees. The FY2015 SFOPs appropriations act did not include the requested language allowing any funding to be used for combatting IS. The conference version of the FY2015 NDAA approved $1.618 billion for a new Iraq train-and-equip account and rejected broad authorities for the CTPF. Congress may need to address budgetary and policy oversight issues regarding the funding provided. The $1.6 billion funding provided for DOD's Iraq training plans raises questions about its adequacy and potential availability of additional funds from other DOD OCO sources. Congress is also considering the pros and cons of the requested train-and-equip authority for Iraq and Syria, as well as the practicality of the cost-sharing arrangement with Iraq. The President's budget requests for countering Ebola and the Islamic State are designated as \"emergency\" and \"OCO/GWOT\" funds, respectively, exempt from discretionary spending limits. Additional funding may be needed in FY2016 and beyond for these purposes. The FY2016 budget and beyond may include additional funding for missions, Congress should consider if these programs are temporary or enduring requirements funded in DOD's base budget."
