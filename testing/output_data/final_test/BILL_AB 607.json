    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 10145 of the Business and Professions Code requires real estate brokers to deposit funds belonging to others into a trust fund account until disbursed according to instructions. Withdrawals from a trust fund account of a broker require the signature of the broker or an authorized person, such as a licensed real estate salesperson or another broker with a written agreement. An unlicensed employee of a broker can access trust funds if the broker has fidelity bond coverage equal to the maximum amount of the funds. Bonds with a deductible of up to 5 percent are allowed, and the broker must show evidence of financial responsibility to cover any losses. To cover the fidelity bond deductible, options include separate coverage, a cash deposit in a designated account, or other approved financial responsibility. Authorization for withdrawals from a broker's trust fund account does not absolve the broker or broker-officer from liability in handling trust funds. A real estate broker can deposit funds in an out-of-state depository institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for loans secured by a first lien on real property if the investor is a specified entity. (B) Entities such as banks, trust companies, credit unions, and insurance companies operating under state or federal laws with proper licensing.\n(C) Trustees of pension, profit-sharing, or welfare funds with a net worth of at least $15,000,000. Entities eligible to purchase a promissory note include corporations with registered securities, syndications, housing finance agencies, licensed mortgage lenders, and real estate brokers. A real estate broker must deposit trust funds in an out-of-state institution but make records available in-state for examination. If acting as a principal, all funds for real property purchases must be placed in a neutral escrow depository. A real estate sales person must promptly deliver trust funds to the broker or deposit them into a designated account. A broker can deposit trust funds into an interest-bearing account if certain requirements are met. The broker must hold trust funds in a separate account with insurance coverage, disclose account details to the person depositing the funds, and ensure that interest earned does not benefit the broker or any other person. In an executory sale, lease, or loan transaction, the broker must specify in the contract or written agreement who will receive interest earned on trust funds. The broker is not required to place trust funds in an interest-bearing account unless requested and certain conditions are met. The commissioner may establish regulations for real estate brokers to deposit trust funds into interest-bearing accounts. The broker must keep records of funds received and disbursed, including interest earned. They must provide authorization for financial record examination upon request. \"Neutral escrow\" refers to escrow businesses licensed under specific financial codes."
