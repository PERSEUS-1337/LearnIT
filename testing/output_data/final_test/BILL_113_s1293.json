    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building Understanding, Investment, Learning, and Direction Career and Technical Education Act of 2013\" or the \"BUILD Career and Technical Education Act of 2013\". Congress finds that career and technical education programs have a high graduation rate, improve students' academic scores, and lead to higher achievement in reading, mathematics, and science. Students who completed technical education programs and continued their postsecondary education either earned a credential or were still enrolled two years later. The pilot grant program supports career and technical education exploration in middle and high schools. The Act aims to provide students with opportunities for career and technical education exploration, expand professional growth and career opportunities, enhance collaboration between education providers and employers, develop or enhance exploration programs tied to a program of study, and evaluate students' participation in coordinated programs. The Act authorizes grants for career and technical education exploration programs offered to middle and high school students by local educational agencies. The Secretary of Education will award grants to support these programs. Grants awarded under this Act are 2 years in duration. The Secretary considers the resources and capacity of each local educational agency when awarding grants. Local educational agencies must submit an application to receive a grant. Priority is given to grant proposals that demonstrate partnerships with business, industry, labor, or higher education institutions. The grant project must have innovative design, aligned curriculum, focus on preparing students for high-wage jobs, evaluation method, and not receiving assistance under the Carl D. Perkins Act. The local educational agency receiving a grant must assure funding for operational costs after the grant period and implement a sliding scale fee for participation in career and technical education programs. Grant funds can be used for various purposes outlined in the Act. The grant funds can be used for equipment, staff expenses, consultation services, professional development programs, minor remodeling, and evaluating access to career and technical education programs. The grant funds awarded under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 can be used for education exploration programs, transition to career and technical programs, high school completion, and earning industry-recognized credentials or postsecondary credits. Materials or equipment purchased with grant funds become the property of the local educational agency. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 allows local educational agencies to use grant funds for various educational programs and activities. Grant recipients must develop an evaluation plan to measure specific outcomes and progress towards meeting those outcomes. Administrative costs are limited to 5 percent of the grant funds. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 allows grant funds for educational programs. Specific outcomes must address student participation, improved rigor in content, alignment between courses, and impact on transitioning to career and technical programs. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 allows grant funds for educational programs, with funds under this Act to be used to supplement existing funds. A local educational agency receiving a grant must submit evaluations to the Secretary, and $20,000,000 is authorized for carrying out this Act."
