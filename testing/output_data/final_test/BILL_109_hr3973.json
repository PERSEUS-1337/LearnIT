    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Forests Rehabilitation and Recovery Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to national forests. Congress acknowledges the importance of reducing wildfire risks to communities by actively treating hazardous fuels on forested Federal lands. Due to funding limitations, full implementation of necessary hazardous fuels reductions has not been achieved, leaving many communities at risk. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are urged to prioritize and aggressively pursue fuel reduction in at-risk communities in the wildland-urban interface. Many communities remain at risk from fuel accumulation in the wildland-urban interface. It is crucial to proactively plan for rehabilitating Federal land near these communities in case of a disturbance. Research on post-fire vegetative removal highlights the need to test different management approaches for the fastest recovery while ensuring long-term protection. Community collaboration shows promise in this endeavor. Community collaboration has shown promise in resolving controversial issues related to environmental policy and wildfire protection plans. Pro-active planning and collaboration are essential to expedite the approval of restoration projects after wildland fires or other disturbances. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this section, \"collaboration\" refers to the process of bringing together various stakeholders to reach a consensus on a natural resource issue. \"Community wildfire protection plan\" is defined in the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 and further detailed by the Western Governors Association. \"Federal land\" includes National Forest System land. The term \"Federal land forest community\" refers to towns, cities, counties, Indian tribes, or collaborative groups located adjacent to or containing Federal land. The term \"Inventoried roadless area\" refers to areas identified in maps from the Forest Service Roadless Areas Conservation, Final Environmental Impact Statement. A \"pilot project\" is a post-disturbance rehabilitation project authorized by this Act. The term \"pilot project site\" is an area of Federal land designated for a pilot project. \"Post-disturbance\" refers to a three-year period following an uncharacteristic disturbance. A \"rehabilitation plan\" is developed to address post-disturbance rehabilitation. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, depending on the land. An uncharacteristic disturbance is a significant event like a forest fire or hurricane that alters an ecological system. The Secretary of the Interior oversees public lands affected by such disturbances. Post-disturbance rehabilitation pilot projects for federal land forest communities are addressed in Section 4. Establishment of up to five post-disturbance rehabilitation pilot projects on Federal land by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to restore forest ecosystem health, diversity, and benefit the Federal land forest community. Application process to be developed within 60 days of enactment of the Act. The Act allows for the designation of Federal land as pilot project sites based on specific eligibility criteria, including the presence of a community wildfire protection plan, being at risk from intense wildfires or catastrophic events, or being near forest communities addressing forest health. The Act allows for the designation of Federal land as pilot project sites based on specific eligibility criteria, including community support, collaborative track record, and addressing forest health through watershed assessments. The Act allows for the designation of Federal land as pilot project sites based on specific eligibility criteria, including community support, collaborative track record, and addressing forest health issues through comprehensive watershed assessments. Certain Federal lands are excluded from pilot project sites, such as those containing old growth or late successional forests, areas where vegetation removal is prohibited, Wilderness Study Areas, and Inventoried roadless areas. The Act allows for the designation of Federal land as pilot project sites, limited to 10,000 acres each and totaling 50,000 acres. The Secretary's authority to designate pilot project sites expires after three years, but existing designations remain unaffected. SEC. 5. POST-DISTURBANCE REHABILITATION PLAN FOR DESIGNATED FEDERAL LAND FOREST COMMUNITIES. Post-disturbance rehabilitation plans are required for designated Federal land forest communities, whether the disturbance is caused by a wildfire or non-fire-related event. If the area is already covered by a community wildfire protection plan, the rehabilitation plan can be developed as an amendment to that plan. A rehabilitation plan must be developed for Federal land forest communities to address nonfire-related disturbances, following guidelines similar to community wildfire protection plans. The Secretary may offer technical and financial assistance for plan development. The plan should include addressing temporary road use, road decommissioning, and reducing hazardous fuels. The curr_chunk discusses measures for land management after disturbances, including reducing hazardous fuels, protecting soil integrity, water quality, wildlife habitat restoration, and economic utilization of removed materials. It also emphasizes replanting with native vegetation. The curr_chunk focuses on fire planning, grazing, and tree removal in post-disturbance rehabilitation projects. Fire planning must align with strategic restoration objectives, grazing plans should optimize recovery, and tree removal should prioritize small diameter trees and retention of legacy trees. The curr_chunk discusses the expedited consideration of rehabilitation plans and responses to uncharacteristic disturbances on pilot project sites covered by accepted plans. The Secretary concerned must initiate a process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to decide on management activities after an uncharacteristic disturbance occurs. The curr_chunk discusses the development of a qualifying rehabilitation plan as the preferred alternative in response to uncharacteristic disturbances. The Secretary concerned must make environmental documentation available to the public within a specific timeframe after the disturbance. The Secretary must address disturbances promptly and allow for public comment periods of 30 days for environmental assessments and 45 days for draft or final environmental impact statements. A record of decision must be issued within 30 days after the public comment period, and appeals should ideally be resolved within 30 days. Independent third-party monitoring is required for projects within pilot project sites to ensure effectiveness. The Secretary must promptly address disturbances and allow for public comment periods for environmental assessments and impact statements. Independent third-party monitoring is required for pilot project sites to evaluate rehabilitation impacts. A national oversight committee will provide scientific and socio-economic monitoring for pilot projects. The oversight committee will evaluate the biological, ecological, hydrogeological, and socioeconomic aspects of pilot projects. They will submit reports to Congress on the results, including improvements in forest diversity, soil stability, fire risk reduction, and local economic indicators. The Federal land forest community must submit two reports on the pilot project results, with an initial report due at the halfway point. The Federal land forest community must submit two reports on the pilot project results, with an initial report due at the halfway point and a final report at the end of the project."
