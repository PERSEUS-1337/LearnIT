    "title": "AB 1347",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9204 is added to the Public Contract Code to ensure timely and full payment for construction work on public projects in California. This section applies to all contractor claims related to public works, with specific definitions provided. Section 9204 of the Public Contract Code in California provides provisions for timely payment and dispute resolution for contractors working on public projects. It includes clauses for time extensions, relief from damages, payment for work not explicitly covered in the contract, and disputed payments by the public entity. The definition of a \"contractor\" under this section refers to any contractor who has a direct contract with a public entity for public works. The Public Contract Code in California defines a \"public entity\" as a state agency, department, city, county, district, or public corporation, excluding specific entities like the Department of Water Resources and the Division of Boating and Waterways. The Public Contract Code in California defines a \"public entity\" as a state agency, department, city, county, district, or public corporation. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Military Department, Department of General Services, and High-Speed Rail Authority are responsible for various public projects. A \"public work\" includes the construction, repair, or improvement of public structures. A \"subcontractor\" is any contractor in direct contract with another contractor or a lower tier subcontractor. Upon receipt of a claim, a public entity must review it within 45 days and provide a written statement disputing or undisputing portions of the claim. The claimant must provide supporting documentation for the claim. The claimant must provide documentation to support their claim. If the public entity's governing body needs approval to provide a written statement identifying disputed and undisputed portions of the claim, and does not meet within 45 days, they have up to three days after the next meeting to provide the statement. Payments for undisputed portions must be made within 60 days of the public entity issuing its written statement. If the claimant disputes the public entity's response or if there is no response within the specified time, they can request an informal conference for settlement. The public entity must schedule a meet and confer conference within 30 days upon receiving the demand in writing. Within 10 business days after the meet and confer conference, the public entity must provide a written statement to the claimant identifying disputed and undisputed portions of the claim. Payments for undisputed portions must be made within 60 days. Disputed portions go to nonbinding mediation, with costs shared equally. If parties can't agree on a mediator, each selects one, and those mediators choose a neutral third party for mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, the remaining disputed claim parts will be handled through procedures outside this section. Each party will cover the fees and costs of their chosen mediator, with a neutral third party selected by appointed mediators. Mediation, including neutral evaluation or dispute review board, assists parties in resolving disputes through negotiation or evaluation. Mediation conducted under this section may excuse further mediation obligations after litigation. Public entities can still require arbitration if mediation does not resolve the dispute. Failure to respond to a contractor's claim within specified time periods will result in the claim being rejected. Denied claims due to the public entity's failure to respond promptly will not reflect on the claim's merits. Unpaid amounts will accrue 7% interest per annum if not paid on time. If a subcontractor lacks legal standing to assert a claim against a public entity, the contractor can present the claim on their behalf. The subcontractor must provide documentation to support the claim and the contractor must notify them within 45 days if the claim was presented or provide reasons for not doing so. The section requires the inclusion of its text or a summary in public works project plans. Waivers of rights granted by this section are void, except parties can mutually agree to skip mediation and proceed to civil action or arbitration. Public works contracts can have dispute resolution provisions complying with this section. Effective for contracts from January 1, 2016. This section applies to contracts from January 1, 2016 onwards and does not hold public entities liable for awardees' failure to meet obligations. It will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement for state-mandated costs to local agencies and school districts."
