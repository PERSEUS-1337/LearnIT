    "content": "The \"Bringing Resources from Academia to the Industry of Our Nation Act\" or the \"BRAIN Act\" authorizes a pilot program for employment-based nonimmigrants with degrees in mathematics, science, engineering, or computer science to change their nonimmigrant status. The \"BRAIN Act\" allows nonimmigrants with STEM degrees to change their status to perform services in special technical occupations under a new nonimmigrant category (T) in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The \"BRAIN Act\" amends section 214 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow nonimmigrants with STEM degrees to change their status to special technical occupations under a new nonimmigrant category (T). The \"BRAIN Act\" allows nonimmigrants with STEM degrees to switch to a special technical occupation nonimmigrant category (T) if they meet certain criteria. This category requires knowledge and skills in high-tech fields like mathematics, science, engineering, or computer science. The special technical occupation nonimmigrant category (T) requires annual total compensation exceeding $60,000 and full state licensure for practice. Graduates with STEM degrees can switch to this category if they meet specific criteria. Nonimmigrant workers in the United States under title IV of the Act must have their employer commit to paying them as specified in the petition. Nonimmigrants in the T category are limited to a 5-year stay and their employers must annually submit relevant documentation to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may initiate an investigation based on the employee's statement from the most recent IRS statement under section 6051 of the Internal Revenue Code. Employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees who disclose information related to a petition filed under subsection (c)(10)(A). The Attorney General may establish a process for receiving, investigating, and resolving complaints related to violations of immigration regulations or employee cooperation in investigations. Additionally, nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(T) who file complaints may be allowed to seek other employment in the U.S. for a limited period. The Attorney General may establish a process for receiving, investigating, and resolving complaints related to violations of immigration regulations or employee cooperation in investigations. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization, including bargaining representatives. No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning a failure, misrepresentation, or violation unless filed within 12 months. The Attorney General will conduct an investigation if there is reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred. Within 30 days of filing a complaint, the Attorney General shall provide for a resolution process. The Attorney General will determine if there is a reasonable basis for a finding on a complaint within 30 days of filing. If a reasonable basis is found, interested parties will be notified and a hearing will be held within 60 days. A finding must be made within 60 days after the hearing. Similar complaints may be consolidated for hearings. If a failure to meet a condition is found after a hearing, action will be taken. The Attorney General may revoke the status of an alien under section 101(a)(15)(T) if certain conditions are not met, impose penalties up to $10,000 per violation, and restrict the petitioner from filing any other petitions. The Attorney General can revoke an alien's status under section 101(a)(15)(T), impose penalties up to $10,000 per violation, and restrict the petitioner from filing other petitions. Civil money penalties collected will be deposited in the Treasury. Reports on aliens granted nonimmigrant status and workers included in approved petitions must be submitted every 6 months and annually to the Committees on the Judiciary. The Attorney General determines alien status under section 101(a)(15)(T) upon employer petition. Fees may be imposed for such petitions under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Attorney General imposes a fee on employers filing petitions for alien nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(T). The petition must be approved before the alien obtains a specific degree and specify a period of intended employment. Approval of the petition does not automatically grant nonimmigrant status to the alien. The Attorney General imposes a fee on employers filing petitions for alien nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(T). The fee amount is $500 for certain petitions and $1,000 for others. Fees collected are deposited into the High-Tech Education Fund Account in the Treasury. Fees collected from petitions for alien nonimmigrant status are deposited into the High-Tech Education Fund Account. The funds are used for k-12 mathematics, science, and computer science education programs for elementary and secondary school students. 3 percent of the funds are allocated for duties relating to petitions. The Fund Account is available to the Attorney General for specific duties until expended. The amendments made by this section will be effective starting from fiscal year 2000 and will cease on September 30, 2004, except for aliens with nonimmigrant status under the amendments."
