    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering a petition from the Republic of the Marshall Islands for further compensation for damages from U.S. nuclear testing. Key oversight committees include the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the House Resources Committee, and the House International Relations Committee. Hearings have been held on the petition, with the U.S. government estimating spending between $520 million and $550 million on nuclear test-related compensation in the Marshall Islands. The Republic of the Marshall Islands received $520 million to $550 million in nuclear test-related compensation and assistance, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, cleanup, and resettlement efforts. The Compact of Free Association provided $150 million for compensation, with the possibility of additional claims under certain circumstances. The Marshall Islands government submitted a Changed Circumstances Petition to the US Congress for additional compensation under the Compact. The petition includes claims for personal injury awards, property damages, health services infrastructure, radiation exposure monitoring, and other programs based on new information about radioactive fallout and safe radiation levels. The petition argues for higher health consequences and costs of healthcare and environmental cleanup. The Changed Circumstances Petition submitted by the Marshall Islands government to the US Congress requests additional compensation under the Compact. It argues for higher health consequences and costs of healthcare and environmental cleanup, as well as lower investment returns from the Nuclear Claims Fund. The petition also highlights that the US Congress retains authority to appropriate additional compensation if needed. The monetary requests include unpaid Nuclear Claims Tribunal personal injury awards of $15.7 million. The Marshall Islands government submitted a Changed Circumstances Petition to the US Congress requesting additional compensation under the Compact. The petition includes unpaid Nuclear Claims Tribunal personal injury awards of $15.7 million, property damages awards to Enewetak Atoll and Bikini Atoll totaling $949 million, $50 million for medical services infrastructure, and $45 million annually for 50 years for a health care program for those exposed to radiation. In November 2004, a report by the US Department of State disputed key scientific claims of the petition regarding radioactive fallout and radiation dose estimates. The Bush Administration disputes the Marshall Islands' request for additional compensation under the Compact, stating that there is no legal basis for it. They argue that the health care needs related to radiation exposure are already partially addressed through health sector grants. RMI officials claim that the requests were not part of the negotiations to amend the Compact and that the amended Compact was not meant to address nuclear test compensation claims. They highlight that a significant portion of the expenditures mentioned in the Administration report supported U.S. research on radiation effects but did not directly benefit the affected communities. The report analyzes key issues related to personal injury, health care, and property damages claims in the Marshall Islands due to nuclear testing. It discusses expected radiation-related illnesses, property damage valuation, cleanup levels, and radioactive fallout. Possible legal options for pursuing nuclear damages claims are also explored. Congress has policy options regarding the Marshall Islands' request for additional compensation for nuclear damages. The report discusses key issues related to personal injury and health care claims in the Marshall Islands due to nuclear testing. It suggests enacting legislation for a \"full and final settlement\" of claims and allowing federal courts to review judgments of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. The Petition's claims are based on U.S. programs for compensating radiation-exposed individuals and scientific studies on radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands. The National Cancer Institute study supports the need for compensation for radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands. There is a dispute over the population exposed to radiation from nuclear tests. The Petition requests compensation for environmental restoration based on EPA cleanup standards. Property claims are based on \"loss of use\" calculations. The NCI estimated that nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands would result in 530 additional lifetime cancers among residents exposed to the fallout. Compensation is provided for all victims of certain types of cancers, as distinguishing between testing-caused and naturally occurring cancers is difficult. The methodology used to estimate the value of lost property use by claimants is considered reasonable, but there may be additional compensation claims as half of expected cancers in the exposed population have yet to be diagnosed. The methodology used for estimating loss-of-use damages in compensation claims for nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands may lead to overstated estimates due to inflated average rents and assumptions that result in possible overestimation of past and future damages. This is primarily attributed to the use of an exponential regression model on unrepresentative data reflecting government-influenced rents, leading to potential inaccuracies in loss-of-use calculations. The RMI argues for further cleanup in the Marshall Islands based on a recent U.S. radiation protection standard, while the Bush Administration maintains that contamination levels are safe according to the existing standard. The RMI has adopted the EPA's standard for cleanup of radioactive contamination, limiting annual radiation exposure to 15 millirems above natural background levels. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act established the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites in the United States. The EPA issued a 15 millirem standard in 1997 for the cleanup of Superfund sites, which is more stringent than the previous 100 millirem standard used by the DOE in the Marshall Islands. The RMI argues for applying the 15 millirem standard for cleanup in the Marshall Islands, but it is not an enforceable federal regulation. The 15 millirem standard is recommended by the EPA for cleanup of Superfund sites, but it is not enforceable. The Bush Administration prefers DOE's 100 millirem standard for cleanup, citing radiation levels below this amount in the population. The disagreement over the extent of contamination in the Marshall Islands persists despite various surveys conducted since nuclear weapons tests ceased. The 1994 survey found the highest contamination in uninhabited islands, with occupied areas deemed safe. The RMI disputes these findings, claiming understated contamination and health risks. The Bush Administration supports the 1994 survey results and argues against further cleanup to protect residents. Further cleanup may be necessary for contaminated northern islands if they are to be resettled or used for agricultural purposes, depending on safe radioactivity levels. Litigation involving Marshall Islands inhabitants in the 1980s saw different groups seeking damages from nuclear weapons testing, with preliminary findings made for Bikini Atoll, Enewetak Atoll, and other islands not used for testing. The court found that claims of takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment and breach of implied-in-fact contracts survived a motion to dismiss in cases involving Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll inhabitants. The Compact of Free Association was implemented between the United States and RMI, establishing the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. The Court of Claims dismissed cases, leaving open the possibility of further compensation beyond that provided by the Compact. The court decision allowed for potential additional compensation beyond the Compact for Marshall Islands affected by US nuclear tests from 1946 to 1958. Tests caused health issues and rendered atolls uninhabitable. The Marshall Islands government submitted a nuclear claims petition to the United States Congress in September 2000, requesting $3.3 billion over 50 years for personal injuries, property damages, medical care, and radiological monitoring due to the nuclear tests. This petition was made under the Compact of Free Association, which provided self-government for the Marshall Islands and Micronesia. The Marshall Islands government submitted a nuclear claims petition to the United States Congress in September 2000, requesting $3.3 billion over 50 years for personal injuries, property damages, medical care, and radiological monitoring due to the nuclear tests. In November 2004, the Administration released a report evaluating the petition, stating that the United States has provided $531 million to the Marshall Islands for nuclear test damages since 1954. This includes compensation payments, environmental cleanup, and resettlement programs. The Compact of Free Association established a Nuclear Claims Fund of $150 million for personal injury and property damages claims, health care, and radiological monitoring for the four atolls in the Marshall Islands. Congressional authorizations for nuclear test damages total roughly $398 million since 1964. The Fund was expected to generate $270 million in investment returns over 15 years, with distributions to the atolls for hardships suffered. The United States government has provided financial assistance to Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik Atolls in the Marshall Islands for nuclear test-related health and environmental programs. Legislation authorizing these programs includes various acts such as the Compact of Free Association Act. The Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory has been monitoring and treating patients from Rongelap and Utrik atolls since 1954. The Pacific Health Research Institute in Honolulu administers the Radiological Health Care Program for patients from Rongelap and Utrik atolls. The program includes two clinics and provides medical care to 119 enrolled persons. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducts environmental and agricultural studies at Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik. The Department of Energy budgets approximately $6.3 million per year for health and environmental programs in the Marshall Islands. The 177 Health Program, managed by Trinity Health International, provides medical services for residents exposed to radiation. The program faced funding challenges due to high enrollment and lack of inflation adjustments. Funding was inadequate, with only $1 million allocated in FY2005. The RMI government has urged the U.S. government to continue the DOE and 177 health programs. Additional programs for the nuclear affected atolls include resettlement, agricultural, and food programs. The Enewetak Food and Agriculture Program has been funded at an average annual amount of approximately $1.2 million between 1986 and 2003, with authorization for $1.3 million per year through 2023. The program also includes the shipment of USDA supplemental food commodities to the affected atolls. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides supplemental food commodities to the four affected atolls in the Marshall Islands. The Special Assistance Food Program, authorized by P.L.108-188, costs about $600,000 annually and continues under USDA appropriations. The Compact of Free Association established a Nuclear Claims Tribunal with $45.75 million for awards over 15 years. The Tribunal's compensation system is based on U.S. statutes for victims of nuclear testing. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands has paid out over $87 million in personal injury awards to 1,917 individuals as of December 2004. However, over 40% of awardees died before receiving full compensation due to lack of funds and pro-rated payments. Concerns were raised about political influence on the Tribunal's decisions, leading to an independent examination by former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh in 2002. The Thornburgh report found that the Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands operated independently and followed procedures similar to those in the United States. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act provides lump-sum payments to individuals affected by radiation-related diseases, administered by the Department of Justice's Civil Division. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, initially provided compensation to downwinders and uranium miners with specific cancers. It was later amended to include government employees exposed to above-ground tests. In 2000, RECA was expanded to include uranium millers and ore transporters, and added six more cancers to the list of compensable diseases. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides compensation to individuals who were physically present in affected areas downwind of the Nevada Test Site during above-ground testing and subsequently developed specified cancers. Downwinders and on-site participants may receive $50,000 for certain cancers, while individuals who participated in above-ground tests and developed the same cancers are eligible for $75,000. The program administration is handled by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP). The Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) received 14,987 claims through FY2002, with 52.8% approved and paid a total of $530.5 million. Downwinders filed the majority of claims, with 59.5% approved and paid $50,000 each. Congress makes annual appropriations to the RECA Trust Fund for compensation. The RECA Trust Fund received increased appropriations following the RECA Amendments of 2000, with a total of $108 million paid out in approved claims in FY2001. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 mandated appropriations for the Trust Fund for a 10-year period. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal adjudicates claims for compensation for personal injuries and property damage resulting from U.S. nuclear tests. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands compensates individuals for injuries and property damage from U.S. nuclear tests. Similar to RECA, claimants do not need to prove a direct link between radiation exposure and their illness. Residents during the testing period with specified diseases are eligible for compensation. Initially, 25 diseases were included based on evidence linking them to radiation exposure. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands reviews and amends its list of compensable diseases each year based on scientific evidence. Unlike RECA, the Tribunal awards varying amounts for different diseases on its list. In 2005, the National Research Council released a report on Radiation Exposure. The National Research Council (NRC) released a report in 2005 recommending new scientific criteria for awarding federal compensation to individuals exposed to radioactive fallout from U.S. nuclear weapons tests. The report suggested using probability of causation (PC) to determine if radiation exposure caused specific cancers, expanding compensation beyond current designated areas. The NRC recommended new criteria for awarding federal compensation to individuals exposed to radiation from nuclear weapons tests. Compensation is awarded if radiation exposure is likely the cause of specific cancer and meets Congress criteria. The Compact of Free Association created a $150 million Nuclear Claims Fund for Marshall Islands affected by nuclear testing. The Compact of Free Association established the Nuclear Claims Tribunal in 1986 to settle Marshall Islanders' compensation lawsuits against the US government. Article IX allowed for additional compensation if new damages were discovered, and the Fund was seen as a political settlement rather than a scientific assessment. The US Congress retained authority to approve additional compensation for personal injury and property damages under the Compact (P.L. 99-239). Legal counsel for the atolls suggested the possibility of returning to court for inadequate compensation. The RMI government seeks equitable remedies based on US compensation standards for radiation exposure. Unpaid NCT personal injury awards amount to $15.7 million. Unpaid NCT personal injury awards of $15.7 million. Unpaid NCT property damages awards to Enewetak Atoll ($386 million) and Bikini Atoll ($563 million) for loss of use of their lands, restoration costs, and hardships suffered. $50 million for medical infrastructure. $45 million annually for a \"Section 177\" health care program for those exposed to radiation. Extension of DOE medical surveillance and environmental monitoring program for 50 years. Capacity-building, occupational safety, and nuclear stewardship programs for the RMI. The Petition justifies its claims of \"changed circumstances\" based on new information since the Compact's enactment, including wider radioactive fallout and updated safety levels for radiation exposure. It argues for higher health consequences and costs, as well as lower investment returns from the Nuclear Claims Fund. Studies and factors highlight the inadequacy of Compact provisions. The Petition challenges the Compact provisions based on declassified information revealing wider radioactive fallout and updated safety levels for radiation exposure. Experts argue that more atolls were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation than previously thought. Additionally, new directives in the late 1990s established a lower annual dose limit compared to previous assumptions. The Compact agreement had a dose limit of 500 mrem per year, but the EPA's 15 mrem standard would increase cleanup costs for more atolls exposed to radiation. Studies showed radiation exposure to be more damaging than previously estimated, with higher external radiation doses and underestimated thyroid doses for residents of certain atolls. The funding provided by the Compact was deemed insufficient for the necessary health care, surveillance, and monitoring of affected Marshallese citizens and atolls. The Compact agreement's funding for health care and monitoring of Marshallese citizens and atolls was deemed inadequate. The Nuclear Claims Fund did not meet projected returns, with losses in 1987 and 2001-02, earning $160 million instead of $270 million as expected. The Petition argues that unexpected claims and low interest earnings have depleted the Fund, leaving only $4 million with $15.7 million in unpaid awards in 2005. The Bush Administration's report in November 2004 rejected the claim of \"changed circumstances,\" citing the Fund's mixed earnings record and high medical care demands as insufficient reasons for additional funding. The report also criticized the NCT for granting personal injury awards too liberally. The Tribunal provided payments for medical conditions not recognized under U.S. radiation injury compensation programs, including descendants of affected individuals. The Administration disputes the Petition's scientific claims regarding exposure levels in certain atolls. There is no legal basis for funding health education, occupational safety, and community programs under the Changed Circumstances Clause. The report states that the southern atolls in the Marshall Islands were not exposed to dangerous levels of radioactive fallout. The Nationwide Radiological Survey commissioned by the RMI found that only four atolls had unsafe radiation levels. The Administration challenges the RMI's assertion of increased risk. The BEIR Committee's estimates of radiation risk are higher than Behling's, according to the Administration report. It denies past cleanup inadequacies on the Marshall Islands and states that current radiation doses are below recommended levels. The RMI's cleanup efforts exceed U.S. guidelines and Tribunal standards. The Changed Circumstances Petition raises issues related to personal injury, health care, and property damages claims in the Marshall Islands, including radiation-related illnesses, property damage valuation, cleanup level standards, and legal options for pursuing nuclear damages claims. Cancer estimates from the NCI in 2004 provide insight into potential future personal injury compensation requests in the Marshall Islands. Among the approximately 14,000 persons in the Marshall Islands during the 1946-1958 period of nuclear testing, NCI estimated that about 6,130 cancers would occur over their lifetimes. About 5,600 of those cancers would have occurred even if the nuclear tests had not taken place (baseline risk), and about 530 were estimated to be caused by fallout from the tests. The nuclear testing program was projected to increase the cancer rate for the exposed population by about 9% above the baseline. NCI's baseline cancer risk estimate was derived from cancer rates for all races, adjusted to reflect statistics for ethnic Hawaiians. Estimates of the additional risk were based on various data collection methods. Less than 10% of the projected cancers were estimated by NCI. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal policy ensures compensation for testing victims by awarding those with specified types of cancer. NCI estimates that half of projected cancers for the testing population are yet to develop or be diagnosed. Over 2,000 personal injury awards have been made, indicating more claims may still be filed. Extending eligibility to those born after the testing period is also considered. The loss-of-use methodology for Enewetak and Bikini claims was developed by a consulting firm under contract for claimants and the NCT. No alternative methodologies were explored. The estimates of the dollar value of loss-of-use were adjusted and awarded by the NCT as damages. The methodology used to estimate the value of lost property use is considered reasonable and appropriate. The loss-of-use methodology for Enewetak and Bikini claims, developed by a consulting firm, is viewed as reasonable. However, critical data, assumptions, and statistical procedures used in the methodology result in overstated loss-of-use estimates. The main issue lies in the use of inflated average rents per acre, leading to an overestimate of both past and future loss-of-use. The NCT methodology overestimates past loss of use by assuming more land was lost for longer periods than actually occurred. It undervalues rentals on alternative habitation and assumes recipients would have saved 100% of rental proceeds. Alternative methodologies could have led to a different outcome in estimating the fair market rental value of lands belonging to the people of Enewetak and Bikini. The U.S. government should have paid rents to the atoll residents for the use of their land, based on estimated rental values. Compensation is calculated for the period when the nuclear bombs were tested and the islands remained unsafe due to radiation contamination. The total loss-of-use includes past loss-of-use and future periods up to 2027. The loss-of-use compensation for Enewetak residents includes past loss-of-use, which covers rents from evacuation in 1947 to return in 1980, and future loss-of-use until decontamination. Prejudgment interest is also awarded. The Enewetak people were allowed to return to only 646.82 acres of the atoll in 1980, with 1,305.78 acres remaining off-limits due to radioactive contamination. Past loss-of-use includes estimated rents from 1980 to 1996. For Bikini, past loss-of-use is the estimated rental value of the entire atoll from 1967 to 1997. The methodology assumes continuous loss-of-use. The NCT's Estimated Damages for Loss-of-Use are detailed in Table 1. The Operations of the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal Established Pursuant to U.S. Public Law 99-239 on April 23, 2004, discussed the Changed Circumstances Petition and Bill Graham. Pre-judgment interest on loss-of-use for Bikini is not available. The Hallstrom Group estimates of past lost use are significantly higher than the Darroch report estimates. The value of past lost use is calculated based on estimated average rents per acre for each year of denied use. The calculation of compensation for past lost use involves estimating average rents per acre for each year of denied use, subtracting the rental value of alternative habitation, deducting prior compensation paid, applying a compound interest factor, adding interest income from investing rental proceeds, and summing the interest-adjusted estimated rentals cumulatively. The pre-judgment interest methodology calculates interest on the original awards for Enewetak and Bikini islands from the date of loss-of-use claims to the time of awards. Future loss-of-use methodology is described for both islands. The future loss-of-use methodology for Enewetak and Bikini islands calculates the value of projected foregone rental income over a specific time period until claimants can return to a safe homeland. The future loss-of-use methodology for Enewetak and Bikini islands calculates the value of projected foregone rental income over a specific time period until claimants can return to a safe homeland in 2027. The methodology used by the NCT to estimate the value of the lost use of the claimants' property is viewed as reasonable and appropriate, although specific assumptions and data can lead to inflated loss-of-use estimates. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value for Enewetak and Bikini atolls involves calculating the present and future rental value of the land based on fair market rents per acre. This approach, rooted in economic theory, aims to determine the U.S. government's responsibility for preventing the use of the land by Enewetakians and Bikinians. The NCT's methodology for estimating loss-of-use value adjusts estimated rentals owed for past payments, alternative accommodations, and interest earned. It samples lease transactions to estimate average rents per acre, crucial for loss-of-use estimates. Future loss-of-use is estimated as the present discounted value of projected values. The NCT's methodology for estimating loss-of-use value adjusts estimated rentals owed for past payments, alternative accommodations, and interest earned. It samples lease transactions to estimate average rents per acre, crucial for loss-of-use estimates. However, the methodology produces overstated past and future loss-of-use estimates, leading to possibly excessive damages claimed and awarded by the NCT. The main issue lies in inflated estimates of average rents per acre, impacting both past and future loss-of-use calculations. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value uses a nonrandom sample of average rents per acre from lease transactions, which may not accurately reflect rents on Enewetak and Bikini. The RMI cabinet has set above-market rentals on government-involved leases since 1979, with an official government rental rate established at $2,500/acre in 1979 and increased to $3,000/acre in 1989, serving as a benchmark for all other leases. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value uses a nonrandom sample of average rents per acre from lease transactions. The official government rental rate established at $2,500/acre in 1979 and increased to $3,000/acre in 1989 serves as a benchmark for all other leases, creating a \"rent floor\" for transactions. The methodology applies an exponential regression model to inflated average rents sample data, biased by the official rates, leading to an overestimation of past loss-of-use. Rents reflect values that fluctuate based on economic circumstances, rather than following an exponential trend since 1946. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value in Enewetak and Bikini islands is biased due to inflated rents and assumptions about the quantity of land denied to the people. Despite portions of the atolls being destroyed by nuclear testing, the methodology assumes they were not, leading to inflated rents continuing through 2026 for Enewetak and 2027 for Bikini. The appropriate methodology should compensate landowners for the value of the destroyed portions plus interest. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value in Enewetak and Bikini islands is biased due to inflated rents and assumptions about the quantity of land denied to the people. The assumption that the rental value of alternative properties provided to the claimants by the U.S. government is generally only a fraction of the average rents on the atolls is problematic. This carries over an upward bias from prior calculations and underestimates the true value of the properties. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value in Enewetak and Bikini islands is flawed due to inflated rents and assumptions about the quantity of land denied to the people. The NCT methodology also assumes continuous loss-of-use for Bikinians, despite some returning to the atoll from 1969 to 1978. The methodology for estimating loss-of-use value in Enewetak and Bikini islands is flawed due to inflated rents and assumptions about the quantity of land denied to the people. The return of some Bikinians to the contaminated atoll from 1969 to 1978 impacts the estimation of loss-of-use value. The assumption that 100% of rental proceeds would be invested in Treasury bonds is unrealistic, as islanders would likely save only a fraction and consume the rest. The present discounted value methodology overestimates future lost use in Enewetak and Bikini islands due to inflated rent estimates and assumptions about residents returning to use vaporized islands. Residents of the Marshall Islands have ongoing concerns about this overestimation. The residents of the Marshall Islands are concerned about the United States' efforts to clean up radioactive contamination from past nuclear tests. Scientific data suggest that external exposure to soil is not a significant health risk, but consuming food grown on contaminated soil could pose a higher risk. The degree of risk is uncertain, with the Republic of the Marshall Islands claiming that prior cleanup standards were less stringent than current US standards. The Republic of the Marshall Islands is requesting additional financial compensation from the United States for a more extensive cleanup of radioactive contamination, citing a larger area of contamination than previously thought and the need to meet current US standards. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal agreed that the US should provide additional compensation for cleanup efforts. The Bush Administration argues against federal funding for additional compensation for environmental restoration in the Marshall Islands, stating that radiation protection standards have not changed, contamination area remains the same, and current radiation doses are safe. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal recommended the US to pay for the cleanup. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal recommended additional compensation of $251.5 million for environmental restoration of Bikini Atoll and $91.7 million for Enewetak Atoll. The total estimated costs are $360.5 million and $101.7 million respectively. Adjustments were made from previous compensation paid by the United States. The RMI estimated cleanup costs for contaminated soil by using it for construction, treating with potassium, and monitoring. They chose a cost-effective approach of soil removal and potassium treatment instead of removing all contaminated soil. The RMI considered shipping removed soil to the US for disposal but opted for a different option. The RMI considered shipping contaminated material to a disposal facility in the US but chose a sealed causeway alternative for local disposal. The IAEA's policy on environmental cleanup applies to contamination from past events, including nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands. The RMI argues for further cleanup based on more stringent US standards and the IAEA's position on radiation protection. The IAEA's policy on transboundary radiation exposure, released in 1985, states that cleanup standards for populations outside national borders should be as stringent as those within the country of release. This policy primarily applies to situations where a nuclear facility near a border releases radiation across borders, rather than to cleanup from past nuclear tests. The IAEA's current policy document on environmental cleanup, released in November 2003, consolidates many policies from previous safety series. It includes a policy on transboundary exposure, recommending that radiation protection for populations outside national borders should be as stringent as those within the country of discharge. This policy applies to ongoing activities such as nuclear reactor operations. The IAEA's policy on environmental cleanup applies to ongoing activities like nuclear reactor operations and sets objectives for protecting public safety. It recommends a framework for nations to establish their own legal and regulatory requirements for cleanup in contaminated areas where radiation levels exceed 10 millisieverts annually. The policy does not specify the quantity or demographics that would constitute a critical group. The IAEA's policy on environmental cleanup does not specify the quantity or demographics that would constitute a group for measuring mean dose. Each nation has discretion in defining a dosage group and deciding on cleanup based on their legal requirements. The safety standards are not legally binding on Member States, including the United States, unless the IAEA is involved in a specific action at their request. The standards may be adopted by Member States for use in national regulations, but are binding on the IAEA and States in relation to their own operations. The IAEA's safety policies are recommended guidelines for protecting against radiation exposure, not legally binding. This means that applying IAEA policy to cleanup in the Marshall Islands is a policy decision, not a legal requirement. The degree of cleanup in the US varies among regulatory agencies, and the RMI has its own cleanup standards. The RMI's cleanup standards are based on an EPA standard limiting annual radiation exposure to 15 millirems, which is different from the IAEA's recommended standard. EPA and DOE standards focus on limiting exposure above natural background levels, with no restrictions on radioactivity concentration in soil or water. The cleanup level depends on potential human exposure pathways for intended land use. The RMI's cleanup standards are based on EPA's 15 millirem standard for annual radiation exposure, which considers potential human exposure pathways for intended land use. EPA's standard is not legally enforceable but guides cleanup efforts at Superfund sites with radioactive contamination. The RMI argues for using EPA's 15 millirem standard for cleanup in the Marshall Islands, but DOE's general standard for cleanup at nuclear sites is 100 millirems. DOE has not enforced this standard but uses it internally. The DOE uses a cleanup standard of 100 millirems internally, equivalent to the NRC's standard for civilian nuclear power plants. The NRC's more stringent standard of 25 millirems applies to its licensed facilities, not to DOE nuclear weapons sites. The DOE has agreed to EPA's 15 millirem standard for cleanup in some cases. The DOE has agreed to EPA's 15 millirem standard for cleanup at former nuclear weapons production sites like Hanford and Rocky Flats. The application of this standard to the cleanup of the Marshall Islands is uncertain due to various factors. The cleanup standards for Hanford and Rocky Flats are more restrictive than in the Marshall Islands, reducing the likelihood of human exposure to radioactivity. Both sites will not be used for residential or agricultural purposes, with Hanford continuing as a waste treatment facility. The 15 millirem standard is applied to these sites, but it does not set a precedent for other cleanup efforts. The 15 millirem standard applied to Hanford and Rocky Flats does not necessarily set a precedent for the level of cleanup desired by the RMI. The Bush Administration opposes using the 15 millirem standard in the Marshall Islands and advocates for the continued use of the 100 millirem standard. The State Department report acknowledged that the EPA and NRC cleanup standards are more stringent than the 100 millirem standard advocated by the Administration for the cleanup of the Marshall Islands. The report did not explain why the Administration did not apply EPA's stricter standard to the cleanup. The Administration did not provide an alternative cost estimate for additional environmental cleanup in the Marshall Islands, as they argue that no cleanup is necessary to meet the 100 millirem standard. Medical tests show that current human doses of radioactive isotopes in the Marshall Islands do not exceed 15 millirems above natural background levels, indicating that additional remediation is not needed according to the Administration. The Marshall Islands do not require remediation as per the Administration's argument. Surveys have been conducted to identify radioactive contamination, with the most comprehensive one being the Nationwide Radiological Survey in 1994. It revealed that radioactivity levels are highest in the northernmost islands. Residents have expressed concerns about the accuracy of these surveys in identifying all contaminated areas. The panel concluded that some cleanup may be necessary for certain islands in the Marshall Islands due to radioactivity levels, despite the low health risk. The RMI disputes the findings, claiming more contaminated areas exist. The RMI advocates for more contamination surveys to identify areas needing cleanup to protect the population. The Tribunal's compensation decision for Bikini Atoll included $4.5 million for surveys to fund environmental restoration. The Bush Administration supports the 1994 survey findings and argues against the need for broader cleanup to protect residents, assuming unoccupied contaminated areas won't be resettled. Certain northern atolls are deemed too contaminated for habitation or food gathering, while most areas are considered safe. The Administration indicated that historically inhabited islands in the northern atolls could be resettled under specific conditions, without specifying what those conditions might be or if cleanup would be necessary due to radioactivity. Efforts to understand the health effects of radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands may reveal the need for remediation to protect residents. Efforts to understand the health effects of radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands may lead to decisions on remediation for currently settled areas, even if access to unoccupied areas remains restricted. Litigation involving inhabitants of the RMI, including those from Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, brought cases against the United States for damages resulting from nuclear weapons testing. The Court handled three different groups of cases separately, with some seeking to file suit again. The cases were suspended during negotiations for the Compact of Free Association between the US and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. When litigation resumed, the government moved to dismiss, but the court found that some claims had merit and waived sovereign immunity for the claims. The court allowed plaintiffs to move forward with claims of takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment and breaches of an implied-in-fact contract between the people of Bikini and the United States. The statute of limitations barred some claims by the Enewetak people, but a breach of contract claim was allowed to proceed. Claims of breach of contract were found not barred by sovereign immunity, leading to a denial of a motion to dismiss. The court allowed plaintiffs to proceed with claims of takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment and breaches of an implied-in-fact contract. The United States' motion to dismiss was denied for takings claims but allowed for other claims. The Compact of Free Association was agreed upon, with the United States accepting responsibility for compensation owed to citizens of the Marshall Islands due to nuclear testing. The Section 177 Agreement established a Nuclear Claims Tribunal to settle nuclear testing claims, terminating all related claims and dismissing pending cases in US courts. The United States argued that the claims were non-justiciable due to being a political question involving foreign affairs powers. The plaintiffs' arguments regarding the termination of their rights under the Section 177 Agreement were rejected by the Court of Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Various legal arguments made by the plaintiffs were also dismissed, including the concept of \"espousal.\" The newly-formed RMI espoused the claims of its citizens against the US for damages from nuclear testing and settled under the Section 177 agreement. The plaintiffs argued that the waiver of legal rights was not valid due to the \"continuous nationality\" rule. The \"continuous nationality\" rule in international law states that a state cannot ask another state to pay for damages to its citizens if they were not citizens at the time of the loss. The RMI lacked legal capacity to espouse the plaintiffs' claims, as analyzed by the Court of Claims in the Bikini Atoll case. The issue was not about naturalized citizens bringing claims from a chosen forum for convenience. The court deferred a decision on whether the \"continuous nationality\" rule should be applied to an emerging state seeking to espouse claims arising before its creation, as it was a novel area in international law. The rule stems from the broader principle that a state can only espouse claims on behalf of its nationals. The \"continuous nationality\" rule may not strongly apply in the instant case as most injured parties are likely citizens of RMI since its inception. The doctrine arises from restrictive interpretations of bilateral treaties, assuming exclusion of non-nationals at the time of injury. The court considered the application of the \"continuous nationality\" doctrine to the interpretation of the Compact, which was intended to extend to the plaintiffs. There was a debate on whether limiting the court's jurisdiction violated the Constitution, as it could deprive plaintiffs of judicial remedies for constitutional rights violations. The United States argued that the Tribunal established by the Section 177 Agreement provided adequate compensation for any takings. The Court of Claims dismissed the case due to the withdrawal of its jurisdiction by Congress. If the plaintiffs file suit again, the United States may argue it as a political question to be resolved by the Executive Branch, not the courts. Marbury v. Madison established that certain political questions are for the political branches, not the judiciary. The current case involves the US relationship with individuals under its stewardship, not a foreign country. The issue is about interpretation, not the legitimacy of the Compact with RMI. The ultimate shape of the US political question argument in this situation is unclear. The Court of Claims dismissed the case due to Congress withdrawing its jurisdiction, leaving the possibility for the US to argue it as a political question for the Executive Branch to resolve. Sources for Nuclear Testing in the Marshall Islands from 1964-2004 include agreements between the US and the Marshall Islands government, a report to Congress, and a chronology of events. Authorized amounts may not have been fully appropriated. A $45 million agreement was signed for resettlement purposes. Radiation compensation amounts are compared from various sources including the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program and the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. The Department of Justice and Nuclear Claims Tribunal provided information on payments from the Nuclear Claims Fund and the current status. Sources include testimonies, agreements, and a timeline of events in the Marshall Islands. Additionally, a map of the Marshall Islands was included in the appendix."
