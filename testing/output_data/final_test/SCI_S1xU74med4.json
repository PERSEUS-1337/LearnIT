    "content": "The ResNet and batch-normalization (BN) show high performance with limited labeled data. Analyzing the skip-connection in ResNet and BN's effect on data separation ability reveals that skip-connection and BN improve data separation ability, encouraging neural networks to separate points from different classes. The architecture of neural networks, such as CNN, ResNet, and BN, enables high performance with limited labeled data. These networks capture prior knowledge about the problem and statistical properties of the data, improving data separation ability in few-shot learning problems. The convolutional layer of CNN captures statistical properties of data like shift invariance and compositionality through local features. The effects of skip-connection in ResNet and BN on feature vectors are unclear. Analysis shows that skip-connection and BN preserve the angle between input vectors, which is crucial for classification. This preservation at initialization helps neural networks separate points from different classes. The ResNet with batch-normalization encourages neural networks to separate points from different classes by improving data separation ability and achieving high performance with few labeled data. The neural networks transform input vectors into new feature vectors through layers using ReLU activation function. The weights are randomly initialized for analysis of average behavior. The weights in the MLP and ResNet were initialized differently due to the activation functions used. The paper defines angle and cosine similarity in the context of neural networks. The analysis shows that the MLP contracts the angle between input vectors, which is considered undesirable. The MLP contracts the angle between input vectors, which is undesirable for classification. Skip-connection in ResNet and BN relax this contraction. Numerical simulations on the MNIST dataset validated the analysis. Skip-connection in ResNet and BN preserve the angle between input vectors by bypassing the ReLU activation function. BN reduces the effect of the ReLU activation function. The ReLU activation function affects the angle between input vectors in a neural network. The angle converges to zero exponentially with depth, but skip-connections in ResNet and batch normalization (BN) slow down this convergence. Numerical simulations on the MNIST dataset confirmed these findings. The angle between input vectors in a neural network is affected by the ReLU activation function. Results show that randomly initialized neural networks contract the angle between input vectors from different classes. Training can control the angle by adjusting the parameter \u03b8, making small angles smaller and large angles larger. Validation was done by training a model on the MNIST dataset, showing the change in angles of feature vectors. The discussion highlights the impact of training on the angles of feature vectors in a neural network. The initialized MLP shows small angles, indicating no extreme separation of classes, while skip-connections and BN maintain angles even at higher layers, leading to better class separation. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of ResNet and BN with limited labeled data. The analysis focuses on the role of skip-connections and BN in transforming input vectors through layers. The skip-connection and BN in neural networks preserve the angle between input vectors, aiding in data separation and achieving high performance with limited labeled data."
