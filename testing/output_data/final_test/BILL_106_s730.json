The \"Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1999\" aims to establish a cigarette fire safety standard due to the high number of deaths, injuries, and property damage caused by cigarette ignited fires in the United States. Congress has found that over 1,000 deaths and $420 million in property damage were caused by such fires in 1996 alone. Additionally, more than 100 children die each year from cigarette-related fires.
