    "content": "Coal fired power plants in the United States generate almost 45% of electric power and produce a significant amount of coal combustion waste (CCW). In 2008, 136 million tons of CCW was generated, making it the second largest waste stream in the country. CCW can be managed by disposal in landfills, surface impoundment ponds, or mines as minefill, or it can be used in beneficial ways like in concrete or cement. These management methods are regulated at the state level rather than federally. On December 22, 2008, a breach at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston, TN plant released 1.1 billion gallons of coal fly ash slurry, causing extensive damage to homes and property. The sludge contaminated the Emory and Clinch rivers, leading to fish kills. Arsenic levels exceeding EPA standards were found in samples taken in January 2009, with an estimated cleanup cost of $1.2 billion. The estimated cleanup cost of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston plant breach could change depending on containment methods, ash disposal, and new regulations. The cleanup may take two to three years, and other incidents related to coal ash management have also garnered attention. For example, a $54 million class action settlement was approved in Maryland due to contaminated drinking water from coal ash disposal. Recent incidents in a Gambrills, MD, quarry have contaminated owners' drinking water with arsenic, lead, cadmium, and sulphates above EPA standards. Concerns about coal combustion waste (CCW) management include the generation of large volumes of waste accumulating for decades at power plants, with hazardous constituents likely present. The EPA has identified hazardous constituents in coal combustion waste (CCW) such as heavy metals and toxic organic materials. These constituents can contaminate groundwater or surface water, posing risks to human health and the environment. EPA found that the risk of human exposure to arsenic and other metals in CCW increases significantly when disposed of in unlined landfills or surface impoundments. Most new landfills and impoundments have liners and groundwater monitoring systems, but challenges remain in ensuring proper waste management. The EPA has identified hazardous constituents in coal combustion waste (CCW) such as heavy metals and toxic organic materials. CCW is exempt from federal hazardous waste management regulations and is regulated by state requirements. EPA has recognized the need for national regulations on CCW disposal due to inconsistencies in state requirements. Concerns have been raised by the public about potential health and property risks from waste releases. Industry organizations argue that CCW is generally safe and poses minimal risk. Environmental organizations and some Members of Congress express concerns about the inadequate oversight and monitoring of coal combustion waste disposal sites. They argue that the Kingston spill serves as a warning sign for future spills and highlight the need for stricter regulations. Stakeholders debate the impact of managing waste according to hazardous waste regulations on its potential for use and disposal costs. The EPA has been studying how to regulate coal combustion waste (CCW) since 1980. In 2000, EPA determined that CCW did not need regulation under hazardous waste requirements but should be regulated under solid waste management requirements when disposed in landfills or surface impoundments. CCW used in mines may also require regulation under existing regulations or modifications under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Various surveys have been conducted since then. Since 1980, the EPA has been studying how to regulate coal combustion waste (CCW). In 2000, EPA determined that CCW should be regulated under solid waste management requirements. Despite various surveys and reports, no federal regulations have been proposed. EPA declared its intent to move forward with CCW regulations in 2009 after the Kingston release. Concerns have been raised about whether CCW will be regulated as a solid or hazardous waste. EPA has stated that regulating CCW under solid waste management requirements would provide sufficient protection. The EPA has been studying how to regulate coal combustion waste (CCW) since 1980. In 2009, EPA announced a delay in its decision on regulating CCW due to the complexity of the analysis. The amount of CCW generated each year is significant, and as emission standards become stricter, the waste generated is expected to increase. The report discusses the nature of the waste, potential risks, and regulatory issues. This report focuses on the regulatory history of coal combustion waste (CCW) management, including why CCW is exempt from federal regulations. It also discusses CCW management options such as landfill and surface impoundment disposal, and the associated state and federal requirements. The report does not provide risk analysis or details on the Kingston release, but primarily focuses on issues related to CCW disposal. Coal combustion waste (CCW) includes inorganic residues left after burning coal, with different types generated at various stages of the combustion process. These residues consist of coarse particles settling at the bottom of the combustion chamber and fine particles removed from flue gas. Understanding the characteristics of specific CCW types and the environment they are placed in is crucial to minimize negative impacts. Factors like the coal source influence the waste's characteristics and potential risks. Coal combustion waste (CCW) characteristics and potential toxicity are influenced by factors such as the source of the coal burned and the technology used. Different types of CCW have varying physical and chemical characteristics that affect their potential for use and risk to human health and the environment. The National Research Council (NRC) identified factors like the chemical characteristics of the source coal that influence CCW properties. Coal-fired boilers may be co-fired with materials such as wood, biomass, plastics, petroleum coke, tire-derived fuel, or manufactured gas plant wastes. The processes and technology used at individual utility plants affect waste characteristics, including the presence of toxic constituents like heavy metals. The waste from coal-fired boilers may contain heavy metals like arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, lead, and mercury, as well as toxic organic materials such as dioxins and PAH compounds. Different types of coal have varying chemical compositions and ash content, with fly ash containing silica, alumina, iron oxide, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. This coal combustion waste can be used in cement production or as a soil amendment. Knowledge of coal chemistry and technology used in firing and collecting it is crucial. The disposal or use of coal combustion waste (CCW) poses risks of hazardous material leaching into groundwater or surface water, potentially contaminating living organisms. Land disposal of liquid waste could lead to sudden releases. Airborne dispersion of hazardous constituents is a concern, but the primary focus is on leaching into water sources and contaminating drinking water, surface water, and biota. The 2006 NRC report highlighted factors influencing heavy metal migration from waste, including water volume and flow. Contaminants are more likely to migrate from unlined disposal units. Water chemistry, especially pH, also plays a role in contaminant transport. EPA emphasizes the importance of water flow through waste in determining migration risk. The pH of water flowing through waste affects metal solubility. Different metals in coal combustion waste (CCW) are soluble in acidic, alkaline, or neutral environments. CCW can neutralize acidity, making it useful for treating acid mine drainage. Monitoring contamination migration at CCW disposal sites is challenging. EPA has documented damages from disposal in landfills and impoundments, but data on contamination in mines or beneficial use sites is limited. There is limited data on contamination from coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal in mines or its beneficial use on land. CCW is managed in ways that could lead to contamination, such as in surface impoundment ponds. The Kingston release in 2009 highlighted the risks of such disposal methods. EPA has requested better tracking of data to prevent catastrophic releases. In 2009, EPA requested information from owners of CCW impoundment units to prioritize inspections and assess structural integrity. Responses identified 584 units, including 49 high hazard units, at 30 locations. High hazard rating does not indicate potential failure. EPA aims to prevent catastrophic releases like the Kingston incident. The EPA's dam safety rating helps prioritize inspections at waste facilities under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to protect human health and the environment from hazards of waste disposal. The evolution of CCW regulation has a complex history. The history of CCW regulation is complex, involving EPA's authority under RCRA, the \"Bevill amendment\" exclusion, and current debates on categorizing CCW as solid or hazardous waste. Challenges in the rulemaking process revolve around identifying CCW as either solid or hazardous waste. The EPA's authority under RCRA involves identifying waste as solid or hazardous based on specific characteristics like toxicity, reactivity, ignitability, or corrosivity. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) is used to determine toxicity levels in waste, simulating landfill conditions to prevent toxic constituents from leaching into groundwater. Generally, CCW does not exceed toxicity levels in TCLP tests. CCW is unique due to its large volume and inert materials that dilute hazardous constituents. EPA lists hazardous wastes, including source-specific wastes like those from petroleum refining or pesticide manufacturing. If CCW is deemed hazardous, it would likely be a specifically listed waste. Certain wastes may be excluded from the definition of hazardous waste or solid waste for reasons such as public policy, economic impacts, lack of data, or high volume and low toxicity. The decision to exclude materials is either due to congressional action or EPA policy making. For example, Congress excluded CCW from the definition of hazardous waste pending additional study from EPA. Subtitle D of RCRA designates state and local governments as the primary entities for managing non-hazardous solid waste. EPA is required to regulate solid waste. Subtitle C of RCRA focuses on regulating hazardous waste management facilities, including treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). EPA is authorized to establish a system for controlling hazardous waste from generation to disposal, requiring permits, compliance with operating standards, financial requirements for accidents, and closure of facilities according to EPA regulations. EPA does not have authority to regulate facilities that receive non-hazardous industrial solid waste or household hazardous waste from small quantity generators. The 1984 amendments to RCRA imposed new requirements on TSDFs to minimize land disposal of hazardous wastes. Bulk hazardous liquid wastes are prohibited from landfills, and strict restrictions are placed on disposal of containerized hazardous liquids. EPA set minimum technological standards for new landfills and surface impoundments, including double liners, leachate collection systems, and groundwater monitoring. EPA identified six categories of \"special wastes\" for regulation in proposed hazardous waste management regulations in 1978. The 1980 Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments exempted \"special wastes\" from hazardous waste regulation under RCRA until further risk assessment could be conducted. These special wastes, including fossil fuel combustion wastes, were considered to pose less risk to human health and the environment. EPA was granted broad enforcement tools under Section 7003 of RCRA to address imminent and substantial risks. Section 7003 of RCRA grants EPA enforcement tools to address imminent risks from solid or hazardous waste handling. It allows EPA to take legal action or issue orders to prevent endangerment. This section is useful in situations where other enforcement tools are not applicable, such as at sites not regulated by subtitle C of RCRA. Under Section 7003 of RCRA, EPA can take action if there is imminent endangerment to health or the environment from past or present waste handling. The agency has the authority to obtain relevant information and address risks on a case-by-case basis. This section is seen as an alternative for EPA to regulate waste management by some industry representatives. Proponents argue for an alternative approach to EPA regulating CCW management, allowing enforcement of disposal practices or uses posing a threat. Opponents view this method as resource-intensive, requiring site-specific data collection instead of a consistent national regulation approach. In 1980, Congress debated RCRA reauthorization, with an amendment proposed to defer hazardous waste regulations for fossil fuel combustion and discarded mining waste until potential hazards are analyzed. EPA's intent to regulate such waste as hazardous was questioned. In 1980, Congress debated RCRA reauthorization, with an amendment proposed to defer hazardous waste regulations for fossil fuel combustion and discarded mining waste until potential hazards are analyzed. Congressman Bevill argued against EPA's intent to regulate such waste as hazardous, stating it would discourage coal use and burden the utility industry. P.L. 96-482, enacted on October 12, 1980, provided EPA with stronger enforcement authority for illegal hazardous waste dumping. The final version included an amendment excluding large-volume wastes from the definition of hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA, such as waste generated from coal combustion and other fossil fuels. The Bevill amendment deferred hazardous waste regulations for fossil fuel combustion and mining waste until potential hazards are analyzed. Factors to be addressed in each study included determining potential danger to human health or the environment, identifying disposal practices and costs of alternatives, and assessing current and potential future uses of coal combustion products. EPA was directed to make a regulatory decision within six months of each report to Congress. Since 1980, EPA has conducted studies and made regulatory determinations on whether coal combustion waste should be regulated as hazardous waste. Actions primarily focused on landfill and surface impoundment disposal, with some studies on beneficial use. EPA and OSM have conducted activities related to mine placement of coal combustion waste. EPA concluded in 2000 that coal combustion waste did not warrant regulation as hazardous waste. EPA determined that coal combustion waste (CCW) did not need regulation as hazardous waste under subtitle C. However, EPA acknowledged the potential risks to human health and the environment if CCW is not properly managed, citing inadequate controls in place for existing utility surface impoundments. EPA emphasized the need for better controls due to the environmental releases of metals, large waste volume, and hazardous constituents present in CCW. EPA plans to establish national regulations under RCRA subtitle D for coal combustion waste disposal, following data gathering and public hearings. EPA announced its intent to develop regulations after the Kingston release and stated its plan to propose regulations by the end of 2009. EPA cited sections 1008(a) and 4004(a) of the law as the basis of its authority. The EPA cited sections 1008(a) and 4004(a) of the law as the basis of its authority to regulate coal combustion waste disposal. However, in 2009, it was stated that subtitle D only gave EPA authority to regulate sanitary landfills, not facilities receiving coal combustion waste. The EPA does not have the authority to regulate facilities receiving coal combustion waste under subtitle D. EPA has three options for regulating coal combustion waste, with a regulatory proposal currently on hold. In 2008, 136 million tons of coal combustion waste were generated, with 8% disposed of in mines. In 2008, 136 million tons of coal combustion waste (CCW) were generated. 8% was disposed of in mines, 37% used in various capacities, and the rest was disposed of in landfills or impoundments. State regulations govern CCW management methods, with minimal federal involvement. Regulations vary not only from state to state but also from unit to unit. Regulatory requirements for coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal vary between impoundments, landfills, and mine disposal sites, with state regulations playing a significant role. The total number of disposal units and waste usage sites is not tracked, leading to unknown elements in current disposal practices. Landfilling CCW involves long-term disposal on land. CCW involves long-term disposal of dry waste on land or in excavations. Surface impoundment units hold liquid waste from power plants, with solids settling out. Impoundments can be natural or man-made depressions used for storage or treatment. Solids may be dredged periodically or taken to a landfill. In 2006, EPA and DOE studied state regulatory requirements for CCW landfills and impoundments built between 1994 and 2004. The EPA/DOE study in 2009 found that there were more surface impoundments for coal combustion waste (CCW) than previously estimated, with 584 ponds nationwide. Regulations for disposal units varied significantly between states, with permits required for operation according to solid waste, water pollution control, or dam safety requirements. The EPA/DOE study in 2009 found that regulations for coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal units varied between states, with permits required for operation based on solid waste, water pollution control, or dam safety requirements. Older landfills and surface impoundments built before 1994 may not have the necessary liners, leachate collection systems, or groundwater monitoring devices. States commonly regulate the structure and discharges from surface impoundments according to dam safety and water pollution control requirements. States often allow exceptions to regulatory requirements for coal combustion waste disposal, such as alternative compliance methods on a case-by-case basis. While many states require groundwater monitoring for contamination detection, fewer have regulations to prevent contamination, leading to variations in state programs and the need for consistent national regulation. Consistent national regulation is needed for coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal under RCRA Subtitle D. States regulate CCW landfills under their solid waste management programs, treating CCW as solid waste rather than hazardous waste. Landfills must operate according to permit criteria set by the state. Some states require new CCW landfills to have liners, groundwater monitoring systems, leachate collection systems, and closure/post-closure requirements under their solid waste permit program. Not all states regulate CCW landfills through permits, with some using dam safety requirements to oversee surface impoundments. Five states exempt certain CCW landfills from solid waste permitting requirements, but still have operational regulations in place. State dam requirements for coal combustion waste (CCW) surface impoundments are similar to those for mining waste surface impoundments under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). For example, West Virginia has dam safety requirements for CCW surface impoundments, including the need for approval to construct or repair waste disposal dams and detailed design and construction plans. These requirements aim to prevent breaches like the one that occurred at Kingston. State dam requirements for coal combustion waste (CCW) surface impoundments are similar to those for mining waste surface impoundments under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). Units must meet specific design requirements, such as conformance to general hydrological requirements and address criteria applicable to foundation stability, structural consideration, and spillways. The presence of strong dam safety requirements is not a guarantee that regulated units will actually be operated and maintained according to those requirements. State dam safety requirements may be challenging to enforce due to limited inspectors and strict construction and operation requirements. Disposal units like surface impoundments may be regulated as water pollution control facilities, treating and discharging wastewater into state waters. This can make it difficult to assess compliance with regulations. A disposal unit discharging to surface water must meet Clean Water Act effluent guidelines and operate under a NPDES permit. States authorized by the EPA to administer the NPDES program must regulate discharges to surface waters according to federal standards. State water quality agencies may assess facilities individually for groundwater protection measures. The Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining administers provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which specifies requirements for mine reclamation. Coal combustion waste can be used in the reclamation process to abate acid mine drainage, improve disturbed mine lands, and reduce the need for landfills and impoundments. Groundwater protection measures such as liners and monitoring may be required for facilities not discharging wastewater to surface or groundwater. The use of coal combustion waste (CCW) in mine reclamation is not explicitly regulated at the federal level, but some states consider it a beneficial use exempt from regulation. In 2000, EPA determined that regulations may be necessary for using CCW in mine filling due to potential risks. Congress requested a study in 2003 on the health, safety, and environmental risks of placing CCW in active and abandoned coal mines. The National Research Council (NRC) established the Committee on Mine Placement of Coal Combustion Wastes in response to concerns about placing CCW in coal mines. The NRC committee found that it can be a viable option if properly planned to avoid adverse environmental and health impacts. They emphasized the need for waste and site characterization, engineering design, and monitoring to reduce contamination risks. The NRC committee recommended enforceable federal standards for placing coal combustion wastes in mines to prevent contamination risks to groundwater and surface waters. Although SMCRA does not specifically regulate CCW placement, its broad scope could encompass such regulation during reclamation activities. Some states have expressed concerns about the lack of explicit rules for regulating CCW use in coal mines. The committee recommended enforceable federal standards for disposal of coal combustion wastes in mines to prevent contamination risks. Approximately 37% of coal combustion wastes were used in various products like concrete, cement, and roofing materials. EPA considered alternatives to disposal methods and their costs in regulatory determinations. The EPA analyzed the impact of coal combustion products on natural resources and found no environmental harm associated with their beneficial use. Encapsulated and unencapsulated applications are possible, with proper evaluation needed for groundwater protection in unencapsulated uses. EPA's Resource Conservation Challenge targets coal combustion waste as an industrial material for reuse. The EPA's Resource Conservation Challenge focuses on increasing the use of coal combustion waste (CCW) as a building and manufacturing material. The Coal Combustion Products Partnership program was formed to promote the beneficial use of CCW, but concerns have been raised about its safety, particularly in agricultural and structural applications. The Battlefield Golf Course in Chesapeake, Virginia used 1.5 million tons of dry fly ash to build over a shallow aquifer. Elevated levels of various contaminants were found in groundwater and private drinking water wells nearby. It is unclear if the fly ash has impacted residential wells, ongoing monitoring is in place. Concerns about the safety of beneficial uses of coal combustion waste (CCW) were raised, leading to an investigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General in 2009. The EPA opened an investigation into its partnership with the coal industry to market coal ash and combustion wastes in various products. The report recommended a new probe into EPA's promotion of coal ash before determining its safety. Regulation of coal combustion waste disposal is controlled by individual states, making it difficult to determine the total amount disposed of in the US. The total number of operational disposal units in the United States is difficult to determine, as well as the total number of unlined units that may have been closed without proper monitoring. As power plant emission standards become stricter, the amount of waste generated and toxins in them are expected to increase. Regulations for new landfills raise questions about minimizing risks posed by existing facilities. After the Kingston release, congressional interest in the risks posed by existing facilities increased significantly. The Coal Ash Reclamation, Environment, and Safety Act of 2009 (H.R. 493) was introduced to establish new standards for surface impoundments. Hearings were held to address potential water quality impacts and causes of the release. EPA announced new regulations for landfills and surface impoundments, leading to the cancellation of a scheduled markup. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on the impacts of coal combustion waste disposal. Congress is debating EPA's authority to regulate coal combustion waste as hazardous waste."
