    "title": "AB 1344",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 53094 of the Government Code is amended to exempt school districts from complying with county or city zoning ordinances unless the ordinance includes provisions for public school locations and the city or county has adopted a general plan. The governing board of a school district or county office of education may override city or county zoning ordinances for proposed use of property by a two-thirds vote, as long as it complies with specific requirements. This exemption does not apply to nonclassroom facilities like warehouses or administrative buildings. The governing board of a school district or county office of education can override city or county zoning ordinances for property use with a two-thirds vote. If challenged, the city or county can seek a court review to determine if the board's action was arbitrary and capricious. If found so, the zoning ordinance will apply to the property use. Section 53097.3 of the Government Code is repealed and replaced with a new provision stating that a school district or county office of education cannot exempt a charter school facility from city or county ordinances unless the facility is within their jurisdiction. Charter schools can request exemption from zoning ordinances only if the facility is within the school district or county office of education's geographic jurisdiction. The school district can make the zoning ordinance inapplicable to a property for school use under Section 53094. A charter school facility must still comply with the California Building Standards Code. The school district may request information from the charter school, such as the facility's address and proof of control over the property. The school district can render a city or county ordinance inapplicable to a charter school facility within its jurisdiction by following certain procedures, including placing a request on the governing board's agenda for approval. A fee of up to $500 may be charged for processing the written request. The governing board of a school district or county office of education must approve a request for notice of zoning inapplicability for a charter school unless specific written findings are made that it would endanger student health and safety. If a school district fails to provide the notice within 60 days, the charter school can request it from the county office of education. The charter school can request notice of zoning inapplicability from the county office of education if not provided by the school district within 60 days. The State Board of Education will address the appeal within 120 days and notify the city or county of the ordinance's inapplicability to the charter school. A charter school can request zoning ordinance inapplicability from the county office of education if not provided by the school district. The charter school making the request is not required to provide warranties, indemnification, bonds, or insurance for the facility. Reimbursement for any state-mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts."
