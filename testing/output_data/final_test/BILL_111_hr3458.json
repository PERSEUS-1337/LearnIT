The Congress recognizes the importance of the Internet as essential infrastructure for economic, social, and political activities, promoting economic growth, investment, job creation, and technological innovation. Unfettered access to the Internet is crucial for offering, accessing, and utilizing content, services, and applications, contributing to the United States' global leadership in high technology. The Internet was enabled by historic policies promoting competition and openness, allowing all users to access telecommunications networks. However, legal and marketplace changes have eroded these policies, giving network operators control over who can offer content and services. This threatens the ability of Internet providers to reach consumers, potentially harming the national economy. The Internet's openness is threatened by network operators who control content access, hindering providers from reaching consumers. A network neutrality policy is crucial to ensure fair access for all users and protect the economy. A network neutrality policy is essential to provide certainty to businesses, investors, and others who rely on the Internet for commercial reasons. It can also allow Internet service providers to protect network reliability and prevent illegal uses, consistent with the principle of non-discrimination. This policy is crucial for the economic growth of the United States and to preserve the right to free speech under the First Amendment. The United States should adopt a clear policy to preserve the open nature of Internet communications and networks. SEC. 3. INTERNET FREEDOM.

They will also promote both facilities-based and nonfacilities-based competition for information service providers to have marketplace choices for transmission capacity. Private transmission capacity services must not undermine the purposes of the Act or diminish the level of Internet access service offered to the public. Additionally, these services should not be offered in an anticompetitive, unreasonable, discriminatory, or deceptive manner. The Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 requires the Commission to establish rules for filing complaints, enforcement procedures, network management practices, and disclosure obligations for Internet access services. The Commission enforces compliance with transmission capacity services under title V, with provisions for forfeiture liability and special orders for damages in case of violations. Definitions for Internet access service and Internet access service provider are provided in this section. The Act does not affect laws addressing illegal activities, such as theft of content.

It includes definitions for provider, user, and reasonable network management as determined by the Commission."
