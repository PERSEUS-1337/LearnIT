    "content": "Current interest in PPPs arises as agencies dispose of real property they no longer need. Agencies must follow prescribed processes that can be cumbersome and costly. PPPs allow agencies to rely on nonfederal entities for financing and maintenance of properties. Federal agencies acquire real property assets to fulfill specific functions and missions. For example, the Department of Energy owns laboratories to support its mission. The government owns over 306,000 buildings, including laboratories and hospitals, to support various missions. Agencies may restructure their real property portfolios over time, closing bases or consolidating holdings for operational benefits. The Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Public Debt are consolidating personnel and relocating employees to new headquarters to improve communication, coordination, and reduce costs. This restructuring of real property holdings allows agencies to realize operational benefits and savings. The government faces challenges with excess and underutilized properties, leading to high maintenance costs. A report in FY2010 showed 71,000 underutilized and 6,700 excess buildings costing $1.66 billion to maintain. The number of such buildings fluctuates, with a net increase of 2,017 from FY2008 to FY2009. The government has 45,190 underutilized and 10,327 excess buildings, with a net increase of 2,017 unneeded properties by the end of FY2009. The high maintenance costs of these properties have been a concern since 2003, as the disposal process is cumbersome and costly. Agencies must first offer excess properties to other federal agencies at market value before offering them to state and local governments or qualified nonprofits for public purposes. The McKinney-Vento Act (P.L. 100-77) mandates that surplus properties be screened for use by organizations assisting the homeless, adding up to two years to the disposal process. This slows down the disposition process for agencies, leading to increased operating costs for months or even years. The disposal process for surplus properties can be delayed by up to two years due to screening for use by organizations assisting the homeless, as mandated by the McKinney-Vento Act. Additional time may be added by environmental remediation and historic preservation requirements, leading to increased operating costs for agencies. Efforts to dispose of unneeded real property can be complicated by competing agendas of stakeholders, including local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and political factors. Committees in the 113th Congress held hearings on federal real property management and introduced bills to reform the disposal process, with a specific interest in expanding the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). PPPs offer federal agencies benefits like reduced operating costs, modernized space, and increased revenue by enabling them to finance repairs and renovations they cannot afford. However, risks and limitations exist due to legal uncertainties and requirements. The federal government provides underutilized or excess real property, such as buildings and land, while the nonfederal partner provides capital for improvements. These properties are often in poor condition due to age, with many dating back to the 1940s and 1950s, or even earlier like buildings from the Civil War era. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) building, constructed in 1855, is underutilized and in poor condition. Agencies struggle to meet real property needs due to insufficient funds. Investing in new space is prioritized over costly repairs for aging buildings. This results in the government holding thousands of properties it cannot maintain or dispose of. The government struggles to maintain underutilized and vacant properties, which are often in poor condition and costly to operate. Nonfederal partners may see an opportunity to invest in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to generate profit from these properties, especially if they are in desirable locations with high rental rates. Nonfederal partners can invest in Public-Private Partnerships to profit from underutilized federal properties in desirable locations. They may renovate or construct spaces to meet market demands, such as building a new medical facility or installing energy-efficient systems, recouping costs through subleasing or savings in operating expenses. Nonfederal partners can renovate underutilized federal properties to make them more profitable, such as upgrading electrical systems to attract new tenants. This allows partners to monetize assets that the government cannot, sharing revenue with the agency. Despite potential benefits, Public-Private Partnerships have risks and limitations that are often overlooked. The report discusses the risks and limitations of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) at the federal level, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding legal requirements and the limited use of PPPs for real property management by federal agencies. PPPs can be structured in various ways depending on legal authorities, but there are potential risks to consider. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) formed by federal agencies generally have key elements and common structures. The process starts with identifying property for redevelopment, working with a nonfederal partner to assess benefits and risks, and entering into a master ground lease agreement. The partners in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) typically enter into a master ground lease agreement to establish the partnership terms, including the lease length, redevelopment strategy, and financing method. The master ground lease is usually a long-term lease of 50 years or more, preferred by nonfederal partners for investment recoupment and profit generation. Nonfederal partners aim for a 15% return on investment, and may seek a lease exceeding 50 years to mitigate risks in weak markets or high improvement costs. The redevelopment strategy and financing method are closely connected in a PPP structure. The redevelopment strategy and financing in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) are closely linked. Nonfederal partners agree to renovate VA medical centers and lease office space on unused land to generate revenue. Financial benefits may include sharing property cash flows through subleasing renovated space at a higher rate. The nonfederal partner receives rental payments referred to as operating income from subleasing renovated space at a higher rate. To make a profit, the sublease must generate enough income to cover lease costs, operating costs, and debt payments. The remaining revenue, known as net cash flow, is divided between the nonfederal partner and the agency. The government receives revenue from lease payments and net cash flow. The government's revenue from lease payments and net cash flows in PPP agreements is specified, with various structures identified. For example, a federal agency may lease underutilized land to a developer for new construction, with the developer subleasing the property. Another scenario involves a federal agency owning a historic building in disrepair, which is expected to attract public and private entities. The property in a desirable location is leased by a developer who renovates it according to historic preservation requirements. Retailers sublease the first floor, while the city government subleases office space above. The developer demolishes the existing building and constructs a larger, modern office building, partially occupied by a federal agency and backfilled by businesses. A garage is built to replace the parking lot, providing space for tenants and public parking. A federal agency also owns family housing units in need of repair, aiming to retain all units due to space shortage. The federal agency owns family housing units in need of repair and wishes to retain them all due to a space shortage. A developer repairs the existing units and adds new ones on underutilized land owned by the agency. Additionally, a business installs energy-efficient equipment in exchange for repayment and a share of energy savings. Another example involves a federal agency adding an annex to a multi-use facility in exchange for excess property. Agencies benefit from lease payments, reduced utility costs, and maintenance backlogs, as well as potential \"in-kind\" benefits. In addition to lease payments, reduced utility costs, and maintenance backlogs, agencies may also receive \"in-kind\" benefits when selling or leasing real property. In-kind consideration can include goods and services provided to the agency, its personnel, or clients, as authorized by statute. Examples include a local government building transitional housing on agency-owned land and a developer leasing renovated office space to a federal agency. A federal agency leases office space to a developer who renovates the building and subleases it back. Agency personnel can use the child care center at reduced rates. Another agency leases space and allows the lessee to offset rent by building a water tower. Federal law lacks specific guidance on PPPs for real property. Federal agencies rely on their authority to take specific actions necessary to form and perform public-private partnerships (PPPs) for real property. The nature of PPPs entered by agencies can vary due to differing authority levels. Federal law does not define PPPs or authorize agencies to enter them, leading to uncertainty regarding legal requirements. The federal government does not define or authorize agencies to enter public-private partnerships (PPPs) for real property. Agencies that have entered agreements resembling PPPs have done so under their authority to lease or convey federal real property and enter procurement contracts. Leases of real property are not considered procurement contracts under federal law. Leases of federal real property are excluded from procurement contracts as they do not involve a \"seller\" providing supplies or services to the government. Federal agencies historically use their authority to lease or convey real property when entering public-private partnerships (PPPs). Despite GSA being known as the federal government's \"landlord,\" many agencies have the authority to lease or dispose of federal real property without GSA's involvement. Congress has enacted statutes allowing specific agencies to lease real property independently for PPPs. Some agencies have the authority to lease federal real property independently for specific purposes without GSA's involvement. This authority allows agencies like DOD to lease nonexcess real property for maintenance, repair, or environmental restoration in exchange for long-term use. Various statutes grant agencies similar authority to enter into long-term leases or convey federal property for cash or in-kind consideration. Section 111 of the National Historical Preservation Act authorizes federal agencies to lease or exchange historic properties to ensure preservation. Some agencies have authority to exchange or give away real property, permit nonfederal entities to use their property, or allow construction of international bridges by nonfederal entities. Nonfederal entities can construct and operate international bridges, providing facilities or services to federal agencies for free as a permit condition. Long-term procurement contracts under federal law, like Section 801 of NECPA, allow contractors to finance performance and share in savings from agency energy conservation efforts. Section 801 of NECPA allows long-term contracts for energy savings performance, lasting up to 25 years. Contractors cover costs for energy-saving measures and receive a share of resulting savings. This enables third parties to finance modifications to federal buildings in exchange for a portion of operational cost savings. The authority to enter into \"share-in-savings\" contracts for information technology, which allowed contractors to share in savings from solutions improving agency processes, expired in 2005. Federal agencies often rely on leasing authorities for public-private partnerships, raising questions about legal requirements such as competitive selection of partners and payment of prevailing wages. Some statutes impose specific requirements on agencies' use of leases. Some federal statutes and agency regulations impose requirements on the use of leasing authorities for public-private partnerships. While the FAR does not apply to leases of real property, some agencies have adopted regulations similar to the FAR for their acquisition of leasehold interests. Federal law may not provide guidance on certain questions related to PPPs, such as project selection or specific terms. This section discusses legal requirements for PPPs, including statutes authorizing leases and agency regulations similar to the FAR. It also addresses situations where federal law is silent on issues like project selection and non-compete agreements. The text discusses legal requirements for PPPs, including statutes authorizing leases and agency regulations. It highlights the reliance of agencies on specific statutes for entering and performing PPPs, such as Section 111 of the NHPA for leasing historic property and Section 801 of the NECPA for long-term contracts for energy savings. The NECPA authorizes energy savings for federal buildings through specified actions. Agency-specific statutes regulate aspects of PPPs, such as agreement duration and consideration received. The NECPA authorizes energy savings for federal buildings through specified actions, while the FAR provides detailed guidance on federal contracting, including requirements and standard terms for contracts. The FAR provides detailed guidance on federal contracting, covering various topics such as planning acquisitions, market research, contract payments, and compliance with \"Buy American\" requirements. It also sets limits on noncompetitive contract awards and includes specific contract terms for termination. The FAR governs federal contracting for supplies and services, excluding real property interests. However, in certain cases, agencies may impose FAR requirements on themselves through regulations or contracts, such as GSA's regulations on leasehold interests. The FAR governs federal contracting for supplies and services, but agencies like GSA must also comply with FAR regulations for leasehold interests, ensuring full and open competition through competitive procedures. While GSA's regulations align with the FAR in some aspects, other agencies may have different rules for acquiring leasehold interests in real property. Other statutes may impose requirements on agencies' partnership activities beyond those authorizing the federal agency's actions in the PPP. The structure of PPP projects can determine the applicability of such requirements, such as leases of real property potentially being subject to statutory contract requirements. The GAO's 2012 decision in The Argos Group highlighted that leases are considered contracts under the Anti-Deficiency Act and the CDA, requiring GSA to provide \"price evaluation preferences.\" The GAO decision requires GSA to provide \"price evaluation preferences\" to HUBZone small businesses in lease procurements, expanding the application of the Small Business Act to all federal contracts involving full and open competition. This could also impact public-private partnerships subject to statutory requirements related to \"public buildings\" and \"public works.\" The recent litigation regarding the CityCenterDC project involves the determination of whether it is considered a public work subject to the Davis-Bacon Act's requirements on prevailing wages and fringe benefits. The U.S. Department of Labor has appealed a decision stating that CityCenterDC is not a public work, while the project developer and the District of Columbia argue otherwise. The CityCenterDC project, located on land conveyed by the city to the developer, is disputed as a public work subject to the Davis-Bacon Act. The developer argues it is not public, citing no public funds used, no city occupancy, and similar benefits to private developments. However, the Department of Labor disagrees, stating the city's authority over the project makes it subject to the Act. The CityCenterDC project, disputed as a public work subject to the Davis-Bacon Act, involves the District having authority over construction and maintenance during the lease terms. The Department of Labor sees economic gains to the District and potential public entanglement in the partnership structure. The 2007 federal district court decision found that housing units and infrastructure on Marine Corps land, developed by a private developer under a 50-year ground lease, are not subject to local taxation due to the level of control retained by the United States. The court decision stated that housing units on Marine Corps land developed by a private developer are not subject to local taxation due to the level of control retained by the United States. The outcome could have been different if the land was sectioned off from the military installation for non-military uses. Appropriations law constrains agencies in determining which projects to pursue in public-private partnerships. Appropriations law constrains agencies in determining projects for public-private partnerships. Some states require agencies to consider PPPs within their broader priorities and prohibit special consideration based on private financing. Federal law lacks comparable provisions. Noncompete agreements in public-private partnerships (PPPs) are not common in federal procurement contracts or real property leases. However, some commentators suggest including them in PPPs where a developer builds and operates a facility to ensure revenue generation for construction costs repayment. Developers may seek agreements where the agency promises not to develop or operate competing facilities. In federal procurement contracts or real property leases, noncompete agreements are not common. However, some suggest including them in public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure revenue generation for construction costs repayment. Federal agencies are left to determine whether to undertake PPPs or consent to non-compete agreements, drafting contractual terms without standard clauses. This variability in agency willingness and partnership terms could limit commitment to PPPs and public acceptance. The legal requirements for public-private partnerships (PPPs) vary between federal and state laws. While federal law lacks guidance, at least 29 states have statutes defining PPPs and providing comprehensive guidance on their use. This includes addressing agency powers, feasibility studies, partner selection procedures, offeror protections, and other aspects of PPP agreements. The federal law lacks guidance on public-private partnerships (PPPs), while at least 29 states have statutes defining PPPs and providing comprehensive guidance. Congress may need to focus on topics such as agencies' capabilities, legal uncertainties, and the need for business plans in expanding federal agencies' ability to enter PPPs. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive information on various PPP authorities of different landholding agencies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued reports on specific real property authorities that may allow agencies to enter PPPs, but a comprehensive analysis of all agencies' PPP authorities is lacking. GAO has not conducted a comprehensive analysis of all agencies' PPP authorities and practices, making it difficult to compare and evaluate their effectiveness in reducing excess and underutilized space. Feedback from real property managers on existing PPP authorities could provide valuable insights. The lack of detailed legal requirements can benefit PPPs by allowing flexibility in creating agreements tailored to meet specific needs, but it may also lead to uncertainty about applicable requirements for projects. The lack of detailed legal requirements for PPPs can create uncertainty and limit willingness to commit to projects, affecting public acceptance. Government agencies and partners may be hesitant to enter agreements due to uncertainties about their rights and responsibilities. Public skepticism may arise if PPPs are perceived as not meeting expectations of competitive and impartial selection processes. Unsolicited proposals and political connections could undermine public trust in PPPs. PPP agreements require expertise in various disciplines such as real property, architecture, civil engineering, procurement, and law. Lack of agency expertise can lead to costly mistakes and agreements that do not provide the best value for the government. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) emphasizes the importance of agency expertise in successful PPP implementation. Inadequately trained staff entering into real property contracts can have significant monetary consequences, as seen in the case of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010. In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a $556 million lease for 900,000 square feet of office space in Washington, DC, which was 600,000 square feet more than needed. The lack of a solid real property organization within the agency led to this costly mistake. Congress should evaluate agency structures before granting PPP authority to ensure expertise. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has successfully used business plans in PPP management for years. The USPS has utilized business plans in PPP management for years, emphasizing the importance of jointly drafting plans with private partners. Developing business plans prior to entering a PPP can facilitate ongoing discussions, sharing of market information, and improve decision-making during negotiations. Business plans serve as a roadmap for the PPP agreement. The agreement being negotiated may benefit from business plans as a roadmap for PPP implementation, aiding partners in meeting milestones and potentially facilitating oversight if shared with Congress. Congress oversees GSA's real property decisions through the prospectus approval process, requiring resolutions from specific committees before appropriations can be made for certain property management purposes. GSA must submit a prospectus of the proposed facility to Congress for approval. The GSA must submit a prospectus of the proposed facility to Congress for approval, as required by the Public Buildings Act of 1959. Compliance with these requirements is historically followed by GSA, and similar provisions could lead to agency compliance in other contexts. Requiring agencies to seek authorization before entering into PPPs could allow Congress to monitor agency activity and evaluate proposed partnerships. Federal agencies may benefit from leasing federal space to nonfederal partners, generating revenue and positive net cash flow. If Congress expands PPP authorities, the issue of agencies retaining net proceeds may arise. While agencies argue that this incentive promotes the use of PPPs, some stakeholders are concerned about potential lack of congressional oversight. Congress has various options to address these concerns in PPP legislation. Congress has options to address concerns about agencies retaining net proceeds from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). Options include depositing net proceeds in the Treasury, a designated fund for agency real property activity, or allowing agencies to use proceeds without congressional approval. Each option has implications for congressional control and agency incentives. The disposal process for excess properties is regulated by statute, with agencies required to follow specific steps unless they have statutory authority to bypass them. Congress may consider evaluating underutilized properties for PPPs before declaring them excess, establishing a screening process for unneeded space. PPP legislation may allow agencies to bypass statutory disposal requirements, increasing interest from nonfederal entities in PPP options. Screening properties for PPP suitability and offering them for redevelopment may take as long as the standard disposal process. Data on the time and financial benefits of finalizing a PPP is lacking. The absence of data on the time it takes to finalize a PPP and the financial benefits to the government makes it unclear if giving agencies special authorities for PPPs would yield greater returns than the existing process. Congressional interest in PPPs for federal real property management is likely to persist, but the legal framework governing federal agencies' use of PPPs is less clear. Federal agencies historically rely on leasing, conveying, or permitting federal real property for PPPs due to varying authority levels. There is uncertainty in legal requirements for PPPs. Congress should consider agencies' capabilities, business plans for PPPs, and the relationship between PPPs and real property disposal processes."
