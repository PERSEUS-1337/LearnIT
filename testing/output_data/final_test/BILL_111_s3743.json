The term 'regional transportation planning organization' is defined as the policy board of an organization established under section 135(k) of title 23, United States Code. Additionally, there are new requirements for cooperation with nonmetropolitan local officials through these organizations. In regional transportation planning, organizations must consider concerns and coordinate transportation improvement programs. Nonmetropolitan areas must cooperate with local officials for the statewide transportation plan. In regional transportation planning, organizations must consider and coordinate transportation improvement programs with nonmetropolitan local officials responsible for transportation. The statewide transportation improvement program must be developed in cooperation with affected nonmetropolitan areas. To enhance transportation planning, States must establish and fund regional transportation planning organizations through available resources. This includes coordinating with nonmetropolitan local officials for transportation improvement programs. Funding for this purpose is amended to include sections 104(f) and 505. Each regional transportation planning organization is established to enhance statewide transportation plans and programs, focusing on nonmetropolitan areas. It is a multi-jurisdictional organization of local officials and representatives of local transportation systems. The organization is formed through a memorandum of understanding between the State and nonmetropolitan local officials. Each regional transportation planning organization in nonmetropolitan areas must establish a policy committee with majority nonmetropolitan local officials and a fiscal and administrative agent for professional planning. The regional transportation planning organization is responsible for ensuring nonmetropolitan local officials' involvement in statewide transportation planning, developing regional long-range transportation plans, creating a regional transportation improvement program, coordinating local planning with transportation plans, and providing technical assistance to local officials. The regional transportation planning organization is responsible for providing technical assistance to local officials, participating in policy and planning development processes at national, multi-State, and State levels, facilitating public participation in transportation planning, sharing plans with neighboring organizations, and conducting other necessary duties to support the statewide planning process."
