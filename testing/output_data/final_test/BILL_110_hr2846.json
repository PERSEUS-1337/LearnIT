The Act defines \"performance-based assessment\" as evaluating knowledge application to real-world tasks to measure higher order thinking and performance skills, including problem-solving, information analysis, knowledge application, idea development, and proficient communication. Multiple measures refer to various evidence sources of student learning. Performance-based assessment evaluates knowledge application to real-world tasks to measure higher order thinking and performance skills. Multiple measures refer to various evidence sources of student learning across subject areas, providing opportunities for students to demonstrate achievement using different methods. The purpose of performance-based assessment is to evaluate knowledge application to real-world tasks and measure higher order thinking and performance skills. Multiple measures provide various evidence sources of student learning across subject areas, allowing students to demonstrate achievement using different methods. The Act aims to empower States to develop assessment systems aligned with student learning standards, providing multiple measures of student learning, including performance assessments that assess higher order thinking and skills. It also includes local assessments for timely diagnostic information, consistent with professional standards for test construction and use, employing universal design principles and accommodations for special populations and English language learners. The Act empowers States to develop assessment systems aligned with student learning standards, including performance assessments for higher order thinking skills. Local assessments should meet validity and reliability requirements, be fair and unbiased, provide multiple sources of evidence, and demonstrate student progress. The Act allows States to create assessment systems aligned with standards, including performance assessments for higher-order thinking skills.

GRANTS FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS. The Secretary shall award grants to State educational agencies under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve the quality of academic assessments and enhance State accountability systems. This includes collaborating with higher education institutions and developing local education agencies' capacity for valid and reliable student assessments. The grants awarded to State educational agencies aim to improve academic assessments by using multiple sources of evidence, including performance assessments. Each grant is a minimum of $5,000,000 per year and lasts up to 5 years. States must allocate at least 5% of the grant for technical assistance from universities or non-profit research organizations with expertise in performance assessments. The grants aim to enhance academic assessments by incorporating performance assessments. Universities and non-profit research organizations with expertise in performance assessments will assist in developing tools for State assessment systems, training educators to score assessments, and ensuring scoring reliability. The State can make subgrants to local educational agencies or schools to develop and implement local performance assessments, train teachers and school leaders to score and use assessments, and support the development of formative assessments for detailed feedback to improve learning and teaching. The State can retain a portion of grant amounts to develop integrated State assessment systems, collaborate with other States, provide assistance to local educational agencies, and evaluate local assessments. States that have already begun developing such systems are eligible. Any State receiving funds under this section must ensure high-quality professional development for educators to develop and score assessments aligned with learning standards. They must also ensure assessments are unbiased, valid, and reliably scored, with mechanisms for training scorers and expert review. Additionally, they should integrate local performance assessments. The State accountability system must integrate local performance assessment results with State benchmark examinations to evaluate schools and student progress. Authorization of appropriations includes $200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012."
