    "content": "Innovations in elections were introduced to reduce fraud, such as tampering with ballots. In the nineteenth century, voters would pick up preprinted ballots for a party, leading to potential fraud. The Australian Secret Ballot was developed to address these issues. The Australian Secret Ballot was introduced in the 1880s to prevent vote-buying and fraud in elections. This ballot system lists all candidates, with voters marking their choice in privacy. Each ballot has a unique serial number for control, reducing the risk of tampering. While it improved security, tampering was still possible but more difficult than with previous ballot systems. The lever voting machine, introduced in 1892, eliminated document ballots and reduced the possibility of tampering. Voters choose candidates by moving levers, preventing them from selecting more candidates than allowed. The machine records votes mechanically, eliminating the need for manual ballot counting. Computer-Assisted Counting (Punchcard and Optical Scan) revolutionized voting by using computers to count votes through punchcard and optical-scan systems. This eliminated the need for manual counting and allowed for electronic tallying of votes at precincts or central locations. Tampering is still possible with these systems, such as adjusting mechanisms to manipulate vote counts. Electronic Voting Machine. DREs (direct recording electronic systems) are the first completely computerized voting systems, introduced in the 1970s. Voters choose candidates from a posted ballot displayed on a computer screen and make their choices by pushing buttons or touching the screen. This system creates possibilities for tampering with the counting software and hardware. DREs allow voters to make choices electronically by pushing buttons, touching the screen, or using other devices. The design of DREs can be classified into three basic types, including mimicking a lever machine, displaying a ballot page on a computer screen with mechanical devices for selection, and using a touchscreen display for making choices by touching names. Touchscreen and other DREs are versatile and user-friendly voting systems that allow voters to make choices electronically by touching the candidate's name on a computer screen. Votes are directly stored in a computer memory device. DREs can display ballots in different languages, offices, and allow for review before casting the vote. They are accessible for persons with disabilities, including visual impairment. The popularity of touchscreen DREs has increased in recent years, especially with the provisions of HAVA. HAVA authorized funding for replacing outdated voting machines and improving election administration. This funding is expected to substantially increase the use of DREs in the future. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires voting systems to notify voters of overvotes, provide accessible voting machines for persons with disabilities, and ensure error prevention and correction. However, security concerns exist with Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines as they do not provide an independent record of each ballot for recount verification. The Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines lack an independent record of each ballot for recount verification, raising security concerns. The ballot consists of electronic records in the machine's memory banks, similar to mechanical lever machines where counters move out of view of the voter. In case of discrepancies in recording results, neither the voter nor an observer would be aware, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in the voting system. Some computer experts express concerns about the security of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines, citing the potential for undetectable modifications to the software that could alter election results. Malicious code can be difficult to detect, especially in complex software like DRE systems. This raises doubts about the reliability of DRE machines compared to traditional lever machines with physical ballot records. The security of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines is a concern due to the difficulty in detecting unauthorized software modifications. Manufacturers keep their software code proprietary, making it hard for experts to assess vulnerability. The Voluntary Voting Systems Standards (VSS) developed in 1990 by the FEC aimed to address these concerns, with a focus on security for various voting systems. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 established a voluntary testing and certification program for voting systems through the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED). An independent test authority (ITA) tests voting systems for compliance with the Voluntary Voting Systems Standards (VSS), keeping software and documentation in escrow for verification. HAVA also created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to develop voluntary voting system standards and oversee the certification process. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to replace the FEC's Office of Election Administration. The EAC consists of three bodies: a Standards Board, a Board of Advisors, and a Technical Guidelines Development Committee. The EAC is responsible for testing, certification, and decertification of voting systems, with NIST involved in the process. Additionally, the EAC conducts studies on electronic voting issues and challenges. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002 established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee voting systems. HAVA requires voting systems to produce a permanent paper audit document for recounts. The Caltech/MIT Study identified security issues in voting systems after the 2000 election, leading to recommendations incorporated in HAVA. The Caltech/MIT study identified four main security strengths of the electoral process in the United States, including openness, decentralization, redundant trusted recordings, and public control. Concerns were raised about electronic voting trends weakening these strengths, but properly designed machines can enhance security. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) addressed some of these concerns by requiring paper audit trails for recounts. The California secretary of state established a task force to examine the security of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines and recommended changes in testing procedures and the implementation of a voter-verified audit trail for ensuring election security. The task force recommended \"parallel monitoring\" to test machines on election day for accurate vote recording. The Hopkins Study revealed serious security flaws in Diebold's voting system code, raising concerns about DRE vulnerabilities. The Hopkins Study found serious security flaws in Diebold's voting system code, which could allow tampering by various individuals. Diebold disputed the claims, stating they were based on misunderstandings and inadequate sampling. Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich suspended the contract with Diebold for an independent security analysis, which confirmed some criticisms but also identified serious security issues in the system. The Hopkins study identified serious security flaws in the Diebold voting system, leading to high-risk compromise. Maryland State Board of Elections is implementing recommendations for improvements. Ohio is also evaluating electronic voting devices for security. Ensuring election security is crucial for democracy. Some experts disagree on the security risks of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems. While tampering is possible with any computer system, opinions vary on the adequacy of current security measures. Understanding computer security concepts is essential to address threats, vulnerabilities, defense, and response in computer-assisted voting systems. Threats refer to potential attacks, and discussions on security practices are crucial for election security in a democracy. The report discusses possible attacks on voting systems, including threats, vulnerabilities, risk assessment, defense, response, and recovery. It mentions the types of attacks, such as tampering with vote totals, historically done by corrupt officials. Tampering with vote totals historically involved corrupt officials or partisans, aiming to influence the final vote tally by adding, dropping, or switching votes. Modern voting systems have features like secret balloting and observers to prevent such threats. The impact of vote tampering depends on the scale of the attack and the context. Tampering with election outcomes depends on the scale of the attack and the competitiveness of the contest. The impact of tampering is greater when it affects many machines or precincts, especially in closely contested elections. Various types of attacks, not just altering votes, need to be considered to safeguard the election process. Potential threats to voting systems include attacks that gather information to increase a candidate's chances of winning and disrupt voting through malware causing voting machines to malfunction. These attacks could adjust get-out-the-vote efforts or reduce turnout, impacting the integrity of the election. Such threats are of interest to those wanting to have a negative impact on the political system. The use of information technology in elections has led to new types of cyber threats, with attackers ranging from hackers to foreign governments. The number and sophistication of cyberattacks have increased significantly in recent years. Some attackers may aim to disrupt elections or undermine voter confidence in the electoral process. Malware in voting systems can be sophisticated and designed to operate subtly, such as changing votes in a random manner to avoid detection. It can also adapt its behavior based on the tally direction and be inserted at various stages of the process. Other potential attacks include electronic interception and theft of information during transport. The curr_chunk discusses threats to election security, including electronic interception, hardware modifications, and system control bypassing. It emphasizes the importance of vulnerabilities in the voting system, categorizing them as technical and social. Technical vulnerabilities include weaknesses in computer code, connection to other computers, and auditing transparency. The recent public debate on the security of DREs has focused on potential vulnerabilities in cryptography and software design. Cryptography is crucial for data integrity and security, but weaknesses were found in encryption usage in DREs. Software design complexity and structure can also impact vulnerability to malware. The complexity of software design impacts vulnerability to malware. More complex code is more vulnerable to attacks due to hidden malware and potential vulnerabilities. It is difficult to anticipate all weaknesses in complex software, making it challenging to analyze for security problems. DREs require relatively complex software for voter interface, ballot recording, and vote tallying. Optical-scan and punchcard readers can use simpler code. The software code used in optical-scan and punchcard readers can be simpler to reduce vulnerabilities. Well-designed code minimizes points of attack and weaknesses, with established procedures to enhance security. DRE code has been criticized for its design, but thorough public assessment is hindered by proprietary software. Commercial off-the-shelf software used in systems may also have vulnerabilities. The software in major systems has been evaluated and certified to meet security requirements. Connection to other computers can be a vulnerability, especially for Internet-connected systems. Internet voting in public elections is generally unattractive due to security concerns. It is safest for voting system computers to not be connected to the Internet or any other Internet-connected computers. An effective air gap must include security controls for removable media like floppy disks, CDs, and memory cards used to transport data. Election results are generally not transmitted via the Internet from precincts, but may be sent through a direct modem connection, which can still be vulnerable to attacks if encryption and verification are lacking. Telephone transmission systems are increasingly connected to the Internet, posing potential risks for election data security. Organizations with local area network connections may unknowingly have Internet connections, especially with wireless systems. Voter interaction with Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines, like the Diebold DRE, using smartcards could potentially be exploited for repeated voting or manipulation. Studies suggest vulnerabilities, but controls and auditing transparency aim to minimize exploitation risks in current DRE systems. Auditing transparency in current DREs is lacking, as actions between ballot screen and final vote tally are not observable. Voters cannot verify if their choices are accurately recorded, and observers cannot ensure all ballots are counted correctly. DREs do not provide an independent record of each ballot cast, posing social vulnerabilities. The Maryland study identified social vulnerabilities in computer systems, including weaknesses in policy, procedures, and personnel. A security policy is crucial for system implementation, and the absence or weakness of one can be a significant vulnerability. The Diebold system in Maryland did not comply with the state's information security policy. The Diebold system in Maryland did not comply with the state's information security policy and standards, highlighting vulnerabilities in access controls and procedures. Election administration involves various entities and volunteers, making security procedures crucial to prevent attacks on DREs at any stage of development and use. Manufacturers' controls, evaluators' analyses, and software chain of custody are key areas where vulnerabilities can occur. The Maryland study raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the technology, chain of custody for software updates, and auditing controls. The importance of skilled and trained personnel in implementing security policies and procedures to defend against attacks was emphasized. Inadequately trained staff may be unable to prevent security breaches and could be vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Defending against attacks by malicious actors can be particularly challenging. The Maryland study highlighted vulnerabilities in technology and the importance of skilled personnel in implementing security measures. Defense against attacks on computer-based systems involves protection, detection, and reaction. Procedural mechanisms, such as access controls and certification procedures, are currently relied upon for protection. Procedural mechanisms like access controls and certification procedures are essential for protection against attacks on computer-based systems. Detection involves identifying attempted attacks, with election observers serving as potential detectors. Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in DRE systems, making it difficult for observers to detect suspicious activity within the machines. One approach to addressing the lack of transparency in DRE systems is through auditing, which involves creating logs of actions and audit trails for votes. Cryptographic protocols can also help detect tampering attempts. Reacting to detected attacks promptly is crucial to prevent their success or minimize their impact. If suspicious activity is observed during voting or tallying, the process can be halted for investigation. The voting machine can be programmed to shut down in case of problems, with additional defense measures like antivirus software. Early detection of attacks is crucial for effective reaction. Defense should focus on personnel, technology, and operations, including security commitment, role assignments, access control, and training. The technology component of computer security focuses on hardware and software development, acquisition, and implementation. The operations component emphasizes policies, procedures, certification, access controls, and assessments. Imbalance among these elements can create vulnerabilities. Critics of computer-assisted voting argue that procedural safeguards are overemphasized, leading to concerns about legacy technology, weak defenses, and lack of security training for election personnel. Techniques have been developed to prioritize security in applications. Techniques have been developed to engineer systems with the appropriate level of security for specific needs. Experts suggest applying this approach to voting systems. Effective defense should operate at all relevant points in the enterprise, including development, certification, acquisition, implementation, and use during elections. Defenses used by vendors are proprietary and not disclosed. Effective defense in voting systems should be robust and operate at all relevant points in the enterprise. A layered defense approach is recommended, with multiple defense mechanisms in place to protect against attackers. This includes physical security, procedural controls, and auditing to ensure security needs are met even in the event of an attack. Georgiadoes additional validation testing on software installed on machines in a local election jurisdiction to ensure it matches certified software. Balancing protection capability and cost, performance, and operational considerations is crucial in defense strategies. Trade-offs involve resource allocation decisions in addressing threats with varying probabilities and impacts. In homeland security and election administration, trade-offs must be made between protection, safety of countermeasures, and disruption to daily life. Setting priorities for defense investment is complex, as decisions on security measures must consider the probability and impact of potential threats. For example, with DREs, the risk of tampering may be low, but the consequences of a successful attack could be severe. The impact of a successful attack with DREs could be high, but they reduce certain tampering risks with paper ballots. DREs have desirable features that can prevent lost votes due to errors. Security measures should not make voting more difficult or discourage participation. Voting machines are just one part of the election system, and security must be integrated throughout. The election administration system must have integral security measures to be effective. Defenders should assume attacks will happen and have mechanisms for minimizing and recovering from damage. This includes protecting against various sources of damage like power outages or machine malfunctions. For example, DREs store vote data in redundant memory locations to prevent data loss. HAVA requires voters to be notified of overvotes before casting a ballot and given the chance to correct errors. DREs simplify recounts and reduce the complexity of identifying valid votes in case of auditing issues. Recovery from certain problems may involve recounts to ensure the accuracy of the original count. DREs simplify recounts by basing them on machine vote tallies rather than individual ballots, reducing chances for error. However, concerns exist among computer scientists about the security of current DREs and other computer-assisted voting systems, which are crucial for democratic government. Election administrators and experts express more confidence in the systems, but security issues do not necessarily mean the systems have been compromised. The security concerns surrounding computer-assisted voting systems, such as DREs, need to be addressed promptly to maintain voter confidence in the integrity of elections and government legitimacy. The potential erosion of trust in these systems could be worsened by the increasing use of DREs and the market dominance of a few voting system companies. The diversity of voting systems in the US has been seen as an advantage for security reasons. However, as the use of DREs increases, there is a need for increased scrutiny on the companies that make and sell them. Experts and observers have proposed actions to address the security concerns surrounding DREs. Some argue existing security mechanisms are sufficient, while others criticize flaws in processes and procedures. Lack of proven tampering cases doesn't guarantee it hasn't been attempted. Some critics argue that security provisions in the VSS are insufficient and did not follow best practices recommended by standards-setting organizations. Critics also believe that the VSS place too many constraints on the development of new technology to address security concerns. Additionally, problems identified in studies occurred despite certification by NASED for the Diebold system. The Hopkins and Maryland studies revealed issues with the Diebold system despite NASED certification. HAVA mandates changes in voting system standards and certification processes, establishing a new committee to develop voluntary guidelines. The committee, chaired by the Director of NIST, includes representatives from ANSI, IEEE, and NASED. IEEE is already working on new voting system standards to inform the guideline development process. Standards are crucial for the development of guidelines for voting systems. The adoption of VSS led to improvements in computer-assisted voting systems. Security standards are essential as they define the attributes a system needs to be trustworthy and can help reduce design flaws. However, a challenge with security standards is the inability to anticipate all possible attacks. It is important to continually reevaluate security standards as new threats emerge. Adherence to standards does not guarantee a system's security. The federal government requires adherence to computer-security policies, standards, and practices for federal agencies, but not for voting systems controlled by state and local governments. Developing standards can be time-consuming, especially with the consensus approach. The VSS standards were initiated in the 1970s but approved in 1990. The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation took five years to develop. The development of voting system standards has faced delays and controversy, with uncertainty on whether new guidelines will be in place before HAVA requirements take effect in 2006. Issues remain regarding testing and certification of voting systems, including whether systems certified under the VSS should continue to be accepted. The current process for testing and certification of voting systems, initiated by NASED in 1994, is directed by HAVA to provide for \"testing, certification, decertification, and recertification of voting system hardware and software by accredited laboratories.\" Most states have adopted the VSS for certified systems, but if the EAC decertifies systems that do not meet new guidelines, states may replace them if funding is available. However, more stringent security standards may make testing and certification more time-consuming and expensive. Some critics question the effectiveness of the Common Criteria for testing and certifying voting systems, while others suggest applying them to improve security. Secure systems may be costly to produce, creating economic disincentives for investment. Current testing under specific lab conditions may not be sufficient, with experts proposing additional testing involving actual voters and retesting after field use. Despite potential new guidelines and certification procedures, some believe more security measures are necessary. Some observers believe that new voting system guidelines will take years to implement, leaving systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. Overreliance on security standards is criticized for not providing enough defense, and the lack of transparency in computerized voting systems raises concerns about public confidence. Certification and procedural controls are seen as insufficient to guarantee voting system security. The security of voting systems is a complex issue, with some experts suggesting the use of open source software for increased security. However, the use of proprietary software in Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) systems remains a concern. The code for voting system software in the United States is proprietary and closely held by vendors. While secrecy is argued to protect intellectual property and security, it has weaknesses such as limited scrutiny for vulnerabilities. This was demonstrated by the Hopkins study where Diebold code was inadvertently posted online. The authors analyzed code with vulnerabilities discovered on an open Internet server. A proposed solution suggests separating voter interface and vote-casting functions. Vote casting requires high security, while the voter interface allows for innovation and flexibility. The code for vote casting and counting can be simpler than that for the voter interface, improving security. Verifiability in elections involves voter verifiability and results verifiability. Universal verifiability is achieved when both are present. Roll-call voting offers robust universal verifiability. Universal verifiability in elections involves publicly recording votes and counting them in the presence of all voters. However, this sacrifices ballot secrecy and is only practical for small electorates. Hand-counted paper ballot systems can provide ballot secrecy but may only offer universal verifiability under limited circumstances. Lever machines and computer-assisted voting systems lack both voter and results verifiability. Document-based systems like optical scan and punchcards retain the capacity for surrogate results verifiability through manual recounts. Some observers believe that security problems with DREs cannot be resolved through security procedures, standards, and testing. They argue for using ballots that voters can independently verify as the official record for recounts. HAVA mandates a paper audit record for voting systems and the opportunity for voters to correct their ballots before the record is finalized. The curr_chunk discusses different methods for achieving voter verifiability, including the Voter-Verifiable Paper Ballot where a paper ballot is printed with the voter's choices listed for verification. Any discrepancies can be addressed by a pollworker, and the paper ballot is kept for recounts. Some observers suggest that recounts using paper ballots should be done by hand for transparency and voter confidence. This method allows for independent verification and auditing of elections, triggering full recounts if significant discrepancies arise. Critics argue that it complicates voting and requires extra steps. The use of printers in elections would increase costs and the risk of mechanical failure. Paper ballot systems may not meet accessibility requirements. The effectiveness of the electronic votemeter method is untested and its impact on security and voters is uncertain. Hand counting paper ballots could be time-consuming and error-prone compared to machine counting. A third way to provide voter verifiability with DREs is through a Modular Voting Architecture. After a voter makes choices on the touchscreen interface, the ballot is written to a memory card called a frog. The voter then takes this card to another machine for reading, ensuring a secure process. A secure reader with display and audio program allows voters to verify choices before casting the ballot. Encrypted votes provide electronic verification using cryptographic methods, offering privacy, transparency, auditability, and security superior to current approaches. The use of cryptographic methods in the election process allows voters to verify their choices before casting the ballot. Encrypted information corresponds to ballot choices, and a receipt is generated with encrypted information after the vote is cast. Voters can verify if their vote was counted by comparing the receipt to posted information. The encrypted receipt generated after casting a vote allows voters to verify their choices. Encryption keys from different election trustees are used to decrypt votes, ensuring authenticity. Any attempt to alter a ballot will be detected during an audit, similar to modifying an encrypted financial transaction. The system allows for auditing and authentication of the election process. The encrypted-vote system allows for auditing by observers during the election, ensuring transparency and integrity. Proponents claim that it eliminates the need to trust voting machines, reduces costs, and maintains ballot secrecy. It is more transparent than hand-counted paper ballots and resembles a roll-call vote while retaining secrecy. The encrypted-vote system allows for auditing during elections, ensuring transparency and integrity. Proponents claim it eliminates the need to trust voting machines, reduces costs, and maintains ballot secrecy. However, it has not been independently evaluated and may have unknown vulnerabilities. Voter confidence in the system may not be significantly improved compared to paper-based verification. Some proponents believe that teaching voting concepts in secondary school is feasible. Issues arise with printers at voting booths similar to those for voter-verifiable paper ballots. Verifiability adds complexity to the voting process with unclear outcomes in case of tampering or malfunctions. Critics question the effectiveness of encrypted receipts in showing a voter's choices. Proponents argue these concerns are manageable, but different proposed methods to address verifiability have varying strengths and weaknesses, making it challenging to determine the best approach. The evolving DRE technology presents challenges in determining the best approach for increasing verifiability and transparency in electronic voting. While a defense-in-depth security approach is desirable, potential problems must be considered when implementing it. Pressure to resolve security issues quickly may increase as jurisdictions continue to adopt DREs in response to HAVA and other factors. Some argue for incremental changes in election technology and procedures due to potential problems with implementing new systems. However, others believe that incremental changes may not be enough to prevent tampering that could impact election outcomes. Policymakers must consider these differing viewpoints when deciding on actions to take. Three general approaches are discussed for addressing the issues raised in the report: leaving action to state and local jurisdictions, having the EAC address the issues, or Congress taking action. States administer elections with federal government playing a limited role, and states may address issues individually. The availability of federal funding under HAVA and the creation of an independent federal agency aim to improve election administration at the state and local levels. Allowing states to take action could lead to a variety of tested approaches, but may also result in a patchwork of responses that could make some states more vulnerable to tampering. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) established by HAVA will provide guidance and conduct studies on election administration. The EAC, established by HAVA, will work with NIST and others on voting system security. One option is for the EAC to conduct independent security reviews of DREs with states. However, forming relevant boards and completing studies will take time, potentially delaying resolution of the controversy. Congress could take actions such as holding hearings, providing funding, and revising HAVA to address the controversy surrounding voting systems. They may also support research and development to find solutions for DRE security issues. The funding provided by HAVA for new voting systems may lead to improved security measures. Congress could consider adding a specific security provision to voting system requirements to address the controversy surrounding voting systems. The Act could potentially require voting systems to adhere to security requirements for federal computer systems, use open-source software, and undergo a security review and certification process. It may also mandate voter-verifiable paper ballots and include security experts on the Technical Guidelines Development Committee. Additionally, the EAC could offer security consultation services to state and local jurisdictions, and federal funding could be provided for upgrades or replacements of DREs purchased under HAVA. Federal funding could be provided for upgrades or replacements of DREs purchased under HAVA if they have significant security defects. Some options may be controversial, such as voter verifiability and use of open source software. Creating additional requirements would increase the federal role in election administration, which may face opposition from those advocating for state autonomy. Strengthening the EAC's ability to address controversies may be less controversial but could delay issue resolution. Delays in meeting HAVA requirements could be contentious, and additional funding authorization may be challenging in a constrained budget. The report discusses the controversy surrounding the security vulnerabilities of DREs and options for addressing them. While not resolving the controversy, it concludes that some current DREs do exhibit security vulnerabilities, posing potential risks to election integrity. No proven cases of tampering with DREs exist, but opinions vary on the significance of these risks. Funding authorization and appropriations for upgrades may be challenging in a constrained budget environment. The controversy surrounding the security vulnerabilities of DREs revolves around differing views on the effectiveness of current election administration procedures and security measures. Vendors and election administrators argue that existing measures are sufficient, while some experts, particularly computer scientists and activists, believe they are inadequate. Proponents of voter verifiability advocate for more transparency and openness in the election process to enhance security. Many election administrators and vendors believe that current trust in vendors, election officials, and involved parties is excessive. They argue that proponents of voter-verifiable paper ballots misunderstand how voting systems work and how elections are administered. Resolving these differences may require better understanding on both sides, with computer scientists learning about election processes and administrators gaining clearer insight into cybersecurity. Significant improvements in the security of DREs may be achieved through careful analysis of current systems without requiring voter verifiability. DREs have greater threats and vulnerabilities compared to punchcard or optical scan readers due to their complexity and lack of independent vote records. Other computer-assisted voting systems, like document-ballot readers, may also be vulnerable to malware and connection-related vulnerabilities. The security of systems using readers, including DREs, can benefit from similar security approaches. The report discusses seven proposals to address security issues with DREs, such as improving current procedures, enhancing development standards, using open-source software, and increasing transparency in elections. Several methods to improve the transparency and verifiability of elections include voter-verified paper ballots, modular electronic voting architecture, and cryptographic protocols for verifying ballots. These proposals vary in ease of implementation and level of contention. The public debate has focused on whether to rely on current procedures or adopt voter-verifiable paper ballots, but other options should be considered. Several policy approaches, including leaving the matter to state and local governments, utilizing the EAC's convening power, or implementing legislative solutions, were discussed to address the controversy surrounding election transparency and verifiability. Various legislative options exist, such as funding research or enhancing DRE security under HAVA, each with its own benefits and drawbacks depending on different factors. The controversy surrounding election transparency and verifiability can be addressed through various policy approaches, including legislative solutions. The benefits and disadvantages of these approaches depend on different factors, and a legislative solution may become more attractive if the controversy cannot be resolved through other means."
