    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Childhood Cancer Survivors' Quality of Life Act of 2013\". Congress acknowledges the significant impact of childhood cancer, with increasing survival rates but potential long-term effects on survivors. Over 360,000 individuals are survivors of childhood cancer, with up to two-thirds likely to experience late effects such as neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal issues, as well as secondary malignancies. Minority, low-income, and medically underserved children with cancer face disparities in care, leading to late-stage diagnosis, poor treatment outcomes, shorter survival, and higher likelihood of death. The late effects of cancer treatment may change over time, requiring modified monitoring and care for survivors. Despite the stress of childhood cancer, standardized psychosocial care for children and families is lacking. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the need for an organized system of care for pediatric cancer survivors. Research and pilot programs can improve health care, monitoring services, and survivorship care for childhood cancer patients, enhancing their quality of life. SEC. 417G. PILOT PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE MODEL SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER SURVIVORS. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities like medical schools, children's hospitals, cancer centers, or other experienced entities to establish pilot programs for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors. The funds must be used to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for survivor care, with special emphasis on certain aspects. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities to establish pilot programs for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors. Special emphasis will be given to designing protocols for follow-up care, developing multidisciplinary care models, disseminating information to healthcare providers, creating support programs for survivors, and designing systems for effective transfer of treatment information. The Secretary will provide grants for pilot programs to monitor and care for childhood cancer survivors, including designing follow-up care protocols, developing multidisciplinary care models, disseminating information to healthcare providers, creating support programs for survivors, and promoting coordination between cancer care providers, primary care physicians, and mental health professionals. Authorization of $15,000,000 for each fiscal year 2015 through 2019 is provided for these initiatives. The Secretary will provide grants for pilot programs to monitor and care for childhood cancer survivors, including designing follow-up care protocols, developing multidisciplinary care models, disseminating information to healthcare providers, creating support programs for survivors, and promoting coordination between cancer care providers, primary care physicians, and mental health professionals. Authorization of $15,000,000 for each fiscal year 2015 through 2019 is provided for these initiatives. Additionally, there is a workforce development collaborative on medical and psychosocial care for childhood cancer survivors. The Secretary will convene a Workforce Development Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors within a year of the Act's enactment. The Collaborative will consist of educators, advocates, and health service providers. Their goal is to develop a plan for workforce competencies and curricula related to pediatric cancer care. The Workforce Development Collaborative on Medical and Psychosocial Care for Pediatric Cancer Survivors aims to enhance workforce skills in teaching psychosocial health care, evaluate patient navigator and peer support programs, and recommend revisions to accreditation standards for psychosocial health care. The Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. Grants are provided to improve care for pediatric cancer survivors. Section 417E of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include research on causes of health disparities in pediatric cancer survivorship, focusing on needs and outcomes within minority or medically underserved populations. Grants are provided for this research. The Director of NIH shall make grants for research on health disparities in pediatric cancer survivorship outcomes within minority or medically underserved populations, focusing on barriers to follow-up care and the impact of familial, socioeconomic, and environmental factors on treatment outcomes and survivorship. The Director of NIH will conduct or support research on follow-up care for pediatric cancer survivors, focusing on indicators for long-term patient tracking, risk factors for late effects of treatment, and predictors of neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. The Director of NIH will conduct or support research on follow-up care for pediatric cancer survivors, focusing on indicators for long-term patient tracking, risk factors for late effects of treatment, and predictors of neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. Initiatives include protecting survivors from late treatment effects, transitions in care, training professionals for follow-up care, and different models of care. Updates include authorizing funds for subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) and changing the year from 2013 to 2019. Authorized $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2015-2019 for pediatric cancer survivor research. SEC. 317U. CLINICS FOR COMPREHENSIVE LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP SERVICES FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER SURVIVORS. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities like schools of medicine, children's hospitals, cancer centers, or other entities with expertise in treating pediatric cancer survivors for establishing and operating clinics for long-term follow-up services. The grants can only be used if the entity agrees to use the funds as specified. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible entities for establishing and operating clinics for long-term follow-up services for pediatric cancer survivors. The grant must be used for providing medical and psychosocial follow-up services, facility construction, and acquiring equipment. The Secretary will provide grants for clinics to support pediatric cancer survivors with medical and psychosocial care, facility construction, and equipment acquisition. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2015 to 2019."
