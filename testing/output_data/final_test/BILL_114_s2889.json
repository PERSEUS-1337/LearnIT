    "content": "The \"American Innovators and Entrepreneurs Act\" may be cited as the short title. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include the Innovation Corps. The National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps (I-Corps) was established to foster a national innovation ecosystem by encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to explore the commercial potential of Foundation-funded research. This includes investments in entrepreneurship education, training, and mentoring to deploy technologies that improve competitiveness, promote economic growth, and benefit society. The I-Corps program, funded by the National Science Foundation, aims to translate federally funded research into commercial success efficiently, creating new jobs and companies while providing a greater return on investment for taxpayers. The program's success model should be replicated across all Federal research agencies, with essential components including Nodes, Sites, Teams, and leadership control of curriculum. The I-Corps program success relies on both online and in-person access to its curriculum. Definitions include Nodes as centers for entrepreneurial education supporting national needs and serving as curriculum delivery locations, Sites supporting local and regional needs, and Teams receiving funding with at least one student. The I-Corps program aims to award grants for entrepreneurship and commercialization education to science and engineering researchers and students. It requires Teams to have a diverse composition including undergraduate students, professors, and individuals experienced in commercialization or business to act as mentors. The program also provides access to its curriculum through Nodes, Sites, and Teams. The I-Corps program aims to support entrepreneurship and commercialization education for science and engineering researchers and students. Grants awarded under this program increase the capacity of researchers and students to engage in entrepreneurial activities and transition research results into the marketplace by identifying research that can lead to practical deployment of technologies and products to improve economic competitiveness. The I-Corps program supports entrepreneurship and commercialization education for science and engineering researchers and students by bringing them together with industry representatives, providing education and training, and promoting the development of innovation networks. Grant funds can also be used for additional researcher support. The grant funds awarded under this section can be used for prototype development, proof-of-concept, and building infrastructure for science and engineering entrepreneurship. Collaboration with small business innovation research and technology transfer programs is also encouraged. The Small Business Act allows for entrepreneurship and commercialization education through the I-Corps program, including partnerships with other federal agencies for similar programs. Partnership funding for the I-Corps program may be provided by Federal agencies for training researchers, students, and establishing Nodes and Sites for entrepreneurship infrastructure. The Director chairs a curriculum committee consisting of program officers from relevant Federal agencies. The I-Corps program involves program instructors, researchers, industry, and academic representatives who develop and update curriculum. Team selection is managed by relevant program officers, and a biennial report on program efficacy is submitted to specific committees. Each Federal agency contributes to the program. The I-Corps program involves partnerships with State and local entities to support entrepreneurship education. Authorization of appropriations includes $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $45,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The Secretary of the Treasury can recover assets owed to the United States Government on behalf of any agency, retaining a portion of the recovered amounts to cover administrative costs."
