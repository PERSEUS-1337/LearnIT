The report is part of a series of CRS products providing detailed background and analysis of FDA-related issues. For more information on related issues, visit the CRS website or contact the author. Titles I through IV of both the Senate and House bills would authorize FDA to collect user fees and direct the revenue to fund specified activities relating to prescription drugs, medical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilar biological products. PDUFA, established in 1992, allows FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products for specified activities. The FDA is authorized to collect user fees from industry to set target completion times for review processes and supplement funding from Congress. User fees make up 35% of the FDA budget, with 51% allocated to the human drug program. These fees have allowed the FDA to increase staff and reduce application review times. The FDA collects user fees from the regulated industry to support the review process of human drug applications. PDUFA covers new drugs and biological products, excluding generic and biosimilar drugs. Proposed legislative changes aim to update current law. The FDA collects user fees from the medical device industry to fund the review process. User fees and direct appropriations support FDA's review of medical devices for diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, or prevention of diseases. FDA approval is required before marketing in the US to reduce review time. The FDA collects user fees from the medical device industry to fund the review process and negotiates with industry to set performance goals for premarket device review. The medical device user fee program is modeled after the PDUFA program. Legislation in S. 3187 and H.R. 5651 would make changes to current law for the MDUFA program and authorize the collection and use of generic drug user fees through GDUFA. GDUFA, effective from October 1, 2012, to October 1, 2017, has provisions similar to S. 3187 and H.R. 5651. Performance goals are crucial, outlined in the FDA-industry agreement submitted to Congress. For more details, refer to CRS Report R42540 on GDUFA and BSUFA. Biological products, known as biosimilars, are similar to brand-name biologics but not identical. The biotechnology industry has been developing these products since the late 1970s. While biologics are expected to become more prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry, their high cost can be a barrier for patients. These products are regulated for marketing under specific guidelines. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, allowed for the approval of generic drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a new regulatory authority for biosimilars, similar to generic drugs, under the FDA. Biosimilars can be approved by demonstrating similarity to an already approved biological product. The proposed Biosimilar User Fee Act (BSUFA) would require the collection of six types of fees from industry for biosimilar biological products. Fee amounts would be based on inflation-adjusted PDUFA fee amounts. The proposal includes fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue for the new program and enable early meetings with FDA. Companies may pay a reactivation fee to resume product development. Waivers for small businesses are also included in the legislative language. The Biosimilar User Fee Act (BSUFA) proposes fees for biosimilar biological products, including a fee waiver for small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. The authority for biosimilars user fees would end on October 1, 2017. The proposed changes would add new sections to the FFDCA. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) provide incentives for drug manufacturers to test products for use in children. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (PMDSIA) creates reporting requirements and incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), passed by Congress in 2002 and 2003, provide incentives for pediatric testing. BPCA offers extended market exclusivity for manufacturers conducting pediatric studies, while PREA requires safety and effectiveness testing in pediatric populations. BPCA sunsets on October 1, 2012, and PREA is authorized only as long as BPCA is in effect. The incentives include extended marketing exclusivity for products under patent protection and referral of pediatric studies to NIH or FNIH. The BPCA and PREA studies provide new dosing, indications, safety information, and effectiveness data for pediatric populations. Both acts were reauthorized in 2007 and are usually discussed together. S. 3187 and H.R. 2516 aim to permanently authorize BPCA and PREA, amending current laws. Medical devices range from simple to complex products used in healthcare for diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, or prevention of diseases. The FDA regulates medical devices based on risk classification: Class I for low-risk, Class II for moderate-risk, and Class III for high-risk devices. Low-risk and some moderate-risk devices are exempt from premarket review, while others require premarket approval or notification submission for market authorization. According to a 2009 GAO report, most devices listed with the FDA were exempt from premarket review, with the remainder entering the market through the 510(k) process, PMA process, or other means. FDA has postmarket authority to monitor device safety and effectiveness, with requirements for labeling, surveillance, tracking, and adverse event reporting. Proposed modifications in legislation aim to change aspects of premarket and postmarket device regulation. The proposed modifications in legislation aim to change aspects of premarket and postmarket device regulation, including streamlining the de novo 510(k) process, expanding postmarket surveillance, altering postmarket study requirements, and strengthening device recall and tracking capabilities. Other reforms focus on increasing transparency in FDA's approval processes, improving health information technology, and harmonizing device regulation with international standards. The FDA is responsible for regulating the safety and effectiveness of drugs in the United States through preapproval and postapproval phases. Congress has refined and expanded FDA's responsibilities regarding drug approval and regulation since 1906. The FDA's responsibilities include drug approval and regulation, with Congress suggesting additional efforts for product development, application review, product integrity, drug shortages, and medical gases regulation. The earliest FDA authorities in 1906 focused on product integrity, reflecting changes in the mid-century pharmaceutical industry. The FDA's responsibilities have evolved as the pharmaceutical industry shifted to a global chain of manufacturers. FDA leadership and stakeholders have suggested solutions to align the agency's statutory tools with its responsibilities. Discussions continue on chain-of-custody documentation, track-and-trace technologies, and anti-counterfeiting measures for domestic and foreign facilities. The availability of anti-infective drugs is crucial for treating infectious diseases, but drug resistance can render approved drugs ineffective. The development of new anti-infective drugs is not always attractive to sponsors due to short-term use and unique regulatory challenges. S. 3187 and H.R. 5651 propose incentives for new anti-infective drugs by providing extended exclusivity. These bills aim to encourage the development of specific anti-infective drugs by offering a period without generic competition. The Senate bill limits eligible products for incentives to treat serious or life-threatening infections, while the House bill includes any anti-infective drug. Congress members debate on the effectiveness of each approach in promoting new drug development. The FDA must approve drug applications before they can be sold in the US, starting with laboratory and animal testing, followed by clinical trials in Phase I, II, and III. The FDA reviews drug applications in Phase I, II, and III studies for safety, effectiveness, labeling, and manufacturing methods. Regulations outline requirements, and expedited processes like accelerated approval are used for serious conditions. The FDA regulations outline approval processes for drugs and biological products that offer therapeutic benefits over existing treatments. Fast track designation expedites the application process for drugs addressing unmet medical needs, while priority review affects the timing of FDA's drug review. Proposed amendments aim to expedite treatments for serious diseases by combining elements of accelerated approval and fast track designation, introducing a new breakthrough therapy designation. The Senate and House provisions aim to expedite drug approval processes by introducing new designations like fast track product and breakthrough therapy. These provisions focus on different elements such as drug characteristics, FDA interaction with developers, and criteria for assessing safety and effectiveness. The Senate and House provisions aim to expedite drug approval processes by introducing new designations like fast track product and breakthrough therapy. These provisions focus on different elements such as drug characteristics, FDA interaction with developers, and criteria for assessing safety and effectiveness. Both bills also address drug shortages, which have been increasing since 2005, particularly affecting generic sterile injectable drugs used in surgery or hospital care. Causes of shortages include manufacturing quality problems, supply interruptions, and unanticipated increases in demand. The increasing rate of drug shortages is attributed to various factors such as market concentration, global supply chain issues, manufacturing constraints, and inventory practices. The production of sterile injectable drugs by a limited number of producers in specialized facilities also contributes to shortages when manufacturing facilities go offline. The FDA has taken steps to address drug shortages by asking manufacturers to increase production, expediting reviews, and communicating with the DEA about controlled substances. Construction of new facilities and FDA approval processes can delay efforts to ease shortages. The FDA has taken steps to address drug shortages by asking manufacturers to increase production and expedite reviews. An Executive Order directed FDA to use all tools to require advance notice of manufacturing interruptions and address instances of price gouging. Immediate steps include increasing notification and staffing, developing legislation for notification, and communicating with the public. Longer-term steps include using databases to prevent shortages, identifying manufacturing quality issues, and encouraging wholesaler transparency. Some proposed solutions to address drug shortages include tracking availability, verifying legitimacy of shipments, and providing incentives to manufacturers. Legislation in Congress focuses on notification requirements and potential changes to Medicare and Medicaid payment policies. S. 3187 and H.R. 5651 both aim to expand notification requirements and address the causes of shortages. The House bill H.R. 5651 focuses on drug shortage notification, a list with reasons and estimated duration, coordination with the Attorney General on production quotas, and approval pathway for medical gases. FDA oversees medical gases through CGMP regulations and guidance, with proposed certification process for approval. The House bill H.R. 5651 focuses on drug shortage notification, coordination with the Attorney General on production quotas, and approval pathway for medical gases. FDA proposed a certification process for approving medical gases that meet requirements without conferring market exclusivity or requiring user fees. Additional drug-related provisions include independent assessment of drug approval processes, drugs for rare diseases, accessibility of prescription information for the blind, risk-benefit assessment framework for NDAs, and more. The Secretary must review expertise and financial disclosures of individuals appointed to FDA advisory committees to reduce conflicts of interest. Advisory committee members are prohibited from participating in decisions if they have financial conflicts of interest. Advisory committee members are prohibited from participating in decisions if they have a financial interest, including those of their spouse, minor child, or organizations they are affiliated with. Waivers can be granted if the financial interest is disclosed and deemed not substantial enough to affect integrity. The financial interest of advisory committee members must be disclosed and can be waived if it is not deemed substantial enough to affect integrity. The HHS Secretary has the authority to grant waivers for conflicts of interest under the FFDCA. The HHS Secretary can grant waivers for conflicts of interest for advisory committee members. Provisions in S. 3187 and H.R. 5651 regarding conflicts of interest are compared in tables. Additional provisions in the bills include reauthorization of partnerships, internet promotion guidance, electronic submission, tanning bed labeling, global clinical trials, regulatory science, and reporting requirements for medical products. The Senate passed S. 3187 and the House passed H.R. 5651, focusing on various aspects such as reporting requirements for medical products, strategic management plan for FDA workforce, patient participation in discussions, nanomaterials, online pharmacies, medication and device errors, drug information communication, small businesses report, whistleblower protection, clinical trial registration, sunscreen product compliance date, changes to the Controlled Substances Act, and prescription drug monitoring programs. The reauthorizations of PDUFA and MDUFA were completed before potential FDA lay-offs. Despite successful bipartisan efforts to build core drug and device provisions in bills S. 3187 and H.R. 5651, there are still complex issues to address. Negotiations are ongoing between House and Senate staff to resolve differences, including changing medical device approval procedures, developing a global supply chain system, and examining federal health program drug payment policies. Congress may pursue these issues after the bills are passed. The program drug payment policies can influence drug shortages, and Congress may need a must-pass vehicle to achieve legislative changes facing the FDA in 2017."
