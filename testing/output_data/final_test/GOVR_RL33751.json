    "content": "The report examines the specialty metal clause in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which prohibits DOD from acquiring end units or components for various systems unless they are made with specialty metals melted or produced in the United States. Specialty metals are crucial for military equipment, including aircraft, weapons, and electrical components. Thousands of products in defense, aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy sectors rely on these specialty metals. The specialty metal clause in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) prohibits DOD from acquiring components unless made with specialty metals melted or produced in the US. Specialty metals are crucial for military equipment, and the Berry Amendment ensures domestic procurement for defense contractors. The specialty metal clause, initially included in the 1973 Defense Appropriations Act to protect domestic source materials during the Vietnam War, has evolved over the years. Congress separated specialty metals from the Berry Amendment in the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act, defining them in 10 U.S.C. 2533b and revising the definition in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. Specialty metals are no longer part of the Berry Amendment and are now covered in a separate citation in the United States Code. The current definition of specialty metals, as outlined in 10 U.S.C. 2533b, includes steel with specific alloy content limits, metal alloys with certain base metals, titanium, and zirconium. DFARS 225.252.7009 requires specialty metals used in defense articles to be melted in the U.S. or a qualifying country. The specialty metals clause requires metals used in defense articles to be melted in the United States or a qualifying country. Exceptions to this rule include waivers for national security, lack of compliant specialty metals, acquisitions made outside the U.S. for combat operations, and use of non-competitive procedures under certain circumstances. Exceptions to the specialty metals clause include circumstances of urgency, agreements with foreign governments, small purchases, electrical components, certain commercial items, commercially derivative defense articles, and noncompliant materials for national security reasons. H.R. 1960 and S. 1197 were introduced to give the President more authority to conserve strategic materials and assess supply chain diversification for rare earth substitutes. Section 1411 of the bill modifies the President's authority to maintain a national defense stockpile. The bill H.R. 1960 and S. 1197 aim to enhance the President's authority in conserving strategic materials and exploring alternative sources for rare earth substitutes. It includes provisions for recovering excess materials, encouraging conservation, and developing domestic sources of critical materials. Section 1412 of Title 50, United States Code, is amended to include 'conservation' in addition to 'development'. This allows for the acquisition of strategic and critical materials for the National Defense Stockpile to meet military, industrial, and civilian needs. The National Defense Stockpile Manager can acquire specific materials using funds from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund, such as Ferroniobium, Dysprosium Metal, Yttrium Oxide, Cadmium Zinc Tellurium Substrate Materials, Lithium Ion Precursors, and Triamino-Trinitrobenzene. The National Defense Stockpile Manager may use up to $41,000,000 from the National Stockpile Transaction Fund for acquiring specified materials. The authority is available for purchases from Fiscal Year 2014 to Fiscal Year 2019. H.R. 1960 addresses concerns over maintaining a secure supply chain for rare earth elements for national security and defense weapon systems. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics is required to submit a report outlining a risk mitigation strategy by February 1, 2014. The committee is aware of the need to secure rare earth elements for defense procurement needs, with an exception of yttrium. The consumption of rare earth elements is expected to increase after 2013, prompting a report on recycling and recovery feasibility. The committee is aware of the increasing demand for rare earth elements for defense procurement, with specific quantities needed for submarines, destroyers, and aircraft. The Department of Defense plans to secure rare earth supplies through diversification, substitutes, and waste reclamation. Diversification of supply is crucial to meet the growing demand, but there are concerns about the effectiveness of some processes. The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the Department's risk mitigation strategy for rare earth elements, including programs for reclamation, cost assessment, supplier availability, and reprocessing. The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the Department's risk mitigation strategy for rare earth elements, including programs for reclamation, cost assessment, supplier availability, and reprocessing. The report should include a list of alternative sources of supply, physical descriptions of these sources, materials to be obtained via the Defense Priorities and Allocations System, and activities for diversification of supply. Additionally, DOD is required to assess the potential for substituting non-rare earth materials in components of the Joint Strike Fighter to address supply chain challenges. The committee is concerned about securing rare earth materials for Department of Defense programs, including the F-35 Lightening II program. They are unsure how the Department's strategy for securing rare earth elements will be implemented in major defense acquisition programs, potentially leading to increased costs. The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the Department's risk mitigation strategy for rare earth elements. The committee directs a report on the potential substitution of rare earth materials in F-35 aircraft to reduce costs and secure the supply chain. The report should include a list of subsystems containing rare earth elements, assessment of substitute components, and potential engineering changes needed for integration. The Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013, S. 1600, aims to reestablish domestic critical mineral capabilities in the United States. The bill has bipartisan support and focuses on assessment, production, manufacturing, and recycling of critical minerals. The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 (H.R. 761) aims to develop domestic sources of minerals important for U.S. economic and national security. The bill passed in the House and was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Another bill, the RARE Act of 2013 (H.R. 981), requires an assessment of global rare earth element resources. The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 (H.R. 1063) requires an assessment of global rare earth element resources and future supply. The bill aims to evaluate the demand for minerals critical to U.S. manufacturing, agricultural competitiveness, and national security. Public comments are being sought on the definition of \"produced\" for specialty metals. The DOD sought public comment on the application of the word \"produce\" for specialty metals production. A proposed rule was published to revise the definition of \"produce\" in the DFARS. The revision removed certain processes from armor plate production and expanded the application of listed technologies to any special metal. The final rule was issued on March 28, 2013, following a public comment period. Members of Congress advocated for a thoughtful approach in adding specialty metals to the Berry Amendment list. Senator Jacob Javits discussed the intent of the debate over specialty metals. Senator Jacob Javits emphasized the need for flexibility in the Department of Defense's administration of the specialty metals provision to avoid excessive burdens on government contractors and unnecessary expenses. In a March 7, 2007 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Lieutenant General Donald J. Hoffman requested Congress's support in relieving the Air Force from the burdensome aspects of the specialty metal waiver process. The Air Force requested relief from the burdensome specialty metal waiver process for electronic components, citing difficulties in tracing metals in commercial products. Industry is hesitant to create separate supply chains for traceability, despite Congress authorizing a waiver process that is labor-intensive. The Air Force requested relief from the specialty metal waiver process for electronic components due to difficulties in tracing metals in commercial products. They spent over 2,200 man hours reviewing 4,000 parts to justify a waiver for $14,000 on an item valued at $566,000. Policy questions for Congress include the impact on competition, factors affecting the clause's success, and balancing domestic suppliers with global trade. Recent revisions in the specialty metal clause are being evaluated to ensure they align with the law's purpose and address implementation concerns. Competition for defense work is impacted by the availability of specialty metal critical for high-tech military equipment. Congress exempted electronic components from the clause unless the Secretary of Defense deems domestic availability critical. Some defense suppliers argue that global trade is preferred over a dedicated domestic industrial supplier base for specialty metals critical to national security. Major aerospace companies seek waivers of domestic source restrictions to access foreign markets. Domestic source restrictions like the Berry Amendment are seen as hindering global competition by some industry leaders. Competition from foreign markets makes it challenging for domestic suppliers to survive, with different views on competition within the defense industrial base. Some defense contractors argue that global competition necessitates establishing foreign trading partners due to insufficient domestic supplier capacity. While some are locked into a dedicated supply chain, others find maintaining separate supply chains costly and burdensome. Uncertainty about the end use of their products makes it challenging to differentiate between commercial and military applications. The specialty metals clause addresses these concerns by allowing flexibility in sourcing specialty metals. The specialty metals clause addresses concerns by exempting specialty metal from allied countries, commercial-off-the-shelf items, and allowing producers to treat domestic and foreign specialty metals as fungible materials. Congress may need to assess if recent revisions adequately address these issues. The specialty metal clause in the Berry Amendment required 100% compliance, but the integration of the global supply chain made it difficult to certify all metal as domestic. Congress exempted electronic components from this clause to address the issue of maintaining separate production lines for DOD and commercial sector sales. The specialty metal clause was addressed by exempting electronic components and articles with \"de minimis\" amounts of specialty metals not melted in the US. Producers of commercial derivative defense items can treat domestic and foreign specialty metals as fungible materials. The enforceability of the new clause is questioned due to the difficulty in determining the domestic content of small components in DOD weapons systems. The specialty metal clause in DOD weapons systems requires 100% domestic content, but recent exceptions for electronic components and items with minimal non-compliant metal make it challenging for Congress to assess its effectiveness. Companies have voluntarily disclosed violations, such as National Semiconductor Corporation not meeting the requirement. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) stated that most U.S.-based semiconductor companies may have small amounts of non-compliant specialty metal in their integrated circuits due to global supply chain constraints. They believe that current domestic preference policies do not consider the economic realities of the industry. During FY2007, DOD approved a \"Domestic Non-Availability Determination (DNAD)\" to allow procurement of non-compliant specialty metal. Suppliers disclosed use of non-compliant metal in defense systems, leading to temporary modifications in the specialty metal clause. Guidance was issued on accepting non-compliant metal with conditional acceptance and withholding of payment based on financial considerations. The specialty metal clause led to temporary modifications allowing conditional acceptance of non-compliant metal with payment withheld based on financial considerations. The Berry Amendment Reform Coalition expressed concerns about the clause's impact on defense contractors partnering with other companies. The Berry Amendment made compliance difficult for defense contractors partnering with small and mid-size companies, leading to higher costs for components like fasteners and titanium. Compliance with the specialty metal clause was costly due to market forces affecting the domestic titanium industry. The cost of compliance with the specialty metal clause could be unsustainable for many companies, as developing a 100% systematic reporting system for all types of metal used in the melting process is difficult and costly. Contractors with smaller percentages of business devoted to DOD contracts may find it not cost-effective to maintain such a system, leading them to consider terminating their business relationship with DOD. Congress should assess whether recent amendments to the specialty metals law have reduced administrative burdens. The Berry Amendment, dating back to World War II, ensures U.S. troops wear domestically produced uniforms and consume food made in the U.S. Domestic source restrictions like the specialty metal clause are seen as vital for the defense industrial base's viability and national preparedness. The specialty metal clause is viewed as crucial for ensuring national security in times of war by maintaining a robust domestic capability for critical items like titanium. Domestic suppliers protected by this clause help keep production lines open and viable, preventing undue dependence on other countries. The three domestic titanium producers rely on the specialty metal clause for their viability. Some policy makers believe that domestic titanium producers have diverse income streams and are not solely reliant on the specialty metals clause. The specialty metal clause in the Berry Amendment has been in place for over three decades, and any changes could impact the defense supply chain. There are seven possible options for policy makers to consider regarding the specialty metal clause. Some possible options for policy makers to consider regarding the specialty metal clause include eliminating the clause, requiring compliance assessments, reviewing waivers, and promoting the use of domestic specialty metal. There are also discussions about potentially eliminating the Berry Amendment due to concerns about its relevance in the global supply chain. Congress could require a comprehensive review of compliance and implementation of revisions to the specialty metal clause, including a study of waiver frequency and impact. Domestic source restrictions like the Berry Amendment may ensure a dedicated domestic source for DOD products. Review and publication of waivers granted for items under the Determinations of Domestic Non-Availability could be mandated to assess the need for domestic sourcing policies. Congress could tighten the waiver process for non-compliant items, increase transparency, and limit the use of non-compliant specialty metal by tying it to the contractor's business with DOD. This may pose administrative burdens but could enhance public confidence in the process. The DOD market allows the use of compliant specialty metal for 16% of its total needs. Congress has set legal criteria for the Multi-Year Procurement Program (MYP) and when a weapons program does not meet MVP requirements. Conditions may determine when non-compliant specialty metal can be used in defense contracts, based on cost savings, production rates, and total quantities. The contract period, rate of production, and procurement quantities are key factors in using non-compliant specialty metal in defense contracts. The contract will be subject to re-competition every five years to support the domestic specialty metal industry. Cost estimates must be realistic and auditable, with funding expected throughout the contract period to avoid cancellation. The use of non-compliant specialty metal is deemed critical for national security. Congress may require separate reports for each weapons platform. One suggestion for Congress is to mandate separate reports for each platform or component of a weapons program using foreign specialty metals. This approach would provide detailed information on the specialty metal content, supporting a stronger domestic industry. Congress could also incentivize technological advancements through tax incentives for investment in scientific and manufacturing technology. Congress could create a socioeconomic subsidy program to support domestic specialty metal suppliers, potentially through a partnership between DOD and suppliers. The increased demand for domestic steel suppliers, particularly for iron-based alloy aviation specialty steels, has been highlighted due to the Department of Defense's requirements for aviation parts. The House of Representatives has expressed concern over the conclusions of the Specialty Metals Protection Board regarding the increased demand for specialty steels critical to U.S. military weapon systems. Lead times for raw materials have grown significantly, impacting spare part deliverables. Congress encourages the Department of Defense to partner with domestic industry to develop greater capacity for aviation parts within an acceptable timeframe, suggesting a 50/50 cost share project between the government, private industry, and state governments. The House of Representatives has raised concerns about the Specialty Metals Protection Board's definition of critical materials, which they find unacceptable. The Board's definition limits its scope to materials with predetermined determinations, excluding materials deemed critical by Congress for national security. The Specialty Metals Protection Board's definition of critical materials is criticized for being too narrow, hindering its ability to assess the adequacy of national security policies. This limitation prevents the Board from considering actions related to materials until national security is at risk, even if they are crucial to the industrial base. The Specialty Metals Protection Board's definition of critical materials is criticized for being too narrow, hindering its ability to assess the adequacy of national security policies. The Board currently identifies only one material as meeting the definition for consideration as a strategic material critical to national security, which the committee finds implausible. Congress could create an independent body to study the specialty metal clause and its impact on the defense industry. An independent review chartered by Congress could consult industry experts to determine if the Department of Defense's determination is accurate. H.R. 4310 broadens the definition of specialty metals produced in the US, including processes that result in property changes equivalent to melting. It also reconfigures the Strategic Materials Protection Board, with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy as chair. Congressional intent for the restructuring is outlined in the bill. The bill H.R. 4310 broadens the definition of specialty metals produced in the US and reconfigures the Strategic Materials Protection Board. The intent of the restructuring is outlined in a statement of findings accompanying the bill, with Congress highlighting the lack of progress in addressing previous reports. The office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy should expand its focus to consider both a top-down view of the supply chain, beginning with prime contractors, and a bottom-up view that begins with raw materials suppliers to ensure a secure supply of materials critical to national security. The Defense Supply Chain and Industrial Base Security Act aims to develop a strategy to secure critical sectors of the U.S. national security supply chain, review it biennially, and report to Congress. The Strategic Materials Protection Board should be chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy to oversee resource allocation for agencies ensuring a secure supply of materials. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act introduced provisions affecting the specialty metal clause, including an assessment of domestic producers' viability and requirements for contracts involving specialty metals. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act introduced provisions affecting specialty metals, including mill products like bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, and sheet. Contracts or subcontracts for forgings, castings, high performance magnets, fasteners, and electronic components are subject to specific requirements unless certain exceptions apply. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act introduced provisions affecting specialty metals, including mill products like bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, and sheet. Contracts or subcontracts for forgings, castings, high performance magnets, fasteners, and electronic components are subject to specific requirements unless exceptions apply, such as allowing the Secretary of Defense to accept items with noncompliant specialty metals up to 2% of the total weight. Waivers for national security can be granted if deemed necessary by the Secretary of Defense. Congress enacted provisions in the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act that changed the statutory authority for the special metal clause, creating a new specialty metal clause separate from the Berry Amendment. DOD can grant waivers for non-compliant specialty metal incorporated into items produced in the U.S. before the act's enactment, as long as the noncompliance was not knowing or willful. The new section, 10 U.S.C. 2533b, reaffirms that specialty metal acquired for government use must be melted or produced in the U.S. This restriction applies to all tiers of subcontractors for specific defense-related items. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act created a new specialty metal clause separate from the Berry Amendment, allowing DOD to grant waivers for non-compliant specialty metal. The new section, 10 U.S.C. 2533b, requires specialty metal for government use to be melted or produced in the U.S. It restricts procurement of specialty metal in various defense items and provides exemptions for certain situations like national security concerns, combat operations, and urgent needs. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act established a specialty metal clause (10 U.S.C. 2533b) requiring specialty metal for government use to be produced in the U.S. Exceptions are allowed for international agreements, non-appropriated fund contracts, and small purchases. A \"de minimis\" exception permits up to 2% of non-compliant specialty metal in electronic components. The Strategic Materials Protection Board was created to designate critical materials for national security, including specialty metals and other designated materials. The Strategic Materials Protection Board was established to designate critical materials for national security, including specialty metals listed in 10 U.S.C. 2533b. The board adopted Terms of Reference and directed an analysis of national security issues associated with strategic materials. At its second meeting, the board approved definitions of \"strategic material\" and \"critical material\" and reviewed the work of the Strategic and Critical Materials Working Group. The Strategic Materials Protection Board revised Terms of Reference to broaden scope and flexibility in addressing strategic materials. DOD determined specialty metals no longer require domestic source protection based on recommendations from a 2008 meeting. Specialty metals are not deemed critical to national security, allowing for the use of non-U.S. sources. The analysis showed that specialty metals are \"strategic materials\" which may require special monitoring and attention/action; but not, in general, a domestic source restriction. High purity beryllium, however, is a critical material essential for important defense systems. The Department is taking special actions to maintain a long term domestic supply of high purity beryllium, including a project with U.S. supplier Brush-Wellman. The Strategic Materials Protection Board should review recommendations for essential defense materials with a high potential for supply disruption. The Department of Defense may intervene in the market to address insufficient supplies for defense needs during peacetime or conflict. Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the defense industrial base's viability, including guidance, analyses, and strategies for addressing technological and industrial capabilities. The Department of Defense is required to report on the national technology and industrial base's capabilities and processes, including assessments and analyses used in developing the budget submission for the next fiscal year. The 2012 Annual Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress is available online."
