The \"Vision Zero Act of 2017\" authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to award grants to eligible entities to develop a Vision Zero plan to eliminate transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries within a specified timeframe, not exceeding 20 years. Eligible entities must submit an application containing required information and assurances. The plan should include projects or policies using existing data to address risk factors. The \"Vision Zero Act of 2017\" authorizes grants for developing plans to eliminate transportation-related fatalities and injuries. Plans should include safety-focused technologies, roadway design guidance, implementation, education, and enforcement of projects or policies to address risk factors and prioritize safety for all users. The plan for transportation safety grants must address the safety needs of low-income and minority communities, prevent their disproportionate targeting by law enforcement, and protect their rights under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It should involve various local government subdivisions, including law enforcement, public health, and public works, and include a mechanism to evaluate progress using transportation safety and demographic data. The Vision Zero Implementation Grant Program is established. The Vision Zero Implementation Grant Program allows the Secretary of Transportation to award grants to up to 5 eligible entities to support the implementation of a Vision Zero plan to eliminate transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries within a specified timeframe. Eligible entities must have an approved Vision Zero plan and meet selection criteria set by the Secretary. The Secretary will consider various factors when selecting entities for grants under the Vision Zero Implementation Grant Program, including public input, consideration of existing plans, meeting performance measures, community support, and availability of funds for plan implementation. Funding Limitations under this section require at least 25 percent of funds to be allocated to jurisdictions with fewer than 200,000 individuals.

SEC. 5 requires a report on project progress within 2 years of grant award. SEC. 6 authorizes appropriations.
