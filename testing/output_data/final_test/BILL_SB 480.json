    "title": "SB 480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 97.83 of the Revenue and Taxation Code mandates that for fiscal years 2016\u201317 to 2025\u201326, county auditors must adjust ad valorem property tax revenue allocations to account for qualified heavy equipment reimbursement amounts among local agencies. This includes increasing allocations to cities and special districts and decreasing allocations to the county's Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund. In case the county's Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund lacks funds to cover the heavy equipment reimbursement, the auditor will reduce ad valorem property tax allocated to excess tax school districts and distribute the amount among the county, cities, and special districts based on their usual tax revenue shares. If the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund does not have enough funds to cover the heavy equipment reimbursement, the auditor can decrease property tax revenues allocated to school districts and distribute the amount among county, cities, and special districts based on their usual tax revenue shares. The qualified heavy equipment reimbursement amount is defined as the total ad valorem property tax revenue received in the 2014-15 fiscal year from renters of qualified heavy equipment. Ad valorem property tax revenue allocations for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2025-26 shall not include allocation adjustments made by this section. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2027. Part 11 is added to Division 1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, defining taxation of qualified heavy equipment. For this part, \"rental price\" refers to the total charge for renting qualified heavy equipment, excluding additional fees like delivery, damage waivers, and taxes. \"Qualified heavy equipment\" includes mobile construction, earthmoving, or industrial equipment rented by qualified renters, along with attachments and ancillary equipment. Qualified heavy equipment includes industrial material equipment, shoring, shielding, and ground trenching equipment. It also covers equipment or vehicles exempt from the Vehicle License Fee Law. Mobile qualified heavy equipment is not permanently affixed to real property and can be moved among worksites. A qualified renter is a business primarily engaged in renting qualified heavy equipment as per specific industry classifications. On and after July 1, 2016, a tax of 0.75 percent is imposed on qualified renters for renting heavy equipment in California until July 1, 2026. The tax must be paid to the board and collected according to the Fee Collection Procedures Law. Every qualified renter must register with the board by submitting an application with business details. The board has the authority to enforce regulations for tax administration, including collections and appeals. Taxes are due quarterly to the board by the last day of the month following each quarter. Quarterly tax returns must be filed electronically with the board by the last day of the month following each quarter. The board can prescribe necessary forms and authentication methods for the returns. Qualified renters are not liable for the tax on rental of heavy equipment if accounts are found worthless and charged off for income tax purposes. They can deduct the amount charged off by the retailer if already paid. Any collected amounts must be included in the tax return. Revenues collected under this part are deposited in the General Fund. For fiscal years 2016-2026, the tax on qualified heavy equipment replaces property tax. Qualified renters not subject to this tax remain liable for property taxes. Part 11 of the Revenue and Taxation Code will be repealed on January 1, 2027. The repeal does not affect existing rights or liabilities under the law. The act creates new crimes or infractions, changes penalties, and may incur costs for local agencies. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made if determined by the Commission on State Mandates. SEC. 4. Notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act."
