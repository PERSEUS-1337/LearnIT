    "content": "The Supreme Court in Skilling v. United States clarified that the honest services fraud offenses only cover bribery and kickbacks, striking a balance between vague definitions and severe condemnation of corruption. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. Sections 1341 and 1343, are widely used by prosecutors due to their broad scope and potential 20-year sentence. Federal jurisdiction is triggered when the postal service, interstate carriers, or wire communications are used, such as in cases involving FedEx packages or emails. The honest services statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1346, was enacted in 1988 to address schemes infringing on a victim's right to honest services. This includes cases like lobbyist Jack Abramoff's guilty plea for conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and the indictment of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich for the same offense. The honest services statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1346, has raised concerns about its constitutionality due to its vague language, as seen in cases involving former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Critics argue that the statute's \"28 words\" provide a broad basis for federal criminal jurisdiction, potentially leading to prosecution for minor actions. Justice Scalia also expressed concerns about the statute's vague language inviting federal prosecution for seemingly commonplace actions. The Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in three cases, Weyhrauch v. United States, Black v. United States, and Skilling v. United States, to interpret the honest services fraud statute. The grants of certiorari garnered significant media attention, especially with the highly publicized case connected with the collapse of Enron. Less than a year after Justice Scalia's dissent in a case from the Court's 2008 term, speculation arose about the Supreme Court's interpretation of the mail and wire fraud statutes. These statutes were enacted by Congress in 1872 and 1952 to combat large-scale fraud schemes using mail, wire, or electronic communications. The statutes provide federal jurisdiction over a wide range of fraudulent activities. The mail and wire fraud statutes involve identical criminal conduct and are generally interpreted in the same manner by federal courts. The statutes subject anyone to criminal liability who devises a scheme to defraud and uses the mail or wire to execute the scheme. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes criminalize schemes to defraud using mail or telecommunications in interstate or foreign commerce. Criminal convictions require proof of both an action (actus reus) and a mental state (mens rea). The actus reus component is satisfied by using mail or telecommunications, such as mailing a resume. Prosecutors do not need to prove specific details of the scheme to establish jurisdiction under these statutes. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes criminalize schemes to defraud using mail or telecommunications in interstate or foreign commerce. Prosecutors do not need to prove specific details of the scheme to establish jurisdiction under these statutes. In most cases, a prosecutor need not prove that a person actually used the mail or sent a wire or radio communication. The success of mail or wire fraud prosecutions typically hinges on whether a defendant intended to devise a scheme to defraud. The statutes have a \"specific intent\" requirement, meaning a prosecutor must prove that a defendant specifically intended to perpetrate a fraud. The intent requirement in mail and wire fraud statutes necessitates proving that a public official intended to prevent or question the proper performance of their duties. The prosecution can establish this intent through circumstantial evidence, and the definition of fraud is broad, encompassing any dishonest act that harms property rights. Materiality is a crucial component in mail and wire fraud cases, where a scheme to defraud must have a natural tendency to induce reliance to the victim's detriment. The honest services statute broadens the scope of fraud to include depriving another of the intangible right of honest services. Questions persist regarding the statute's application in various situations. The federal mail fraud statute has been interpreted by federal courts in various ways, including applying it to frauds related to breach of fiduciary duty. In the late 1970s and 1980s, public corruption was also included as a basis for mail or wire fraud convictions. The concept of \"honest services\" convictions for public officials acting as trustees was introduced but later halted by the Supreme Court in 1987. The Supreme Court halted \"honest services\" convictions in 1987, stating that fraud only applies to money or property interests, not other interests like honest services. Congress later amended the definition of fraud to include depriving another of the intangible right of honest services. Some courts interpreted the honest services fraud amendment as reinstating the pre-McNally case law, while others disagreed. The Supreme Court had previously applied the mail fraud statute to intangible property, but it was unclear if this extended to other intangible rights like those covered by the honest services provision. The Supreme Court overturned a conviction in Cleveland v. United States, stating that mail and wire fraud statutes did not apply to a case involving the issuance of a video poker license by the state of Louisiana. The Court clarified that the license was not considered \"money or property\" and did not involve a deprivation of honest services. Federal courts had interpreted the honest services provision to include services owed by both public officials and private employees in cases of corruption. In corruption cases, both public officials and private employees can be prosecuted for concealing conflicts of interest or engaging in fraudulent schemes. The statute applies to individuals who act in their own interests instead of their employer's, including corporate officers, purchasing agents, and stock brokers. In public corruption cases, honest services fraud involves depriving the public of an elected official's honest services through bribery or undisclosed conflicts of interest. Convictions for these schemes have been upheld in various cases. The honest services statute has prompted constitutional examination due to its terse language. The honest services statute has prompted constitutional examination regarding Congress's authority to enact mail and wire fraud statutes based on its Article I powers. Federalism principles may limit federal authority over state political activities, with the Supreme Court historically using these principles to narrow the scope of federal criminal statutes. The Supreme Court requires a clear statement from Congress before interpreting statutes as intruding on areas traditionally governed by states, particularly in mail and wire fraud cases. The honest services statute in federal prosecutions against state and local officials raises concerns about federal intrusion on state matters. This was highlighted in the Court's decision in Weyhrauch, where the issue of whether a state official can be convicted for depriving the public of honest services through the disclosure of material information was addressed. Lower federal courts have debated the interpretation of the honest services fraud statute in relation to state law limitations. The Supreme Court returned the Weyhrauch case to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Skilling decision. Appellants argued that the honest services statute was unconstitutionally vague, violating due process clauses. The \"void-for-vagueness\" doctrine is rooted in concerns regarding notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement of laws. The honest services statute's vagueness in terms of criminal liability, applicability, and punishment is unclear. Judicial precedents play a key role in determining vagueness, with questions arising about the clarity provided by case law before and after the Supreme Court's decision in McNally. Some commentators argue that the case law lacks consistency and firm boundaries for the statute's scope, especially when relying on concepts like fiduciary duty borrowed from civil liability. This raises concerns about whether the statute meets constitutional requirements for penal statutes. The honest services statute's vagueness in criminal liability is a concern, with questions about clarity from case law. Before the Skilling decision, courts rejected void-for-vagueness challenges. In United States v. Rybicki, the Second Circuit upheld the statute, citing pre-enactment case law. Dissenting judges argued that the judicial doctrines were as vague as the statute itself. The courts recognized a need for limiting principles in applying the mail and wire fraud statutes, including the honest services statute. Some courts expressed concerns about the broad scope of \u00a7 1346 and the potential for absurd convictions. Despite the statute's language suggesting that dishonesty alone could be a crime, courts were hesitant to expose employees to mail fraud under such an interpretation. Justice Scalia and lower federal courts recognized the need for a limiting principle in applying the honest services statute to avoid potential abuse by prosecutors. Despite agreement on the necessity of a limiting principle, there was disagreement among lower courts on the approach to convicting defendants for mail and wire fraud based on honest services theory. The three key requirements for convicting individuals for mail and wire fraud under an honest services theory are \"private gain,\" a \"state law violation,\" and a \"foreseeable harm\" requirement. Lower courts have disagreed on the approach to applying these requirements, with some favoring specific intent and materiality requirements instead. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit criticized special tests for honest services fraud, arguing that they add elements not justified by the fraud statutes. This was exemplified in the case of members of the Salt Lake City Olympic Bid Committee who allegedly bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to secure Salt Lake City's chances to host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The Tenth Circuit rejected proposed limiting principles for the honest services statute in the context of the mail and wire fraud statutes, emphasizing the need for fraudulent intent and materiality. The Ninth Circuit also followed this approach in a case involving former members of the San Diego City Council, stating that the intent and materiality requirements of the fraud statutes were sufficient checks against potential overbreadth. Materiality and specific intent requirements were seen as alternatives to limiting principles for honest services fraud. The Tenth Circuit and Ninth Circuit rejected proposed limiting principles for the honest services statute, emphasizing the need for fraudulent intent and materiality as sufficient checks against potential overbreadth in fraud cases. The Seventh Circuit's \"private gain\" test aimed to limit the scope of the honest services provision by requiring a showing of personal gain for the defendant. In United States v. Bloom, the court dismissed an honest services count due to lack of alleged personal gain by the defendant. The Seventh Circuit's \"private gain\" test distinguishes federal crimes from state-law violations by requiring personal gain for the defendant. In United States v. Sorich, a corrupt scheme in the Chicago mayor's office involved political patronage and nepotism. The court clarified that \"private gain\" means illegitimate gain, not necessarily going to the defendant. The Seventh Circuit's definition of \"private gain\" in federal crimes requires personal gain for the defendant, as seen in United States v. Sorich involving political patronage. In a 2007 case, United States v. Thompson, gain sought on behalf of third parties was affirmed as private gain, although not clearly defined. The court ruled that job security and a pay raise cannot be considered private gain for mail fraud conviction purposes. The definition of gain in federal crimes was discussed, highlighting the need for personal gain for the defendant. The court rejected the private gain analysis for mail fraud convictions, citing concerns about ambiguity and under-inclusiveness. Some courts favored the specific intent requirement of mail and wire fraud laws over the private gain test. Others opted for different limiting principles, with the Skilling case notably declining to apply the test. In Skilling, the court declined to apply the \"state law limiting principle\" for mail or wire fraud convictions based on honest services theory. Some federal courts of appeals had adopted this principle, emphasizing federalism and the importance of state law in distinguishing criminal behavior from political actions. The Fifth Circuit first adopted this principle in United States v. Brumley, where it held that services must be owed under state law for a federal prosecution to prove violation. The Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the principle that services must be owed under state law for a federal prosecution to prove violation. The court also mentioned a case where a state senator failed to disclose compensation, leading to the conclusion that state law offers a better limiting principle for determining honest services fraud. The court upheld the conviction of an accessory to a senator's crime for failing to disclose a conflict of interest, clarifying that a violation of state law does not require a violation of criminal law but a breach of a state-created fiduciary duty. In a separate case, the Third Circuit considered the mental state required for violating state law in connection with a conflict of interest, involving a business owner in Norristown. The court upheld the conviction of a business owner in Norristown, Pennsylvania, charged with honest services fraud in a scheme with a borough administrator. The court clarified that a knowledge requirement should be applied in cases involving a third party defendant, but not to the extent of knowing fine details of reporting requirements. The court clarified that a conviction for honest services mail fraud should be upheld if the defendant participated in a scheme to assist a public official in hiding a conflict of interest and knew that the law forbade such actions. The Third Circuit criticized an outlier approach in a 2003 case and noted that most federal courts declined to adopt the state law limiting principle. Some circuits applied a \"federal common law standard of good government\" instead. In cases of honest services fraud, courts applied a \"federal common law standard of good government\" to determine intent, with violations of state law considered as evidence. The principle was evident in conflict-of-interest cases, where failure to disclose a conflict of interest demonstrated specific intent. It was uncertain if courts rejecting the state law principle in public corruption cases would apply it in private sector cases. Some federal courts established special requirements in limited circumstances. Several federal circuit courts have adopted a \"foreseeable harm\" test to limit the scope of honest services fraud in the private sector. The Sixth Circuit held that for a conviction on an honest services theory to stand, the prosecution must prove that the employee foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen economic harm to their employer. The Fourth Circuit applied a similar approach in a case involving two brothers who allegedly misrepresented their actions. The Sixth Circuit's approach to a case involving two brothers who allegedly misrepresented their joint venture's relationship with one brother's employer for the purpose of defrauding the employer focused on the foreseeable harm test as superior to the materiality test for honest services fraud. This test ensures criminal behavior is included and excludes trivial frauds that lead to material changes in business practices. The foreseeable harm test is commonly integrated with an examination of a defendant's mental state in honest services cases. It is applied in private sector cases to determine harm to economic or property interests, including confidential information like trade secrets. Some courts have rejected this test, including the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, along with the United States Supreme Court, made decisions in honest services cases such as Weyhrauch v. United States, Black v. United States, and Skilling v. United States in 2009. Justice Scalia considered the constitutionality of the honest services statute, but the Court narrowly construed it to avoid vagueness concerns. The Supreme Court's principal decision was in Skilling, with a confirming opinion in Black, and Weyhrauch was sent back to lower courts for further review. Justice Ginsburg's majority opinion limited honest services fraud to cases involving certain criteria. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the conviction of former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling for engaging in a conspiracy to overstate the company's financial position. Skilling argued that his actions did not breach his fiduciary duty to Enron, but the court rejected this argument as it appeared that Enron had not approved the deceptive measures taken by Skilling. The court clarified that a defendant may violate a state law fiduciary duty even if he claims to act in his employer's best interest. Skilling argued for a \"private gain\" test to limit the statute's scope, but the Supreme Court did not endorse this test. The Seventh Circuit's private gain test required an illicit gain, which Skilling argued he did not seek. The Supreme Court did not endorse the private gain test or find the honest services statute unconstitutionally vague. It clarified that Congress intended to reach schemes involving bribes and kickbacks, and stopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in McNally v. United States. The honest services statute was enacted by Congress in response to the McNally case, which limited fraud statutes to schemes involving money or property. The Skilling case upheld the constitutionality of the statute, focusing on bribery and kickback fraud cases as the primary applications. The Court found that \u00a71346 presents no vagueness problem, but rejected including self-dealing-conflicts-of-interest cases within the definition of honest services due to splits among lower federal courts and in the interests of lenity. Congress was advised to speak more clearly if it desires to criminalize undisclosed self-dealing. The Government proposes a standard prohibiting official action that furthers undisclosed financial interests with intent to deceive. Questions remain about the extent of conflicting financial interest, the impact of official action, and the disclosure requirements. Skilling's conduct was clear to the Court. The Court found that Skilling's conduct did not constitute honest services fraud and upheld his conviction. The Court also rejected Skilling's claim of an unfair trial due to pre-trial publicity, stating that the jury was impartial. Justices Sotomayor, Stevens, and Breyer dissented, arguing that the jury selection process should have been more thorough. The Supreme Court ruled that Black did not forfeit his right to challenge the erroneous honest services jury instruction by objecting to separate jury verdicts. Black's case provided an opportunity for the Court to address the limitation on the honest services statute. The defendants, executives of Hollinger International, were paid by Ravelston through management fees instead of directly by Hollinger. They received compensation from non-compete agreements with a Hollinger subsidiary, leading to a dispute over the board's knowledge of the arrangement. The government alleged that these payments were illegitimate. The defendants, executives of Hollinger International, received management fees from Ravelston instead of directly from Hollinger. They were also paid through non-compete agreements with a Hollinger subsidiary, leading to a dispute over the board's knowledge. The government alleged these payments were illegitimate. The defendants argued for the foreseeable harm test, but the Seventh Circuit applied the private gain test, focusing on whether they intended to gain privately through fraudulent means. The court upheld their convictions based on this test. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Weyhrauch addressed an honest services issue involving an Alaska state legislator who failed to disclose a conflict of interest related to an oil company. The Court returned the case to the lower court for further review in line with the Skilling opinion. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed an honest services issue involving an Alaska state legislator who failed to disclose a conflict of interest related to an oil company. The question on appeal was whether a mail fraud conviction on an honest services theory required a showing that a defendant's actions violated state law. The court found no evidence that the defendant had violated any state statute and emphasized Congress's authority to regulate and punish fraudulent use of mail and interstate wire communications. In his petition to the Supreme Court, Weyhrauch argued that the honest services statute, as interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, conflicted with federalism principles. The Supreme Court focused on honest services grounds in resolving the case. Skilling established that honest services fraud must involve bribery or kickbacks. The Court suggested that if Congress wants broader coverage, they should provide clear and precise guidelines."
