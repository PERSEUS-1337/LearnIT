    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize and amend programs from the 1996 welfare reform law. Senate and House committees have approved their respective welfare reauthorization bills, but none have reached the full Senate or House floor. The House passed a budget reconciliation bill including welfare reauthorization legislation. This report compares the Senate's proposed welfare reauthorization policies. The report compares welfare reauthorization policies in Senate committee bills with those in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill. Funding for TANF, CCDBG, abstinence education, and TMA has been extended through temporary legislation since 2002, with the latest extension set to expire in 2005. The latest extension for funding TANF, CCDBG, abstinence education, and TMA is set to expire in 2005. Welfare reauthorization legislation includes initiatives for responsible fatherhood, Child Support Enforcement, child welfare programs, Supplemental Security Income changes, and \"superwaiver\" authority. Senate bill S. 667 extends abstinence education grants and revises TMA through FY2010, while the House reconciliation bill does not include these provisions. The Senate committee and House reconciliation bills for welfare reauthorization include provisions to reduce spending, such as revising foster care and adoption assistance eligibility rules. There are similarities between the two proposals, but differences exist in the details. Both Senate committee and House bills for welfare reauthorization propose extending TANF funding through FY2010 and incorporating marriage promotion grants. They also aim to raise work participation standards, with differences in the specifics of the contingency fund and bonuses. The 1996 welfare reform law entitled states to a basic TANF block grant based on pre-1996 welfare program expenditures. The TANF program funding remains fixed since the 1990s, with no adjustments for inflation or changes in caseloads. Both Senate and House proposals plan to maintain current funding levels without adjustments through FY2010. Supplemental grants were considered to disadvantage states with high population growth or historically low expenditures. Supplemental grants totaling $319 million per year are provided to 17 states with high population growth or historically low grant levels. These grants will continue at the same funding level through FY2009. Additionally, a contingency fund is in place to provide extra matching grants to states during economic downturns under TANF. The TANF contingency fund provides extra matching grants to states based on economic need. The House bill proposes minor changes, while the Senate Finance Committee suggests a complete overhaul, eliminating certain requirements for states to qualify for funds. The Senate Finance Committee bill proposes changes to TANF bonuses, eliminating the $100 million bonus for reductions in out-of-wedlock births and refocusing the \"High Performance Bonus\" on employment outcomes. The House budget reconciliation bill eliminates TANF bonuses for reductions in out-of-wedlock births and employment outcomes to fund grants promoting healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood initiatives. TANF grants can be used for various benefits and services to assist low-income families and promote two-parent families. Up to 30% of the grant can be transferred to other block grant programs like the Child Care and Development Fund and the Social Services Block Grant. The House budget reconciliation bill would raise the overall transfer limit to 50%, while the Senate Finance Committee proposal would retain the current 30% transfer limit. Both bills include provisions to ease some rules regarding the use of TANF funds, allowing states to use carryover TANF funds for any TANF benefit and service. The bills aim to change TANF regulations by excluding child care and transportation aid from the definition of \"assistance,\" freeing nonworking families from certain program requirements. Both the Senate Finance Committee bill and the House budget reconciliation bill incorporate work requirements, including developing self-sufficiency plans for adult recipients and imposing sanctions for noncompliance. The Senate Finance Committee bill and House budget reconciliation bill propose raising TANF work participation standards from 50% to 70%, increasing required hours of work, and revising activities for credit. States must have a specified percentage of families participating in work activities, with additional standards for two-parent families. The participation rate standards for TANF work activities may be reduced for caseload reductions since welfare reform in FY1995. In FY2003, the standard was reduced to 0% for 20 states. The Senate Finance Committee and House budget reconciliation bills aim to raise the work participation standard for all families to 70% by FY2010 and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. Both bills would also revise the credits that reduce these standards. The House bill proposes revising the caseload reduction credit to be measured from a more recent year, with an additional credit for states achieving a 60% reduction from FY1995 to FY2001. The Senate Finance Committee bill would replace the caseload reduction credit with a credit for employed welfare leavers starting in FY2008. It also includes a minimum effective standard of 10% in FY2006, increasing to 50% in FY2010. The Senate Finance Committee bill and the House budget reconciliation bill propose raising the minimum hours required for families to participate in welfare programs. The House bill suggests a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, with partial credit for 24 hours of participation. The Senate bill offers full credit for 24 hours per week for single parents with preschoolers. The Senate Finance Committee bill and the House budget reconciliation bill propose increasing the minimum hours required for welfare program participation. Single-parent families would receive full credit at 24 hours per week, with partial credit at 20 hours per week. Two-parent families would have higher hour requirements. Current law lists 12 activities that can count towards TANF work participation standards, with a focus on core activities like work, job search, vocational education, and community service. Educational activities count towards the 30-hour-per-week standard only if combined with at least 20 hours of core activities. The House bill proposes changes to TANF work participation standards by narrowing the list of core activities and giving states more discretion in defining countable activities. Job search and vocational education would only count for a limited time, with work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience becoming the primary activities thereafter. The House bill proposes changes to TANF work participation standards by narrowing the list of core activities and giving states more discretion in defining countable activities. Job search and vocational education would only count for a limited time, with work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience becoming the primary activities thereafter. The Senate Finance Committee bill also provides states with additional discretion in defining countable activities, allowing for an expanded list of activities for a limited period. The House bill proposes changes to TANF work participation standards by narrowing the list of core activities and giving states more discretion in defining countable activities. The Senate Finance Committee bill would allow states to count an expanded set of activities for single-parent families with at least 24 hours per week in core activities. It includes options for participation in education or vocational training programs and rehabilitative activities for disabled persons. The Senate Finance Committee bill proposes allowing rehabilitation activities for disabled individuals to count as work activities under TANF, and emphasizes collaboration between agencies. It also includes provisions for promoting marriage and supporting two-parent families using TANF funds. The Finance Committee and House budget reconciliation bills allocate $100 million for marriage promotion grants from TANF funding. States can use federal or state funds as a match for these grants. Additional funds are provided for research and demonstrations. Activities include public advertising campaigns, education in high schools, and marriage and relationship skills programs. The House bill emphasizes using funds primarily for marriage promotion, while the Senate bill requires 80% of funds to be used for this purpose. The Finance Committee and House budget reconciliation bills allocate $100 million for marriage promotion grants from TANF funding. States can use federal or state funds as a match for these grants. Activities include public advertising campaigns, education in high schools, marriage and relationship skills programs, pre-marital education for engaged couples, marriage enhancement for married couples, divorce education programs, and marriage mentoring programs. Grantees must consider domestic violence issues, and participation in marriage promotion activities must be voluntary. The Senate bill prohibits states from sanctioning families receiving TANF assistance for not participating in marriage promotion activities. The legislation consolidates provisions for \"child care reauthorization\" into a single bill on the Senate side, with funding split between S. 667 and S. 525. S. 667 includes mandatory funding for CCDBG programs, while S. 525 includes discretionary funding and other provisions. The House bill and Senate committee legislation share some provisions, with more details available in the text. The discretionary portion of child care funding is authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, with proposed funding levels increasing annually to reach $3.1 billion in FY2010. Mandatory funding for the CCDBG has been preappropriated and continued at $2.717 billion since FY2002. The House budget reconciliation bill proposes to increase mandatory child care funding by $500 million over five years, with funding levels reaching $2.917 billion for FY2006 and $2.917 billion for FY2010. The Senate committee bill proposes a larger increase of $6 billion over five years, with funding levels reaching $3.617 billion for FY2006 and $4.317 billion for FY2010. Puerto Rico would receive $75 million of the $6 billion increase. The House bill proposes increasing mandatory child care funding by $500 million over five years, while the Senate committee bill suggests a larger increase of $6 billion over the same period. Puerto Rico would receive $75 million of the $6 billion increase. Under current law, states can transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant to the CCDBG, but S. 667 would maintain this limit while the House bill would allow up to 50% transfer. S. 525 would require at least 70% of CCDBG funds to be used for direct services, with an option to use excess funds to increase payment rates. The House budget reconciliation bill and the HELP Committee's S. 525 propose increasing funding for child care above FY2005 levels to support payment rate increases for providers and establish tiered payment rates. Both bills also aim to raise the percentage of CCDBG funds spent on quality activities from 4% to a minimum of 6%. Additionally, stricter requirements would be added to set payment rates in accordance with biennial market rate surveys. The House budget reconciliation bill and the HELP Committee's S. 525 aim to increase funding for child care and raise the percentage of CCDBG funds spent on quality activities from 4% to a minimum of 6%. Both bills provide detailed definitions of \"quality activities,\" including school readiness activities, staff training, and retention initiatives. S. 525 allows quality funds to be used for evaluating program quality and effectiveness, while the House bill includes a category for \"other activities as approved by the state.\" Eligibility requirements would also be stricter under the proposed legislation. The House budget reconciliation bill and S. 525 propose changes to CCDBG eligibility requirements, allowing states to set income limits without a federal maximum. States must submit plans every two years certifying program elements like parental choice and health/safety. The House budget reconciliation bill and the HELP Committee's S. 525 would amend current law to require additional elements in state plans related to consumer education, state coordination of child care services, compliance with quality requirements, and special needs child care. S. 525 also includes provisions for redetermining eligibility every six months, training requirements for child care providers, and setting provider payment rates in accordance with the state plan. The provider payment rates in the state plan must be set based on a biennial survey of market rates, without reducing the number of families served. State plans must include survey results and ensure timely payment to providers. Survey results must be made public within 30 days. Data reporting requirements for CCDBG programs include monthly data collection and quarterly submission to HHS. S. 525 retains quarterly reporting but amends the list of data. S. 525 would amend the list of data elements for monthly reporting in CCDBG programs and eliminate the separate annual report. S. 667 extends reporting to TANF-funded child care. The House bill does not include these provisions. The House budget reconciliation bill allows waivers for states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The House budget reconciliation bill includes provisions to enhance security at child care centers in federal facilities and establish a small business child care grant program. This program would award competitive grants to states for employer-operated child care programs. Fatherhood programs, known as \"responsible fatherhood\" programs, support noncustodial fathers in their financial and personal responsibilities towards their children. These programs include parenting education, mediation services, job training, and peer support, funded by sources like TANF block grant funds and welfare-to-work funds. The federal government does not allocate specific funding for responsible fatherhood programs, but bills have been introduced in Congress to address this. In the 109th Congress, S. 667 and the House budget reconciliation bill proposed funding for responsible fatherhood grant programs. S. 667 outlined five components for the program, including $20 million for grants to up to 10 programs and $30 million for grants to eligible entities. The House Budget Reconciliation proposal includes allocating $30 million for grants to eligible entities, $5 million for a fatherhood promotion organization, $20 million block grant for states, and $1 million for a fatherhood research and education organization. The House Budget Reconciliation proposal for responsible fatherhood includes establishing four components for the program from FY2006 through FY2010. This involves competitive grants for projects, funding for multicity projects, and evaluation of grant projects. Eligible entities can apply for grants up to $25,000 per fiscal year. The House Budget Reconciliation proposal for responsible fatherhood includes authorizing funding for evaluation of grant projects and multicity, multistate demonstration projects. The Secretary of HHS is authorized to carry out national significance projects related to fatherhood promotion, with an annual appropriation of $20 million for FY2006 through FY2010. The Committee on Education and the Workforce shares jurisdiction with the Committee on Ways and Means for fatherhood programs. The Committee on Education and the Workforce's fatherhood program proposal includes five components, with a limit of 35% of the $20 million annual authorization for specific demonstrations and evaluations. It also authorizes grants for demonstration projects aimed at encouraging noncustodial parents to enter the workforce and support their children emotionally and financially. The bill includes demonstration projects conducted by a national nonprofit fatherhood promotion organization. At least $5 million is allocated for the economic incentive project. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and funded by general revenues. All states and territories operate CSE programs, with certain families qualifying for free services. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides free services to families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage. Other families can apply for CSE services with a maximum application fee of $25. The program offers seven major services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of support payments. Enforcement techniques include income withholding and intercept of federal and state income. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides free services to families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage. Enforcement methods include income withholding, intercept of federal and state income tax refunds, intercept of unemployment compensation, liens against property, security bonds, and reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus. Legislation such as P.L. 102-521 and P.L. 105-187 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. The Child Support Enforcement program enforces support payments through various methods like income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, and liens on property. Legislation allows for federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to pay child support. States must implement procedures to withhold licenses and seize assets of debtor parents. The Child Support Enforcement program enforces support payments through various methods like income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, and liens on property. Legislation also required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) and expand full faith and credit procedures. P.L. 104-193 clarified jurisdiction in cases with multiple child support orders and established federal reimbursement for CSE program costs. P.L. 105-200 established a new incentive payment system for states. The CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program with a focus on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. It helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and assists families in remaining self-sufficient. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and about 30% for poor families. Both S. 667 and the House budget include major provisions related to child support enforcement. Both S. 667 and the House budget reconciliation bill aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for single-parent families. They share objectives of simplifying CSE rules and strengthening \"family-first\" policies, but differ in their approaches. The bills would revise enforcement tools and add new ones to improve collections. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the impact of these changes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate Finance Committee-reported bill would increase federal outlays in the CSE program by $628 million over the period FY2006-FY2010, while the House budget reconciliation bill would reduce federal outlays by $4.899 billion over the same period. Key provisions in the House bill include a reduction in the matching rate for administrative expenses and the elimination of the federal match for CSE incentive payments. Additionally, families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state. The child support assignment rules determine legal claim on payments owed by noncustodial parents. Collections are kept by states and federal government for welfare reimbursement. Nonwelfare families retain all collected child support. Date of assignment determines if arrearages are permanently assigned to the state. The child support assignment rules determine legal claim on payments owed by noncustodial parents. Arrearages are permanently assigned to the state only if accumulated while the family receives assistance. Child support accrued before TANF benefits are not assigned to the state. Former-TANF families receive child support collected for pre-assistance arrearages. Distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, with the state retaining current support and assigned arrearages up to the amount of TANF benefits paid to the family. States have the discretion to decide how much of the state share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to pass on to the family. Child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families are decided by states, with some states continuing a $50 pass-through policy. States are required to pay the federal government's share of child support collections. Both bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families rather than state and federal coffers. The bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families rather than state and federal coffers. S. 667 would allow states to pay up to $400 per month in child support collected on behalf of TANF families to the family without requiring payment to the federal government. The House budget reconciliation bill aims to incentivize states to increase their child support pass-through and disregard policies. It allows states to pay more collected child support to TANF families without paying the federal government. The federal cost-sharing for new pass-through payments is limited to $100 per month or $50 more than what the state previously shared with the family. The federal government incentivizes states to increase child support pass-through and disregard policies. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before being reimbursed, following a \"family-first\" policy. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized child support distribution to families after leaving TANF, aiming to reduce reliance on public assistance. S. 667 proposes giving states the option to distribute all collected child support, including arrearages, to former TANF families. S. 667 and the House bill aim to simplify the child support distribution process and share costs with states for paying arrearages. Both bills also include provisions for expanding collection and enforcement tools. Both bills aim to simplify child support distribution, lower denial threshold for noncustodial parents owing child support, ease collection from veterans' benefits, allow federal tax refund offset for past-due child support, authorize HHS Secretary to compare noncustodial parent information with insurers, and establish interstate child support cases. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, facilitating collection from Social Security benefits, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators. Other provisions include requiring states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years and submitting a report to Congress on child support. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 bill includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as seizing financial assets of noncustodial parents, facilitating collection from Social Security benefits, requiring medical support, and notifying health care plan administrators. It also requires states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, submit a report to Congress on child support procedures, increase funding for the CSE access and visitation program, adopt a later version of the UIFSA, and allow Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver. The House budget reconciliation bill includes provisions to establish a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services, reduce the CSE federal rate, and eliminate federal match on CSE incentive payments reinvested by states. The Senate welfare reauthorization bill and House budget reconciliation bill would also modify Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) program, which extends Medicaid coverage for families leaving welfare for work. The TMA program is set to expire on December 31, 2005, but S. 667 proposes to extend it through FY2010 with options for states to reduce reporting requirements and provide up to 24 months of coverage. The House reconciliation bill does not extend TMA. Additionally, S. 667 extends the abstinence education grant program through FY2010, while the House bill does not. Both bills extend the authority for states to operate child welfare waiver programs through FY2010. The House budget reconciliation bill includes provisions to reduce federal outlays for foster care and adoption assistance, such as nullifying a court rule expanding eligibility for foster care and limiting federal reimbursement for children placed with unlicensed relatives. The Senate committee bill allows Indian tribes to receive direct federal funding for foster care and adoption assistance programs and permits limited additional federal funds for Puerto Rico's foster care. The House budget reconciliation bill and Senate committee bill propose changes to federal funding for foster care and adoption assistance. The Senate bill includes provisions for reviewing disability determinations and extending SSI eligibility for refugees and asylees. The House bill aims to achieve budget reductions by changing how back payments are made. Table 2 compares welfare provisions in the Senate bills (S. 667 and S. 525) and the House budget reconciliation bill. The House budget reconciliation bill is organized by Titles reflecting each House committee's legislative changes related to welfare and other proposals. Table 2 compares identical provisions reported by the Education and Workforce Committee and Ways and Means Committee. The bill includes provisions unrelated to welfare reform programs and tax changes from S. 667 are not addressed in the report. The tax provisions of S. 667 are not included in the report or table comparing current law with S. 667/525 and the House Budget Reconciliation Bill welfare provisions."
