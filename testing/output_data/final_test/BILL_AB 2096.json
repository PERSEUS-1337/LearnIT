    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 25503.6 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow certain alcohol manufacturers to purchase advertising space from on-sale retail licensees under specific conditions related to the ownership and location of the venue. The amended Business and Professions Code allows alcohol manufacturers to purchase advertising space from specific venues in different counties, each with varying seating capacities. Three specific venues in different counties are designated for alcohol manufacturers to purchase advertising space: an outdoor stadium in Tulare County with over 1,500 seats, a motorsports entertainment complex in San Bernardino County with a speedway seating at least 50,000, and an exposition park in Los Angeles County with a grandstand seating at least 8,000 people. In Carson, Los Angeles County, there is an outdoor soccer stadium with 25,000 seats, an outdoor tennis stadium with 7,000 seats, an outdoor track and field facility with 7,000 seats, and an indoor velodrome with 2,000 seats. In San Joaquin County, there is an outdoor professional sports facility with 4,200 seats. In Inglewood, there is a fully enclosed arena with over 13,000 seats. In Santa Clara, there is an outdoor stadium with 68,000 seats. A beer manufacturer, winegrower, distilled spirits rectifier, or manufacturer can advertise at an outdoor stadium if the major tenant doesn't have a retail license. Advertising can also be placed in the stadium's on-sale licensed premises. Sonoma State University owns a complex for various events with multiple venues, including concert halls and outdoor seating areas. Advertising space can be purchased from the owner, tenant, or licensee. In San Diego County, there is a fairgrounds with a horse racetrack and sports facilities. The advertising space or time can only be purchased in connection with events held at the exposition park, stadium, or arena owned or leased by the on-sale licensee. Restrictions apply for advertising in hotels within an exposition park and for events at a complex described in the previous paragraph. The on-sale licensee can serve other brands of alcohol from competing wholesalers in addition to the brand they advertise. Any advertising purchases must be controlled by a written contract between the alcohol manufacturer and the licensee. The on-sale licensee can serve other alcohol brands from competing wholesalers. The major tenant of the outdoor stadium and the owner, long-term tenant, or licensee of the complex are also included in the regulations. Any alcohol manufacturer or distributor who illegally coerces a wholesaler to fulfill contractual obligations may face misdemeanor charges, including imprisonment or fines up to the value of the contract plus $10,000. License revocation is also possible. Any on-sale retail licensee who solicits a wholesaler to purchase advertising space may face misdemeanor charges, including imprisonment or fines up to the value of the contract plus $10,000, and possible license revocation. The Legislature requires separation among manufacturing, wholesale, and retail interests in the alcohol industry to prevent dominance and excessive sales through aggressive marketing. Exceptions to tied interests are limited to prevent undermining the general prohibition. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution because any costs incurred by a local agency or school district would be due to the creation, elimination, or change in penalties for crimes or infractions."
