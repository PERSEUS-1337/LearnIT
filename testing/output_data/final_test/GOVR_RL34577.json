    "content": "President Obama signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, providing $106 billion in supplemental FY2009 funds for defense, intelligence activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, international affairs, and domestic purposes. The Department of Health and Human Services received $7.7 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness. On February 23, 2009, an omnibus FY2009 appropriations bill, H.R. 1105, was introduced by the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. The bill had divisions for nine regular appropriations measures and was passed by the House on February 25 and by the Senate on March 10. It was signed by the President on March 11, 2009, providing $155.0 billion in discretionary funding for the FY2009 L-HHS-ED appropriations. The President signed H.J.Res. 38 into law on March 6, 2009, extending temporary funding for government agencies to March 11, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided emergency supplemental appropriations, including $124.2 billion for discretionary L-HHS-ED programs. H.R. 1 was passed by the House on January 28, 2009, and the Senate on February 10, with the conference report agreed to on February 12. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2009, signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 30, 2008, included three regular appropriations acts for FY2009 and continued appropriations for the remaining nine acts. It also provided supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and recovery. The bill became P.L. 111-5 on February 17, 2009. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL34711. Interim FY2009 appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education were provided by Division A of P.L. 110-329, known as the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009. Most programs were funded through March 6, 2009, at the FY2008 rate of operations. LIHEAP received full-year funding of $5.1 billion. President Bush requested an additional $955 million for preparedness activities in HHS. The Senate proposed $155.7 billion in discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED. The House Committee on Appropriations met to discuss the draft bill for L-HHS-ED appropriations, adopting a manager's amendment that increased the discretionary total to $157.7 billion. President Bush initially requested $146.5 billion in discretionary funds for FY2009, which was later amended in August 2008. The legislative status of FY2009 L-HHS-ED appropriations is summarized in Table 1. The FY2009 L-HHS-ED appropriations data is based on House and Senate committee work in the 110th Congress, reflecting final passage of P.L. 111-8 and P.L. 111-5. The funding represents net funding for specific programs and activities within L-HHS-ED appropriations, excluding funding from other bills and entitlements funded outside the annual appropriations process. The FY2008 funding for L-HHS-ED programs was provided under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Several continuing resolutions and a supplemental appropriations act affected funding levels for some agencies. The FY2008 figures in this report include the June supplemental appropriations. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL30343 and CRS Report RL34451. President George W. Bush's FY2009 appropriations proposal for L-HHS-ED programs, submitted to Congress in February 2008 and amended in August 2008, is compared to the FY2008 enacted amounts. The report tracks legislative action and congressional response to the proposal, focusing on discretionary programs and not mandatory programs like Medicare or Social Security. The L-HHS-ED bill is a significant appropriations bill that provides discretionary and mandatory funds to federal departments and agencies, including the Social Security Administration. It is known for its controversial nature due to various related issues such as restrictions on federal funds for abortion and human embryonic stem cell research. This bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs. The Department of Defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs. It presents overview tables on funding, major changes proposed for L-HHS-ED, and related issues like 302(b) allocations. Details on individual L-HHS-ED departments and agencies are provided, including appropriations enacted for FY2008 and proposed/enacted for FY2009. Table 2 summarizes L-HHS-ED appropriations, including discretionary and mandatory funds, program-level discretionary appropriations, current-year level, and advance appropriations. The report discusses appropriations levels in a given bill, including current-year discretionary appropriations and advance funding for future years. It explains how current-year discretionary appropriations are measured against 302(b) allocation ceilings as the congressional appropriations process unfolds. Media reports and Administration comments typically focus on current-year discretionary totals rather than program levels in the bill. Advance appropriations are funds allocated for future years. Advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted. Scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations, monitored by the Congressional Budget Office. Program-level funding equals current year plus advances for future years minus advances from prior years. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills include both mandatory and discretionary funds. The Appropriations Committees control only the discretionary funds, while mandatory funding levels are modified through changes in authorizing legislation. Reconciliation legislation is used for changes in mandatory funding, not appropriations committees. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills allocate discretionary funds through reconciliation legislation, not annual appropriations bills. Discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED have increased from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to $160.1 billion in FY2009, a 25.9% growth. Adjusted for inflation, funds grew from $148.6 billion in FY2002 to $156.9 billion in FY2009. The annual appropriations act typically includes five titles for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments. The L-HHS-ED appropriations bills allocate discretionary funds through reconciliation legislation, not annual appropriations bills. Discretionary funds for L-HHS-ED have increased from $127.2 billion in FY2002 to $160.1 billion in FY2009, a 25.9% growth. The annual appropriations act typically includes five titles for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments. Title IV covers funding for 13 related agencies, the largest of which is the Social Security Administration. Occasionally, the act has one or more additional titles, which may be legislative (authorizing) language rather than appropriations provisions. In FY2009, the L-HHS-ED discretionary funding totaled $160.1 billion, with nine programs receiving over $3.0 billion each. These programs accounted for about 65% of all discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED budget. The total aggregate funding for this group increased from $96.0 billion in FY2008 to $104.9 billion in FY2009. President George signed the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 as Title VI. In FY2009, President George W. Bush requested $146.5 billion in discretionary appropriations, with an additional $955 million requested later. Issues raised during congressional consideration generally relate to funding changes and program support. The summary highlights changes of at least $100 million in FY2009 discretionary budget authority compared to FY2008. It's important to consider the relative impact of funding changes on different program sizes. The FY2009 budget request for L-HHS-ED included a $147.4 billion discretionary appropriations, a decrease of $1.2 billion from FY2008. The Department of Labor saw a decrease in funding for WIA programs, with reductions in Dislocated Worker Assistance, Adult Training grants, and Community Service Employment for Older Americans program. The FY2009 budget request for the Department of Labor proposed a $172 million reduction in funding, with cuts to Employment Service grants and an overall 10.7% decrease in discretionary appropriations compared to FY2008.

The FY2009 continuing resolution provided temporary funding for most ongoing L-HHS-ED activities from October 1, 2008, to March 11, 2009, due to the lack of regular appropriations. Funding levels were similar to FY2008, with limited new initiatives authorized. The FY2009 continuing resolution authorized temporary funding for ongoing activities from October 1, 2008, to March 6, 2009, with restrictions on new initiatives and spending levels to maintain existing program levels. Additional funding was allowed for entitlements and mandatory activities to continue benefits for eligible beneficiaries. The FY2009 continuing resolution provided temporary funding from October 1, 2008, to March 6, 2009, with restrictions on new initiatives. H.R. 2638 was passed by Congress and signed into law, extending provisions through P.L. 111-6. The budget authority for L-HHS-ED appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional process. The FY2009 budget resolution established a 302(a) discretionary budget allocation of $1,011.7 billion for the Appropriations Committees, with the possibility of an increase under certain conditions. Congress reached agreement on the resolution in early June 2008. The Senate Budget Committee increased its 302(a) allocation by $968 million to $1,012.7 billion for FY2008. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations establish 302(b) allocations, which must not exceed the 302(a) total. Any appropriations bill exceeding the ceiling is subject to a point of order. The 302(b) allocations can be adjusted as appropriations bills progress. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations determine 302(b) discretionary allocations for FY2009 L-HHS-ED appropriations. Advance appropriations allow funds enacted in one fiscal year to be used in a subsequent fiscal year for better planning. Advance appropriations are a contentious issue in budgeting as they avoid certain allocation ceilings for the current year but must be counted in the year they become available for obligation. In FY2002, there was a proposal to eliminate advance appropriations for federal discretionary programs, including L-HHS-ED programs, but it was rejected by Congress. The impact of advance appropriations on program administration can be seen in the Department of Education. The FY1999 and FY2000 annual L-HHS-ED appropriations bills saw significant increases in advance appropriations for discretionary programs, reaching $19.0 billion in FY2000. From FY2001 to FY2007, advance appropriations remained around $19.3 billion, except for $18.8 billion in FY2001 and $21.5 billion in FY2003. In FY2008, Congress increased the amount to $21.3 billion from President Bush's initial request of $18.9 billion. In FY2009, advance appropriations totaled $24.8 billion, accounting for 15.5% of the L-HHS-ED program-level discretionary total of $160.1 billion. In FY2009, advance appropriations for L-HHS-ED totaled $24.8 billion, representing 15.5% of the program-level discretionary total of $160.1 billion.

For FY2009, the Department of Labor (DOL) received $12.4 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $608 million (5.2%) over FY2008. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided an extra $4.8 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009. Total discretionary appropriations for DOL in FY2009 were $17.2 billion, a significant increase of $5.4 billion (45.9%) over FY2008. Mandatory DOL programs funded in P.L. 111-8 included the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund at $2.9 billion. The Department of Labor received $12.4 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009, with an additional $4.8 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was funded at $2.9 billion, along with other programs like Federal Unemployment Benefits, Advances to Trust Funds, and Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners. President George W. Bush's FY2009 budget request included changes in funding for various activities, such as reducing funding for Workforce Investment Act programs by $553 million. In FY2009, funding for various Department of Labor programs was reduced. WIA Dislocated Worker Assistance programs were cut by $241 million, WIA Adult Training grants by $150 million, and Community Service Employment for Older Americans by $172 million. The President proposed eliminating $703 million for Employment Service grants to states. Funding for State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations increased by $172 million. The FY2008 budget included an additional $110 million for operations, totaling $2.574 million. The President's request was $62 million above the total FY2008 funding. The request proposed $2.8 billion for new Career Advancement Accounts, funded by cuts to various programs. The House Appropriations Committee did not complete its markup of the draft bill, with recommended funding for DOL differing significantly from the President's budget request. The draft proposal funded various workforce programs above the Administration's request and FY2008 funding levels. Key increases included $281 million for WIA Dislocated Worker Assistance, $153 million for Job Corps, $150 million for WIA Adult Training grants, $222 million for Community Service Employment for Older Americans, and $703 million for Employment Service grants to states.

HHS agencies have developed implementation plans for spending the money, available at http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/reports/index.html. The \"Hyde Amendments\" restrict federal funds for abortions under L-HHS-ED appropriations, including Medicaid. Funding for abortions was limited to cases of endangerment until the 103rd Congress allowed for rape or incest cases. The FY1998 and FY1999 L-HHS-ED appropriations extended these restrictions to prohibit federal funds for managed care packages with abortion coverage, except in specific circumstances. The Weldon Amendment, added in FY2005, prevents discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. The amendment, along with the Hyde restrictions, has been retained in subsequent L-HHS-ED appropriations. The current provisions can be found in \u00a7507 and \u00a7508 of P.L. 111-8, Division F. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL33467, Abortion: Legislative Response. President George W. Bush allowed federal funding for existing stem cell lines in 2001, but President Barack Obama reversed this in 2009, allowing NIH to issue new guidelines for embryonic stem cell research. Since FY1997, Congress has prohibited NIH from using funds for creating human embryos for research or research involving their destruction.

The Department has established an ARRA website for detailed guidance. There has been ongoing discussion about the appropriations \"promised\" compared to actual funding levels for education programs like ESEA. Some argue that authorized levels are necessary for implementing new requirements. Some argue that authorized funding levels for education programs like ESEA may not align with actual appropriations, leading to a shortfall of billions of dollars. Authorized levels are seen as maximum amounts, with actual funding determined during annual appropriations. Historically, programs with specified authorization levels have been funded below the specified amount. Five ESEA programs had specific authorization levels for FY2002-FY2007. For FY2007, the authorization for five education programs, including ESEA, was $28.9 billion, but only $14.4 billion was appropriated. ESEA programs were extended through FY2008 with the same authorization levels as FY2007. For FY2008, the aggregate authorization for five programs was $28.9 billion, with funding at $15.7 billion, $13.1 billion less than authorized. The GEPA extension applied for one year only. For FY2009, funding for ESEA programs is assumed to be based on implicit authorizations from appropriations, continuing policies from the explicit authorization period. The authorization levels for five ESEA programs in FY2007 remained the same in FY2009, totaling $28.9 billion. The IDEA Special Education Part B Grants to States program has never reached the 40% authorized level for state payments. In FY2008, $10.9 billion was appropriated out of the $19.2 billion authorized, and in FY2009, $11.5 billion was appropriated out of the $21.5 billion authorized. In FY2009, $11.5 billion was appropriated out of the authorized amount of $21.5 billion, creating a $10.0 billion shortfall. Most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill, with funding flexibility for some programs. Forward funding in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill allows appropriations to be available for 15 months, from July 1 of the appropriation year to the end of the following fiscal year. This funding method provides additional time for school officials to plan budgets in advance. For Pell Grants, program costs for individual students cannot be predicted accurately, as appropriations from one fiscal year support grants for the following academic year. The FY2009 appropriations primarily support Pell Grants for the 2009-2010 academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, Pell Grant funds are available for two fiscal years. Advance appropriations are provided for a fiscal year beyond the enacted year, allowing funds to become available later. If the forward funding date for Pell Grants is postponed by three months, the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation. The FY2009 budget request included forward funding and advance appropriations for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs. The impact of these changes in funding provisions is mainly a three-month delay in the availability of funds, with little effect on program expenditures for a standard school year. At the appropriations level, there is no difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period available for obligation. The shift from forward funding to advance appropriations for a program results in a one-time change in the scoring of discretionary appropriations, as per federal budget scorekeeping rules. The curr_chunk discusses various care and education programs, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Federal Pell Grant Program, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the No Child Left Behind Act. It also mentions reports on funding trends and implementation status. The Department of Education's appropriations details for FY2008 and FY2009 show increases in discretionary funding requested by the George W. Bush Administration and recommended by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. P.L. 111-8 provided $12.7 billion for FY2009, representing a 6.6% increase over the previous year. Total discretionary appropriations for Related Agencies for FY2009 were $14.0 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion (16.7%) over FY2008. Mandatory programs for Related Agencies included in the L-HHS-ED bill are funded at $42.7 billion for FY2009, mainly for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. The National Commission on Libraries and Information Science was disbanded in FY2008, with its functions transferred to the Institute of Museum and Library Services. President George W. Bush's FY2009 budget request included changes in discretionary spending for various agencies. The President's FY2009 budget proposed changes in discretionary spending for various agencies, including reducing advance funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and increasing funding for SSA administrative expenses. The House Appropriations Committee did not complete its markup of the draft L-HHS-ED bill, with recommended funding for Related Agencies differing from the President's budget request by at least $100 million. The draft House bill provided $430 million in two-year advance funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $430 million above the President's request. It also increased funding for SSA administrative expenses by $100 million. The Senate committee recommendation for discretionary spending for Related Agencies was $53 million less than the House draft recommendation. In FY2008, P.L. 111-8 increased funding for SSA administrative expenses by $709 million to $10.5 billion. ARRA provided $1.2 billion for Related Agencies, with $1.0 billion going to the Social Security Administration for various purposes including upgrading the National Computer Center and processing disability and retirement claims. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $65 million for the AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America program and $40 million for the National Service Trust. These funds were available for two years until the end of FY2010. Both the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) have developed plans for spending the money. More information can be found at http://www.ssa.gov/recovery and http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/recovery/index.asp.

The budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by Congress, outlining the budget for at least five fiscal years. Discretionary spending is provided in annual appropriations acts, while entitlement authority represents a legally binding obligation for the federal government. Entitlement authority funded by annual or permanent appropriations acts includes mandatory spending like the Food Stamp program. Rescission cancels previously enacted budget authority, while scorekeeping tracks congressional budget actions. Supplemental appropriations provide funds in addition to regular appropriations.
