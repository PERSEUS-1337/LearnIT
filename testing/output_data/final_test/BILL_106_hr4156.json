The Congress finds that the area in and around Wheeling, West Virginia, possesses important historical, cultural, and natural resources, representing major heritage themes of transportation, commerce, industry, and Victorian culture in the United States. Wheeling played a significant role in the settlement of the country as the western terminus of the National Road, the \"Crossroads of America,\" a major inland port, and the site for the establishment of the Restored State of Virginia and later the State of West Virginia during the Civil War. The city of Wheeling in West Virginia has a rich historical and industrial heritage, playing a key role in the nation's development through industries like iron, steel, textiles, boat building, and tobacco manufacturing. It has preserved its national heritage with landmarks like Independence Hall and the historic suspension bridge, along with multiple historic districts and listed properties. In 1992, a comprehensive plan was completed for the development and administration of the Wheeling National Heritage Area, including an inventory of natural and cultural resources, and criteria for preserving significant resources.
