EXPERT REPORTS REQUIRED TO BE SERVED IN CIVIL ACTIONS. In civil actions seeking damages against a health care practitioner for injury or death, a qualified expert report must be served within 120 days of filing the pleading. The report includes the expert's curriculum vitae and their opinion on the standard of care, how the practitioner failed to meet it, and the causal relationship between the failure. In civil actions, a qualified expert report must be served within 120 days, including the expert's opinion on the standard of care and the causal relationship between failure and injury or death.

The expert report cannot be used as evidence, in discovery, or at trial, with violations resulting in consequences. If paragraph (1) of the expert report rule is violated, the court may impose sanctions on the party at fault. If the violating party is the one who served the report, paragraph (1) will no longer apply to any party.

In a civil action for health care-related injury or death, a health care practitioner or institution can offer a qualified settlement to the injured party. The offer must be in writing, specify it is made under this section, state the settlement terms, and include a deadline for acceptance. If the offer is not accepted, the injured party can then make a counteroffer. If the offeree of a qualified settlement offer does not accept the offer and later receives a judgment less favorable than the settlement terms, they are responsible for the offeror's litigation costs incurred after the offer deadline. Litigation costs include court fees, expert witness fees, and attorney fees. A judgment is significantly less favorable if damages sought are not met. If an offeree seeking damages receives less than 80% of the settlement value at trial, they must pay the offeror's post-deadline litigation costs. If an offeree facing damages is awarded more than 120% of the settlement value at trial, the offeror must cover the offeree's litigation costs. SEC. 14. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; STATUTE OF REPOSE.

SEC. 15. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR GOOD SAMARITANS PROVIDING EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE.
