The \"Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act of 2014\" requires agencies to certify to Congress that new Federal PII websites are fully functional and secure before deployment to the public. If certification is not submitted within 90 days of enactment, the website must be made inaccessible to the public. The \"Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act of 2014\" mandates that new Federal PII websites must be certified as fully functional and secure before being accessible to the public. An exception is made for beta websites in development or testing phases, where public access to PII-related portions requires a risk acknowledgment agreement. This section does not apply to websites operated independently by entities like states or localities, regardless of federal funding. The \"Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act of 2014\" requires new Federal PII websites to be fully functional and secure. The act defines terms like \"agency\" and \"fully functional\" to ensure proper handling of personally identifiable information. The \"Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act of 2014\" mandates new Federal PII websites to be operational, collecting personally identifiable information from the public, and accessible after October 1, 2012. The term \"personally identifiable information\" (PII) refers to any information that can identify an individual, including names, social security numbers, biometric records, and other linked data like medical or financial information. The \"responsible agency\" for a new Federal PII website is the agency in charge of its operation. The term \"secure\" for a new Federal PII website means compliance with specific requirements under title 44, minimizing domain name confusion, and capturing personally identifiable information at the latest step in a user input sequence. The responsible agency for a Federal PII website must ensure personnel have completed necessary forms and signed non-disclosure agreements. They must also have sufficient personnel to address website issues promptly and monitor security threats. The term \"State\" refers to each State of the United States, the District of Columbia, territories, possessions, and federally recognized Indian tribes. SEC. 3. PRIVACY BREACH REQUIREMENTS. The Privacy breach requirements under the Information Security Amendment mandate agencies to establish policies for handling breaches involving personally identifiable information, including notifying affected individuals within 72 hours and reporting to a designated Federal cybersecurity center. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may require agencies to take additional actions in response to information security breaches, such as data breach analysis and identity theft insurance. Agency heads must ensure compliance with established policies for handling breaches involving personally identifiable information. The Director must report to Congress annually on agency compliance with these policies. The term 'Federal cybersecurity center' includes various entities such as the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center, the Intelligence Community Incident Response Center, and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, among others. The table of sections for subchapter III of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding a technical and conforming amendment. Privacy breach requirements were passed by the House of Representatives on July 28, 2014. Karen L. Haas, the Clerk, attested to this."
