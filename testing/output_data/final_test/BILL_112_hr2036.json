    "content": "The Act titled \"American Alternative Fuels Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to alternative fuels. Congress finds that the United States needs policies to eliminate reliance on foreign energy sources, create jobs, and utilize all domestic energy resources including fossil fuels, alternative resources, and renewables to promote energy security and sustainability, decrease national security risks, and lower energy prices. The United States aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources, promote energy security, decrease national security risks, and create jobs by utilizing domestic energy resources, including fossil fuels, alternative resources, and renewables. This will lower energy prices, reduce trade deficits, and boost the economy. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is repealed, along with a related amendment in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. Additionally, transparency is required for delayed loan guarantee applications. Section 1702 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a reporting requirement if the Secretary fails to make a final decision within 270 days after selecting an application for a loan guarantee. Status reports must be prepared every 90 days thereafter and submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires status reports every 90 days to the Senate and House committees if the Secretary delays a loan guarantee application review. The report must include reasons for the delay, the reviewing official, and a completion schedule. SEC. 5. ALGAE-BASED FUEL INCENTIVES. This section amends the Clean Air Act to provide incentives for algae-based fuel production by considering each gallon of renewable biomass produced from algae as equal to 3 gallons of renewable fuel if produced using captured carbon dioxide. SEC. 6. LOAN GUARANTEES. This section addresses loan guarantees. SEC. 6 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include loan guarantees for substitute natural gas production facilities that capture at least 90% of carbon. SEC. 7 authorizes multiyear contracts for the Department of Defense to procure alternative fuels. The head of an agency can enter into contracts for up to 20 years to purchase alternative fuels, with provisions requiring specific appropriations for each fiscal year covered by the contract. This commitment does not constitute an obligation of the United States. The United States Code is amended by adding a new section to chapter 141 of title 10. The Secretary of Defense must issue regulations within 120 days of this Act's enactment for agencies to enter into multiyear contracts for alternative fuels. The agency head must ensure funding will be available, technical risks are reasonable, and pricing is appropriate for the contract. The Secretary of Defense must issue regulations for agencies to enter into multiyear contracts for alternative fuels. Contracts must have appropriate pricing mechanisms and cannot be used to finance new fuel production facilities for the Federal Government. No contract can be entered into until the required regulations are issued. SEC. 8. ELECTRIC VEHICLE IMPACT ON ELECTRICITY DEMAND. Section 169(3) of the Clean Air Act is amended to define \"best available control technology\" and set emission limitations. Additional considerations are added for establishing this technology. The Clean Air Act is amended to consider emissions reductions from increased electric vehicle use when establishing best available control technology for major emitting facilities."
