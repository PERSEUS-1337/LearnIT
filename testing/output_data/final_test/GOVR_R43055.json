    "content": "The government's right to terminate contracts for convenience is based on the terms of its contracts, as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This regulation requires agencies to include standard clauses granting the government the right to terminate contracts for its convenience, with specific language varying based on the contract type and value. The government has the right to terminate contracts for convenience, as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The clauses specify the form and content of the government's notice to the contractor, obligations upon receipt of the notice, disposal of termination inventory, settlement procedures, and record retention. Even without explicit contract provisions, the government can still terminate for convenience. The Supreme Court established the government's right to terminate contracts for convenience, citing it as an inherent right. This was exemplified in a case where the Navy suspended a contract post-Civil War, offering reduced compensation for partial performance, which the contractor disputed. The Court ruled in favor of the government, stating that termination is a necessary aspect of its contracting authority. The Supreme Court affirmed the government's right to terminate contracts for convenience, emphasizing the public interest and the government's authority to modify or suspend contracts for unforeseen circumstances. This right was upheld in various cases, including one post-World War I where the Court implied that the government's termination right was a term of any contract with the government. The U.S. Court of Claims found that termination clauses should be included in federal procurement contracts, viewing termination for convenience as a key public procurement policy. Contractors are entitled to some recovery when contracts are terminated for convenience, with profit limited to work completed. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses prescribe standard Termination for Convenience provisions. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses state that a termination for convenience is based on the \"Government's interest,\" which includes various reasons such as no longer needing supplies/services, contractor refusal of contract modification, questions about contract performance, contractor eligibility issues, deteriorated business relationship, or agency restructuring. Terminations for convenience by the government are typically based on various reasons such as no longer needing supplies/services, contractor refusal of contract modification, questions about contract performance, contractor eligibility issues, deteriorated business relationship, agency restructuring, or to avoid conflicts/disputes. In rare cases, improper terminations could lead to government liability for breach. The government has a duty to consider its own best interests when terminating contracts for convenience. Different types of terminations are discussed, including total and partial terminations, constructive terminations, terminations for default, and other reductions in work performed under a contract. Total termination involves all remaining work, while partial termination involves only some of the remaining work. When a contract is terminated, the contractor may be entitled to a termination settlement covering costs of work already performed and certain incurred costs. In the case of partial termination, the contractor may receive an equitable adjustment for additional money and/or time to complete the remaining work. This adjustment may seem counter-intuitive, but it aims to compensate for the reduced overall contract price due to deleted work. The government can delete work from a contract, potentially leading to increased costs for the contractor. In such cases, the contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment. Agencies can use a Changes clause to delete work within the contract's scope. Written notice is required for termination for convenience. The termination notice for convenience includes the effective date, extent, and steps for minimizing impact on personnel. It directs the contractor to cease work, notify subcontractors, and settle subcontracts. Constructive termination can occur without a formal notice. The concept of \"constructive termination\" is a judge-made doctrine that retroactively justifies an actual breach by the government. It is used to avoid finding breach when the government stops or curtails a contractor's performance for questionable reasons. Constructive termination for convenience is commonly seen when an improper termination for default is converted into a constructive termination for convenience. The government can terminate a contract for default if the contractor fails to deliver supplies or perform services on time, make progress, or fulfill other obligations. Termination for default is based on the contractor's failure to perform as required, unlike termination for convenience which is based on the government's interests. If the government terminates a contract for default, and later it is found that the termination was improper, it will be treated as a constructive termination for convenience. In such cases, the government may only be liable for a termination settlement, not damages for breach. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) distinguishes between termination and cancellation in government contracts. Termination can be done at any time during the contract's life, while cancellation is for the total requirements of all remaining program years. Termination can be for total or partial quantity, whereas cancellation must be for all subsequent fiscal years' quantities. When a multiyear contract is canceled, the contractor is generally paid a \"cancellation charge\" which covers costs incurred for performance of the contract and a reasonable profit or fee on those costs. The cancellation charges in a multiyear contract cannot exceed the \"cancellation ceiling\" specified in the contract, representing the maximum amount the contractor may recover. Termination for convenience should not be confused with \"de-scoping\" or other actions that could reduce the work originally contemplated. Federal procurement contracts often include a Changes clause allowing the government to make changes within the general scope. The government can make changes within the general scope of a contract, including specifications, method of work, government-furnished property, shipping method, delivery location, and performance time. The contracting officer can de-scope work or terminate it for convenience. Terminations differ from not exercising options or ordering the minimum quantity in an ID/IQ contract. In ID/IQ contracts, the contractor may not obtain expected work if the government decides not to exercise options or make purchases beyond the minimum. Unlike terminations for convenience, the contractor has no legal entitlement to work not performed by the government. When the government terminates a contract for convenience, the contractor may be entitled to a termination settlement. This section discusses the government's potential liability in such cases and how termination settlements are typically determined. The government may face liability for breach when exercising its right to terminate for convenience, and is usually required to pay the contractor for certain costs as outlined in the contract. A termination settlement, also known as a \"termination settlement,\" is a payment included in contracts when the government terminates for convenience. The contractor must submit a final termination settlement proposal within a specified time frame, which forms the basis for agreement on the amount to be paid. If no agreement is reached, the contracting officer may determine the amount due to the contractor. If the contractor and contracting officer cannot agree on the final payment amount, the contracting officer can make a determination based on specified factors in the contract. This decision is final and can be appealed through the contract's Disputes clause if the contractor submitted a termination settlement proposal on time. Any settlement agreement modifies the contract and is binding. Federal procurement contracts include Termination for Convenience clauses that outline settlement components for claims from termination. Termination settlement includes payment for work done, costs incurred, and profit recovery. Fixed-price contracts have predetermined prices, while cost-reimbursement contracts reimburse allowable costs. Termination can convert fixed-price contracts into cost-reimbursement contracts. The application of Part 31 of the FAR governs all costs claimed under Termination for Convenience clauses, with the purpose of fairly compensating the contractor. Allowable costs in termination settlements include common items and costs continuing after termination. Costs continuing after termination include initial costs, preparatory costs, loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment, and rental under unexpired leases. The contractor must make all reasonable efforts to minimize these costs. The contractor must make \"all reasonable efforts\" to terminate or reduce the cost of the lease, including alterations and restorations necessary for the contract, settlement expenses, storage and transportation costs, indirect costs related to salary and wages, and subcontractor claims. The termination settlement allows for compensation of indirect expenses that are reasonably proportionate to benefits received and consistent with FAR regulations. The settlement amount varies based on termination timing and incurred costs, potentially reaching billions of dollars. Settlement costs cannot exceed the contract price minus payments made or to be made. The termination settlement allows for compensation of indirect expenses reasonably proportionate to benefits received and consistent with FAR regulations. Settlement costs cannot exceed the contract price minus payments made or to be made. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that potential termination costs are generally not so large as to justify continued performance of contracts. Agencies must reserve funds for termination liability, affecting financial management practices. The termination settlement may be limited by contract clauses like the Special Termination Cost clause in certain Department of Defense Contracts. The government is generally not liable for breach when terminating a contract for convenience, unless bad faith or abuse of discretion is proven. Proving bad faith is challenging and limits potential liability cases. The government is presumed to perform its duties correctly and in good faith, but breach can occur when terminating a contract for convenience. Courts have found breach when the government enters a contract with the intent to terminate it or terminates after the contract expires to avoid liability. This reflects common law principles, with courts describing undisclosed termination intent as a \"mockery\" of contract assent. The government's undisclosed intent to terminate a contract is seen as a breach of contract, with courts emphasizing that termination for convenience cannot be used to avoid liability. The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating funds beyond what is appropriated by law when entering into contracts. In government contracts, agencies must have funds to cover contract costs and potential termination liabilities. For single-year fixed-price contracts, the contractor's recovery cannot exceed the contract price. Renewal options may require agencies to pay termination charges to contractors for initial outlays. The government may be required to pay a termination charge if a renewal option is not exercised in multiyear contracts. The Anti-Deficiency Act mandates agencies to have funds for termination costs before entering such contracts. Multiyear contracts, authorized under FASA, can last up to five years and require setting aside termination costs. FASA mandates that civilian agencies must set aside funds for termination costs in multiyear contracts, either for the full contract term or for the first year plus estimated termination costs. Exceptions exist, where Congress has allowed agencies to skip setting aside termination funds for specific programs. Congress has allocated funds for termination costs in multiyear contracts, with exceptions for specific programs. Additional funds may be designated for termination liability, and Congress may set ceilings on the amount that agencies can negotiate with contractors."
