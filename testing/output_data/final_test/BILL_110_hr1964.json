    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom of Choice Act\". The \"Freedom of Choice Act\" acknowledges that the United States was founded on principles of liberty, personal privacy, and equality, allowing individuals to make intimate decisions without interference. It recognizes that reproductive health decisions should be made by women in consultation with loved ones and healthcare providers, as affirmed by Supreme Court cases like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. The Roe v. Wade decision balances women's rights to make reproductive decisions with the State's interest in potential life. It protects a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy before fetal viability, with restrictions after viability. This has safeguarded women's health and lives in the US, preventing the need for unsafe illegal abortions. Before Roe v. Wade, many women resorted to illegal abortions, risking unsanitary conditions, incompetent treatment, infection, hemorrhage, disfiguration, and death. Thousands of women died annually in the US due to illegal abortions. In countries where abortion is illegal, the risk of maternal mortality is high, with approximately 80,000 deaths associated with unsafe abortions annually. The Roe v. Wade decision also expanded women's opportunities to participate equally in society. The Roe v. Wade decision has allowed women to control their reproductive lives, but there are increasing threats to reproductive health and freedom. South Dakota enacted a ban on abortion, with other states considering similar bans. The Supreme Court upheld a Federal ban on abortion without exceptions for a woman's health. The Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America allows the government to restrict a woman's right to choose abortion, overturning protections for women's health established in Roe v. Wade. Justice Ginsburg criticized the majority's opinion for lacking exceptions safeguarding women's health, calling it an alarming effort to undermine a long-standing right. Legal and practical barriers to reproductive services pose risks to women's health and lives. Reproductive services are endangered by incremental restrictions on abortion rights, making access to care difficult. 87% of US counties lack abortion providers. Women need better access to family planning services to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. Federal legislation is needed to protect Roe v. Wade. Congress has the power to enact legislation to create statutory rights in national concerns, including protecting a woman's right to choose abortion under interstate commerce and equal protection laws. Reproductive health clinics, as commercial actors, purchase supplies from out-of-state suppliers and employ personnel who travel across state lines to provide services to patients. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"government\" as including entities at various levels, \"State\" as encompassing states and territories, and \"viability\" as the stage of pregnancy when the fetus can survive outside the woman. SEC. 4. INTERFERENCE WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROHIBITED. The United States policy affirms every woman's right to choose to bear a child, terminate a pregnancy before or after fetal viability for health reasons. Governments are prohibited from interfering with these rights or discriminating against them. Individuals can take civil action for violations. An individual aggrieved by a violation of the United States policy on abortion rights may seek relief in a civil action. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. RETROACTIVE EFFECT. This Act applies to all statutes, regulations, and actions before or after its enactment."
