    "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has shifted Russian national security policy towards more cooperation with the United States and the West, especially after the September 11 attacks. This shift led to political and military cooperation with the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan, closing of Russia's electronic intelligence base in Cuba, and softening of Russia's stance towards the West. The report will analyze the implications of Russia's shift in national security policy towards cooperation with the U.S. and the West, including the softening of positions on NATO enlargement, the ABM Treaty, missile defense, and nuclear force reductions. It will also assess Putin's motives for the policy change and the Bush Administration's response, as well as congressional interests in influencing U.S. policy towards Russia. President Putin is currently the dominant figure in Russian politics with no credible rivals. President Putin, currently the dominant figure in Russian politics, has maintained high approval ratings for over two years. Initially seen as a political lap dog for Yeltsin, Putin's tough stance on Chechnya quickly boosted his popularity and power. Yeltsin resigned in December 1999, six months after Putin became premier. Putin succeeded Yeltsin as President in 2000 after Yeltsin's abrupt resignation. Putin continued Yeltsin's national security policy initially shaped by Yevgeny Primakov, who advocated for a multi-polar world order with Russia at the forefront opposing U.S. global domination. In December 1998, Primakov called for a Russia-China-India alliance to oppose U.S. \"global hegemonism\" and advocated for a Eurasian-based strategy of coalition politics to diminish U.S. influence worldwide. Putin initially followed Primakov's national security policy but started moving away from it by mid-2001, before September 11. After September 11, Putin shifted Russia's direction away from Primakov's vision. The initial meetings between Presidents Bush and Putin emphasized personal rapport over political substance, with Bush praising Putin's trustworthiness and Putin reciprocating the sentiment. It is unclear if the softening of Russian policy towards the US was influenced by their personal chemistry. Before September 11, Putin softened Russia's opposition to U.S. missile defense plans and NATO enlargement. The events of September 11 marked a turning point in U.S.-Russian relations, leading to a shift in Putin's approach towards moderating outcomes rather than fighting against inevitable changes. After the September 11 attacks, Russian cooperation was seen as crucial for the United States to take action against Al Qaeda and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Initially, it was expected that Putin would take a tough stance and extract concessions from the U.S. However, Putin chose to seize the opportunity to transform U.S.-Russian relations instead, moving Russia closer. Putin saw the opportunity after September 11 to change the focus of U.S.-Russian relations towards cooperation against international terrorism, shifting away from negative issues like missile defense and NATO enlargement. Putin had been trying to interest Washington in joint action against terrorism since late 1999, but previous administrations were not receptive due to concerns about Putin's military campaign in Chechnya. Putin, in response to the September 11 attacks, was the first world leader to speak to Bush and ordered the immediate cancellation of military exercises, including long-range bomber flights and naval units, to avoid false alarms. Putin, in response to the September 11 attacks, canceled military exercises, including long-range bomber flights and naval units. Putin compared the attacks to Nazi atrocities, hinting at a possible shift in Russian policy towards strategic cooperation with the United States. Despite initial resistance from Russian officials, Putin intervened to allow U.S. military deployments in Central Asia. Putin allowed U.S. military deployments in Central Asia despite initial resistance from Russian officials. U.S. Air Force and Special Forces units began flying to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan on September 19. There were conflicting reports on Moscow's role in the deployments, with some saying Russia tried to prevent Central Asian leaders from offering military bases to the U.S. Ultimately, Russia could not stop sovereign states in Central Asia from hosting U.S. forces, especially in Uzbekistan. Russian influence in Tajikistan is strong, with U.S. deployments made possible despite potential objections from Moscow. Putin offered assistance in the campaign against the Taliban, viewing them as a threat to Russian security due to their promotion of radical Islam in Central Asia. This posed a direct threat to secular regimes in the region and could potentially destabilize Russia's own Muslim population. Russian support for the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan included covert and open assistance to the Northern Alliance, supplying heavy weapons and skilled personnel. This support aimed to counter the Taliban insurgency and eliminate a security threat on Russia's vulnerable southern flank. Russian specialists, including tank commanders, artillery officers, and pilots, were crucial in the rapid defeat of the Taliban in the North in October-November 2001. Despite initial hopes for a breakthrough in negotiations on missile defense and strategic force reductions, the November summit between Bush and Putin yielded few major results. The November summit between Bush and Putin yielded few major results. Three weeks later, Bush announced the US would withdraw from the ABM Treaty, with Putin expressing regret but insisting it would not destabilize bilateral relations. Putin eventually yielded on strategic nuclear issues, signing the Treaty of Moscow on May 24, 2002. Putin announced the closure of Russia's electronic intelligence base at Lourdes, Cuba, in 2001. This facility provided a significant amount of Russia's electronic intelligence data on the United States. The decision to close it was seen as a strategic move towards cooperation with the United States and the West. In August 2000, Russia announced a unilateral reduction of its strategic nuclear forces from 6,000 deployed warheads to 1,500. This was followed by plans to reduce military manpower and transition to a professional army. Defense spending was cut in the 1990s but improved after 1999. The Russian government's fiscal situation improved after 1999, with increased defense spending mostly going towards military salaries. Putin's presidency saw a shift in military exercises from anti-NATO to a more moderate stance. Putin also made personnel changes in the military high command to remove advocates of anti-western policies. The sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk in 2000 highlighted changes in Russian defense policy. The Russian government released an official report that a faulty torpedo caused the sinking of the Kursk submarine in 2000. Putin made significant personnel changes in the military high command following the incident, emphasizing the need for military reform and modernization. After the Kursk incident, Putin began making changes in military leadership, signaling a shift towards cooperation with the West. A Polish analyst questioned Russia's intentions but noted that participation in anti-terror efforts could show readiness for partnership. Putin's actions suggest a reorientation towards integration with the West, prompting speculation on his motivations as a former KGB agent. Putin's change of course towards integration with the West is driven by Russia's vital interests and economic reconstruction priorities, rather than cultural or ideological affinity. Putin has emphasized the urgent need to reverse the catastrophic economic collapse of the 1990s to ensure Russia's strength and dignity. Putin's primary goal for Russia is to transition to a functioning market economy with a growing GDP to ensure rising living standards and a strong central state. He emphasizes economic integration with the West for Russia's reconstruction and vitalization, as stated in his April 2002 State of the Nation address. Putin emphasized the need for a benign international environment for Russia to actively work with the European Union in creating a single economic space. This integration with the West is crucial for Russia's economic objectives, as highlighted in a conference with Foreign Ministry officials in July 2002. Putin aimed to establish new principles for Russian national security policy to support its economic goals. Putin emphasized the importance of positive economic development for Russia's future in international relations. He highlighted the need for a confident partnership between Russia and the U.S.A. to influence the global system positively. General Vasily Lata emphasized that economic policy dictates all aspects of international relations under Putin's leadership. Putin's drive for economic integration with the West, influenced by his background as an intelligence officer in Germany, led to his shift in Russian national security policy towards cooperation with the West. He believed that Primakov's strategy of maintaining Russia's status as a great power was futile against the overwhelming economic, political, and military power of the U.S. Putin's focus on adjusting foreign and defense policies to Russia's limited capabilities reflected his realization that Primakov's approach was unsustainable. Putin may have had doubts about Primakov's reliance on China as a key partner compared to the United States. Both Russia and China shared common interests such as opposition to U.S. interference in internal affairs, radical Islam in Central Asia, and economic dominance of industrial democracies. They also felt threatened by U.S. missile defense plans and military intervention in conflicts without international approval. In the late 1990s, Russo-Chinese condemnations of \"global hegemonism\" hinted at a possible alliance against the United States. While some Russian nationalists saw China as a short-term opportunity to counterbalance U.S. dominance, others viewed China as a long-term threat due to Russian decline and Chinese ascendance. Concerns about China as a future neighbor also played a role, considering Russia's vast territory and declining population. Russia's population in 1991 was 149 million, and today it stands at 144 million, experiencing a rapid decline despite in-migration of ethnic Russians. Putin acknowledges the demographic crisis as a major issue, with projections for the population in 2050 ranging from 77 million to 126 million. The Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia have a population of only 6 million, shrinking faster than the general population as Russians move back towards the European heartland. Russia's population is declining rapidly, with the Russian Far East and Eastern Siberia shrinking faster than the general population as Russians migrate back towards the European heartland. In contrast, China's population is growing and faces scarcity of land and resources. The two countries have resolved most territorial issues along their border and have mutually beneficial trade relations. Russia and China have important trade relations and both parties want to maintain friendly relations for domestic development. Russian concerns about China becoming a superpower with sustained economic growth are present, but there are differing opinions on China's future economic growth. Russia is also worried about potential instability in China leading to uncontrolled population movement towards Russia's eastern regions. The prospect of China turning to patriotic nationalism could revive territorial claims against Russia, causing concern for Moscow. Some analysts suggest that Russia may need to turn to the United States and NATO for security against China, as Putin moved away from relying on China against the United States. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian national security policy was initially pro-American. Yeltsin's initially pro-American national security policy shifted in the mid-1990s due to economic challenges, political opposition, and rising Russian nationalism. This led to strained U.S.-Russian relations and the appointment of Primakov as Foreign Minister. Putin's new national security policy is now being closely watched for similarities to Yeltsin's approach. Putin's new national security policy, similar to Yeltsin's approach, is seen as lacking solid domestic political support. It is considered a one-man show with Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov being the only senior leader fully embracing it. Despite opposition from senior military leaders, the Foreign Ministry bureaucracy, and political elites, some specialists believe that cooperation with the United States is necessary for economic modernization. Putin personally makes key decisions, indicating a centralized decision-making process. Putin's political strength and popularity are unquestionable, with public approval ratings over 70%. He came to power during an economic upturn after the Yeltsin regime's failed transition to a market system. Despite uncertainty about political support for his integration policy with the West, Putin remains the dominant figure in Russian politics. After the 1998 financial crisis, Russia experienced a mini economic boom from 1999 to 2001 due to a devalued ruble and higher oil prices. Putin gained political credit for the improving economy and used this opportunity to implement ambitious reform strategies, including domestic economic reform, integration into the global economy, and strategic partnership with the United States and the West. Despite some public opposition to his pro-western policy, Putin's popularity and political effectiveness remained strong. He extended government control over media, reduced the power of business oligarchs, and maintained support in the Duma. Putin has strong support in the Duma and there is no effective parliamentary opposition to his policies. The Russian Constitution concentrates power in the President's hands, making Russia a \"super-presidential\" republic with no significant political opposition. There is no significant political opposition in Russia due to Putin's strong support in the Duma and the concentration of power in the President's hands. Concerns about lack of support for Putin's pro-western policy are raised, with warnings of potential bureaucratic obstacles. Putin's shift in national security policy in 2001 was seen as a response to the September 11 attacks, aiming to align Russia with US-led anti-terrorist operations and garner support for Russia's campaign in Chechnya. Putin's policy in Chechnya has evolved into a strategic reorientation of Russian policy, driven by Putin's assessment of Russian national interests. Despite declaring Russia's economic future tied to integration with the West, Putin's numerous changes in position towards the US are seen as too high a price to pay for short-term tactical objectives. The concessions made to Washington may be difficult to reverse, indicating a shift in Russia's strategic relationship. The shift in Russia's strategic relationship with China under Putin's leadership has displeased Beijing, as Moscow has turned towards integration with the West. This marks the third instance in five years where Russia has \"surrendered\" to Western policies, following similar instances with NATO expansion and concessions to the US. The second perceived \"surrender\" by Russia was during the NATO military intervention in Yugoslavia, where Moscow initially supported Serbia but eventually joined NATO pressure on Yugoslav President Milosevic. China supported Russia in this clash with the West, especially after the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The third \"surrender\" was Putin's post-September 11 concessions to the United States, which displeased China as Moscow abandoned its resistance to U.S. missile defense plans and the ABM Treaty. Putin's strategic cooperation with the United States post-September 11, including military deployments to Central Asia without consulting Beijing, may have strained Sino-Russian relations and undermined China's trust in Russia as a potential ally against U.S. influence. This could have led to Putin forfeiting the option of using the \"China card\" that Primakov had previously worked to establish. Putin's strategic cooperation with the United States post-September 11 may have strained Sino-Russian relations and undermined China's trust in Russia as a potential ally against U.S. influence. The economic revival that Putin seeks through integration with the West could eventually strengthen Russia to the point that it is able to revert to previous patterns of antipathy toward the West. Putin seems to acknowledge that cooperation with the West is a necessity for the near- and medium-term future. After September 11, the Administration's view of Russia shifted from seeing it as \"part of the problem\" to \"part of the solution\" in the war on terrorism. There are significant splits within the Administration on Russia policy, with Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld taking a harder line, while Secretary of State Powell is more willing to compromise. National Security Advisor Rice's position leans towards Cheney and Rumsfeld. Putin has shown willingness to acquiesce on many issues. Putin's willingness to compromise on various issues, including core interests, is seen as aligning with the Vice President and Defense Secretary's less conciliatory approach. The Bush Administration has utilized Russian cooperation in Afghanistan, with Pentagon praising Russia's contributions. Some Russian officials are concerned about the prolonged U.S. military presence in Central Asia, while Central Asian governments view it as crucial in countering radical Islam and balancing Russia and China's influence. Many Russians are wary of China's influence in the region and may welcome the United States as a counterweight. Criticisms were raised against the Georgia Train and Equip Program for potentially turning U.S. training and equipment against Russian interests. The U.S. military presence in Georgia under the Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP) is seen as a temporary mission to enhance Georgia's security capabilities against Chechen threats. The Bush Administration reduced criticism of Russian human rights abuses in Chechnya post-9/11 and pursued NATO enlargement, while also establishing a new NATO-Russia Council with Moscow's equal voice on certain issues. The Bush Administration's stance on core Alliance collective security issues and admitting new members remained unchanged after the inconclusive November 2001 summit. Despite Russian objections, the administration proceeded with withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and stood firm on strategic nuclear force reductions. The new Nuclear Posture Review continued to consider Russia a potential threat, but the administration focused on addressing Putin's top priority of Russian economic interests. The U.S. Department of Commerce certified Russia as a \"market economy\" in June 2002, benefiting bilateral trade and easing export burdens. Some critics faulted the delay in certification, suggesting it may signal a lack of urgency towards Russia's interests in Washington. Some argue that the deliberate pace of Commerce Department action towards Russia was a positive sign of treating the country like a \"normal country.\" Moscow complains about still being subject to the \"freedom-of-emigration\" requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, linked to granting Russia \"permanent normal trade relations\" status. Bush promised Putin to work with Congress to grant Russia PNTR status, with two bills introduced for this purpose. Critics believe the Bush Administration has not prioritized lifting the Jackson-Vanik amendment's application to Russia enough. President Bush has expressed a desire to increase U.S. trade and investment in Russia, but many Russian officials are disappointed with the current level. Under Putin's leadership, efforts have been made to create a more market-friendly climate for trade and investment, but more implementation of market reforms is needed, especially in areas like contract enforcement and protection of shareholders' rights. Foreign business interests are eager to see further progress in these areas. The shift in Russian national security policy and the Bush Administration's responses have implications for future U.S.-Russian relations. The new leadership aims to avoid dramatic swings in relations, as seen in the 1990s. At the Bush-Putin summit in May 2002, both leaders issued a Joint Statement on selected issues of congressional interest. At the Bush-Putin summit in May 2002, the two leaders issued a Joint Declaration on the New Strategic Relationship, focusing on cooperation and resolving differences with mutual respect. They established the Consultative Group for Strategic Security to maintain bilateral relations. The declaration also reflects Russia's recognition of U.S. geostrategic dominance. The Joint Declaration between Bush and Putin emphasized the importance of a benign security environment, political and economic freedoms, and international cooperation for the security and prosperity of both nations. Economic partnership between the US and Russia, particularly in sectors like energy and finance, could benefit Russia greatly. Putin's belief in the need for economic cooperation with the US may lead to increased cooperation on security issues. Russia may be more cooperative on security issues with the United States in the coming years. Putin has promoted U.S.-Russian cooperation against terrorism, which remains a key element in both countries' security agendas. Cooperation in Central Asia may continue as long as Russia does not feel threatened by the U.S. presence. Presidents Bush and Putin announced the U.S.-Russia Working Group at their May 2002 summit. At the May 2002 summit, Presidents Bush and Putin expanded the U.S.-Russia Working Group on Afghanistan to address counterterrorism, including nuclear, biological, and chemical threats. Moscow views Chechen rebels as terrorists, while Washington has reservations. The Bush Administration criticizes Yasser Arafat's ties to terrorism, a stance not fully supported by Moscow. Russian support for Iraq strained U.S.-Russian relations in the 1990s, but some Russian officials now suggest they may not oppose U.S. military action against Iraq. Recently, Moscow hinted that they might not object to U.S. military action in Iraq as long as it is not unilateral and Russian economic interests are respected. U.S.-Russian cooperation in preventing WMD proliferation includes safeguarding dangerous materials and technologies, with programs like the Nunn-Lugar Comprehensive Threat Reduction program likely to continue. The Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation Act of 2001 would authorize debt-for-nonproliferation exchanges. The Russian WMD proliferation issue involves reducing Soviet-era debt through debt-for-nonproliferation exchanges and implementing the \"10 plus 10 over 10\" plan to finance nonproliferation programs. Concerns also include Russian transfers of nuclear reactors and ballistic missile technology to states like Iran, a longstanding issue in U.S.-Russian relations. The United States has been unsuccessful in convincing Russia to stop its nuclear reactor construction program in Bushehr, Iran, and the covert transfers of missile technology to Iran. Moscow argues that the Bushehr project is legal and safe, while Washington believes it will be used for a clandestine nuclear weapons program. The issue of missile technology transfer is unclear, with different Russian authorities giving conflicting statements. The Bush administration and Russia have established a working group to address illicit transfers of dual-use technology to Iran. Russia plans to build five new nuclear reactors in Iran, including three at Bushehr and two at another site, despite previous speculation of limiting nuclear cooperation with Iran. The White House was infuriated by Russia's plan to build five new nuclear reactors in Iran, despite being told it was still a draft. A high-level U.S. delegation visited Moscow to urge Russia to cancel the deal. Reports of new Russian ties with Iraq and North Korea also drew attention, with Iraq and Russia planning a $40 billion economic cooperation agreement. The Russian plan to build five new nuclear reactors in Iran has been approved and is ready for signing, despite U.S. objections. Putin's support for the war on terrorism was emphasized by the White House, while Moscow's ties with North Korea and Iran are under scrutiny. Putin's cooperation with the U.S. may be tested by continued technology transfers to Iran. The United States views Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism and is committed to preventing them from acquiring nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. There are concerns about Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran affecting Congressional support for the Russian Debt for Nonproliferation Act. The Russian reactor construction program in Iran may have been drafted without Kremlin approval and could be a negotiating tactic to expand nuclear cooperation with Iran. The reported plan for Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran may be a ruse to ease U.S. pressure on the Bushehr project. The Russia-Iraq economic cooperation agreement could be a way for Baghdad to gain international support against a possible U.S. military attack. Moscow's deals with Iraq and Iran, along with an invitation to Kim Jong-il, may signal displeasure with current U.S. policy. The Bush Administration believes the Cold War is over and friendly states do not need arms control treaties. Some argue that Russia, despite being weak economically and politically, remains a nuclear superpower and maintaining arms control with Russia is crucial for U.S. security and nonproliferation efforts. Moscow has acceded to the U.S. position in the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. In the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, Moscow agreed with the U.S. on key issues, including the abandonment of the ABM Treaty and START II Treaty. Russia opposes U.S. missile defense, fearing it will destabilize global security and increase nuclear proliferation. Despite their concerns, Russian authorities acknowledge their limited ability to influence the Bush Administration's missile defense plans. The Bush Administration is moving forward with missile defense despite Russian opposition. The United States and Russia have agreed to steps to increase transparency and cooperation in missile defense technologies. Russia's main hopes for altering U.S. missile defense plans lie in rallying international opposition, including from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. Congress plays a critical role in the future of missile defense, with sharp divisions over the Bush Administration's approach. Russia has accepted NATO enlargement, reducing the drama surrounding the issue. The creation of the NATO-Russia Council in May 2002 has reduced the drama surrounding NATO enlargement. This new Council allows Russia to have an equal voice and vote in security discussions with the 19 Alliance members. The NATO-Russia Council, established in May 2002, gives Russia an equal voice and vote in security discussions with NATO members. The Council focuses on specific issues like counterterrorism, nonproliferation, and military cooperation, fostering higher levels of trust compared to the previous PJC format. The NATO-Russia Council, established in May 2002, allows Russia to participate in security discussions with NATO members. The new NATO-at-20 Council operates on consensus but issues can be referred to the North Atlantic Council if consensus is not reached. There are concerns about Russia's role in the Council, with optimists hoping for ally-like behavior and skeptics fearing attempts to weaken the Alliance. Congressional interest in NATO is growing, as seen with the reestablishment of a bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group by Senators Daschle and Lott. Interest in NATO has led Senators Daschle and Lott to reestablish a bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group (SNOG) to monitor developments in NATO, especially in relation to the new relationship with Russia and the upcoming Prague summit in November 2002. The addition of new NATO members would require Senate approval. The importance of economic issues in U.S.-Russian relations has increased, with Putin prioritizing domestic economic development. Bilateral trade and U.S. investment in Russia have been minimal, but a functioning market economy in Russia could provide a significant market for U.S. goods and services. The market economy in Russia could be a major market for U.S. goods, services, and investments, benefiting both countries. Putin and Bush aim for a more businesslike relationship. The U.S. Commerce Department certifying Russia as a market economy is a step in that direction. Trade issues like steel, chicken, and oil may receive attention, with a past dispute over Russian steel exports to the U.S. due to increased demand and currency appreciation. The U.S. steel industry filed anti-dumping complaints against Russian steel exporters, leading to pacts in 1999 imposing quotas and minimum prices on Russian steel exports to the U.S. Tariffs were later imposed on steel imports, including Russian steel, by the Bush Administration in 2002, causing tension with Moscow. The Bush Administration's steel tariffs caused tension with Moscow, leading to a dispute over U.S. poultry exports to Russia. The Russian Veterinary Service suspended imports citing health concerns, seen as retaliation for the steel tariff. The import ban was lifted after U.S. remonstration, but issues persisted. Negotiations over a new veterinary certificate for U.S. poultry exports to Russia dragged on for months, keeping most U.S. poultry out of the Russian market. However, progress was made as U.S. trade officials were close to reaching an agreement with Russian counterparts. Additionally, Russia's significant oil production capacity presents opportunities for cooperation rather than conflict. Russia is competing with Saudi Arabia in the world energy market by increasing oil production, portraying its companies as reliable suppliers to stabilize prices and boost the global economy. This strategy helps Russia integrate into the industrialized West and gain political leverage, although it is not expected to replace Saudi Arabia as the oil price setter. Russia is competing with Saudi Arabia in the world energy market by increasing oil production to stabilize prices and boost the global economy. OPEC and Russia have disagreements over oil export volumes and target prices, with OPEC aiming for $22-$28 a barrel and Russia preferring $20-$25. The Bush-Putin summit highlighted the importance of Russia as a reliable oil supplier in partnership with the United States, pledging cooperation to reduce volatility in global energy markets. In a Joint Declaration, Bush pledged to encourage U.S. investment in Russia's energy sector and infrastructure. The Paris Club and London Club agreements reduced Russian debt and provided financial relief. Russia's debt is being converted into 30-year eurobonds with lower interest rates and an 8-year grace period, totaling 52% debt forgiveness. Paris Club negotiations are ongoing to determine if western creditors will grant more debt forgiveness. Germany, holding 48% of the debt, calls for full repayment. Some critics argue that Russia's economic improvement and increased defense spending should be considered. The United States holds 5% of Russia's Paris Club debt, with some Members of Congress considering debt reduction to aid economic recovery or nonproliferation efforts. The Senate passed the Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation Act of 2001, linking U.S. debt forgiveness for Russia to nonproliferation efforts. The Bush Administration was leaning towards supporting Russia's quest for debt forgiveness. However, political support for this idea could be affected by Russia's plan to build nuclear reactors in Iran. Putin's strategic decision to integrate Russia with the West rejects the Primakov vision of a Russian-Chinese axis against the United States. Putin's turn towards the West has implications for Russian-Chinese and U.S.-Chinese relations. This shift reduces Russian support for China vis-a-vis the United States, potentially bringing U.S.-led forces closer to China. The geostrategic shift in Russia towards the West raises concerns for China about potential isolation and being seen as the leading anti-American power. Despite warming relations between the US and China, China faces risks in its position as it strives to accelerate economic modernization. After a rocky start, the events of September 11 led to a potential for Sino-U.S. cooperation against global terrorism. The Bush Administration sought Chinese support with Asian states and in U.N. initiatives, while Chinese leaders took steps to improve relations and demonstrate China's responsible global role. The apparent softening of Chinese policy towards the United States post-9/11 is likely driven by various factors. The Chinese policy towards the United States is influenced by domestic political struggles, particularly regarding economic reforms. Proponents of market-oriented reforms tend to support closer cooperation with the US, while opponents of reform are against further opening to the West. This disagreement among Chinese political elites can reflect broader domestic issues and become a point of conflict. The Chinese leadership may have decided to ease tension with the United States in 2001 as a precautionary measure, possibly influenced by concerns over deteriorating relations after the EP-3 aircraft collision and September 11. The shift in Putin's policy towards the West may have also played a role in Chinese calculations about their relationship with the US, providing an argument against a confrontational approach that risked conflict. Influenced by Putin's partnership with China against the US, Beijing may have been encouraged to take a tougher stance. Russia's shift towards the West likely influenced China's policy, albeit to a lesser extent and for different reasons. There is an ongoing debate on how the US should respond to Putin's efforts to integrate Russia with the West. Some critics argue that the United States should reciprocate Putin's cooperation with more support. Concerns are raised about Putin's pro-Western shift lacking strong domestic backing, drawing comparisons to Gorbachev's downfall. There are warnings that if Putin feels his efforts are not reciprocated by the US, he may abandon his current policy. Additionally, there are fears that Russia's current weakness may force it to submit to heavy-handed US dominance. Russia may recover as a great power and hold resentment towards the United States due to perceived offensive actions like withdrawal from treaties and military deployments. Some believe the US approach to Russia is sound, arguing that Russia's influence is diminishing. Some view Russia as a regional power, not a global one, and believe in a \"tough love\" approach to help Russia adjust. Supporters of U.S. policy towards Russia argue that Putin's concessions confirm the correctness of the policy, as Russia is seen as weak vis-a-vis the United States. Some argue that the United States should not be deferential to Moscow due to undemocratic domestic policies under Putin, including restrictions on freedom of the press and religion, control over political parties, and human rights violations in Chechnya. They believe U.S. silence on these issues betrays American values and undermines democracy in Russia. Some argue that the United States should not be deferential to Moscow due to undemocratic domestic policies under Putin. Others believe that Putin's pro-western policies may be at risk if Russia's economic recovery is not achieved in a reasonable period of time, which would be a lost opportunity for the United States."
