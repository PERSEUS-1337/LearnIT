    "content": "The Act titled the \"Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act of 1999\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program under the Flood Control Act of 1944 to promote economic development, provide irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa, protect areas from floods, and for other purposes. The Oahe Irrigation Project was established to meet the Act's requirements by providing irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa, with main canals as its key features. The Oahe Irrigation Project included main canals like the Pierre Canal and regulating reservoirs like the Blunt Dam. Land for the project was purchased between 1972 and 1977. The Commissioner of Reclamation has administered the land since 1978 through preferential and nonpreferential leases. The Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program caused the loss of 221,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. The state has a plan to mitigate this loss and provide original landowners or their descendants with the opportunity to repurchase the land. The Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program caused the loss of 221,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. The state plans to mitigate this loss by offering original landowners or their descendants the opportunity to repurchase the land and transferring the remaining land to the State of South Dakota for habitat mitigation.

SEC. 3. BLUNT RESERVOIR AND PIERRE CANAL. In this section, key definitions include the Blunt Reservoir feature, the Commission of Schools and Public Lands of South Dakota, and nonpreferential lease parcels related to the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program. The Pierre Canal feature is part of the Oahe Irrigation Project authorized by the Act of December 22, 1944. A preferential leaseholder is someone who either sold the land to the Secretary for the Blunt Reservoir or Pierre Canal feature, was the original operator at the time of acquisition, or is a descendant of the original owner. The term \"preferential lease parcel\" refers to land purchased by the Secretary for the Blunt Reservoir or Pierre Canal feature and leased to a preferential leaseholder. The term \"unleased parcel\" refers to land purchased for the same features but not currently under lease. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation. The Blunt Reservoir feature is deauthorized, and the Secretary will convey unleased parcels to the Commission without consideration. Preferential leaseholders have the option to purchase their lease parcel from the Commission. Preferential leaseholders have the option to purchase their lease parcel from the Commission at a discounted price, with payment options based on the parcel's value. If the parcel is under $10,000, the purchase must be made on a cash basis. Preferential leaseholders have 10 years after conveyance to exercise the purchase option for their lease parcel. They can continue leasing under the same terms until then. The value of the parcel can be determined by the leaseholder. The value of a preferential lease parcel can be determined by multiplying the number of acres by the per-acre assessment of adjacent parcels or by a valuation made by an independent appraiser. If the leaseholder chooses the appraisal method, they are responsible for the cost. If a preferential leaseholder fails to purchase a parcel within the specified period, the Commission will convey it to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks for wildlife habitat mitigation. The cost of valuation for the parcel is the responsibility of the leaseholder. Proceeds from land sales will be used accordingly. Proceeds from land sales under this subsection will be allocated as follows: $500,000 for Secretary expenses, 10% of transaction costs for Commission expenses, $3,095,000 for South Dakota Wildlife Habitat Mitigation Trust Fund, and $100,000 for Hughes County. Proceeds from land sales will be allocated as follows: $100,000 for Hughes County and $100,000 for Sully County in South Dakota to support public education, with the remainder used by the Commission to support public schools in the state. The Secretary will convey nonpreferential lease parcels and unleased parcels to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks for wildlife habitat mitigation. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks will use proceeds from land sales to mitigate wildlife habitat lost due to the Pick-Sloan project. The South Dakota Commission of Schools and Public Lands may allow land exchanges for nonpreferential lease parcels or unleased parcels at Blunt Reservoir or Pierre Canal, with priority given to current lessees. The South Dakota Commission of Schools and Public Lands prioritizes exchanges for nonpreferential lease parcels and unleased parcels at Blunt Reservoir or Pierre Canal. Preferential leaseholders at Pierre Canal must allow an easement for an irrigation pipe. Amendment to fund the South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Trust Fund is proposed."
