Congress recognizes the developmental differences between youth and adults in the criminal justice system, emphasizing the need to consider juveniles' special characteristics during pretrial release or detention. Juveniles under adult court jurisdiction should be housed separately from adults and not have contact with them. Juveniles detained or incarcerated under adult criminal court jurisdiction should have access to educational, substance abuse treatment, health, mental health, and vocational programs. They should also be able to report abuse or intimidation, with prompt investigation and appropriate remedies. Transfer and sentencing of juveniles in adult court should consider individual characteristics and the nature of the offense committed. Juveniles in adult facilities face higher risks of future crimes, unsafe conditions, and suicide rates compared to juvenile detention. They are also more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Juveniles in adult facilities face higher risks of assault, abuse, and violence compared to those in juvenile detention.
