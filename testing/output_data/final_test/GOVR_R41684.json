    "content": "Recent oil spills, including the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, have sparked increased congressional interest in oil spill legislation. The Gulf oil spill released approximately 206 million gallons of oil before containment in July 2010, leading to further discussions on related issues. This report identifies legislation addressing oil spill-related issues such as prevention, preparedness, response, liability, compensation, and Gulf of Mexico restoration. The statutes for these provisions are mainly found in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Clean Water Act, and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Tables list acronyms, enacted legislation, and proposed bills in the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress enacted two statutes with oil spill-related provisions in response to issues raised by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. One statute, P.L. 112-90, increases civil penalties for safety violations and authorizes the installation of shutoff valves on transmission pipelines. The 112th Congress enacted two statutes with oil spill-related provisions in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. P.L. 112-90 increases civil penalties for safety violations and authorizes shutoff valves on transmission pipelines. The Secretary of Transportation may issue leak detection requirements after analyzing systems and issues. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will review regulations for pipelines transmitting diluted bitumen for potential increased risk of release. P.L. 112-141 (MAP-21) included the RESTORE Act, which is summarized below. Other bills not listed may impact oil spill policy, including proposals for offshore oil exploration and development. One enacted bill, P.L. 112-74, transferred air emission authority in the OCS off Alaska's north coast from EPA to DOI. Several other bills passed the House, including H.R. 1230 directing oil and gas lease sales, H.R. 1229 amending permit process time frames, H.R. 1231 directing OCS leasing, and H.R. 2021 amending certain provisions. H.R. 2021, passed by the House on June 22, 2011, aimed to amend the Clean Air Act (CAA) regarding OCS source definition and support vessel emissions. Some bills proposed prohibiting oil and gas development in specific areas for environmental protection, focusing on oil spill prevention. The RESTORE Act established the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund using penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The RESTORE Act established the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund using penalties from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The act allows the Secretary of the Treasury to determine fund expenditures each fiscal year and stop funds to entities not using them as prescribed. The amount of revenue available for the fund is uncertain. The Gulf Coast Restoration Fund's future is uncertain as some responsible parties, like BP, have settled with the government, but BP still faces potential substantial civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. Penalties for violations of the CWA can be up to $37,500 per day or $1,100 per barrel discharged, and up to $140,000 to $4,300 per barrel for gross negligence or willful misconduct. No negligence determination has been made yet. The 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a discharge of approximately 206 million gallons (4.9 million barrels). Responsible parties are disputing this estimate, with BP recovering 17% directly from the wellhead. The potential Clean Water Act penalty for the spill ranges from $1,100 to $4,300 per barrel, totaling $4.5 billion to $21.5 billion. The Clean Water Act penalty for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill ranges from $1,100 to $4,300 per barrel, totaling $4.5 billion to $21.5 billion. Factors considered for the penalty include seriousness of the violation, economic benefit to the violator, degree of culpability, history of prior violations, efforts to minimize effects, economic impact on the violator, and other relevant factors. The judicial civil penalty for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill could be less than $4.5 billion, even for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Gulf Coast Restoration Fund distributes funds to Gulf states, with 65% going directly to states and the rest divided equally among Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Additional requirements exist for specific fund distributions. The Gulf Coast Restoration Fund distributes funds to Gulf states, with specific requirements for distributions to political subdivisions in Florida and Louisiana. In Florida, 75% of its share goes to disproportionately affected counties, while in Louisiana, 30% goes to individual parishes based on a statutory formula. The funding must be used for activities such as restoration of natural resources, mitigation of damage, workforce development, and infrastructure improvements. The Gulf Coast Restoration Fund allocates funds to Gulf states for various projects, including infrastructure, coastal flood protection, planning assistance, and tourism promotion. States must meet conditions and submit implementation plans to receive funds. 30% of the trust fund monies are distributed to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, composed of federal officials and state governors, will distribute 30% of trust fund monies to Gulf states based on a distribution formula. States must submit plans detailing how funding will support ecosystem restoration activities. The act establishes the GCERSOMT program funded by 2.5% of trust fund monies for marine research projects in the Gulf of Mexico. 2.5% of trust fund monies will be disbursed to Gulf states for establishing \"centers of excellence.\" 50% of interest earned by the trust fund will fund the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council will receive funding to implement the Comprehensive Plan. 25% of the funding will go towards the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Science program, and another 25% will support centers of excellence research grants."
