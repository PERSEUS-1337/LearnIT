    "content": "The 2008 farm bill authorized federal farm and food policies through 2013, with baseline projections used to assess changes in mandatory spending. Some programs had baseline funding beyond the bill's expiration, causing budget challenges for the 2014 farm bill development. In 2010, 37 provisions or programs from the 2008 farm bill with mandatory funding did not have baseline beyond the bill's expiration, potentially costing $9 billion to $14 billion to extend for five years. These programs covered various areas such as agricultural disaster, specialty crop research, organic research, beginning farmer programs, rural development, and bioenergy. The CBO develops the budget baseline for various programs, including disadvantaged farmer programs, rural development, bioenergy, farmers market promotion, and conservation programs. Some programs may not continue in the budget baseline beyond the end of a farm bill due to various reasons such as lack of new mandatory budget authority or scoring thresholds not being met. The 2014 farm bill provided new mandatory funding totaling over $6.2 billion for 29 programs over a five-year period. Some programs received permanent baseline funding for the second five years, while others were incorporated into different programs. The enacted law allocated more mandatory funding to these programs compared to the House and Senate proposals. The Senate-passed farm bill (S. 954) would have provided over $4.5 billion of mandatory funding for 25 programs over five years, offset by reductions in mandatory spending from the 2014 farm bill. The one-year extension of the 2008 farm bill did not provide additional mandatory funding for programs without baseline, leading to authorizations of appropriations for discretionary funding in FY2013. The FY2013 Agriculture appropriation included proposals from 2012 that were not enacted, envisioning funding for various programs. Programs from the 2008 Farm Bill without budget baseline after FY2012 are grouped by title, uncertainty in cost, and duration of mandatory funding use. Titles with the most provisions include energy, conservation, nutrition, and horticulture/organic agriculture. The ranking of titles in the next farm bill is based on the cost to extend provisions, with agricultural disaster assistance having the highest cost ($4.8 billion to $9 billion), followed by conservation, energy, and research. Farm bill funding can be fixed or based on \"such sums as necessary\" for program operation. Many believe that programs in the farm bill are unlikely to receive increased funding above 2008 levels due to budget constraints. Fixed-dollar funding was specified for 33 provisions in the 2008 farm bill, totaling about $2.4 billion over five years. For programs with \"such sums as necessary\" funding, the cost estimates vary based on different approaches. The 2008 farm bill set fixed-dollar funding for 33 provisions totaling $2.4 billion over five years. Estimates for provisions with \"such sums as necessary\" funding range from $6.7 billion to $11.5 billion, accounting for 80% of total costs for those provisions. Congress prioritized programs based on budget allocation, adjusting parameters to reduce costs if necessary. After the 2008 farm bill, programs with \"such sums as necessary\" funding may exceed initial cost estimates. The question arises whether to continue these programs at higher costs or redesign them in the next farm bill. The duration of mandatory funding usage varies, with 20 provisions costing $6 billion to $10 billion if extended in the next bill. Some provisions in the 2008 farm bill have mandatory funding for the entire duration, estimated to cost $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion if extended for five years. Programs with full-term funding may be prioritized over those with short-term funding for implementation or backlog funding. Other programs may receive short-term mandatory funding and discretionary appropriations, operating for the full term regardless of funding duration. In the 2008 farm bill, 37 programs received mandatory funding without a baseline for a new farm bill. These programs include bioenergy, specialty crops, beginning and minority farmers, conservation programs like wetlands reserve and grasslands reserve, and new programs like local and regional foreign food aid procurement and the national clean plant network. The 2008 farm bill funded 37 programs without a baseline for a new farm bill, requiring $9 billion to $14 billion for five more years. The 2012 farm bill extension did not provide additional mandatory funding for these programs, leading to a need for offsets from other sources in a tight budget environment. In FY2013, no discretionary appropriations were provided for various programs due to deficit reduction and sequestration. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees aimed to fund these programs through the 2012 farm bills, which would have allocated over $5 billion in mandatory funding over five years. In FY2013, no discretionary appropriations were provided for programs due to deficit reduction and sequestration. The enacted farm bill extension did not provide additional mandatory funding for these programs."
