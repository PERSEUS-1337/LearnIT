    "content": "The organizations described in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as charitable organizations. These organizations are organized and operated exclusively for specific purposes such as religious, charitable, scientific, educational, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. They are prohibited from engaging in certain activities like providing athletic facilities, influencing legislation, or participating in political campaigns. 501(c)(3) organizations, including public charities and private foundations, have restrictions on political activities to maintain their tax-exempt status. Private foundations face stricter regulations due to limited funding sources. They are prohibited from engaging in significant lobbying or intervening in political campaigns to avoid consequences like losing tax-exempt status. The lobbying restriction and political campaign prohibition for 501(c)(3) organizations were enacted in 1934 and 1954, respectively. The Treasury Department's position in 1919 led to organizations advocating controversial or partisan propaganda not being considered \"educational\" for tax-exempt status. Court decisions varied on deductibility of contributions to such organizations based on advocacy and influence on legislation. The lobbying restriction and political campaign prohibition for 501(c)(3) organizations were enacted in 1934 and 1954, respectively. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that contributions to organizations were not deductible if lobbying did not further the organization's charitable purpose. Congress enacted the lobbying limitation in the Revenue Act of 1934 to address concerns about organizations lobbying while receiving tax-deductible contributions. The lobbying provision in the Revenue Act of 1934 aimed to address concerns about organizations lobbying while receiving tax-deductible contributions. Some Members believed the provision was too broad, while others argued that all contributions to lobbying organizations should be nondeductible to avoid distinguishing between deserving and undeserving organizations. The provision was not identical to the Slee decision, as it focused on whether lobbying was a substantial part of an organization's activities. The 1934 Act also included a provision restricting charities from participating in partisan politics. The political campaign prohibition in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was initially restricted but later removed due to concerns about its broadness. Senator Lyndon Johnson added the provision as a floor amendment, comparing it to the lobbying limitation inaccurately. The legislative history does not provide further discussion on the prohibition, and Senator Johnson's motives remain unclear. The legislative history suggests that Senator Lyndon Johnson proposed the political campaign prohibition in the Internal Revenue Code as either retaliation or as an alternative to another Senator's proposal. The definition in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) prohibits organizations from engaging in lobbying activities, including direct lobbying and grassroots lobbying. Lobbying involves attempting to influence legislation by contacting legislators or advocating for or against legislation. \"Lobbying includes actions by legislative bodies, public referenda, and initiatives. It encompasses introducing, amending, enacting, defeating, or repealing acts, bills, and resolutions. Senate confirmation of judicial and executive branch nominations is also considered lobbying. Advocacy activities can be lobbying even without pending legislation. Making contributions or providing loans to entities that lobby can also be treated as lobbying. Testifying in response to official requests by legislative bodies is not considered lobbying, nor is contacting executive, judicial, and administrative bodies on non-legislative matters.\" Organizations can determine if lobbying is a substantial part of their activities by electing under IRC \u00a7 501(h) to measure lobbying expenditures against objective standards. If not, they are subject to the \"no substantial part\" test with no clear standards. Most organizations do not make the election, and some, like churches and private foundations, are not allowed to. Those that elect under \u00a7 501(h) measure lobbying against limits in IRC \u00a7 4911. Exceeding these limits for total lobbying expenditures and grassroots activities can have consequences. Exceeding lobbying expenditure limits in IRC \u00a7 4911 results in an excise tax of 25% on the excess. To avoid taxation, organizations must adhere to specific spending limits on lobbying and grass roots activities based on their total expenditures. Safe harbor provisions are available for organizations that do not exceed these limits. The election provides a safe harbor for organizations that do not exceed lobbying expenditure limits, allowing them to maintain their tax-exempt status. Organizations can conduct significant lobbying without losing their exempt status as long as their lobbying expenditures do not exceed 150% of the limitations over a four-year period. The determination of whether an organization has conducted more than an insubstantial amount of lobbying depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, with case law suggesting that \"no substantial part\" is between 5% and 20% of the organization's expenditures. Courts consider various factors when determining if an organization's lobbying activities jeopardize its tax-exempt status. Non-electing public charities face an excise tax on lobbying expenditures if they lose their exempt status due to substantial lobbying, with the tax being 5% of the expenditures. Private foundations are generally required to pay an excise tax on any lobbying expenses. Private foundations must pay an excise tax on lobbying expenditures, equal to 10% of the expenditures. Foundation managers may also be subject to a tax of 2.5% of the expenditure, limited to $5,000. Failure to correct the expenditure results in additional taxes. In Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, the Supreme Court upheld the lobbying limitation as constitutional, denying TWR's application for tax-exempt status due to excessive lobbying. TWR argued that the limitation violated its freedom of speech under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected Taxation With Representation of Washington's argument that it was being denied equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. The Court found that Congress had not prevented TWR from speaking but had simply chosen not to subsidize it through tax exemptions. TWR could qualify for exemption under a different section and receive deductible contributions for non-lobbying activities. The Court stated that the classification was constitutionally permissible if it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose. The Supreme Court found that Congress had the discretion to classify tax exemptions for lobbying activities, stating that it was not irrational to withhold this benefit from charities due to concerns about lobbying for members' benefit. The Court also justified distinguishing charities from veterans organizations based on the policy of compensating veterans. The IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) prohibits political campaign involvement for these organizations. The IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) prohibits political campaign involvement for organizations seeking tax-exempt status, defining candidate as an individual running for public office. Prohibited activities include endorsing or opposing candidates, distributing campaign literature, and making contributions to political campaigns. However, political activities unrelated to campaigns are allowed for these organizations. Organizations with tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) can engage in political activities unrelated to elections, such as lobbying and supporting or opposing appointments. They can also participate in certain election-related activities as long as they remain unbiased towards any candidate. The IRS provides examples of biased activities, emphasizing that even subtle biases can be problematic. Voter guides and similar materials created or distributed by these organizations must be unbiased in form, content, and distribution. The IRS emphasizes that voter guides and similar materials created by tax-exempt organizations must be unbiased in form, content, and distribution. Biases can manifest in various ways, such as not including all candidates equally, rating candidates, or only covering issues important to the organization. According to the IRS, candidate-neutral voter guides should have clear, unbiased questions and descriptions, identical questions for all candidates, unedited candidate answers, questions and answers placed close together, reasonable response time, and opportunities for candidates to explain their positions. Distribution timing and recipients are also important factors. The IRS allows 501(c)(3) organizations to publish voting records and positions on issues in newsletters as long as they are not timed to an election or broadly distributed. They may also conduct unbiased public forums for candidates, with specific guidelines to ensure fairness. According to IRS guidelines, \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations can invite candidates to speak at events as long as they provide equal opportunities to all candidates, do not show preference for any candidate, and do not engage in fundraising activities. Candidates can also speak in a non-candidate capacity without violating campaign intervention rules. Key factors indicating no campaign intervention include speaking solely for non-candidacy reasons, no reference to the upcoming election, and no campaign activity occurring. Section 501(c)(3) organizations can conduct nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, as long as activities do not show preference for any candidate or party. Factors indicating neutrality include equal representation of candidates, limited activity to urging individuals to register and vote, and providing services without bias. Section 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without showing preference for any candidate. The IRS outlines key factors that distinguish issue advocacy from campaign intervention, such as not identifying candidates, expressing approval/disapproval, timing close to elections, or referring to voting/elections. Section 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without showing preference for any candidate. They may also sell or rent goods, services, and facilities to political campaigns under certain circumstances, with factors indicating impartiality including ongoing business activity and availability of goods and services. A \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization can engage in campaign activity by linking its website to another site showing candidate preference, with factors like context, representation of all candidates, and directness being considered by the IRS. Members and leaders of such organizations can participate in campaign activities in their private capacity. Individuals associated with \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations can engage in campaign activity in their private capacity but must not receive support from the organization. Expressing political views in the organization's publications or functions is prohibited, and the organization cannot cover expenses for such statements. There should be no implication that the individual's views represent the organization. Engaging in campaign activity may result in loss of \u00a7 501(c)(3) status and tax consequences. The IRS imposes taxes equal to 10% of expenditures for violations of the prohibition on political expenditures by \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations. If not corrected in a timely manner, an additional tax equal to 100% of expenditures may be imposed. The organization's managers may also face tax consequences. The IRS has developed the Political Activity Compliance Initiative to address concerns about violations, which includes educational outreach and a fast-track review process for possible violations. The IRS developed the Political Activity Compliance Initiative to address violations by \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations during election cycles. The initiative involved expedited reviews and written advisories for cases where organizations engaged in campaign activity but were not penalized due to mitigating factors. The IRS revoked tax-exempt status of five organizations and proposed two more revocations. 23 cases had no substantiated campaign activity, while six had non-political violations. The IRS Commissioner asked TIGTA to investigate any improper activities during the initiative, and TIGTA's report in 2005 concluded that the IRS used appropriate procedures. The TIGTA report found that the IRS used appropriate procedures during the 2006 initiative involving 100 cases. 60 cases were still open in 2007, with written advisories issued in 26 closed cases. No political intervention was found in 14 cases. Additionally, 269 instances of \u00a7 501(c)(3) groups making direct contributions to political candidates were identified. \u00a7 501(c)(4) organizations are described as social welfare organizations. Section (c)(5) organizations are labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, while section (c)(6) organizations are trade associations and business leagues not organized for profit. Treasury regulations clarify that organizations must be primarily engaged in promoting the common good and general welfare of the community to qualify for tax-exempt status. The organizational definitions in \u00a7 501(c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) do not have explicit limitations on lobbying. Organizations under these sections can engage in lobbying related to their exempt purpose. For example, a business association lobbying for legislation may qualify for \u00a7 501(c)(6) status. Lobbying activities can affect the deductibility of dues paid by members under IRC \u00a7 162. Under IRC \u00a7 162, organizations can't deduct lobbying expenditures from dues. \u00a7 501(c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) organizations can engage in political campaign activity but it can't be their primary focus. Organizations benefiting partisan interests may risk losing their \u00a7 501(c)(4) status. The IRC places limitations on \u00a7 501(c) organizations participating in political activities, with minimal IRS guidance available. Other types of organizations under \u00a7 501(c) fall into two categories, some prohibited from political activity while others have limited participation. The IRS limits political activities for certain \u00a7 501(c) organizations, including trusts and specific types of organizations like fraternal societies. Exceptions may exist for lobbying related to the organization's purpose. Certain \u00a7 501(c) organizations may engage in political activity but are subject to tax if they make expenditures for a \u00a7 527 \"exempt function,\" which includes influencing elections. Certain \u00a7 501(c) organizations may be taxed on their expenditures for political activities, but they can avoid this tax by setting up a separate fund under \u00a7 527(f)(3). This fund would be treated as a separate political organization, allowing the \u00a7 501(c) organization to avoid taxation. However, the fund cannot be used to circumvent prohibitions on certain activities, such as campaign intervention for a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization. Under the IRC, \u00a7 501(c) organizations must report political activities on Form 990. \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations detail campaign activities, expenditures, and lobbying on Schedule C. Other organizations describe political campaign activities and spending. The Form 990 requires organizations to report political campaign activities, expenditures, volunteer hours, \u00a7 527 exempt function activities, contributions to other organizations, filing of Form 1120-POL, and payments made to \u00a7 527 political organizations. Additionally, \u00a7 501(c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) organizations can report lobbying activities related to dues deductibility. On the Form 990's Schedule B, \u00a7 501(c) organizations must disclose significant donors who contributed at least $5,000, including those not donating for political activities. While the Form 990 is publicly available, donor information on Schedule B is not disclosed to the public, except for donors to private foundations."
