    "content": "Congress is currently considering reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) during the 2018 hurricane season. The House passed a reauthorization bill (H.R. 2874) in November 2017, while the Senate has introduced three bills. The NFIP has received short-term reauthorizations despite concerns about its solvency after the 2017 hurricane season. The program was last reauthorized until September 30, 2017, by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. The NFIP received multiple short-term reauthorizations in 2017 and 2018, managed by FEMA to provide flood insurance and reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to reduce flood risk and federal expenditure on disaster assistance. It is the primary source of flood insurance coverage for residential properties in the US, with over 5 million policies providing $1.28 trillion in coverage. The program collects $3.6 billion in annual premium revenue and has 22,322 participating communities. In July 2018, 22,322 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions participated in the NFIP, saving the nation an estimated $1.87 billion annually in flood losses. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States, with U.S. flood losses in 2016 totaling about $17 billion. 2017 was the most costly year for U.S. hurricane losses on record, with losses from various flood events exceeding $1 billion each. The 2017 hurricane season saw record losses of $270.3 billion, with Hurricane Harvey at $127.5 billion, Hurricane Maria at $91.8 billion, and Hurricane Irma at $51.0 billion. Key insurance reform provisions in recent legislation and issues for congressional consideration regarding the NFIP reauthorization are discussed. The NFIP does not have a comprehensive expiration provision. The NFIP does not have a comprehensive expiration provision but has multiple legal provisions tied to key components. Without reauthorization by Congress, new flood insurance contracts will expire on November 30, 2018. The authority to borrow funds will be reduced, but other program activities will remain authorized. The House Financial Services Committee has completed markup on bills to reform and reauthorize the NFIP. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act (H.R. 2874) passed the House and would authorize the NFIP until September 30, 2022. Three Senate bills have been introduced to reauthorize the NFIP with varying expiration dates. The report summarizes proposed changes to the NFIP in H.R. 2874, S. 1313, S. 1368, and S. 1571, focusing on key areas identified by the Government Accountability Office for comprehensive reform. The NFIP was designed with public insurance goals in mind, including providing flood insurance in flood-prone areas and reducing government costs after floods. It also engages in non-insurance activities for public interest, such as disseminating flood risk information, requiring communities to adopt standards, and contributing to community resilience. These tasks have benefits that are not directly measured in the NFIP's financial. The NFIP was designed to achieve multiple objectives, including providing flood insurance, promoting community participation, and earning income to cover claims and expenses. Competing goals, such as keeping insurance affordable while ensuring fiscal solvency, have made reforming the program challenging. The NFIP faces challenges in setting premiums that are both \"risk-based\" and \"reasonable,\" leading to premiums that do not fully reflect the risk of loss. Congress has directed FEMA to provide subsidized premium rates but has not provided funds to offset these subsidies, leading to FEMA borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to pay NFIP claims. As of January 2018, the written premium on approximately 5 million policies was $3.5 billion. As of January 2018, the NFIP had written premiums of $3.5 billion on 5 million policies. Coverage limits include $100,000 for contents and $250,000 for buildings for single-family dwellings, $500,000 for buildings and $100,000 for contents for other residential buildings, and $500,000 for both buildings and contents for non-residential business buildings. NFIP premiums include fees like the Federal Policy Fee, set by FEMA to cover administrative expenses and floodplain mapping. The Federal Policy Fee for flood insurance is set by FEMA and can vary annually. As of October 2017, the fee is $50 for Standard Flood Insurance Policies, $25 for Preferred Risk Policies, and $25 for contents-only policies. Congress authorized a reserve fund assessment in BW-12 to cover future claim and debt expenses, with FEMA required to maintain a reserve ratio of 1% of total loss exposure. As of February 2018, approximately $12.79 billion was required for the reserve fund ratio, with FEMA allowed to phase in the assessment over time to reach the target of not less than 7.5% of the ratio each fiscal year. Since April 2016, FEMA has charged every NFIP policy a reserve fund assessment equal to 15% of the premium. The reserve fund assessment has increased from 5% to 15% and is used to cover future claim and debt expenses. In addition, all NFIP policies are assessed a surcharge following the passage of HFIAA, with charges of $25 for primary residences and $250 for other properties. Revenues from the surcharge are deposited into the reserve fund to reduce the NFIP's debt. The HFIAA surcharge, not considered a premium, is not included in FEMA's insurance rate increase calculations. Flood insurance rates in the NFIP are based on risk and actuarial principles, with discounts offered for certain properties. Three main categories pay less than full risk-based rates, including Pre-FIRM properties built before December 31, 1974. The availability of pre-FIRM subsidies allowed properties built before the first Flood Insurance Rate Map to have lower premiums. BW-12 phased out most subsidized insurance premiums, requiring FEMA to increase rates on certain properties at 25% per year until full-risk rates were reached. This was intended to distribute the financial burden among those protected by flood insurance and the public. The BW-12 legislation phased out subsidies for various properties, including secondary residences, businesses, and those with substantial damage. Subsidies were eliminated immediately for lapsed policies, refusal of mitigation assistance, and properties not insured by NFIP. Properties not phased out or eliminated had to start paying actuarial rates after five years, phased in at 20% per year. Concerns were raised about the financial burden on policyholders due to the elimination of lower rate classes. HFIAA was passed to address concerns over rate increases from BW-12, reinstating premium discounts and slowing down some rate increases. It repealed the property-sale trigger for full-risk rates and slowed the phaseout of pre-FIRM subsidies for primary residences. Approximately 16.1% of NFIP policies received a pre-FIRM subsidy as of September 2016. The HFIAA established a new subsidy for properties newly mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area after April 1, 2015. The subsidy lasts for the first 12 months following the map revision, transitioning to a full-risk rate thereafter with annual increases. As of September 2016, about 3.9% of NFIP policies receive this newly mapped subsidy. FEMA allows properties built in compliance with the FIRM to maintain old flood insurance rates when remapped. This \"grandfathering\" practice is not considered a subsidy as discounts are offset by other policyholders. Congress implicitly eliminated this practice. FEMA reinstated grandfathering in HFIAA, allowing grandfathered status to be passed on to new owners. The number of properties with grandfathered rates in NFIP is uncertain, estimated at 10%-20%. Categories for reduced rates are based on structure build date relative to FIRM adoption, not flood risk or policyholder's ability to pay. The FIRM adoption date determines reduced rates in NFIP, not flood risk or policyholder's ability to pay. Reforming premium structure to reflect full risk-based rates could address policy goals, make NFIP financially sustainable, provide clearer flood risk understanding, and attract private insurers. However, charging actuarially sound premiums may lead to unaffordable insurance for some properties or politically unacceptable rate increases. Section 102 would phase out pre-FIRM subsidies for primary residences at a rate of 6.5%-15%. After enactment, the minimum rate increase would be 5% in the first year, 5.5% in the second year, and 6% in the third year. The phaseout of pre-FIRM subsidies for various property categories would remain at 25%. FEMA could potentially raise premiums more rapidly by increasing the minimum rate for removing the subsidy for primary residences. Section 105 requires FEMA to calculate premium rates based on differences in flood risk from coastal and inland hazards within two years of enactment. FEMA would be required to publish an explanation of the bases and methodology for determining flood insurance premium rates, including incorporating replacement cost value in setting rates. A study would be conducted to evaluate industry best practices and develop a timeline for implementing these changes. Section 112 of the NFIP reform proposal would cap premiums for 1-4 unit residential properties with elevation data meeting FEMA's standards at $10,000 per year, adjusted for inflation every five years. This cap could affect approximately 800 properties, or 0.02% of NFIP policies. Section 301 would require FEMA to calculate premium rates based on replacement cost value within three years of enactment. FEMA will calculate premium rates based on risk identified by FIRMs and other assessment tools, including risk models and scores. The HFIAA surcharge will increase for primary residences and non-residential properties, but decrease for non-primary residences eligible for a Preferred Risk Policy. Section 503 of S. 1313 would require FEMA to increase the reserve fund assessment by at least one percentage point annually until the statutory reserve ratio is achieved, likely leading to increased premiums for all NFIP policyholders. FEMA is also required to conduct a study to evaluate insurance industry best practices and develop feasible solutions. FEMA would be required to conduct a study on insurance industry best practices and develop a plan to include replacement cost value in NFIP premium rates. The use of replacement cost value would be phased in gradually, starting 12 months after enactment and fully implemented four years after enactment. Section 209 of S. 1313 would set coverage limits based on Fannie Mae loan limits, with contents coverage at 50% of the baseline amount and building coverage limits varying based on property type. S. 1368, Section 102, would limit the rate of increase of covered costs for all categories of policies under NFIP, including premiums, surcharges, and Federal Policy Fee. It would also lower premiums by excluding catastrophic loss years from the calculation of average historical loss year. S. 1368, Section 104, raises building coverage limits to $500,000 for single-family dwellings and $1,500,000 for non-residential buildings. S. 1571, Section 301, requires FEMA to study insurance industry best practices for setting NFIP premium rates. NFIP can borrow from the Treasury for extreme events, historically repaying loans with interest. The U.S. Treasury increased NFIP borrowing limits after hurricanes in 2005, 2006, and Hurricane Sandy. In 2017, NFIP borrowed $1.6 billion for losses in 2016 and $5.825 billion for Hurricane Harvey. Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP debt to cover claims for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. FEMA borrowed an additional $6.1 billion in November. The NFIP borrowed $6.1 billion in November 2017 to cover losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, bringing the total debt to $20.525 billion. If the borrowing authority is reduced to $1 billion after November 30, 2018, FEMA would adjust and pay claims as premium dollars come in. If funds are depleted, claims would have to wait for sufficient premium dollars unless Congress provides supplemental funds or increases the borrowing limit. The NFIP's debt is owed by current and future participants, with policyholders potentially seeking judicial remedies if Congress does not fund unpaid claims. The program pays off the debt through premium revenues, with payments made from the reserve fund. Since borrowing funds after the 2005 hurricane season, the NFIP has paid $2.82 billion in principal and $3.83 billion in interest. Charging current policyholders for past debt is noted as contrary to actuarial principles. The NFIP's debt is being paid off by current and future policyholders, with the recent cancellation of $16 billion of debt in 2017. The practice of charging current policyholders for past debt is criticized by the GAO as unfair and contrary to actuarial principles. The GAO suggested eliminating FEMA's debt to the Treasury to reallocate funds for other purposes and create a more equitable system. Eliminating the NFIP debt would require Congress to cancel debt outright, appropriate funds for FEMA to repay the debt, or change the law to eliminate the repayment requirement. No projections have been made considering the cancellation of $16 billion of NFIP debt or the total claims of the 2017 hurricane season. FEMA's report to Congress in 2013 suggested the debt would not be paid off for at least 20 years, with the period potentially increasing due to future catastrophic incidents. FEMA estimated in March 2017 that the NFIP's $24.6 billion debt would need annual repayment. In March 2017, FEMA estimated that the NFIP's $24.6 billion debt would require annual interest-only payments of nearly $400 million. If interest rates were to rise, these payments would increase significantly, and FEMA might not be able to retire any debt, even in low loss years. Additionally, in April 2017, FEMA updated assumptions and projected that the NFIP's net debt would increase by a further $9.4 billion at the end of 20 years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the NFIP would have insufficient receipts to pay expected claims and expenses over the 2018-2027 period, requiring FEMA to use about $1 billion of its borrowing authority. The NFIP's debt is a concern due to interest payments surpassing debt repayment since 2005. S. 1368, Section 301, proposes freezing interest accrual for six years to redirect funds. Stakeholders worry about flood insurance affordability and balancing actuarial soundness. BW-12 and HFIAA raised premium concerns, prompting an affordability study by FEMA. FEMA and the National Research Council conducted studies on flood insurance affordability as mandated by BW-12 and HFIAA. The NRC report highlighted the lack of objective definitions for affordability and the need for financial assistance for some households. FEMA's Affordability Framework was published in April 2018. The NRC report addressed the lack of objective definitions for flood insurance affordability and suggested government assistance criteria such as eligibility based on cost burden, income, and community characteristics. The NRC report identified potential policy measures to reduce the burden of premium payments for flood insurance, such as means-tested grants and loans, tax deductions, disaster savings accounts, and expanding individual mitigation measures. Policymakers need to decide how to define cost burden, whether based on income, housing costs, premium paid, or other measures. The GAO suggested an affordability program that provides means-tested assistance through appropriations rather than discounted premiums to encourage consumer participation and promote resilience. They argued that linking subsidies to ability to pay would make premium assistance more transparent and open to oversight by Congress and the public. This approach would help ensure that only those who cannot afford full-risk rates receive assistance. Premium assistance could lower the number of policyholders receiving subsidies, increase NFIP premiums, and reduce federal fiscal exposure. GAO estimated 47%-74% of policyholders could be eligible for subsidy. Instead of premium assistance, GAO suggested providing assistance for mitigation measures to reduce flood risk and lower premium rates. Mitigation could also decrease the need for federal disaster assistance. Another approach to affordability would be introducing an affordability program with means-tested assistance through appropriations. To increase affordability of premiums for policyholders in relevant communities, introducing policies to expand participation in the Community Rating System (CRS) or improve existing ratings could help. The CRS incentivizes risk reduction and adoption of effective floodplain protection measures. Policyholders in CRS communities receive discounts on SFIP premiums. Currently, only 5% of eligible NFIP communities participate in the CRS program. The CRS program incentivizes risk reduction and effective floodplain protection measures for eligible NFIP communities. More than 69% of all flood policies are written in CRS-participating communities. The CRS discount for individual communities is cross-subsidized into the NFIP program, offsetting the discount with increased premium rates for all NFIP communities. FEMA lacks the authority and funding to implement an affordability program within the current rate structure. An affordability program for flood insurance could be funded through NFIP funds, raising rates for policyholders, or congressional appropriation. Section 103 allows states to create a voluntary program for owner-occupants of 1-4 unit residences in NFIP communities. Eligibility is based on income limits, with assistance in the form of limiting risk premiums or rate increases. The state affordability program for flood insurance, as proposed in S. 1313, would be funded through a surcharge on policies not eligible for the program. This surcharge could impact policyholders with low incomes, including renters and owner-occupiers in multiunit buildings. The program would provide affordability vouchers for owner-occupied households in Special Flood Hazard Areas with incomes less than 165% of the area median income, to help cover excess flood insurance costs. The proposed flood insurance affordability program would provide vouchers to offset excess costs for policyholders based on their household income levels. The vouchers would be used towards payment of flood insurance premiums, surcharges, and fees. Policyholders with household incomes below 80% of the area median income would receive a voucher for 100% of the excess costs, while those with incomes of 81%-120% and 121%-165% of the area median income would receive vouchers for 80% and 60% of excess costs respectively. Funding for these vouchers is unclear, but S. 1368, Section 103, would require FEMA to establish an Affordability Assistance Fund separate from other NFIP funds. The proposed Affordability Assistance Fund, separate from other NFIP funds, would provide financial assistance to eligible households with housing costs exceeding 30% of adjusted gross income. Assistance would include zero or low-interest loans for mitigation projects and vouchers, grants, or premium credits to offset NFIP premiums. The NFIP has long aimed to increase flood insurance purchases, leading to the mandatory purchase requirement for federally backed mortgages in SFHAs. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened this requirement. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) for federally backed mortgages. Compliance rates vary across the country, with some areas as low as 43% and others as high as 88%. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 strengthened the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) for federally backed mortgages. Compliance rates vary across the country, ranging from 43% in some areas to 88% in others. A recent study in New York City showed an increase in compliance from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. Suggestions have been made to expand the mandatory purchase requirement to more mortgage loans to increase consumer participation in the NFIP. The GAO and the Association of State Floodplain Managers suggest that a federal mandate for flood insurance could increase consumer participation and help private insurers manage risk. Low penetration rates of flood insurance were highlighted by the 2017 hurricanes, with some counties in Texas having only a 10% penetration rate. The highest penetration rates for flood insurance were in Aransas County (72%), Nueces County (70%), and Galveston County (64%) in Texas, and in St. Johns County (73%), Flagler County (72%), Nassau County (62%), and Palm Beach County (62%) in Florida. Puerto Rico had a very low NFIP penetration rate of 0.23% before Hurricane Maria. The NFIP policies are not evenly distributed across the country, with higher participation rates in coastal areas. The top five states with the most policies are Florida, Texas, Louisiana, California, and New Jersey. FEMA aims to increase flood insurance coverage nationwide as a priority for reauthorization. FEMA prioritizes doubling flood insurance coverage by 2023 through increased sale of NFIP and private policies. Section 507 proposes raising civil penalties for lenders not enforcing mandatory purchase, while Section 513 mandates a GAO report on mandatory purchase efficacy within 18 months. S. 1313 requires FEMA to study flood insurance coordination with NAIC. A study in coordination with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to increase flood insurance participation through programmatic and regulatory changes, including options to expand coverage, automatically enroll customers, and create bundled coverage. FEMA required to conduct a study on properties with federally backed mortgages in SFHAs and the 500-year floodplain to report to Congress. Section 303 of S. 1571 requires federal banking regulators to conduct an annual study on compliance with the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement. FEMA is also mandated to conduct an annual study on participation rates and financial assistance for individuals living outside Special Flood Hazard Areas. The NFIP was created due to the unavailability of private flood insurance in the US, mainly because private companies couldn't offer affordable coverage due to the unpredictable nature of flooding. The private market's role in primary residential flood insurance has been limited, with private insurance companies handling day-to-day operations of the NFIP under FEMA's oversight. FEMA authorizes two arrangements with private industry, including the Direct Servicing Agent for purchasing flood insurance policies directly from the NFIP. The NFIP offers two arrangements for purchasing flood insurance policies: the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. The WYO Program involves private insurance companies writing and servicing policies, with 86% of NFIP policies sold through this program. There are debates over the compensation levels for WYO companies, with concerns about reimbursement adequacy and lack of systematic consideration of actual expenses and profits by FEMA. The private flood insurance market focuses on high-value properties with higher premiums, making flood underwriting expenses more justified. Few private insurers compete with the NFIP in the primary voluntary flood insurance market, partly due to the non-compete clause restricting WYO carriers from offering standalone private flood products. FEMA has proposed changes for FY2019 to address this issue. FEMA has proposed changes for FY2019 to remove restrictions on WYO companies offering private flood insurance, while maintaining the requirement for separation from NFIP business. Private insurers are increasingly interested in providing flood coverage, with advancements in analytics and data driving this trend. Private insurance is viewed as a way to shift flood risk from the government to the private sector, and a reformed NFIP rate structure could attract more private insurers to enter the primary flood market. Private insurers may be encouraged to enter the primary flood market due to changes in FEMA's proposed regulations. The NFIP's subsidized rates are a barrier to private sector involvement, as private insurers have different criteria for full-risk rates. Even NFIP policies considered actuarially sound may be underpriced from the perspective of private insurers. Congress has allowed federal agencies to accept private flood insurance to fulfill mandatory purchase requirements, impacting the market potential for private insurers. The implementation of accepting private flood insurance to meet the mandatory purchase requirement has faced challenges, with federal agencies issuing two Notices of Proposed Rulemaking. The main issue lies in determining if private policies offer coverage as broad as the NFIP and who would make this judgment. Uncertainty around meeting this standard has hindered private sector participation in the flood insurance market, along with FEMA's continuous coverage policy. Private insurers face barriers in offering flood insurance due to lack of access to NFIP data on flood losses and claims. Increasing access to past NFIP claims data could help insurers better estimate future losses and price premiums. However, FEMA is restricted by privacy concerns in releasing policy and claims data with personally identifiable information. Private sector competition may increase financial exposure and volatility of the NFIP by cherry-picking profitable, lower-risk policies. This could lead to a higher density of actuarially unsound policies in the NFIP portfolio, as private insurers are unlikely to compete for policies they consider inadequately priced. Private insurers may not prioritize affordable flood insurance premiums, potentially leaving NFIP with more subsidized policies. Increased private sector involvement could weaken NFIP's revenue generation and repayment of debt. NFIP may end up as a residual market for high-risk properties in the long term. The NFIP may not be financially self-sustaining if policyholders decrease significantly, requiring federal support. Private flood insurance systems could make enforcing flood mitigation standards challenging, but government investment in mitigation could increase private market participation. The ASFPM has expressed concerns about these potential consequences. The ASFPM has concerns that private flood insurance availability may lead communities to drop out of the NFIP, potentially resulting in at-risk development in flood hazard areas. Congress revised FEMA's authority to secure reinsurance for the NFIP from private markets, with FEMA purchasing $1.042 billion of insurance in January 2017. This reinsurance covers 26% of losses between $4 billion and $8 billion from a single flooding event. In January 2018, FEMA purchased $1.46 billion of insurance for reinsurance, covering losses above $4 billion for a single flooding event. The agreement includes coverage for 18.6% of losses between $4 billion and $6 billion, and 54.3% of losses between $6 billion and $8 billion. FEMA also announced plans to transfer additional NFIP risk to private markets through a reinsurance procurement involving a catastrophe bond. The purchase of private market reinsurance by FEMA reduces the need to borrow from the Treasury to pay claims. Reinsurance allows FEMA to recognize flood risk upfront through premiums paid to reinsurers, managing and reducing volatility of losses over time. While reinsurance transfers and manages risk, it does not significantly reduce NFIP's long-term fiscal exposure. For example, $16.8 billion coverage for Katrina-level losses could cost $2.2 billion per year. The NFIP's finances do not allow for $2.2 billion per year on reinsurance due to limited premium income. Section 201 would redefine private flood insurance, focusing on state compliance and including surplus lines insurance. Federal regulators would still be involved in developing and implementing regulations. Federal regulators would develop requirements for the financial strength of private insurance companies for acceptance by entities and agencies, without conflicting with state laws. Private flood insurance policies can differ from NFIP coverage, allowing property owners to switch between the two without penalty. Section 202 of the proposed changes would apply the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance only to residential improved real estate, potentially reducing the number of commercial properties covered by the NFIP. Section 203 would eliminate the non-compete requirement in the WYO arrangement with FEMA, allowing WYO companies more flexibility. Section 204 of the proposed changes would allow WYO companies to offer their own insurance policies in addition to NFIP policies, while also requiring FEMA to make flood risk data and information publicly available through an open-source data system. FEMA would establish a searchable database with community information for NFIP participation. Personally identifiable information would not be included, and data would be at zip code or census block level. This data could help private insurers offer flood insurance and improve flood mitigation efforts. However, it may also lead to private insurers targeting overpriced NFIP policies, while the government retains subsidized policies. Section 506 of S. 1313 would limit the allowance paid to WYO companies to 27.9% of the chargeable premium for coverage and require FEMA to reduce costs for participating companies. Section 511 mandates the annual transfer of NFIP risk to private reinsurance or capital markets to cover probable maximum loss targets. S. 1313, Section 101, also requires annual risk transfers to maintain claim payment ability and limit exposure to catastrophic losses. Section 401 of S. 1313 proposes changes to the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement, allowing state-approved private insurance to fulfill it. The coverage required would be the lesser of 80% of the property purchase price, maximum NFIP coverage, or outstanding loan balance for multiunit structures. FEMA would need to report on the risk differences between properties insured by private flood insurance and NFIP policies within two years of enactment. Section 402 of S. 1313 allows temporary authority for WYO companies to sell private flood insurance for certain properties for the first two years after enactment. This includes non-residential properties, severe repetitive loss properties, business properties, or properties with flood-related damage exceeding fair market value. A study will be conducted to assess risk classification underwritten by WYO companies, and FEMA will determine if expanding flood insurance provision to other properties will not harm NFIP's risk diversity. The Administrator is authorized to expand the participation of WYO companies in the flood insurance marketplace. FEMA will study the feasibility of selling NFIP claims data to non-governmental entities while protecting policyholder privacy. FEMA may sell claims data as deemed appropriate, with proceeds going to the National Flood Insurance Fund. FEMA must create a searchable database of monthly claims filed and paid within a year of enactment. S. 1368, Section 302, limits reimbursement to WYO companies to 22.46% of chargeable premiums. Section 304 requires FEMA to reimburse WYO companies for actual costs only. S. 1571, Section 302, allows FEMA to consider various risk transfer options. Controversy surrounds NFIP. The NFIP faces controversy over insuring properties with multiple flood losses, leading to concerns about program costs and future insurability. Different definitions of repetitive loss are used for various NFIP applications and tracking purposes. According to FEMA, repetitive loss (RL) and severe repetitive loss (SRL) properties account for approximately $17 billion in claims, or about 30% of total claims in the NFIP. As of January 31, 2017, there were 90,000 insured repetitive loss properties and 11,000 insured severe repetitive loss properties, representing about 2% of overall policies in the NFIP. These properties have accounted for approximately $9 billion in claims, or about 16% of total claims in the program's history. Section 402 of the NFIP requires communities with repetitive flood loss properties to identify and assess risks, develop mitigation plans, or face sanctions from FEMA. Covered communities include those with 50 or more repetitive loss structures or five or more severe repetitive loss structures. FEMA requires covered communities with repetitive flood loss properties to conduct mitigation activities or face sanctions. Data on property addresses and dates of claims must be provided to assist in plan preparation. Notice of noncompliance and recommendations for action must be issued before sanctions are imposed. FEMA considers community resources before sanctioning. FEMA may consider community compliance with mitigation requirements when providing financial assistance. Section 504 introduces a new category of \"multiple-loss properties\" including repetitive, severe repetitive, and extreme repetitive loss properties. This may impose additional requirements on covered communities. The new definition of repetitive loss property includes structures with two or more separate flood damage claims. Extreme repetitive loss properties have claims exceeding 150% of maximum coverage. Premium rates for multiple-loss properties not paying full risk-based rates will increase by 10% per year until full rate is reached after three qualified claims. After three qualified claims payment, rates would increase at 15% per year until the full risk-based rate is reached. Severe repetitive loss properties and extreme repetitive loss properties would have a minimum annual deductible of $5,000. Flood insurance would not be available to extreme repetitive-loss properties with a flood loss claim payment if mitigation offer is refused. The section broadens the definition of repetitive loss properties, bringing more properties into multiple-loss categories. Only future claims would classify a property as multiple-loss, eliminating grandfathering after two future claims. Section 505 would stop new or renewed NFIP coverage. Section 505 of S. 1571 and H.R. 2874 would eliminate NFIP coverage for properties with excessive lifetime claims. The definition of repetitive loss structures differs slightly between the two bills. NFIP policyholders are required to purchase ICC coverage to comply with more rigorous standards. Increased Cost of Compliance Coverage is a separate insurance policy authorized by law to offset expenses of complying with building code standards. Rates and claim limits are set by FEMA, with premiums capped at $75 per year. ICC coverage provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses like elevating, demolishing, or flood-proofing buildings. This coverage is in addition to standard flood insurance policies. FEMA's ICC policy limits payments to $250,000 for residential structures and $500,000 for non-residential structures. The program has received $1.4 billion in premiums, paid $700 million in claims, and incurred $450 million in underwriting expenses. Between $100 million and $200 million is still owed on older claims. NFIP has lost money on ICC from 2007-2015, with $171 million in underwriting losses on $701 million in premiums. Elevation is the most common form of mitigation for ICC claims. The average cost of elevating a structure to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) ranges from $33,239 to $91,732. H.R. 2874 and Senate bills agree on the need to increase ICC coverage, with suggestions to raise the $30,000 limit. Section 403 would allow FEMA to offer additional ICC coverage up to $60,000 for a surcharge, expanding coverage to high-risk properties. S. 1313 and S. 1368 propose increasing ICC coverage to $75,000 and $100,000 respectively, exempting ICC payment amounts from the maximum payout of an NFIP policy. Private flood insurance policies would need to provide coverage that meets or exceeds the increased cost of compliance coverage under the NFIP. ICC coverage would be available to all NFIP policyholders, regardless of their location, if the community has established land use and control measures. Section 103 of S. 1571 proposes increasing primary ICC coverage to $60,000, with an option to purchase additional coverage up to $100,000. Policyholders can use ICC coverage for eligible project costs under various programs, regardless of their location if the community has established land use and control measures. The proposed section allows policyholders to use ICC coverage for eligible project costs under FMA, HMGP, or PDM programs for various projects. The bills include provisions for administrative reforms, pilot projects, and studies. Only disclosure requirements will be discussed in this report, as there is currently no flood risk disclosure requirement in place. Section 109 proposes a flood hazard disclosure requirement for property sellers or lessors to disclose past flood history, insurance claims, property designations, and federal obligations. This requirement aims to inform buyers of potential flood risks associated with the property. S. 1313, Section 203, would mandate property sellers or lessors to provide a FEMA flood risk information pamphlet and disclose past flood damage, insurance claims, property designations, and any requirement for flood insurance due to disaster assistance received. A 10-day disclosure period would be established. The disclosure requirement under S. 1368, Section 423, would mandate landlords to disclose flood zone information, insurance coverage, and contents coverage to tenants. This could lead to increased contents coverage uptake by renters. Additionally, S. 1571, Section 105, would restrict new flood insurance coverage after September 30, 2022, unless sellers provide property flood hazard disclosures. The property flood hazard disclosure requirement mandates sellers and landlords to disclose prior flood damage, insurance claims, property designation, and federal flood insurance obligations. The NFIP's role goes beyond insurance, including mapping flood hazards and offering grants for floodplain management. The NFIP aims to reduce flood risk through grants and incentives for investments in flood risk reduction. FEMA develops Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) with participating communities to identify flood risk zones and set insurance rates. The age and quality of flood maps vary across the country, with no consistent timetable for updates. FEMA is required to assess the need to update flood maps every five years based on natural hazards. Updates may be necessary due to new building developments, changes to flood protection systems, or environmental changes. The mapping process has been criticized for using outdated data and being time-consuming due to statutory consultation and appeals. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council (TMAC) was reestablished by Congress in BW-12 to review and recommend improvements to FEMA's national flood mapping program. TMAC submits annual reports to FEMA with evaluations and recommendations for enhancing the mapping program, including incorporating the best available climate science for assessing flood risks. The TMAC submits annual reports to FEMA with evaluations and recommendations for enhancing the national flood mapping program, including incorporating the best available climate science for assessing flood risks. FEMA is legally required to incorporate future risk assessments from the TMAC's Future Conditions report into any revision of the NFIP's FIRMs. FEMA must also include any other relevant information recommended by the TMAC in the updating of FIRMs. The statute does not specify how or when the Administrator should act on TMAC recommendations, but BW-12 mandates FEMA to report annually to Congress and OMB on TMAC recommendations and how they are being addressed to improve flood risk assessment. The TMAC provides recommendations to FEMA on improving flood insurance rate maps and flood risk data. FEMA is required to address TMAC recommendations in the annual report mandated by BW-12. TMAC recommended a shift to structure-specific flood risk assessment and risk-based structure-specific premiums. NFIP flood mapping is funded through annual discretionary appropriations and discretionary spending. In FY2015, $100 million was appropriated for flood hazard mapping and risk analysis. In FY2016, $190 million was appropriated, and in FY2017, $175.5 million was appropriated. The President's budget request for FY2018 proposed eliminating the discretionary appropriation for flood mapping, but Congress appropriated $262.5 million for flood hazard mapping and risk analysis in the FY2018 Omnibus. The Federal Policy Fee (FPF) funds FEMA for flood mapping, with Congress determining how much to spend from the fees collected. In recent years, Congress has generally followed FEMA's budget request for the Federal Policy Fee (FPF) revenue in appropriations bills. Congress directs that excess FPF revenue should be used for floodplain management and mapping. Before FY1986, program costs were funded through congressional appropriations, but since then, the NFIP has been required to cover all expenses with insurance premiums. GAO calculated that FEMA should collect $197 million from the FPF in 2017. Funding for floodplain mapping changed in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, requiring FEMA to establish the FPF to cover administrative expenses for flood insurance and management programs. FEMA disagreed with this change, arguing that the benefits of these programs are enjoyed by all communities, not just NFIP policyholders. About 66% of FPF resources are allocated to flood mapping, with 19% going to floodplain management. Section 302 proposes a new appeal process for updating flood maps based on new information, allowing communities to challenge FEMA's decisions. Concerns have been raised about funding for floodplain mapping and management as private flood insurance policies shift away from NFIP, potentially reducing funds collected through the FPF. Some stakeholders suggest implementing a user fee on private flood insurance to maintain funding levels. Section 306 of S. 1313 would require the TMAC to develop a procedure for mapping flood hazards in communities and states that choose to create alternative maps to FEMA's FIRMs. This would give states and local governments the ability to finance and develop their own FIRMs independently, subject to FEMA's final approval within six months. S. 1313, Section 404, would require insurance companies issuing private flood insurance policies to collect an annual surcharge transferred to FEMA. Section 501 reauthorizes the National Flood Mapping Program at $500 million annually. Section 502 mandates TMAC to develop mapping standards and procedures for states and local governments, with FEMA certification within 90 days. The certified map would be effective for three years without revisions. S. 1313, Section 503 promotes high-resolution mapping technology in FIRMs. Section 504 requires FEMA to update flood zone designations in levee-protected areas. S. 1368, Section 204 reauthorizes the National Flood Mapping Program at $800 million annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2023, emphasizing the use of updated mapping technology and structure-specific flood risk information. S. 1368, Section 208 mandates FEMA to create a new flood zone designation for areas behind non-accredited levees, providing flood insurance to properties within those areas. Section 209 establishes an appeal process for updating flood maps based on scientific or technical inaccuracies or risk mitigation factors. FEMA would be required to provide an opportunity for an administrative hearing and an appeal process for updating flood maps based on inaccuracies or risk mitigation factors. S. 1368 also includes provisions for refunding expenses and developing a fee schedule for private entities using flood maps. S. 1571 continues funding for the National Flood Mapping Program. FEMA, under S. 1571, is mandated to modernize flood mapping inventory using updated technology and develop a digital display of building-specific flood risk information within five years. While flood insurance aids in financial recovery post-flooding, mitigation efforts are crucial for preventing disasters and creating safer communities, ultimately saving money for individuals and taxpayers. The importance of FEMA's mitigation programs is highlighted by research showing that for every dollar invested in flood mitigation, society saved $7 in reduced future flood losses. FEMA encourages communities to adopt floodplain management regulations to reduce damage to structures. Mitigation activities funded by NFIP policyholders have been found to avoid significant losses. The NFIP offers programs like the Community Rating System, Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program, and Increased Cost of Compliance coverage to reduce flood risk. Insurance can incentivize policyholders and communities to address flood risk by rewarding risk reduction measures. However, a study found little evidence of active encouragement from governments or insurance companies in residential flood insurance markets. The NFIP offers programs to reduce flood risk, but there is little evidence of governments or insurance companies actively encouraging risk reduction. H.R. 2874 and Senate bills propose premium credits for mitigation measures in buildings where standard measures are not feasible. Section 113 would require FEMA to offer policyholders a reduction in the risk premium rate for approved mitigation actions. The proposed legislation aims to enhance mitigation techniques for flood risk reduction in urban areas, including elevating mechanical systems. It would require FEMA to offer premium reductions for approved mitigation methods and prioritize grants for property owners in high-risk areas. Funding of $225 million per fiscal year would be allocated to the program, with potential sources including penalties for non-compliance and recouped grant funds. S. 1313, Section 201 reallocates HFIAA surcharge to fund flood mitigation programs like PDM and FMA. Section 205 offers NFIP policyholders a one-time premium credit up to $500 for submitting necessary flood risk data. Section 206 authorizes FEMA to reduce policyholders' risk premium rate by at least 10% for approved flood risk mitigation actions. Section 202 of S. 1368 authorizes $1 billion for the FMA program over six fiscal years to prioritize properties with repetitive losses, unaffordable premiums, and losses exceeding property value. Section 203 allocates $500 million for the PDM program over the same period. Section 204 offers NFIP policyholders a one-time premium credit of up to $500 for obtaining an elevation certificate. Section 205 reallocates the HFIAA surcharge for affordability measures. Section 205 of S. 1368 reallocates the HFIAA surcharge to affordability and mitigation assistance. Section 206 authorizes FEMA to offer policyholders a reduction in risk premium rates for flood risk mitigation actions. Section 207 prioritizes flood mitigation activities benefiting entire communities. Section 422 appoints a regional coordinator for small communities in the CRS program. Section 104 of S. 1571 authorizes $200 million for the PDM program annually for six years. Section 106 of S. 1571 authorizes FEMA to offer policyholders a reduction in risk premium rates for flood risk mitigation actions, including alternative methods for multifamily buildings in urban areas. It also allows FEMA to require land use and control measures for mid-rise or high-rise multifamily buildings. Section 107 requires FEMA to appoint a regional coordinator to assist small communities in participating in the CRS program. The CRS program would be authorized to appropriate necessary funds for future flood mapping and climate change impacts. A 2013 report projected a 45% increase in the 1% annual-chance fluvial floodplain area by 2100 nationally, with no significant decreases in floodplain depth or area expected. Increased runoff from impermeable land surfaces due to population growth and development accounts for 30% of the projected increase, while 70% is attributed to climate change. The projected increase in the coastal Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) by 2100 is about 55%, with increased variability in expected total losses. Coastal flooding is a current concern, with nuisance flooding already occurring in many areas due to minor tidal flooding or rainstorms. The NFIP currently distinguishes between the SFHA and areas beyond it, but over 20% of claims are for properties outside SFHAs. Recent floods in South Carolina and Louisiana mainly affected properties not mapped in SFHAs, showing that flood risk varies inside and outside the SFHA boundary. Flood maps should depict the spectrum of risk rather than focusing solely on the SFHA boundary to avoid the false belief that properties outside the SFHA are safe. Future flood maps need to communicate that flood risk is not binary and varies spatially and temporally. Insurance policies based on FIRMs are not indicative of future flood risk, leading to potential costly assistance after disasters. The TMAC recommended FEMA adapt flood mapping to account for population growth, development, and increased future flood risk both inside and outside the floodplain. Assistance may be more costly than providing credible flood hazard data. FEMA needs additional funding for mapping and higher-quality data to identify future flood risks. New York City and FEMA are planning new maps to better account for future flood risk due to climate change. Flood insurance will still be priced against current flood risk. Floodplains and coastal areas in the US will likely continue to sustain damages from floods. The potential for large flood events to exceed private insurers' capacity and render the market insolvent is a concern. Flood risks are highly correlated, leading to widespread impacts when a large flood occurs. FEMA's report to Congress highlighted the necessity of government involvement in flood risk financing due to the nature of low-frequency, high-magnitude events with highly correlated risks. The NFIP has borrowing authority from Congress, but government intervention in paying for catastrophic floods is inevitable. The NFIP has borrowing authority from Congress but lacks a robust approach to repay catastrophic flood losses. Reinsurance purchases made by the program are insufficient to cover events like Hurricane Katrina or Sandy, which are within the expected range of NFIP losses. FEMA predicted a 1%-2% chance of a Katrina-level storm occurring in any given year and a 4%-5% chance for a Sandy-level storm. The 2017 hurricane season brought unexpected losses with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, making it the second-largest claims year in NFIP history. By June 30, 2018, NFIP had paid $10.426 billion in claims for these hurricanes. Total NFIP claims for Hurricane Harvey are estimated between $8.7 billion and $9.01 billion, for Hurricane Irma between $1.003 billion and $1.074 billion, and for Hurricane Maria between $25 million and $34 million. The National Research Council affordability report considered forgiving NFIP debt as an option. The NRC report suggested forgiving all or part of the NFIP debt and designating the Treasury as reinsurer for the NFIP to lower premiums, enhance affordability, and reduce disaster assistance spending. Congress could provide funds through the Disaster Relief Fund when annual losses exceed a certain threshold. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) argued that neither private insurers nor government entities can fully absorb catastrophic losses. Insurance systems have mechanisms to socialize risk of extreme events, such as a solvency standard based on a particular event. Premiums charged to policyholders would need to include a volatility loading to cover and eventually repay any debt from catastrophic events over a long time period. The AAA report suggests establishing a sufficiency standard for NFIP revenue to fully fund a maximum amount of short-term loss. Any losses exceeding this standard would be publicly funded, similar to how state guarantee funds reimburse policyholders for claims from insolvent private insurers. This explicit standard would provide clarity on NFIP funding. FEMA suggests analyzing various financial options for NFIP solvency after catastrophic events, including reserve funds, reinsurance, and a Treasury backstop. GAO emphasizes the importance of Congress's actions in this regard. The GAO emphasized the importance of Congress's actions in addressing affordability concerns and protecting NFIP's flood resilience activities. Premium rate reform is recommended to address outstanding debt and reduce the likelihood of future unpayable debt buildup. A central question for Congress is who should bear the costs of floodplain occupancy in the future, as outlined in the NRC study on affordability. Individual policyholders may bear the costs in various ways. The costs of floodplain occupancy are borne by individual policyholders through insurance premiums and deductibles, federal taxpayers through various assistance programs, and property owners for uninsured losses. Congress faces difficult policy choices in allocating these costs among stakeholders."
