    "content": "The 115th Congress discussed an omnibus water authorization bill with H.R. 8 and S. 2800. The House passed H.R. 8, which was then referred to the Senate EPW. The Senate EPW introduced an amendment titled America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. The Senate did not take up H.R. 8 or S. 2800, instead agreeing on new legislative text for a water authorization bill. The House amended an unrelated bill to include negotiated text for a water authorization bill, containing provisions from various pieces of legislation. The Senate can quickly consider the text, and if agreed upon without changes, it will be sent to the President for signature. Otherwise, the two chambers may resolve differences before the adjournment of the 115th Congress. Enactment of S. 3021 in the 115th Congress would likely halt further action on H.R. 8 or the Senate EPW-posted amendment to H.R. 8. Table 1 provides details on various legislative texts for omnibus water authorization as of October 2, 2018. The House and Senate discussed the impacts of WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 on federal and nonfederal investments in water infrastructure. There were also talks about restructuring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and addressing drinking water and water quality issues in communities and rural areas. AWIA 2018 and WRDA 2018 focused on authorizing water resource projects, dam and levee safety programs, and water quality and drinking water programs. Additionally, AWIA 2018 included provisions for tribal water-related programs and Department of the Interior authorities. This report provides an overview of WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018, focusing on authorizing water resource projects, dam and levee safety programs, and water quality and drinking water programs. Congress generally authorizes USACE water resource activities in authorization legislation prior to funding through appropriations. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) and the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) are recent omnibus USACE authorization bills. WRDA bills have time-limited authorizations and follow a biennial cycle. WIIN, enacted in December 2016, included titles on water-related programs and projects across various agencies. Title I of the bill, known as WRDA 2016, focused on USACE water resource authorizations. WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 included provisions for USACE activities such as new studies, projects, and modifications to existing authorizations. Both bills extended authorization of appropriations for federal levee safety and national dam safety programs beyond FY2019. Table 2 summarizes the differences between WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018. While WRDA 2018 focused on USACE water projects and dam safety, AWIA 2018 included provisions for EPA water programs and DOI authorities. AWIA 2018 included provisions for processing take permits for bald and golden eagles, Bureau of Reclamation's Fontenelle reservoir, water resources research institutes at state universities, and the use of geomatic data by federal and state agencies. It also addressed water-related programs for tribes, including Indian dam safety and irrigation authorities, and USACE housing. The provisions in AWIA 2018 addressed Indian dam safety, irrigation authorities, and USACE housing assistance related to dam construction in the Pacific Northwest. WRDA 2018 had fewer provisions affecting tribes, directly related to USACE activities. Hearings during the 115th Congress highlighted the importance of USACE activities in addressing water resource infrastructure demand and the agency's $96 billion backlog in construction activities. The backlog reflects costs for constructing and rehabilitating infrastructure, with a focus on federal funding and project authorization. Legislation like WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 address water project delivery and federal spending. Nonfederal entities have increased roles in project delivery and funding, with opportunities for federal credit and reimbursement. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) provided new financing authorities for water resource projects, including public-private partnerships (P3) and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) credit assistance program. Implementation challenges have been faced by USACE's WIFIA and P3 efforts. Balancing the benefits of improving water infrastructure with concerns about federal expenditures remains a challenge. Cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have influenced previous water authorization bills. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released cost estimates for various legislative bills related to water resource projects. Provisions in WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 addressed topics such as information dissemination, budget processes, nature-based projects, and innovative financing. These bills aimed to improve US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operations and efficiency. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released cost estimates for legislative bills related to water resource projects, including WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018. These bills aimed to improve US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operations and efficiency by addressing topics such as nonfederal water storage, pricing for water supply, and potential restructuring of USACE responsibilities. The Trump Administration proposed transferring navigation responsibilities to the Department of Transportation and other civil works responsibilities to the Department of the Interior. Numerous other USACE policies, authorities, and projects were also addressed in the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released cost estimates for legislative bills related to water resource projects, including WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018. These bills aimed to improve US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operations and efficiency by addressing topics such as nonfederal water storage, pricing for water supply, and potential restructuring of USACE responsibilities. WRDA 2018 and AWIA 2018 included project-specific provisions and numerous provisions related to specific river basins or states, shaping past debates of omnibus USACE authorization legislation. Congressional deliberations in the 115th Congress were influenced by these provisions. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up H.R. 8 with a provision related to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for navigation support. This provision was not included in the final version of H.R. 8 passed by the House. The HMTF provision would have allowed the Secretary of the Army to use funds from the HMTF for navigation maintenance costs. The 115th Congress also focused on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure issues. Numerous bills were introduced on these topics. Several bills have been introduced to amend EPA-administered programs under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and/or the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to address water infrastructure improvements. These bills aim to increase federal investment, promote resiliency and sustainability, and enhance compliance with CWA and SDWA mandates. Provisions in AWIA 2018, WRRDA 2014, and WIIN 2016 have also addressed water infrastructure programs administered by EPA, including the authorization of credit assistance for various water infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program provides assistance to state infrastructure finance authorities for water infrastructure projects eligible under the CWSRF and DWSRF programs. WRRDA 2014 and WIIN 2016 made revisions and amendments to the CWSRF and SDWA programs. AWIA 2018 included provisions for EPA-administered water quality infrastructure programs, such as grants for sewer overflow and stormwater management projects under Title V. AWIA 2018 proposed amendments to the Clean Water Act (CWA) to include sewer overflow and stormwater management projects for grants, authorize a technical assistance program for wastewater treatment works, and formalize EPA's integrated planning initiative. It also aimed to promote green infrastructure integration and codify regulations on water transfers. AWIA 2018 proposed amendments to the Clean Water Act (CWA) to include sewer overflow and stormwater management projects for grants, authorize a technical assistance program for wastewater treatment works, and formalize EPA's integrated planning initiative. It also aimed to promote green infrastructure integration and codify regulations on water transfers for commercial use. Additionally, Title V of AWIA 2018 would have made changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) provisions, including requirements for projects receiving assistance to use U.S.-produced iron and steel products, authorize EPA's WaterSense program, and revise the grant program for testing lead in school and childcare-program drinking water. AWIA 2018 included amendments to WIFIA, allowing for secured loans at subsidized interest rates for state SRF financing authorities. It also proposed a water infrastructure resiliency grant program, an Indian reservation pilot program, and water utility workforce development. Additionally, studies on \"intractable water systems\" and WIFIA accessibility were called for. In 2018, studies on \"intractable water systems\" and WIFIA accessibility for certain communities were called for. These water quality and drinking water provisions were described in Table 4, while WRDA 2018 did not contain these provisions."
