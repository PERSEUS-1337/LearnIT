    "content": "The \"Consumer Automobile Lease Advertising Improvement Act of 2001\" is referred to as the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The purpose of the Act is to make amendments and repeals related to consumer automobile lease advertising. The Congress finds that current automobile leasing practices lack consistent and adequate information for consumers to compare lease offerings. Important lease costs and terms are often not disclosed until the consumer visits a dealership, leading to confusion and misleading advertisements. The need for automobile manufacturers, dealers, and firms involved in leasing to provide transparent and easily understood information in advertising and at the dealership is crucial. This will allow consumers to make informed decisions when evaluating lease offers, comparing terms, and weighing the benefits of leasing versus purchasing. The purpose of amendments made by this Act is to provide consumers with clear information on lease terms and costs early in the process, allowing them to compare lease and purchase options and shop around for the best deal. SEC. 3. APPLICABLE CONSUMER LEASES amended to increase the limit on contractual obligation to $75,000 and adjust annually based on Consumer Price Index. SEC. 4. GENERAL LEASE ADVERTISING. Amendments to Section 184(a) (15 U.S.C. 1667c) include renumbering paragraphs, requiring identification of lease transactions in TV ads, and extending requirements to all consumer lease advertisements across various media platforms. Amendments to Section 184(a) (15 U.S.C. 1667c) extend requirements to all consumer lease advertisements in electronic media, including Internet web pages, e-mail, CD-ROMs, and interactive computer services. Conforming amendments are made to Section 184(c) (15 U.S.C. 1667c(c)). SEC. 5. Advertisement for automobile lease. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to require clear disclosure in automobile lease advertisements regarding the availability of the advertised payment amount for a single vehicle or a limited number of vehicles of the same make, model, and year. The Board shall set forth a lease payment formula based on the total capitalized cost of the advertised vehicle model, without adjustments for down payments or trade-ins, for a lease term of twenty-four months or as determined by the Board. The Board may determine a mileage allowance of 12,000 miles per year for a lease term in automobile lease advertisements. The lease payment amount stated in an advertisement can differ from the required amount based on the total capitalized cost of the vehicle model. The advertisement must clearly identify lease terms or payment amounts that explain any differences from the required lease payment amount stated in the advertisement. SEC. 6. AVAILABILITY OF LEASE INFORMATION. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to require automobile dealers engaging in advertising for consumer leases to provide clear and accurate information on customer incentives for each vehicle model offered. This information must be made available to the public in a format determined by the Board. Automobile dealers must provide clear information on customer incentives for each vehicle model offered, including special interest rates, incentives, and lease terms. This information must be prominently displayed in the dealership for consumers. The dealership must provide a clear document to consumers upon request, detailing rebates, money factor (lease interest rate), and vehicle residual value for each vehicle model. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Section 184 (15 U.S.C. 1667c) is amended to define \"clearly and conspicuously\" for print and video advertisements, specifying requirements for disclosures to be noticeable and comprehensible to consumers. In audio, video, and online advertising, disclosures must be clearly visible, audible, and easily accessible to consumers. In advertising, disclosures must be easily accessible under the label \"Important Information for Consumers\" and no techniques should obscure or detract from the communication of the disclosures. SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act by adding a new section on administrative enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission enforces compliance with section 184 of the chapter, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission has the authority to enforce these provisions on any person, regardless of their involvement in commerce or meeting jurisdictional tests. The Federal Trade Commission enforces compliance with section 184 of the chapter, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. A violation had been a violation of a Federal Trade Commission trade regulation rule. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 5 of the Truth in Lending Act is amended by adding at the end the following new item. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must issue regulations within 6 months of this Act to implement the amendments. These regulations will update lease disclosures and address consumer leasing issues to ensure compliance with the amendments and prevent circumvention."
