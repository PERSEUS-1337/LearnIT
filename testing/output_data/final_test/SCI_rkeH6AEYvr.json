A novel architecture is proposed that uses a top-down approach and a hard attention mechanism to selectively process informative image parts, leading to gains in performance with less FLOPs. The attention mechanism makes predictions more interpretable and allows for a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. The goal is to process images of arbitrary resolution to capture visual information with varying levels of detail. Global pooling in existing CNN architectures ignores spatial configuration, resulting in a bag of features output.

A novel architecture is proposed to address the receptive field problem and inefficient allocation of computational resources in fully convolutional processing. The proposed approach uses a top-down method and a hard attention mechanism to selectively process informative image parts, leading to improved performance with fewer FLOPs. The proposed architecture addresses the receptive field problem in fully convolutional processing by using a top-down approach and a hard attention mechanism to selectively process informative image regions. This approach aims to reduce computational waste on uninformative areas and improve performance with fewer FLOPs. The proposed architecture uses a top-down approach and hard attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions, reducing computational waste and improving performance with fewer FLOPs. The final latent representation is a combination of local features extracted at different levels. The model uses a top-down approach and attention mechanism to focus on key image regions, improving performance with fewer operations. It captures contextual and local information from different pyramid levels, outperforming baselines with larger receptive fields. The model utilizes attention mechanism to focus on key image regions, balancing accuracy and computational complexity. By inspecting attended regions, insights can be gained about the image parts valued most by the network. Various successful models have used attention in different problems, with technical differences between them. Our approach models image content as a hierarchical structure with a parsing tree, allowing for efficient indexing. We fall under the category of multi-scale processing methods, extracting features from multi-scale inputs. Our approach falls under the category of multi-scale processing methods, utilizing encoding schemes and encoding-decoding schemes to take advantage of the hierarchical nature of deep neural networks. Spatial modules are also incorporated to alter feature extraction between layers for computational efficiency. Our architecture utilizes multi-scale processing methods and spatial modules to take advantage of deep neural networks' hierarchical nature. In the example presented, the image is downscaled to 32 \u00d7 32 px in the first level for feature extraction, producing a feature vector V1. Moving to the second level, the last feature map F1 is fed for further processing. In the second processing level, the location module predicts important candidate locations within the image described by F1. It forms a 2x2 grid and yields 4 probabilities used to sample a hard attention mask. The corresponding regions are cropped and passed through the feature extraction module to create V21 and V23. These can be directly passed through the aggregation module to combine features into a single feature vector V. The merging module combines fine information (Vagg1) with context (V1) to create a comprehensive representation V1 for final prediction. Moving to a third level, F21 and F23 are used to create binary masks through the location module. V23 is excluded from location selection, resulting in Vagg21. The model architecture details and feature extraction process are explained in Appendices A.2 and A.3 respectively. The model is not fully differentiable due to Bernoulli sampling in location selection. The model architecture combines fine information with context to create a comprehensive representation for final prediction. A variant of REINFORCE is used to update parameters based on the probability of correct labels. The batch size is approximated with a Monte Carlo estimator for simplicity. A baseline and weighting hyperparameter are used to reduce variance in estimators. The objective function allows for updating parameters to maximize the probability of correct labels.

A variant of REINFORCE is used to update parameters based on the probability of correct labels. The batch size is approximated with a Monte Carlo estimator for simplicity. A baseline and weighting hyperparameter are used to reduce variance in estimators. The objective function allows for updating parameters to maximize the probability of correct labels by regulating the number of attended locations per image. The learning rule introduced in the current chunk focuses on encouraging exploration by adding a term to the attention policy. This term aims to diversify the learned attention policy by promoting the average probability of attending different candidate locations. A weighting hyperparameter is used to adjust the influence of this term. Additionally, gradual learning is emphasized, where the quality of updates depends on the Monte Carlo estimators and the number of processing levels in the model. The training strategy introduced in the current chunk is gradual learning, where the location module gradually learns which image parts are most informative by allowing additional processing levels at each training stage. This approach aims to narrow down the location sequences that have a high probability of being attended to, using a small number of samples to provide acceptable estimators. The learning rule used at each stage focuses on diversifying the attention policy to encourage exploration and adjust the influence of a weighting hyperparameter. The training strategy involves gradual learning with adjustable hyperparameters at each training stage. The model's accuracy improves with each additional processing level, but stopping early results in lower accuracy. This behavior highlights the need for a flexible model. The training strategy involves gradual learning with adjustable hyperparameters at each stage to improve model accuracy. Experimentation is done with MNIST and ImageNet datasets to test different aspects of the models' behavior. The MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9, with 10 different classes. The images are grayscale and 28 \u00d7 28 pixels in size. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. Modifications are made to create variations like noisy MNIST and textured MNIST, where noise and textures are added to the images. In textured MNIST, a textured background is added to the images, with example images provided for comparison between different models. The baseline model consists of the feature extraction module followed by the classification module, with fully connected layers accounting for aggregation and merging. Three pairs of models are created to study the architecture's performance. Three pairs of models are created to study the architecture's performance. BL 1 has 1 convolutional layer with a receptive field of 3 \u00d7 3 px, BL 2 has 2 convolutional layers with a receptive field of 8 \u00d7 8 px, and BL 3 has 3 convolutional layers with a receptive field of 20 \u00d7 20 px. All models have a base resolution of 14 \u00d7 14 px and consider 9 candidate locations on a 3 \u00d7 3 grid with 50% overlap. Training involves using MNIST-based datasets with resolutions of 56 \u00d7 56 px, rescaled to 2 additional resolutions. The study involves training models with images of different resolutions (14 \u00d7 14 px, 28 \u00d7 28 px) in 3 sessions. The models are evaluated on plain, textured, and noisy MNIST datasets with random variations in digit positions, backgrounds, and noise patterns. The models go through 1 processing level due to input resolution matching the base resolution. In the second training session with images of resolution 28 \u00d7 28 px, the model M i can use the location module and extend processing to 2 levels by assigning different values to hyperparameter c t (2). This results in models with varying computational cost and accuracy, referred to as BL 28 i and M. In the third session with images of resolution 56 \u00d7 56 px, M i can go through 3 processing levels. In the third training session, models BL and M can process images of resolution 56 \u00d7 56 px through 3 levels. Results show performance graphs for all models on plain MNIST, demonstrating interpretability of decisions with an attention mechanism. Models M3 and BL3 are compared on images of different resolutions, with some achieving the same accuracy level. The green markers represent models BL 28 3 and M 28,2.2 3 3, which show higher accuracy compared to BL 3. As input resolution and attended locations increase, accuracy also increases, following a logarithmic curve trade-off between computation and accuracy. The location module focuses on digits, leading to over 99% accuracy. However, there are cases where digits are misinterpreted due to partially covered attended locations. The attended locations provide important insights into the performance of the attention mechanism. The model doesn't offer any advantage in feature extraction for better accuracy due to the size of the images and receptive field. Increasing input resolution or reducing the baseline's receptive field may lead to improved accuracy. In Fig. 4 (b), models M2 and BL2 show differences in accuracy, with BL562 performing lower than BL282 due to its smaller receptive field. This affects feature extraction for classification. Results on textured and noisy MNIST also support this analysis, showing the robustness of the attention mechanism. Additional remarks on the results are provided in Appendix A.5.3. In Fig. 3 of Appendix A.5.3, additional remarks on the results of ImageNet data are provided. The dataset used contains 1,000 classes of natural images with training and validation sets of 1,281,167 and 50,000 images, respectively. The models created follow design principles from Section 5.1, with Model BL1 having 3 convolutional layers. Top-1 accuracy on the validation set is plotted against the required number of FLOPs per image on the x-axis. Model BL 1 has 3 convolutional layers with a receptive field of 18 \u00d7 18 px, while BL 2 has 4 convolutional layers with a receptive field of 38 \u00d7 38 px. The models have a base resolution of 32 \u00d7 32 px and consider 9 candidate locations in a 3 \u00d7 3 grid with 50% overlap. Training involves rescaling images to 4 different resolutions {32, 64, 128, 256} for 4 training sessions. Multi-level learning is used to train models for high accuracy at each processing level. Architecture details are provided in Appendix A.6.1. The models BL 1 and BL 2 have different convolutional layers and receptive fields. Training involves rescaling images to 4 resolutions for high accuracy. Models demonstrate a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The performance gap between models M 1 and BL 1 is bigger due to BL models lacking coarse information. Models M ml 2 and M ml 1 can adjust computational requirements during testing by controlling processing levels, maintaining comparable performance to models M r 2 and M r 1. This flexibility is beneficial for varying image difficulty and computational constraints. The proposed novel architecture can process images of any resolution without losing spatial information by using a top-down image pyramid traversal for feature extraction. An attention mechanism allows for adjusting computational requirements by changing the number of attended locations. Insights into model decisions can be gained by examining the attended image regions. Future research directions are also highlighted. Future research directions include improving the localization capabilities of the attention mechanism, applying the model to budgeted batch classification, and making the feature extraction process more adaptive. The model consists of a feature extraction module, a location module, and an aggregation module. The model includes a feature extraction module, a location module, an aggregation module, a merging module, and a classification module. The feature extraction process involves reorganizing input vectors into a tensor for final output. The merging module concatenates two vectors, while the classification module outputs class probabilities after receiving logits. The model features a softmax layer for class probabilities and a recursive equation for feature extraction. The REINFORCE rule emerges when optimizing log likelihood with attended locations as latent variables. The log likelihood for a batch of images is calculated based on the image, label, and model parameters. Equation 8 describes the log likelihood of labels based on location sequences. By maximizing the lower bound F, the log likelihood is maximized. The update rule involves the partial derivative of F with respect to model parameters. Equation 10 is derived using the log derivative trick, requiring an expectation calculation for each image using a Monte Carlo estimator. We approximate expectations using a Monte Carlo estimator with M samples, obtaining samples from p(l i |x i , w) by processing image x i. To reduce variance, we use a baseline technique from Xu et al. (2015) based on an exponential moving average of log likelihood. The learning rule is updated after each batch, simplifying notation by considering batch size as NM. The text discusses the calculation of quantities p lit and p k in regularization terms, based on the introduced notation. It explains how p lit approximates the expected number of attended locations for an image, and how p k computes the average probability of attending a specific location. The values of c t and c r are noted to be interdependent. Additionally, architectures are provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The text provides details on training models (M i, BL i) with MNIST-based datasets, optimizing cross entropy loss for BL i and using learning rule (4) for M i. M i behaves like a regular CNN with a feature extraction module and classification module. Hyperparameters include a learning rate of 0.01 dropping by a factor of 0.2 after 80% and 90% completion. The training process involves using a learning rate of 0.01 that decreases by 0.2 after 80% and 90% completion. Models M3 and BL3 are utilized with MNIST datasets, employing the Adam optimizer with default values. Data augmentation includes random changes to digit position, noise pattern, and background for regularization. Xavier initialization is used for weights and zero initialization for biases. In the training sessions, data augmentation involves random changes to digit position, noise pattern, and background for regularization. The learning rule for M i is optimized using cross entropy loss, with a resolution allowing M i to go through 2 processing levels. Gradients' flow is stopped from the location module to other modules to control how the location module learns. Regularization terms are set at \u03bb f = 10 \u22126 , \u03bb r = 10 \u22127 and \u03bb t = 10 \u22127. In the third training session, hyperparameters \u03bb f = 10 \u22126 , \u03bb r = 10 \u22127, and \u03bb t = 10 \u22127 are used with 2 samples for Monte Carlo estimators. Models M i in Figure 4 are trained with c t = 2 and can go through 3 processing levels. Gradual learning occurs in 2 stages, with the first stage equivalent to the previous training session. Gradual learning involves training models with images of increasing resolution, benefiting both baselines and models. This method creates an imbalance in training M i and BL i, evolving in multiple stages. It can be applied to baselines as well, leading to higher accuracy in some cases when models are trained from scratch. These modifications were experimented with on the ImageNet dataset. Our experimentation with ImageNet showed consistent results on MNIST-based datasets even with simplified training procedures. Models trained with gradual learning and higher resolution achieved higher accuracy, suggesting the importance of fine information in distinguishing digits from background distractions. Our models show robustness to distracting textured backgrounds compared to baselines, with differences in accuracy between models M1 and BL1 being more significant than previously recorded. Despite processing higher resolution images, model M56,6.13 struggles with accuracy due to intense high frequency noise, resulting in a drop in performance. The explanation provided adds a new dimension to understanding the models, highlighting the impact of high frequency noise on accuracy. Details of model architectures and training processes are provided for models M1 and BL1. The distinction between the two models lies in the training process and hyperparameter values used. The resolution of model M1 matches the input image size of 32 \u00d7 32 px. The model goes through 1 processing level without using the location module. The learning rule used is the first term of LF, optimizing cross entropy of labels. Hyperparameters include a learning rate of 0.001 that drops by a factor of 0.2 after 80% and 90% of training steps, training for 200 epochs with batches of size 128. The Adam optimizer is used with default values, xavier initialization for weights, and zero initialization for biases. Data augmentation similar to Szegedy et al. (2015) is used for regularization. Models M2 and BL2 architectures are used in experiments on ImageNet. The architectures of models M2 and BL2 used in ImageNet experiments include a global average pooling layer. Image crops are resized with interpolation methods and randomly flipped horizontally. Photometric distortions are applied, and final image values are scaled between -1 and 1. This data augmentation strategy is consistent across training sessions. In the second training session, hyperparameter values are optimized for cross entropy loss and learning rule for M i. The input resolution allows M i to go through 2 processing levels, with gradients' flow stopped from the location module. Hyperparameter values are consistent in the remaining training sessions. Models M 64 i are trained with c t \u2208 {1.5, 4.5}. During the training sessions, models M1282 and M1281 are trained with different values of ct. Gradual learning is used for BLi and Mi, with parameters initialized based on previous models. Cross entropy loss is optimized for training BLi and Mi in each session."
