    "content": "The Act titled \"Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008\" focuses on advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicle technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program. The Secretary will establish a program to provide grants for projects advancing research and development of advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicles. Selection criteria will be based on the ability to complete program phases and priority will be given to applicants with the best capabilities. The program will give priority to applicants who can fill research gaps, achieve technological advances, reduce fuel consumption, and emissions. Applicants can partner with other entities for projects. The Secretary will publish a request for applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment, with a deadline for applications 90 days later. The Secretary will select grant recipients through a competitive process within 90 days of the application deadline. The number of grants awarded will be based on technical merits, ranging from 3 to 7 with at least half for plug-in hybrid technology. Each recipient can receive up to $3,000,000 per year for a 3-year project. Each grant recipient can receive $3,000,000 per year for a 3-year project. Recipients must complete two phases, with phase one involving research and demonstration of advanced hybrid technology in heavy-duty vehicles. A report on vehicle performance must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days of phase one completion. Phase one of the grant program involves testing vehicle components like the battery, energy management system, charging system, and power controls. It also includes assessing the projected cost, emissions levels, and may be terminated if requirements are not met. Phase one of the grant program lasts for one year upon receiving the grant. The Secretary will establish standard testing procedures for recipients to test vehicle performance under typical conditions. In phase two, recipients must showcase advanced manufacturing processes by producing or retrofitting 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. A report analyzing the technological advancements must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days of completing phase two. Phase two of the grant program involves analyzing technological challenges in developing and mass producing advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. It also includes researching alternative power train designs for these vehicles. This phase lasts for two years. The grant program involves researching advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles, comparing costs, emissions reductions, and fuel savings with non-hybrid designs. A report will be submitted to Congress within 60 days of receiving grant reports. The grant program involves funding projects for producing or retrofitting vehicles with a focus on fuel efficiency. The Secretary must coordinate activities to avoid duplication with other programs. Cost sharing requirements from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 apply to the program. The Secretary will establish a pilot program to research the impact of plug-in hybrid vehicles on the electric grid. Definitions include \"advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle\" and \"greenhouse gas\" referring to carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The Secretary will establish a pilot program to research the impact of plug-in hybrid vehicles on the electric grid. Definitions include \"advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle\" and \"greenhouse gas\" referring to carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Authorization of appropriations is set at $16,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2011. The authorized funds of $1,000,000 per fiscal year can be used for studies, pilot programs, and program administration. The United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 is amended to include research on hybrid technology for large vehicles weighing over 16,000 pounds."
