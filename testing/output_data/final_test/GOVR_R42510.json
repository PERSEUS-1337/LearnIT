    "content": "China is a major global producer of rare earth elements, critical for high-tech applications and clean energy products. The Chinese government has prioritized the development of rare earth resources since the 1980s. In the 1990s, Chinese leaders emphasized the strategic importance of rare earth resources, leading to government support for the industry. China's dominance in rare earth production, with over 97% of global supply, has been facilitated by low labor costs and lax environmental standards. Recent restructuring and export restrictions by China have impacted global rare earth availability, causing concerns among businesses and foreign governments. China's rare earth policies have raised concerns among many in Congress and foreign governments due to potential business risks and geopolitical implications. Export restrictions by China have disrupted global rare earth supplies, impacting U.S. industries such as high technology and defense. China's dominance in rare earth production has led to sharp price increases outside China. Some believe China's export restrictions are aimed at giving domestic users a competitive advantage. China's rare earth policies have raised concerns among many in Congress and foreign governments. Export restrictions by China have disrupted global rare earth supplies, impacting U.S. industries. China's dominance in rare earth production has led to sharp price increases outside China. Members have expressed concerns about China's virtual monopoly of rare earths impacting U.S. economic and security interests. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to address these concerns. A caucus on rare earths was established in late 2011 to reduce U.S. dependence on China. The report provides an overview of the U.S. dispute with China over rare earth exports, including trade levels, impact on U.S. firms, motivations behind China's restrictions, and responses from the U.S. and other major users. It also examines China's rare earth industry and government policies. Rare earths are not actually rare but are abundant in the earth's crust. However, they are difficult to mine and separate economically due to their scattered nature. Complex separation processes are required to extract individual rare earth elements from the ore. For more information on rare earths from a resource supply chain and national defense perspective, refer to CRS Report R41347 and CRS Report R41744. The separation process drives the cost of rare earth production. Rare earth elements are divided into light and heavy groups. China is the major supplier of both light and heavy rare earths. Separating rare earth metals produces toxic pollutants and hazardous waste. The Mountain Pass mine in the United States produced large amounts of salty wastewater containing radioactive thorium and uranium in the 1990s. Cleaning operations led to hazardous waste spills in the desert, prompting cleanup orders from California. Molycorp, a unit of Unocal, faced waste storage issues and eventually shut down the mine in 2002. Chevron's acquisition of Unocal in 2005 will be discussed later in this report. Rare earth elements have various applications across industries. Rare earths have extensive applications in various industries such as petroleum refining, automotive, electronics, and clean energy technologies. Their super magnetic strength is crucial for military applications like precision bombs and target designation lasers. China has become the dominant producer of rare earth metals. China has become the world's dominant producer, user, and exporter of rare earth elements, with a 97.3% global mine production share. In 2011, China's rare earth exports were valued at $3.4 billion, with Japan being the largest export market (66%), followed by the United States (7%). The US and other countries are dependent on China for rare earth materials. The value of U.S. rare earth imports from China increased significantly from 2002 to 2011, with a 1,376% rise. In 2011, the value of U.S. rare earth imports from China was $523 million, comprising 0.13% of total U.S. imports from China. The U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports decreased in 2011, with a 50.8% drop in imports and a 107.6% increase in imports from other sources. The quantity of U.S. rare earth imports from China dropped by 50.8% from 2010 to 2011, while imports from Japan increased by 107.6%. This decline was attributed to rising prices of Chinese rare earths and the global economic slowdown. The value per metric ton of rare earth imports from China significantly increased from $3,111 in 2002 to $76,239 in 2011, a 2,432% rise. The United States was the top rare earth producer until the 1980s, when China flooded the market with increased production, supported by the Chinese government. China's efforts to dominate the rare earth market led to a rapid increase in production, causing mines in the United States and elsewhere to go out of business. China now produces nearly all of the world's rare earths, with key deposits in Inner Mongolia, California, and Australia. China is estimated to have half of the world's total rare earth reserves. China has the world's largest rare earth reserves, with the Baiyun Obo deposit in Inner Mongolia accounting for over 83% of China's reserves. The heavy rare earths are mainly found in southern China, particularly in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. China is the leading producer of rare earths globally. China is the leading producer of rare earths globally, with significant supplies of both light and heavy rare earths. The Baiyun Obo deposit in Inner Mongolia is the world's largest rare earth mine, with a total reserve of about 36 million tons. Rare earth minerals are recovered as byproducts during iron ore mining at Baiyun Obo, primarily for steel making by Baotou Iron and Steel. Baotou Research Institute of Rare Earths, established in 1963, is now the largest rare earth research facility in China. Baotou Steel's Rare Earth Hi-Tech (Group) Company, the biggest rare earth producer in China, accounts for nearly half of China's production and 44% of global rare earth production. In the late 1970s, China's rare earth production was minimal but increased significantly in the 1980s. In the 1980s, China's rare earth industry saw significant growth with improved techniques, strong demand, and market-oriented policies. China became the world's top producer in 1986, leading to fierce competition and price drops due to overcapacity. By 2005, average rare earth prices in China hit a historic low of about US$5.50 per kilogram. China's rare earth prices dropped to a historic low of about US$5.50 per kilogram by 2005. Due to abundant and cheap rare earths from China, most mines outside China closed by the early 2000s. China invested in refining technologies, using cheaper processes and higher purity extractions. China's rare earth exports sharply rose from 1995 to 2003 but declined after 2008. During the 1990s and early 2000s, China's rare earth production led to a fragmented industry with reckless mining practices, ignoring safety regulations, and intense competition for export deals. This resulted in environmental degradation, low prices, and smuggling of about 20,000 tons of rare earths in 2008. In 2008, tons of rare earths were smuggled from China, accounting for one-third of the total volume leaving the country. This smuggling contributes to discrepancies between official statistics and actual data on rare earth production and exports. Chinese officials are concerned about rapid depletion of their rare earth resources, as the country mines over 95% of the global supply despite holding less than half of total global reserves. Overproduction and illegal mining pose environmental degradation risks. Overproduction and illegal mining in rare earth mining areas in China have led to environmental degradation, with incidents of water system and farmland contamination. Poorly constructed and maintained local mines in the 1990s left behind polluted soil and water. In 2011, toxic rare earths were found in tea products, including a batch of Lipton tea produced and sold in China by Unilever. China aims to consolidate rare earth production and establish a more sustainable supply chain. The country's export prices are deemed too low given its monopoly position, prompting policies to regulate production, stabilize prices, and control exports. This strategy is intended to move China up the supply chain and promote the development of rare earth applications and end products. China's policy measures aim to regulate rare earth production, stabilize prices, and control exports. Export quotas, duties, and license requirements have caused global concerns by distorting trade and granting Chinese companies easier access to rare earths. China's decrease in rare earth exports since 2006 has led to supply uncertainties, price increases, and industries being forced to raise prices or relocate to China. Since the early 1990s, China has been developing production plans for rare earths, issuing production quotas to mining companies. Despite quotas, actual output has exceeded targets. In 2008, regulations were implemented to control the industry. The Chinese government implemented a development plan from 2008 to 2015 to protect and control the exploration and production of rare earth minerals like tungsten and antimony. They also increased the resource tax on rare earths and built strategic reserves to regulate supply and influence the global market. China is increasing its control over rare earth minerals by stockpiling and establishing national rare earth regions to regulate supply and prices globally. The government aims to consolidate the industry under a few state-owned firms to prevent oversupply. The Chinese government aims to control the rare earth sector by consolidating it under state-owned firms in three production districts: North, South, and West. This plan is part of efforts to regulate global supply and prices, prevent oversupply, and establish two production systems for light and medium-to-heavy rare earths. In northern China, Baotou Steel Rare Earth High-Tech Co. has been selected as the leading company for industry consolidation, with the government ordering the closure of 31 private rare earth companies and the merger of 4 others into Baotou Rare Earth. The goal is to create a unified front for the Chinese rare earth industry, but balancing interests among stakeholders has been challenging. In northern China, Baotou Steel Rare Earth High-Tech Co. is leading industry consolidation, with the closure of 31 private rare earth companies and the merger of 4 others into Baotou Rare Earth. In the more fragmented southern market, big companies are competing for dominance, with local governments and stakeholders resisting consolidation to protect local mineral deposits. The government plans to consolidate the rare earth industry in southern China, aiming for three companies to control 80% of production within the next few years. The Chinese government plans to consolidate the rare earth industry, with state-owned companies holding major stakes. There are concerns about balancing central and local interests, economic growth, and employment. The government aims to control rare earth mining and may limit sales to foreign buyers. The government is committed to controlling rare earth mining by maintaining export quotas, suspending new production licenses, and cracking down on illegal activities. They aim to consolidate the industry, reduce the number of miners and smelters, phase out outdated practices, and encourage technological upgrades. Foreign companies are prohibited from mining rare earths. The Chinese government has strict regulations on rare earth mining and trade, including banning foreign companies from mining rare earths in China. Sino-foreign joint ventures are allowed to export products under a licensing system managed by the Ministry of Commerce, with the number of licensed companies gradually decreasing in recent years. In 2012, only 9 companies were allocated first-round export quotas. In 2012, the Chinese government allocated first-round export quotas to 9 companies for rare earth products, with 17 companies awaiting inspection results to potentially increase the total to 26 companies with export permits. Export duties on rare earth products have increased over the years, ranging from 15% to 25%, with additional categories added in 2011, such as ferroalloys with over 10% rare earth elements facing a 25% export duty. China imposes export duties, licenses, and quotas on rare earth elements. Quotas are allocated to domestic firms and joint-ventures with foreign investors, with reductions in total quotas between 2005 and 2010 due to increased domestic demand. In 2011, only half of the export quota was filled due to sluggish global demand and decreasing prices. Manufacturers sought to reduce reliance on China's rare earth supply. Many manufacturers are reducing rare earth usage and seeking alternative materials to lower costs and lessen dependence on Chinese supply. Toyota is developing a new electric motor for hybrid cars that eliminates rare earth magnets. General Electric announced wind turbine generators that reduce rare earth dependence. W.R. Grace & Co. is selling an oil-refining catalyst with reduced rare earth usage. China plans to keep its 2012 rare earth export. China announced that it would maintain its 2012 rare earth export quotas at higher levels than expected, with a focus on conserving resources and protecting the environment. The government allocated quotas to companies meeting environmental standards, splitting them into light and medium-heavy rare earths categories for the first time. This indicates a stricter approach to rare earth exports. Foreign companies are restricted from rare earth mining and smelting in China without a domestic partner. They can invest in downstream processing and new applications. Regulations prohibit foreign companies from engaging in rare earth mining and smelting projects independently, requiring joint ventures with Chinese partners. Foreign companies are encouraged to invest in downstream rare earth processing in China and develop new applications. China's policies on rare earth exports aim to attract foreign companies to move production facilities to China in exchange for a stable supply of rare earths. Japanese manufacturers using rare earths have been urged to relocate their plants to China for a steady supply. In September 2011, Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang expressed interest in technical cooperation with Japan on rare earth industries, citing Japan's advanced technology in this field. Japanese firms like Hitachi Metals and Toyota were considering moving production to China to access rare earths. This aligns with China's goal of expanding its rare earth industry into more advanced processing sectors. China is aiming to become a global leader in innovation and high technology by expanding its rare earth industry. Foreign companies are being incentivized to move factories to China, with about 50 already operating in Inner Mongolia. China's strategy involves technology exchange for resources, causing concerns due to its restrictive export regime. The Chinese government's \"resources for technology\" strategy, coupled with a strict export regime, has raised global concerns. Foreign companies fear that China is leveraging rare earth resources to attract investments for advanced technologies, potentially creating direct competition. Non-Chinese manufacturers are worried about technology transfer and intellectual property infringement risks. For instance, Intematix, a company based in Fremont, CA, took precautions when hiring Chinese scientists for its new factory in China to protect its chemical formulas. China's major state-owned companies are actively seeking raw material supplies domestically and overseas, especially in energy and mining assets. This trend, known as \"going global,\" has increased since the global recession in 2008, making investment prices more reasonable. Chinese companies have made acquisition bids for rare earth mines outside China, such as Molycorp in the United States and Lynas in Australia. This wave of investments is driven by a tightened credit market and the need for financial investments in mining companies and resources-rich regions. In 2005, China's CNOOC made an $18.5 billion bid to acquire Unocal, facing opposition from U.S. leaders concerned about Chinese control of U.S. oil reserves. CNOOC dropped the bid, with analysts speculating interest in Unocal's assets in Southeast Asia. Little attention was paid to the sale of the rare earth resource at Mountain Pass during this time. Chevron acquired Unocal in 2005, including Molycorp and the Mountain Pass mine. Molycorp Minerals LLC later acquired the facility and began processing rare earth materials. In 2011, Molycorp started mining fresh ore at Mountain Pass and announced plans to acquire Neo Material Technologies in 2012. Molycorp intended to export rare earths to China for processing into magnetic materials. Some industry officials and policymakers are concerned that a deal involving China's dominance in rare earth production could hinder the US's development in rare earth processing. In 2009, China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining (Group) Co. tried to acquire a stake in Lynas Corporation, but the Australian government requested changes to the deal. China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining (CNMC) withdrew its offer after Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) requested ownership to be less than 50% and fewer Board Director positions. China's export restrictions on raw materials, including antimony, rare earths, and tungsten, have raised concerns about its dominance in global production. China's export restrictions on various mineral commodities have been criticized by the WTO for reducing export volumes and benefiting domestic processors. This has raised concerns about China's dominance in global production of raw materials like antimony, rare earths, and tungsten. China's export restrictions on rare earth elements have led to global shortages and price increases. China reduced its export quota by 70% in 2010, causing a sharp decline in foreign demand. This shift in trade terms has favored China, impacting the global market for rare earths. The 2011 surge in rare earth prices led to unsustainable levels for the industry, with U.S. imports from China increasing by nearly 10-fold from January 2010 to January 2011. Prices peaked at $158,389 in September 2011 before sharply declining to $46,694 per metric ton in February 2012, still significantly higher than in February 2010. The drop in Chinese rare earth prices after September 2011 was attributed to a sharp decline in foreign demand due to various factors. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the distribution of rare earths by end use in the United States in 2011. In July and August 2011, U.S. firms like General Electric and Intematix raised concerns over high-priced rare earth imports from China affecting production costs. General Electric stated rare earth costs had increased significantly, with some materials experiencing up to 2,000% price hikes. Intematix responded to rare earth shortages by moving manufacturing to China and developing alternative phosphors in the U.S. In September 2011, American Elements, a U.S. chemical company, expressed concerns about the high cost of rare earths impacting wind turbine and electric motor production. Danfoss North America's president also highlighted China's rare earth elements strategy as a threat to U.S. industries and innovation. In October 2011, Peter Dent, VP of Electron Energy Corporation, testified about the impact of quota reductions on rare earth prices and availability. Customers are redesigning products to use less rare earths due to high costs and uncertain supply. This has led to a shift towards investing in capital equipment and workforce training for international competitiveness. The impact of quota reductions on rare earth prices and availability has led to customers redesigning products to use less rare earths. This shift has resulted in investments in capital equipment, workforce training, and facilities expansion to enhance international competitiveness. The huge price gap between Chinese rare earths consumed domestically and exported puts Chinese industrial users at a competitive advantage. There is a risk of unintended technology transfer to China, leading to irreversible loss of intellectual property. Rising costs of rare earths have affected major producers like Seagate Technologies and Western Digital. The rising costs of rare earth from July 2011 to September 2011 significantly impacted the net income of Seagate Technologies and Western Digital Corp. China's efforts to tighten rare earth export restrictions may be to ensure domestic firms have adequate access due to global demand surpassing supply. Analysts predict China may struggle to meet domestic demand, leading to further export limitations or seeking rare earths abroad. China's consumption of its rare earth production has increased from 26.2% in 2000 to 64.2% in 2010. China's export quotas and restrictions on rare earths have led to significantly higher prices for Chinese rare earth exports compared to domestic users. This has prompted calls for trade action against China from stakeholders in the United States, Japan, and the EU. In September 2010, the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy filed a Section 301 petition with the USTR addressing China's rare earth policies. In 2010, the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union filed a petition with the USTR regarding China's export restrictions on rare earths. The petition highlighted China's use of export duties, quotas, and licensing procedures to dominate the global market in rare earth minerals, impacting trade and competition in the green technology sector. The USTR focused its investigation on Chinese subsidies given to domestic wind turbine manufacturers in exchange for using Chinese-made components. In December 2010, the United States initiated a WTO dispute resolution case against China for discriminatory subsidies. China agreed to remove the subsidies in February 2011. In March 2012, President Obama announced a joint WTO case with Japan and the EU against China's restrictive policies on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum. The dispute affected various U.S. industries like hybrid cars, advanced electronics, wind turbines, and medical equipment. China's export restrictions on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum have been criticized by U.S., Japan, and EU for violating international trade rules and causing disruptions in global supply chains. The restrictions include export duties, quotas, and additional requirements that harm producers and consumers worldwide. China's export restrictions on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum have faced criticism for violating international trade rules. The restrictions involve fees, formalities, and minimum export price requirements that discriminate against foreign-invested firms. A WTO dispute case involving the United States, Japan, and the EU is similar to a previous case against China in 2009 over export restrictions on raw materials. China's export restrictions on various raw materials, including bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon metal, silicon carbide, yellow phosphorus, and zinc, are criticized by the United States for artificially lowering prices for Chinese firms to gain a competitive advantage. This practice creates disadvantages for foreign producers and can pressure them to relocate their operations. In July 2011, a WTO panel ruled that China's export quotas and duties on certain raw materials violated its WTO commitments. China failed to justify export restrictions based on conservation of resources or pollution prevention. The panel also found issues with China's export licensing regime. On January 30, 2012, a WTO Appellate Body affirmed that China's export quotas and taxes on raw materials violated WTO rules. This decision was hailed as a victory for the United States, ensuring fair competition for manufacturing industries. Analysts believe that the ruling influenced major users of rare earths like the EU and Japan, who were waiting for the outcome before taking action. China's control over rare earths is seen as a potential bargaining chip for political and economic advantages. A collision between Chinese and Japanese vessels in disputed waters led to a diplomatic dispute, with China halting rare earth exports to Japan as a threat. China halted rare earth exports to Japan as a threat, leading to concerns in the West about China's control of rare earths. Despite China denying reports, the embargo appeared to extend to the US and EU. Eventually, rare earth exports to Japan resumed with some delays, causing fluctuations in trade data. China's actions were viewed as using rare earths as a bargaining chip. The Chinese embargo on rare earth exports to Japan raised concerns about China's control of rare earths and its willingness to use economic warfare. Despite denials, the embargo affected the US and EU, causing trade disruptions. China's actions were seen as leveraging rare earths for strategic purposes. China's control of rare earths raised concerns about economic warfare, but there won't be an embargo as China aims for sustainable development. Congress introduced bills to address U.S. dependence on China for rare earths, promoting R&D in the U.S. In 2011, a Rare Earth Caucus was formed to raise awareness about China's trade policies. The letter from Senators urged the Obama Administration to oppose Chinese financing for rare earth projects and impose restrictions on Chinese investment in the US. President Obama announced plans to create a Trade Enforcement Unit to investigate unfair trade practices, specifically targeting countries like China. The Trade Enforcement Unit will investigate unfair trade practices, focusing on countries like China. Representatives urged President Obama to address China's restrictions on raw materials, particularly rare earth exports. They recommended targeting restrictions, quotas, and embargoes in the rare earth market. The Department of Energy's Critical Materials Strategy report highlighted the importance of rare earth metals in clean energy technologies. The 2011 report highlighted the role of rare earth metals and other key materials in clean energy technologies. It identified supply challenges for rare earth metals like dysprosium, neodymium, terbium, europium, and yttrium, which may impact clean energy technology deployment in the future. The report also mentioned other critical elements like cerium, indium, lanthanum, and tellurium that are expected to be near-critical in the medium term. The DOE's strategy for addressing critical materials challenges includes developing diversified global rare earth supply chains. The Department of Energy (DOE) is focusing on reducing supply risks in global rare earth supply chains by developing substitutes, promoting recycling, and organizing R&D collaboration efforts with other countries. A 2012 Department of Defense (DOD) report was optimistic about U.S. defense industries' ability to meet their rare earth material needs by 2013. The 2012 DOD report indicated that U.S. production of rare earth materials could meet defense procurement needs by 2013, except for yttrium. Market forces globally have led to increased investments in rare earth materials, with positive trends for meeting future U.S. Government demand. China's rare earth restrictions are seen as part of interventionist policies that favor certain industries at the expense of others. Critics argue that China's rare earth export restrictions aim to benefit Chinese firms in the renewable energy sector and coerce foreign companies to transfer technology to China. They suggest that more WTO dispute cases should be brought against China. The joint WTO case by the US, EU, and Japan signals cooperation among major economies against China's policies. This united front may convey the seriousness of the issue to China and lead to further actions against their rare earth restrictions. The joint WTO case by the US, EU, and Japan questions China's compliance with rare earth export restrictions. Concerns arise about China's willingness to adhere to WTO rulings and potential alternative actions against their policies. There are potential alternatives to the current WTO dispute with China over rare earth export restrictions. One suggestion is for foreign companies to improve environmental mining conditions in China in exchange for the ability to mine and export rare earths. The WTO case against China was initiated in June 2009, with a panel issuing findings in July 2011. China appealed, and in January 2012, the WTO Appellate Body issued its findings. China has not yet indicated how it will implement the Appellate Body's findings, leading to concerns that the case may have come too late for U.S. firms currently affected. The WTO case against China on rare earths may have come too late for U.S. firms dealing with high prices. Analysts debate the impact on high tech firms moving production to China. China's restrictions backfired, causing a decline in global demand and prices. Alternative sources of rare earths are being developed in the U.S., Australia, and other countries. Some analysts argue that breaking China's rare earth monopoly could take years. China's dominance in processing and manufacturing rare earth products poses a challenge. Certain heavy rare earths may need to be processed in China, creating a dependency. Market conditions for non-Chinese firms to establish independent rare earth supply chains remain uncertain. Rebuilding a U.S. rare earth supply chain could take up to 15 years and is dependent on securing capital investments, developing new technologies, and acquiring patents. Questions have been raised about the federal government's role in leading and financing these efforts to lessen U.S. dependence on China for rare earth materials."
