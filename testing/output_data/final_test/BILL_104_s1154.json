    "content": "The Act titled \"Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System Act of 1995\" is established for the purpose of providing water supply to rural counties. The Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System Act of 1995 aims to address the need for a water supply system in rural northeast Montana, where no public water supply currently exists. Groundwater sources in the area are not potable, and the construction of a water supply system is expected to bring economic enhancement to Valley County. The adverse impacts of the Fort Peck Dam construction in 1939, including flooding of crop land, have not been mitigated, and the predicted benefits have not been realized. The Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System Act of 1995 aims to authorize the construction of a water treatment facility and distribution system to provide clean and safe water for domestic and limited livestock use in rural northeast Montana. Federal funding will be allocated for this water supply system instead of agricultural irrigation systems as originally intended under the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program. The Flood Control Act of 1944 was approved on December 22, 1944. The Flood Control Act of 1944 was approved on December 22, 1944. Section 3 defines key terms. The Flood Control Act of 1944, approved on December 22, 1944, defines key terms related to construction, the Fort Peck Rural County Water District, feasibility studies, and planning activities. The Flood Control Act of 1944 defines terms related to preconstruction activities for contracts, including the Secretary of the Interior and the Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System. Federal assistance is provided for water supply systems. The Secretary will cooperate with the District for planning, designing, and constructing a water supply system in Valley County, northeastern Montana. The system aims to provide safe rural water supplies, economic enhancement, wetland area mitigation, and water conservation. The Federal contribution will cover the budgeted amount for the system's planning, design, and construction, as well as additional necessary funds. The Federal share for the water supply system in Valley County, Montana is 80 percent and non-reimbursable. The total Federal funds available cannot exceed the authorized amount under section 9. Additionally, only up to 5 percent of the funds can be used for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and oversight of the system's planning and construction by the District. The Secretary cannot use funds for the water supply system construction until meeting the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The District will implement a water conservation program to promote efficient water use. Mitigation for fish and wildlife losses due to the water supply system will be based on ecological equivalency. The Act does not limit water projects in Montana, and it does not affect water rights. SEC. 8. EFFECT ON WATER RIGHTS.\n\nThis Act does not invalidate State water law or interstate compacts governing water rights. It also does not affect existing water allocations or quality laws. Additionally, it does not grant non-Federal entities the right to federal water sources.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $5,800,000, with the funds remaining available until expended. The amount may be adjusted based on fluctuations in development costs after October 1, 1994."
