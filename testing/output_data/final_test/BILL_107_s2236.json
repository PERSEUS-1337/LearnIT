Pregnant women are at a higher risk of being victims of homicide, with evidence showing that many female homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners. Children who witness domestic violence are more likely to have behavioral and physical health issues. Children exposed to domestic violence are at higher risk of depression, anxiety, and engaging in violent behavior. They are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse substances, run away from home, and commit sexual assault crimes. Research shows a strong link between domestic violence and child abuse, with 50% of men who abuse their wives also abusing their children. Only a small percentage of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse. Clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse.
