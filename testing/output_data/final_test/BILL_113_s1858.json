    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Broadband Investment Act of 2013\" or the \"RBI Act of 2013\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"applicable Federal-State Joint Board,\" \"Commission,\" \"revised proposal for rural support,\" and \"rural carrier.\" The Act defines key terms related to rural carriers, including rural rate-of-return carriers, rural wireless carriers, and rural competitive local exchange carriers. It also defines terms like \"study area total unseparated loop cost\" and \"Transformation Order.\" The term \"tribal lands\" is defined in section 54.400(e) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Transformation Order has caused financial uncertainty for rural carriers by denying them the opportunity to recover investments made for universal service. The use of a criticized regression analysis in the order has also created uncertainty in universal service support levels, discouraging broadband infrastructure investments in rural communities. The Transformation Order has led to financial uncertainty for rural carriers and hindered broadband investment in rural areas. Congress intends for the Commission to consult with the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service and establish reliable support mechanisms for universal service. The Secretary of Agriculture has raised concerns about the unintended consequences of the Transformation Order on rural broadband deployment. The Transformation Order has caused financial uncertainty for rural carriers, leading to a decrease in broadband investment in rural areas. Reports show that demand for Rural Utilities Service loans for broadband buildout has dropped, and rural carriers are canceling or postponing new investments, resulting in increased consumer prices and staff reductions. Congressional hearings have highlighted the negative impact on rural economies in the United States. Congressional hearings revealed that the Commission's approach to waivers under the Transformation Order is burdensome for small rural carriers, discouraging them from seeking waivers and creating business uncertainties. Adjustments to the Transformation Order can address these issues without affecting other carriers or increasing the Universal Service Fund. Adjustments to the Transformation Order can address burdensome waiver processes for small rural carriers without impacting other carriers or increasing the Universal Service Fund budget. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION AND REVISION OF PROVISION OF TRANSFORMATION ORDER. The text chunk discusses the suspension of a regulation related to study area total unseparated loop cost and the requirement for the Commission to issue a revised proposal for rural support within 60 days. The Commission must consult with the Federal-State Joint Board before issuing a final rule to adopt a revised proposal for rural support. The final rule must be issued between 45 and 120 days after the notice of proposed rulemaking. The Commission must issue a final rule adopting a revised proposal for rural support within 45-120 days after the notice of proposed rulemaking. Within 60 days of the Act's effective date, the Commission must submit reports to Congress on the revised proposal and the amount of universal service funding needed for the next 10 years. The Commission must establish interim limitations within 30 days of the effective date of the Act, including quantitative and qualitative analysis supporting service objectives for the next 10 years. This analysis should identify unique circumstances and high-cost loop support needed for universal service in Alaska and tribal lands. The Commission must establish interim limitations on study area total unseparated loop costs within 30 days of the Act's effective date. This includes determining annual Universal Service Fund distribution for rural rate-of-return carriers based on previous rules and adjusting high-cost loop support distribution to reflect regulatory revisions. The interim limitations on study area total unseparated loop costs must be established within 30 days of the Act's effective date. These limitations will remain in effect until the final rule required under subsection (b)(1)(D) takes effect. The Commission will adjust high-cost loop support for rural carriers to include investments made before 2012. Waivers may be granted. The Commission will consider waiver petitions from rural carriers affected by revisions in the Transformation Order to ensure they have a reasonable opportunity to recover costs for providing universal service. The Commission must grant or deny a waiver petition within 90 days of receiving it. If the Commission fails to make a determination on a waiver petition within the specified time limit, the petition is deemed granted. The Commission will reconsider any waiver petition related to a regulation revision adopted in the Transformation Order if it was filed before the effective date of the Act and denied. If a waiver petition is denied, the Commission must provide specific reasons for the denial. The Commission must specify unreasonable operating expenses, unused investments, and the basis for its determinations when granting a waiver. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act will be in effect 30 days after its enactment."
