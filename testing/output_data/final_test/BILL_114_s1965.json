    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Maintaining dignity and Eliminating unnecessary Restrictive Confinement of Youths Act of 2015\" or the \"MERCY Act\". It addresses juvenile solitary confinement. The \"MERCY Act\" addresses juvenile solitary confinement in Chapter 403 of title 18, United States Code by defining terms like \"covered juvenile\" and \"juvenile facility.\" The \"MERCY Act\" prohibits room confinement in juvenile facilities except as a temporary response to a covered juvenile's behavior posing a serious and immediate risk of harm. Least restrictive techniques must be used for juveniles posing a risk of harm. Before placing a covered juvenile in room confinement, staff must try less restrictive techniques such as talking to the juvenile and involving a mental health professional. Before placing a covered juvenile in room confinement, staff must explain the reasons and inform the juvenile of the conditions for release. If a covered juvenile poses a serious risk of harm, they must be released from room confinement when they no longer pose a threat. A covered juvenile must no longer engage in behavior that poses a serious and immediate risk of physical harm to themselves or others. If control is not gained within a specified time frame, they must be released from room confinement. A covered juvenile who continues to pose a serious and immediate risk of physical harm after the maximum period of confinement must be transferred to another facility for appropriate services. If a professional deems the crisis service needed is unavailable, a referral to a suitable facility must be initiated for the covered juvenile. The use of consecutive room confinements to evade the purpose of this subsection is prohibited. Juvenile solitary confinement is addressed in section 5043."
