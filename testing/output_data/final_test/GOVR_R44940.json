    "content": "Autonomous vehicles could bring significant social and economic changes, offering new travel options for the elderly, disabled, urban residents, and non-car owners. They could reduce congestion on roads and make highway travel safer by minimizing human errors, as highlighted by a study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Highly automated vehicles have a learning advantage over humans, benefiting from data and experience gathered from thousands of other vehicles on the road. Congressional committees have debated changes in federal regulation to encourage vehicular innovation while protecting passenger safety. In July 2017, the House Energy and Commerce Committee ordered the first major legislation on autonomous vehicles (H.R. 3388) to be reported, which was passed by the House of Representatives in September 2017. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reported S. 1885 in November 2017. However, recent accidents involving autonomous vehicles have raised new questions about how federal and state governments should regulate vehicle testing and the introduction of new technologies into vehicles offered for sale. The introduction of new technologies in vehicles has shifted from mechanical to electronic control, allowing for performance alterations through software updates. Advanced driver assistance systems automate various functions previously done by the driver, such as lighting, braking, GPS connectivity, and lane-keeping. Motor vehicle innovation is driven by technological advances, consumer demand for connectivity, and new ownership models. The Society of Automotive Engineers International (SAE) has developed six categories of vehicle automation, ranging from human drivers doing everything to automated systems performing all tasks. This classification system has been adopted by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to standardize nomenclature for discussions on vehicle automation and safety. Vehicles currently sold are in levels 1 and 2 of SAE's automation rating system. Some predict autonomous vehicles at levels 3 to 5 could be market-ready within five years, while others argue it will take longer due to the need for more testing, regulation, and policy work. Technologies guiding automated vehicles include electronic sensors, GPS, cameras for 360-degree views, and dedicated short-range communication for monitoring road conditions. V2X technology, including V2V and V2I capabilities, aims to improve safety by warning drivers about potential crashes through communication of information. Messages exchanged include details on speeds, braking status, and blind spots within a range of 300 meters. V2X messages have a range of 300 meters, allowing for warnings to drivers about potential crashes. NHTSA has evaluated V2X applications and found that just two of them could reduce crashes by 50%. These applications include intersection movement assist and left turn assist. V2V communications also enable technologies like forward collision warning and blind spot warning. Installing V2V communications capability is estimated to cost about $350 per vehicle. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is working on federal regulatory guidance for autonomous vehicles, consulting with various stakeholders. The first report, Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, established guidelines for autonomous vehicle design, testing, and deployment, as well as a model state policy and streamlined review process. Additional tools and regulatory structures are being considered to aid in autonomous deployment. The 2016 guidelines outlined 15 practices for manufacturers, suppliers, and service providers testing autonomous vehicles. Data generated from research was to be shared with the government and the public. Entities were urged to ensure vehicles meet safety standards and be tested through simulation, on test tracks, or on roadways. NHTSA requested Safety Assessment letters from each testing entity to address issues like data recording, privacy, system safety, and cybersecurity. The Department of Transportation (DOT) outlined guidelines for autonomous vehicles, including data recording, privacy, system safety, cybersecurity, and crashworthiness. Vehicle software must be updatable over-the-air for quick improvements. Vehicles on public roads are regulated by both the federal government and states. NHTSA regulates auto safety while states handle licensing, traffic regulations, and insurance. The model state policy suggests state roles for the transition to fully autonomous vehicles. Vehicle Administrators and safety advocates suggest state roles and procedures for autonomous vehicle testing, including designating a lead state agency, an application process for manufacturers, coordination with law enforcement, changes to registration and titling, and addressing liability and insurance issues. NHTSA has the authority to issue safety standards, order recalls, issue interpretations, exemptions, and rulemakings to address new technologies. NHTSA issues interpretations, exemptions, and rulemakings to address new technologies. Exemptions are not indefinite and may last for two or three years. Rulemaking for new standards can take several years with extensive public comment periods. The Federal Automated Vehicles Policy introduced new tools and authorities for regulating autonomous vehicles. The report suggested using premarket testing and data to ensure new vehicles meet safety standards before deployment. It proposed replacing self-certification for autonomous vehicles with premarket approval authority, requiring NHTSA to test prototype vehicles. Additional resources and statutory authority would be needed for NHTSA to take on certification procedures currently handled by manufacturers. The Obama Administration proposed including imminent hazard authority in the 2015 surface transportation legislation. The report recommended expanding exemption authority for autonomous vehicles in the 2015 surface transportation bill to gather more real-world safety data. It also suggested enhancing data collection tools for NHTSA to utilize information from autonomous vehicles, such as event data recorders. The NHTSA has the authority to use motor vehicle data for autonomous vehicle safety. The Trump Administration updated the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy in 2017, with new guidance for manufacturers and states. The policy changes were based on feedback from various sources. The 2017 DOT report revised vehicle performance guidelines for autonomous vehicles, reducing the number of recommendations from 15 to 12. Privacy, registration, and ethical considerations are no longer mandatory, with manufacturers now encouraged to publish voluntary self-assessments of their testing procedures. The 2017 DOT report revised vehicle performance guidelines for autonomous vehicles, reducing the number of recommendations from 15 to 12. Manufacturers are now encouraged to publish voluntary self-assessments of their testing procedures, aiming to develop a better understanding of autonomous vehicle capabilities. NHTSA recommends states adopt legislation promoting innovation and safe integration of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). The 2017 report outlines four safety-related types of legislation for autonomous vehicles, including a technology-neutral environment, licensing and registration procedures, reporting methods for public safety officials, and review of traffic laws. It also includes best practices for state highway safety officials. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 22 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles. State laws vary widely, with Florida allowing anyone with a valid driver's license to operate an autonomous vehicle on public roads without requiring an operator to be in the vehicle. California has approved testing of autonomous vehicles on certain public roads. The absence of federal regulation may lead to diverse and conflicting state regulations. The Transportation Authority approved testing of autonomous vehicles without traditional controls on public roads. Tennessee, North Dakota, and Utah have enacted laws regarding autonomous vehicle safety standards. Michigan passed bills allowing autonomous vehicle testing on public roads and established the American Center for Mobility. As vehicles become more automated, concerns arise about data security and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Protecting autonomous vehicles from hackers is a top concern for governments, manufacturers, and service providers. Hackers can exploit various entry points in vehicle systems, prompting the need for remote software updates to address security weaknesses quickly. The Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) was established by motor vehicle manufacturers to address these concerns. The Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) released cybersecurity principles in 2016. DOT's automated vehicle policies focus on cybersecurity, requiring a thorough threat mitigation system in vehicle electronics. Incidents, threats, and violations are shared with Auto-ISAC for industry learning. Various entities, including manufacturers and urban planners, seek access to vehicle data. Relevant data types include vehicle testing crash data. DOT's autonomous vehicle policy addresses handling crash data during testing. The handling of test data for autonomous vehicles should follow best practices established by organizations like IEEE and SAE. NHTSA recommends storing and sharing crash data with the government for reconstruction. Data ownership issues exist, especially regarding event data recorders (EDRs) in vehicles. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 addresses ownership of EDR data but not other types of collected data. The National Association of City Transportation Officials recommends identifying data ownership and sharing for autonomous vehicles. Consumer privacy concerns are addressed by motor vehicle trade associations' Privacy Principles. The 2017 DOT report excludes privacy discussions from the 2016 report. The timeline for widespread autonomous vehicle adoption in the U.S. remains uncertain. Several recent studies and surveys show public skepticism about autonomous vehicles, with Americans favoring Levels 1 and 2 automated technologies over fully autonomous vehicles. Interest exists in collision protection and driving assistance technologies, but overall, skepticism towards self-driving technology is increasing. The 2017 DOT report emphasizes the need for consumer education and training on autonomous vehicles to address public skepticism. Organizations testing autonomous vehicles are urged to develop comprehensive education programs for dealers, distributors, and consumers. Various methods such as on- and off-road demonstrations, virtual reality, and onboard vehicle systems are recommended to familiarize potential users with autonomous technology before vehicles are sold. Consumer education and training on autonomous vehicles is crucial to address public skepticism. Recommendations include informing people on the road when a vehicle is in self-driving mode, training sales representatives on technical aspects and benefits of autonomous vehicles, and holding training seminars for manufacturers. The House of Representatives passed the SELF DRIVE Act, emphasizing the importance of education and safety measures for autonomous vehicles. The House of Representatives passed the SELF DRIVE Act, prioritizing safety, promoting innovation, remaining technology-neutral, reinforcing federal and state regulatory roles, strengthening cybersecurity, and educating the public on self-driving vehicles. The House and Senate bills aim to clarify the roles of state and federal regulations in the development of self-driving vehicles. They focus on state preemption, stating that states cannot regulate the design, construction, or performance of autonomous vehicles unless their laws align with federal regulations. The bills emphasize the importance of safety, innovation, and the division of responsibilities between states and the federal government. H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 address state preemption in regulating autonomous vehicles. States are prohibited from regulating certain aspects of autonomous vehicles, such as licensing and discrimination based on disability. The bills also outline new safety standards to be implemented by manufacturers within two years of enactment. The DOT will require manufacturers to demonstrate safety in autonomous vehicles with updates every five years. Manufacturers must submit safety assessment letters and a Safety Evaluation Report within 90 days of enactment. Vehicle deployment cannot be conditioned on DOT review. The House bill mandates a safety priority plan rulemaking within a year of enactment. The bill would require the DOT to submit a safety priority plan rulemaking within a year of enactment, updating federal safety standards for autonomous vehicles and establishing new standards. NHTSA's safety priorities for autonomous vehicles and other vehicles would be included. The House-passed bill also mandates cybersecurity protections for highly autonomous vehicles, requiring automakers to develop a cybersecurity plan within six months before selling domestically. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee bill would require automakers to develop a cybersecurity plan within 18 months of enactment, including measures for mitigating cyberattacks and unauthorized intrusions. The plan must also include a process for limiting access to automated driving systems and training for employees. Additionally, a cybersecurity point of contact must be named, and incentives for vehicle developers will be created by the Department of Transportation. The House-passed bill, S. 1885, would create incentives for vehicle developers to share cybersecurity information and coordinate federal research with DOT. It would establish a Highly Automated Vehicle Data Access Advisory Committee to provide Congress with cybersecurity recommendations. Federal agencies would be prohibited from issuing regulations on data access in automated vehicles until the advisory committee's report is submitted. Additionally, H.R. 3388 would expand DOT's authority to issue exemptions for autonomous vehicle testing. The House-passed bill, S. 1885, would increase the number of vehicles per manufacturer eligible for exemptions from safety standards to up to 100,000 per year over four years. It also mandates the establishment of a database for granted exemptions and requires reporting of crashes involving exempted vehicles to the Department of Transportation. The bill sets criteria for verifying the safety level of autonomous vehicles seeking exemptions. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee bill does not address exemptions for crashworthiness and occupant protection standards. The House-passed bill requires manufacturers to develop written privacy plans for highly automated vehicles, with the option to exclude certain data encryption processes. The Federal Trade Commission would be responsible for reporting to Congress on vehicle privacy issues. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee bill focuses on vehicle privacy issues, requiring NHTSA to establish an online database detailing information collected during vehicle operation. It covers all vehicle types and includes manufacturers' privacy policies. Additionally, H.R. 3388 directs DOT to develop a consumer-education program on highly automated vehicles within three years. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee bill mandates regulations for manufacturers to explain autonomous vehicle capabilities and limitations to consumers. It establishes a working group to identify marketing strategies and educational outreach, and requires a separate panel of experts to submit a report on transportation and environmental aspects. A panel of transportation and environmental experts would submit a report on the impact of autonomous vehicles on infrastructure, mobility, the environment, and fuel consumption. H.R. 3388 proposes a new NHTSA advisory group with up to 30 members to advise on various issues related to autonomous vehicles. S. 1885 suggests establishing a Highly Automated Vehicles Technical Committee to advise DOT on rulemaking policy and vehicle safety. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee bill would establish a committee to advise state and local governments on automated driving systems for five years. It also includes a study on domestic production of autonomous vehicles and parts. Both the House and Senate bills address vehicle safety standards, such as requiring rear seat occupant alert systems and updating headlamps. The House-passed bill directs the DOT to research updating motor vehicle safety standards for improved performance and safety. NHTSA must report to Congress if it chooses not to revise the standards. Recent crashes involving autonomous vehicles have raised concerns about federal regulation of new technologies. The NTSB is investigating nonfatal crashes involving Tesla vehicles using automated controls. H.R. 3388 and its Senate counterpart, S. 1885, have faced delays in further action. Senators have requested changes to provisions on state preemption, vehicle safety, cybersecurity, consumer privacy, and regulation of autonomous vehicles due to lack of federal standards. Some states are enacting their own rules for autonomous vehicles due to the lack of federal standards. Bills like H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 aim to preempt new state and local safety standards for autonomous vehicles, allowing for more exemptions from NHTSA's safety standards without specifying time limits or requiring NHTSA review. State and local governments are seeking a role in federal advisory committees and clarification on their authority over traffic laws. The pending bills, H.R. 3388 and S. 1885, aim to allow more exemptions from NHTSA's safety standards for autonomous vehicles without time limits or NHTSA review. Concerns include potential lack of protection for pedestrians and passengers, suspension of current crashworthiness standards, and an excessive number of exempt vehicles on the roads. Cybersecurity provisions in the bills call for manufacturers to address cybersecurity without specific federal involvement, but some groups advocate for NHTSA to establish cybersecurity standards for autonomous vehicles. Another proposal suggests creating a publicly available autonomous vehicle database searchable by VINs."
