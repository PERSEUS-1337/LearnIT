    "content": "Social Security is a self-financing program providing monthly cash benefits to retired, disabled workers, and family members. In March 2019, there were 63.3 million beneficiaries, with 74.6% being retired workers, 16.0% disabled workers, and 9.4% survivors of deceased workers. The program is funded by payroll taxes from covered workers and employers, with an annual limit on taxable earnings. The Social Security program is funded by federal income taxes paid by beneficiaries and interest income from trust fund investments. The program has two separate trust funds, OASI and DI, with total receipts of $1,003 billion in 2018. The system was established in 1935 to provide economic security for workers aged 65 and older. The Old-Age Insurance system created in 1935 provided benefits to individuals aged 65 or older who had earned retirement benefits through covered work. Benefits were financed by a payroll tax on wages up to $3,000 per year, with monthly benefits based on cumulative wages. The program was progressive, replacing a larger share of earnings for low-wage workers. In 1939, the Social Security Amendments extended benefits to dependents and survivors, shifting the focus to family protection. In 1956, Congress established the Disability Insurance (DI) program, increasing the payroll tax rate to 12.4% and the taxable wage base to $132,900 in 2019. Eligibility for benefits expanded over the years, with periodic increases in benefit levels. In 1972, legislation provided for automatic cost-of-living adjustments indexed to the Consumer Price Index. In the late 1970s, actions focused on solving financing problems, with taxes raised and benefit growth curtailed. In 1982, the OASI trust fund borrowed assets from other funds, repaid by 1986. In 1983, major legislation aimed to restore solvency to the Social Security system. The Social Security system faces long-term funding shortfall, leading to annual deficits through 2093. Changes to the program are being considered, funded primarily by FICA and SECA taxes paid by employers and employees. The FICA tax rate for employers and employees is 7.65%, with 6.20% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare HI. Self-employed individuals pay a SECA tax rate of 15.3%, with 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare HI. SECA taxes are deductible for federal income tax purposes and are paid annually. Social Security program has other sources of income besides payroll taxes. The Social Security program receives income from Social Security benefits included in taxable income for federal tax, interest from U.S. Treasury investments, and trust fund balance in federal government securities. The fund balance represents the money owed to the Social Security trust funds by the U.S. Treasury's general fund. Social Security benefits are funded through the redemption of federal government securities. Since 1984, up to 50% of Social Security benefits are subject to federal income tax for individuals with provisional income above specified thresholds. Revenues from this taxation are credited to the trust funds, with $35.0 billion received in 2018. In 2018, the Social Security trust funds received $35.0 billion from federal income tax on benefits, while the Medicare HI trust fund received $24.2 billion. The income thresholds for taxation are fixed and not adjusted for inflation, leading to an increasing number of beneficiaries subject to federal income tax on benefits. The CBO estimates that half of Social Security beneficiaries are affected by benefit taxation. The trustees project annual cash-flow deficits for Social Security until 2093, with a surplus maintained from 2010 to 2018. Total revenues in 2019 are expected to exceed costs by $1 billion, with a positive balance in the trust funds until 2035. The trustees project a 2.78% 75-year actuarial deficit for the Social Security trust funds, with expenditures exceeding income by at least 20%. To remain solvent, options include a 2.70% payroll tax rate increase, a 17% benefit reduction, or a combination of both. The funding shortfall is due to demographic factors and program design features. The Social Security trust funds were credited with over $2.9 trillion in asset reserves at the end of 2018. The trustees project that the trust fund balance will start declining in 2020 and will be depleted by 2035. The trust fund ratio, representing assets as a percentage of costs, is projected to decline to 130% in 2028 and reach zero by 2035. The Social Security trust fund reserves are projected to be depleted by 2035, after which the program will rely on incoming receipts to pay 80% of benefits in 2035, decreasing to 75% by 2093. Social Security cannot borrow from the Treasury's general fund, so it may face challenges in meeting benefit payments once the reserves are exhausted. The Social Security Act does not specify how benefits will be paid after trust fund depletion, leaving two possible scenarios: delayed full benefits or timely reduced benefits. From 1984 to 2009, Social Security had surplus tax revenues, leading to a growing trust fund balance. However, starting in 2010, the program began operating with annual cash-flow deficits. The trustees project that tax revenues will continue to fall short of expenditures from 2019 to 2093. This results in the trust funds redeeming more federal securities than current tax revenues, relying on reserves to cover benefits and expenses. The trust funds for Social Security are redeemed with general revenues, leading to increased spending from the general fund. When there are no surplus governmental receipts, the federal government must raise funds through taxes, reducing spending, borrowing, or a combination. Social Security cannot borrow from the general fund but relies on previous tax revenues and interest income from trust fund investments when current revenues fall short. Social Security reform aims to address trust fund solvency and control spending growth for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The debate involves improving benefit adequacy, equity, and differing views on the government's role in retirement income provision. Two main reform approaches are maintaining the current program structure or implementing changes. The Social Security reform debate includes two main approaches: maintaining the current program structure with modest changes or shifting towards a personal savings and investment system. Recently, there has been a focus on expanding benefits to address concerns about retirement income security. Social Security provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families. Social Security benefits are provided to retired, disabled, or deceased workers and their families. Benefits are based on a worker's career-average earnings and a progressive formula. The primary insurance amount (PIA) determines monthly benefits at full retirement age and for family members. Eligibility for benefits starts at age 62 with a reduction for early retirement. The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security benefits was raised from 65 to 67 by Congress in 1983. This change is being phased in gradually over a 22-year period from 2000 to 2022, affecting workers born in 1938 or later. Workers born in 1960 or later will see the full increase in FRA. To be eligible for a Social Security retired-worker benefit, a worker needs 40 earnings credits (10 years of Social Security-covered employment). The initial monthly benefit is based on the highest 35 years of indexed earnings in covered employment, divided by 420 months to calculate the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is determined by applying a formula to the AIME, which is divided into three brackets using dollar amounts known as bend points. In 2019, bend points are $926 and $5,583, with three replacement factors applied to AIME brackets. PIA is determined for eligible workers based on a formula. PIA increases annually from age 62 to benefit receipt. Initial monthly benefit equals PIA at FRA, less if taken before, and greater if taken after. Retired-worker benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, but are reduced for each month before the full retirement age (FRA). The reduction is about 6.7% per year for up to 36 months before FRA, and 5% per year for any additional months. Delaying benefits past FRA results in a delayed retirement credit (DRC) of 8% per year until age 70 for workers born in 1943 or later. The decision to claim Social Security benefits before or after the full retirement age (FRA) results in adjustments to the monthly benefit amount. Claiming benefits before FRA leads to a reduction in the primary insurance amount (PIA), with a 25% reduction for those with an FRA of 66 and a 30% reduction for those with an FRA of 67. Conversely, claiming benefits after FRA results in an increase in the monthly benefit amount. Other benefit adjustments may also apply. The decision to claim Social Security benefits before or after the full retirement age (FRA) results in adjustments to the monthly benefit amount. Other benefit adjustments may apply, such as those related to simultaneous entitlement to more than one type of Social Security benefit. Dual entitlement rule, government pension offset (GPO), and windfall elimination provision (WEP) are examples of benefit adjustments that may reduce the monthly benefit amount. The retirement earnings test (RET) withholds Social Security benefits if below full retirement age (FRA) and earning above a threshold. Social Security family benefits are reduced if total exceeds a limit. Disability benefits require inability to work due to a lasting impairment. A worker generally needs 40 credits for benefits. A worker needs 40 earnings credits for Social Security benefits. A worker under 62 can qualify for disabled-worker benefits with fewer credits. The number of credits needed varies based on age when disabled, with a minimum of six credits required. Disabled-worker benefits are based on fewer years of earnings. Disabled-worker benefits are not reduced before full retirement age (FRA) and are equal to the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). 10.7 million beneficiaries are dependents and survivors of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. Social Security benefits are payable to family members of retired, disabled, or deceased workers, including spouses, children, widows, and parents. Benefits are a percentage of the worker's PIA, with a maximum family benefit. For example, a spouse may receive up to 50% of the worker's PIA, and a widow(er) may receive up to 100%. Benefits may be adjusted based on age and receipt of other Social Security benefits. Social Security benefits payable to family members of retired, disabled, or deceased workers are based on the worker's record and capped by the maximum family benefit. If the total benefits exceed the family maximum, each beneficiary's benefit is reduced proportionally to stay within the limit. The maximum family benefit for a retired or deceased worker is determined by a formula, ranging from 150% to 188% of the worker's PIA. For a worker who turns 62 in 2019 or dies before 62, benefits are limited to specific percentages of the worker's PIA based on income brackets. The family maximum for a disabled worker is 85% of the worker's AIME, with a range of 100% to 150% of the worker's PIA. In March 2019, there were around 63.3 million beneficiaries. In March 2019, there were approximately 63.3 million Social Security beneficiaries, with retired workers accounting for 69.7% and disabled workers for 13.4%. The average monthly benefit for retired workers was $1,467, and for disabled workers, it was $1,235. Family members of retired, disabled, or deceased workers made up the remaining 16.9% of beneficiaries."
