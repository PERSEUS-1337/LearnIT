    "content": "Some Members of Congress believe small businesses could benefit from increased access to international markets to boost innovation and economic growth. Small businesses make up a large percentage of U.S. exporting firms but account for a smaller share of export value. Advocates argue that promoting exports for small businesses can lead to job creation and economic growth. The U.S. economy should encourage small businesses to boost employment. Recent studies show startups are more likely to expand. Economists debate the impact of small businesses on job creation. Federal assistance for small businesses may not increase jobs long term. Job creation depends on the labor force size, not assistance. The report discusses the Small Business Administration's role in export promotion. The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) coordinates export promotion activities through various programs like loans, training, and grants. The report analyzes SBA's international programs' performance using quantitative and qualitative data, highlighting policy issues for Congress regarding market barriers, national competitiveness, and policy duplication. The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) coordinates export promotion activities for small businesses through various programs. Policy issues regarding market barriers, national competitiveness, and policy duplication may arise in debates over the size and scope of SBA's international trade programs. The debate will focus on fiscal responsibility and economic opportunities for firms and employees. SBA assists small businesses in export promotion by identifying interested businesses, preparing them for export, connecting them to opportunities, and supporting them throughout the process. The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) focuses on export promotion for small businesses, funded through SBA's appropriations. OIT's programs do not specifically help small businesses access lower-cost imports. Total program costs are detailed from FY2007 to FY2016, with the President's budget request for FY2017 included. The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) details total program costs from FY2007 to FY2016 and the President's budget request for FY2017. OIT's total program costs in FY2016 were $9.5 million, accounting for approximately 1.4% of SBA's total program obligations. The President requested $9.5 million for FY2017, a $20,000 increase from FY2016. OIT was previously a division within SBA's Office of Capital Access before December 2010. The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade (OIT) underwent administrative changes in December 2010, leading to the formation of OIT and the appointment of the first Associate Administrator for International Trade in August 2011. These changes aimed to elevate SBA's export promotion activities. SBA collaborates with other federal agencies to support small business exports, offering various financing programs listed on its website. The Small Business Administration collaborates with federal programs like the Export-Import Bank of the United States, Department of Commerce, and others to support small business exports. SBA is a member of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), which coordinates federal agencies involved in export promotion. SBA identifies small businesses interested in export promotion through informational and financial programs. The Small Business Administration collaborates with federal programs to support small business exports. SBA offers loan programs specifically focused on export promotion, including the Export Express, Export Working Capital, and International Trade loan programs. These programs provide financing for small businesses looking to begin or expand exporting operations. The SBA's export promotion-focused loan programs aim to help small businesses affected by imports and enhance their competitiveness. Fees for smaller loans were waived in various fiscal years to encourage demand, including the up-front loan guaranty fee and ongoing servicing fee for loans of $150,000 or less. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 made permanent the practice of waiving the SBAExpress loan program's guaranty fee. The SBA's export promotion loan programs waive fees for veterans under the SBAExpress program starting October 1, 2015, unless the President's budget shows a subsidy cost above zero. These programs support small business exports through various loan programs like the 504/CDC program and standard 7(a) program. The export activity within each program is analyzed in the report. The Export Express program is similar to the SBA Express program. The Export Express program, similar to the SBA Express program, has an expedited approval process, lower maximum loan amount, and smaller percentage of loan guaranteed. It also resembles the International Trade loan program with lower loan amounts and guaranty percentages. SBA offers trade-related counseling through various programs, including Small Business Development Centers. Development Centers (SBDCs) are the primary SBA source of trade-related counseling, along with Women's Business Centers (WBCs) and the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE). SBA partners with other agencies to provide small business export counseling, including a counselor training certification program and collaboration with U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs). The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) pilot grant initiative, providing funding for counseling and training small business owners on export finance. The State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) initiative awarded grants to states in FY2011 and FY2012 to assist small businesses with exporting. The program aimed to increase the number of small businesses that export and boost the export volume of those already exporting. SBA granted funds for various export programs such as foreign trade missions, market sales trips, and training workshops. In the first grant competition in 2011, SBA awarded 51 cooperative agreements totaling nearly $29 million. In 2011 and 2012, SBA awarded cooperative agreements totaling nearly $29 million and $30 million, respectively. Average grant amounts were around $568,000 and $577,000. Priority projects included assisting small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals, women, veterans, rural businesses, and export opportunities to China. STEP grants were competitively awarded to states, territories, and regions. The Small Business Administration (SBA) awarded cooperative agreements totaling nearly $29 million and $30 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively, for the State Trade Expansion Program (STEP). The SBA provided 75% of funding for most projects, with states contributing 25%. However, for the top three states in export value, SBA provided 65% of funding. The SBA's Office of Inspector General audited the program in FY2011, finding that performance goals were not specific and results-oriented, and baselines were not established to measure changes in small business exporters or exports. The OIG found that some states focused on goals not increasing small business exporters or export volume. SBA management was responsive to issues raised in the report for FY2012 STEP awards. Funding for the STEP program increased from $8 million in FY2014 to $18 million in FY2016. The State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) received $18.0 million in FY2016 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 renamed the program and provided $30 million annually for STEP grants from FY2016 through FY2020. Priority is given to proposals benefiting small businesses that export, rural, women-owned, and socially disadvantaged businesses. The Associate Administrator for International Trade must submit a report on the program's structure, procedures, and review process to the House and Senate Small Business Committees. The 115th Congress could consider modifications to the STEP program based on an SBA Office of Inspector General report. Congress may also decide on the permanent reauthorization of the program. Export-related performance data for SBA's business loan and management programs are analyzed, including loan approval and amount data provided by SBA. Limited qualitative data on SBA's trade-related programs is presented through publicly available survey responses. The section presents qualitative data from surveys on SBA's loan, management, and training programs, including those targeted towards exporters. SBA's loan guarantees for export activities have increased since 2011, with approvals for export-related activity on the rise. Since 2011, SBA's loan guarantees for export activities have increased, but they still make up a small portion of the overall loan portfolio. No single loan program dominates the export-related loans, with the three main programs comprising around 30% of approvals each year. The SBA Express program had the highest share of export-focused loans among various business loan programs. The SBA Express and Export Express programs account for a smaller share of total loan amounts than total loan numbers due to lower maximum loan caps. The International Trade program had the highest share of credit approved annually for small business exporters in FY2015 and FY2016, while the PLP had the highest share in FY2014 for SBA export-related loans. The three export-focused loan programs accounted for 48%, 50%, and 30% of approvals each year. In FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016, export-focused loan programs accounted for a significant portion of export-related loan approval amounts. SBA's Office of International Trade helped small business exporters access capital, with 1,513 assisted in FY2015, up from 1,392 in FY2014. SBA does not publish data on the value of exports supported by its loan programs, but occasionally assesses the impact of its programs through surveys on clients' experiences. The survey sent to clients in SBA management and training programs assesses client attitudes and perceptions of counseling impact on their businesses. The survey received 9,459 responses out of 58,137 surveys sent, indicating that the programs assisted small businesses at all stages of development. The survey of SBA management and training program clients found that most small business owners found the programs useful and made changes to their management practices. Few sought information on international trade, with SBA resource partners mainly assisting with business and marketing plans. Only a small percentage received help with international trade, indicating a need for more focus in this area. The report highlights three policy issues for Congress to consider regarding the future of SBA's export promotion activities: barriers to exporting for smaller firms, government interest in promoting exports for national trade competitiveness, and potential duplication of SBA's export promotion policies with other federal programs. These issues are influenced by concerns about fiscal responsibility. Proponents argue that small businesses face barriers to international trade, including insufficient capacity, lack of information, logistical challenges, export marketing difficulties, and access to credit. These barriers hinder small business exports and constrain trade financing. Export promotion programs can create inefficiencies and reduce national welfare according to economic theory, as firms and workers naturally gravitate towards the most efficient areas without government intervention. Small businesses often struggle to obtain commercial bank financing due to various reasons such as lack of collateral, creditworthiness proof, and high transaction costs. Incentives to engage in economic activity can lead to a net social loss of efficiency by redirecting resources from higher to lower productivity areas. Government assistance may be justified in cases of market failure, but not all barriers faced by small firms in exporting indicate such a failure. Barriers to exporting for small businesses may not always indicate market failure. Higher risk profiles for small exporters are justified by their higher failure rates and ability to absorb risks. Incomplete information about internationalization could be a market failure, as more information could increase efficiency and competition. The debate continues among economists and business experts regarding the link between trade competitiveness and economic outcomes, with most agreeing that domestic productivity growth is the key determinant of economic growth. Some experts are divided on the merits of promoting sectors that produce tradable goods to improve net exports and productivity growth. Proponents of national trade competitiveness theory believe in increasing real income through growth in specific sectors. Government policies can impact businesses' profits either negatively through regulations or positively through subsidies. Advocates argue that promoting small businesses is crucial for U.S. economic competitiveness in the international market, as they are key for job creation and innovative supply chains. Small businesses play a critical role in innovative supply chains and international economic competitiveness. Economist Paul Krugman argues against trade competitiveness theory, stating that countries trade with each other while firms compete within industries. Krugman argues that countries should specialize in industries where they have a comparative advantage, rather than using government resources to incentivize less efficient industries. This leads to a more efficient allocation of resources and productivity gains for workers in higher-valued industries. Despite government incentives for small businesses to export, some economists argue against policies that lead to inefficient resource allocation and net loss in national welfare. They suggest that national competitiveness could justify trade protectionism, restrict mobility, increase unemployment, or engage in retaliatory policies. Congress has passed legislation to boost export promotion programs for small businesses, such as increasing targets for the Export-Import Bank. Congress has increased minimum percentage targets of the Export-Import Bank's (Ex-Im's) aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance authority for financing exports by small businesses over the past 30 years. Concerns about possible overlap and duplication of services across federal agencies supporting export promotion programs for small businesses have arisen, driven by desires for more efficient delivery of government services and elimination of duplicative programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified overlap of services between SBA's export promotion activities and other federal agencies, such as Ex-Im and the Department of Commerce. SBDCs and Commerce offer similar counseling services, while SBA and Ex-Im have overlapping loan guaranty programs. SBA and Commerce target different audiences based on their expertise, with Commerce focusing on existing exporters and SBA on businesses looking to start exporting. The 2013 GAO report highlighted confusion among small businesses due to overlap in services between government agencies. SBA and Commerce are working to clarify counseling roles, but GAO recommended closer consultation with Ex-Im. SBA faces limitations in sharing client information, but efforts are being made to harmonize export financing products with Ex-Im. Co-location of services is being considered for U.S. Export Assistance. Improving export program efficiencies has been a focus in recent bills, with the potential for consolidating trade-related functions under a single agency. In the 113th Congress, several bills were introduced to assist small business exporters, including the Export Coordination Act of 2013. The Export Coordination Act of 2013 (H.R. 1909) aimed to clarify federal agency roles in the export process, revise TPCC duties, and provide more information on trade activities. The TRADE for Small Businesses and Jobs Act (H.R. 1916) would help small businesses understand foreign regulations and monitor changes in trade laws. The Small Business Export Growth Act (S. 1179) would assist small businesses in increasing exports and entering new markets. The Small Business Export Growth Act (S. 1179) and the State Trade Coordination Act of 2013 (H.R. 1926) aimed to enhance coordination between state and federal resources for export promotion. P.L. 114-125 enacted provisions similar to these bills, focusing on streamlining efforts and increasing outreach to small businesses for export opportunities. The Small Business Export Growth Act and the State Trade Coordination Act aimed to improve coordination between state and federal export promotion programs. P.L. 114-125 included provisions to enhance coordination, reform the Export.gov web portal for small business exporters, integrate state trade programs, and clarify the role of the TPCC. The SBA's AA for International Trade and the Secretary of Commerce have roles in these reforms, with mandates to produce plans and reporting metrics for Congress. These deliverables could influence small business trade promotion policy in the 115th Congress."
