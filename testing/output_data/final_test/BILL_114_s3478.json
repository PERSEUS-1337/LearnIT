Congress finds a rise in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe over the past decade, leading to physical and verbal harassment of European Jews. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights reported increases in anti-Semitic incidents in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2014. Anti-Zionism has sometimes turned into anti-Semitic attacks, drawing condemnation from European leaders. Since 2010, the Department of State has followed the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia's definition of Anti-Semitism. Examples include calling for harm to Jews and spreading stereotypes about Jewish power. Leaders like French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have addressed this issue. The Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-332) provides a legal foundation for reporting anti-Semitic actions, including accusing Jews of controlling societal institutions, being responsible for wrongdoing, exaggerating the Holocaust, and prioritizing Israel over their own countries. The Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 lays the legal groundwork for annual reporting on anti-Semitism worldwide. In 2015, H. Res. 354 was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives, urging continued robust reporting by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted a definition of anti-Semitism as a certain perception of Jews leading to hatred and discriminatory actions. The IHRA defines anti-Semitism as hatred and discriminatory actions towards Jews, including targeting Jewish institutions, individuals, and the State of Israel. It often involves blaming Jews for societal problems and employs negative stereotypes and traits in various forms of expression.

Congress acknowledges the importance of combating anti-Semitism domestically and internationally, recognizing it as a threat to tolerance, pluralism, and democracy. There is a pressing need to ensure the safety of European Jewish communities and the US should continue to prioritize fighting anti-Semitism in various international bodies. The Department of State should also document acts of anti-Semitism and incitement. The Department of State should document acts of anti-Semitism globally and encourage other countries to do the same. They should also promote the adoption of a working definition of anti-Semitism by national and multi-lateral institutions. Annual reporting on anti-Semitism in Europe is mandated by Section 4. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 is amended to include reporting on anti-Semitism in Europe, focusing on security challenges and needs of European Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies in countries where threats or attacks against Jewish persons and institutions are significant.
