    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Value and Quality Demonstration Act of 2002\". The Senate findings emphasize rewarding healthcare providers for high-quality, cost-effective care under the Medicare program. The Journal of the American Medical Association has published quality indicators related to care for Medicare beneficiaries. The cost of healthcare is influenced by physician services, ordering behavior, and hospital payments per beneficiary. The original Medicare fee-for-service program lacks a mechanism to pay for interventions to improve care quality, unlike the Medicare+Choice program for managed care organizations. Despite optimistic projections for managed care enrollment, most Medicare beneficiaries remain in the fee-for-service program. SEC. 3.
