    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and purpose. The Act titled \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1999\" highlights the importance of women's health care and the role of obstetric and gynecological providers in offering primary and preventive services. Providers in this field are uniquely qualified to deliver basic women's health care, with a focus on preventive care. Many states have taken steps to improve access to these services, but there is still a need for increased access in other states and federally-governed health systems. Patients in other states or federally-governed health plans may not be protected from access restrictions or limitations. SEC. 2. PATIENT ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL CARE. If a female individual does not designate an obstetrics and gynecology specialist as their primary care provider, a group health plan or health insurance issuer cannot require authorization for gynecological care or pregnancy-related services from a specialist in that field. Referrals for other related care can also be ordered by the specialist without additional authorization. Providers of group health plans or health insurance coverage must ensure a sufficient number of qualified participating health care providers to offer accessible gynecological and obstetrical care, including referrals, without the need for additional authorization. This does not waive coverage requirements related to medical necessity or appropriateness. The group health plan and health insurance issuer must provide timely and accessible services to all participants. They are prohibited from denying eligibility, providing incentives to access less protection, or penalizing providers for following the requirements of the plan. The section prohibits providers from offering incentives to provide care inconsistent with the plan. It allows negotiation of reimbursement levels with providers. State laws regarding health insurance issuers remain applicable. The section prohibits incentives for care inconsistent with the plan, allowing negotiation of reimbursement levels with providers.
