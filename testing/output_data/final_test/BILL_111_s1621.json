    "content": "The \"Thermal Energy Efficiency Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section highlights key points related to thermal energy efficiency. Congress finds that approximately 40% of energy in the US is used for heating and cooling buildings and industrial processes. Thermal energy is crucial in the national energy mix, with district energy systems offering advantages like fuel flexibility and the use of local fuels to support secure, affordable, renewable energy. District energy systems provide infrastructure for producing and distributing thermal energy from renewable sources, increasing energy efficiency and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The United States had around 2,500 operating district energy systems as of 2009. Increasing combined heat and power from 9% to 20% by 2030 could save energy equivalent to half of household consumption, create 1 million jobs, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 800 million metric tons annually, and save hundreds of millions of barrels of oil equivalent. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"Administrator\" referring to the head of the EPA, \"combined heat and power\" for efficient energy generation, \"district energy system\" for centralized thermal energy distribution, and \"eligible entity\" for qualifying organizations. The term \"eligible entity\" refers to qualifying organizations such as institutional entities, commercial or industrial entities, and Federal agencies or facilities. The Thermal Energy Efficiency Fund, established by section 4(a), supports these entities, including institutions of higher education, public school districts, local and state governments, tribal governments, municipal utilities, nonprofit or public hospitals, and their designees. The term \"qualifying project\" refers to district energy, combined heat and power, or recoverable waste energy projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce thermal energy from renewable resources or integrate new electricity generation. The term \"recoverable waste energy\" refers to energy that can be recovered or generated from existing or new facilities, which would otherwise be wasted. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. THERMAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY FUND. A fund named the \"Thermal Energy Efficiency Fund\" is established in the Treasury. If a greenhouse gas emissions regulation program is enacted, 2 percent of emission allowances for 2012-2050 will be allocated to the Fund for auctioning. Proceeds from auctions will be deposited into the Fund. SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR QUALIFYING PROJECTS. The Secretary will use funds from the Thermal Energy Efficiency Fund to make competitive grants for qualifying projects. At least 75% of the grants will support infrastructure construction, 15% for planning and feasibility studies, and the remainder as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will allocate grants from the Thermal Energy Efficiency Fund for qualifying projects. At least 40% will go to institutional entities, 40% to industrial and commercial entities, and the remainder for projects by Federal agencies or facilities. Recipients must provide matching funds to be eligible for grants. From 2012 to 2017, 25% of the grant amount will be allocated, and from 2018 to 2050, 50% of the grant amount will be allocated. By 2030, the United States aims to have 20% or more of its total electrical power capacity met through combined heat and power."
