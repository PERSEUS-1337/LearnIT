    "content": "Persons of African descent, commonly known as \"Afro-Latinos,\" are among the most marginalized groups in Latin America. They have started aligning national movements with international organizations to improve their social status, with countries like Brazil and Colombia taking notable steps in this direction. Some countries like Brazil and Colombia have implemented legal reforms and government programs to address racial discrimination and improve the status of Afro-Latinos. U.S. analysts argue that assisting vulnerable Afro-descendant peoples in Latin America aligns with larger U.S. policy goals for the region. There is debate on whether U.S. foreign aid should be specifically targeted towards Afro-Latinos or distributed broadly. Some analysts question the feasibility of increasing assistance to Afro-Latinos in Latin America due to limited development aid in the region. They raise concerns about diverting funds from other needy groups and caution that race is a sensitive issue in many Latin American countries. This report reviews the situation of Afro-descendants in Spanish-and Portuguese-speaking nations in Latin America and discusses current U.S. policies. The report discusses U.S. foreign aid programs and initiatives supporting Afro-Latinos in Latin America. It highlights the complexity of race and ethnicity in the region, with a diverse population descending from indigenous, European, and African backgrounds. Potential policy options for further support are also considered. Since the colonial period, racial intermingling in Latin America, known as mestizaje, has been a source of national pride. The concept of \"racial democracy\" has influenced countries like Brazil, attributing differences in living conditions to class rather than race. Recent data challenges this theory, revealing a strong correlation between race and poverty in countries like Brazil and Colombia. In Latin America, there is a correlation between race and poverty. Afro-descendants in countries like Brazil and Colombia are among the poorest and least educated citizens. Despite complexities in racial identity, Afro-descendants have historically been marginalized. Classifications in Latin America vary, with some identifying as white or mulattoes. The Dominican Republic exemplifies how racial identity is shaped by official national identity, with a majority of African ancestry but defining themselves as mestizos to differentiate from Haiti. A study found that 83% of Dominicans believe their society is racist against blacks. In Latin America, Afro-Latinos make up a significant portion of the population, with around 150 million people of African descent as of 1997. They are mainly concentrated in coastal areas but have also migrated to urban centers for employment. Countries like Cuba and the Dominican Republic have a majority Afro-Latino population, while in Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, they are a significant minority. Brazil has the largest Afro-descendant population outside of Africa, with 45% of Brazilians identifying as black or mulatto in 2000. The vast majority of Afro-Latinos are descendants of slaves brought from West Africa to the Americas. Historians now believe the first slaves arrived in Hispaniola in the early 16th century. Over 12 million Africans were brought to the Americas during the 400-year slave trade, with more than 50% going to Brazil and only 5% to the United States. Slavery was abolished in most Latin American countries around the time of their independence from Spain. Slavery was abolished in most Latin American countries after their independence from Spain in the 1820s, except in Brazil until 1888. The legacy of black rebellion and self-liberation (marronage) has left a mark on Afro-Latinos. Maroons, escaped slaves, formed communities in remote areas, with estimates of 11,000 to 30,000 in the 17th century. These communities now make up prominent Afro-Latino areas in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. There are at least 1,098 quilombola communities in Brazil today, while Afro-descendant communities in Honduras and Nicaragua are generally rural communities descended from escaped slaves. Communities in Honduras and Nicaragua are rural and descended from escaped slaves who immigrated from the Caribbean in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Garifuna in Honduras have developed distinct racial, cultural, and political identities based on communal land ties. Data on Afro-Latinos is limited, but evidence suggests they face political, economic, and social marginalization despite rising income and growth levels in Latin America. Despite economic growth in Latin America, Afro-Latinos in countries like Brazil face significant disparities. They make up a large portion of the poor and extremely poor, have lower education levels, earn less, and have worse living conditions compared to white counterparts. Afro-Brazilians also have higher maternal mortality rates and lower life expectancies. Afro-Colombians face significant disparities, with lower life expectancies and higher homicide rates compared to whites. They make up a significant portion of the population but live in extreme poverty, with limited government investment in health and education. Many have fled to urban areas due to ongoing armed conflict. Afro-Colombians and Afro-Latinos face disparities in government investment in health, education, and infrastructure. Illiteracy rates are high among Afro-Colombians, with limited healthcare coverage. Afro-Latinos in Ecuador primarily reside in urban areas with high poverty rates, lacking access to essential services. Poverty among Afro-Ecuadorians is exacerbated by limited access to healthcare, education, and well-paying jobs. In Esmeraldas, infant mortality rates are double the national average, and only 15% of Afro-Ecuadorians have completed secondary school. Despite high labor participation, most Afro-Ecuadorians are employed in low-wage jobs. In Honduras, Afro-Latinos make up 2% of the population, with Garifuna and Afro-Antilleans being the primary groups. The majority of Garifuna live in rural communities along the northern coast, while Afro-Antilleans reside in the Bay Islands. These regions have lower poverty levels compared to the rest of Honduras. The Garifuna and Afro-Antilleans in Honduras have better access to basic needs and lower illiteracy rates compared to the national average. However, they are at a higher risk for HIV/AIDS. Afro-descendants in Nicaragua make up 9% of the population and reside in isolated coastal regions. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. The Afro-descendant communities in Nicaragua face challenges with access to basic services such as water and electricity, with lower rates compared to the national average. Issues include legal protection, political representation, land rights, human rights, and healthcare access. Comparisons are made with indigenous peoples in Latin America. Indigenous peoples have a stronger sense of group identity and political mobilization compared to Afro-descendants in Latin America. Afro-descendant communities that prove their \"indigenous-like\" status may receive more rights and recognition from their governments. Political elites in the region have been more inclined to grant collective rights to indigenous groups than to Afro-descendants. Afro-descendant leaders in Latin America have utilized international forums and diplomatic channels to advocate for increased rights and representation for their communities. Since 1990, their efforts have led to significant improvements in formal rights and international support, although grassroots support for race-based public policies remains a challenge. The Afro-descendant movement in Latin America faces challenges in increasing public awareness and group identification among Afro-Latinos, as well as ensuring that formal rights granted by governments lead to meaningful improvements in living standards. Government definitions of race in national censuses can impact advocacy efforts and political movements for Afro-Brazilians. Under Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency in Brazil, the government began using fewer racial categories in the national census to collect data on Afro-Brazilians for potential policy improvements. This led to the adoption of affirmative action policies and influenced other Latin American countries to include racial indicators in their censuses. The World Bank sponsored conferences on census reform, resulting in all countries in the region now including some form of racial indicator in their censuses. Many Latin American countries are incorporating \"racial modules\" in household surveys to track the socioeconomic status of Afro-descendants compared to the general population. Unlike the United States, no Latin American country has enacted strict racially based discriminatory laws. However, anti-discrimination legislation targeted at Afro-descendants varies among countries, with only Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador having constitutional bans on racial discrimination specific to Afro-descendants as of October 2006. The Dominican Republic lacks constitutional provisions to prevent racial discrimination against Afro-Latinos, unlike Brazil and Ecuador which have some representation in their legislatures. Honduras elected 3 Garifuna members in 2005, marking progress in Afro-descendant political representation in Latin America. Some Latin American countries are considering quotas to ensure representation of Afro-descendants and indigenous peoples in legislative bodies. Argentina and other countries have implemented laws to increase female political representation, with Argentina reaching 28% representation in Congress by 1997. Colombia also reserved seats in the House of Representatives for certain groups. In 1993, Colombia reserved two seats in the House of Representatives for Afro-Colombians, but the law was later declared unconstitutional. Currently, Colombia has two Afro-Colombian senators and seven members in the House of Representatives. The Colombian Black Caucus was launched in 2006 to address issues like racism and land rights for Afro-Colombian communities. They are receiving assistance from the International Republican Institute and similar groups are forming in other Latin American countries. In 2003, Brazil established a Special Secretariat to manage Racial Equity Promotion Policies, aiming to reduce racial inequalities through affirmative action programs and cooperation with various entities. Despite efforts, some groups claim the Special Secretariat is under-funded and under-performing, with its leader resigning in 2008 amidst allegations of misconduct. In 2008, the head of Brazil's Special Secretariat resigned amidst allegations of misusing her government credit card. Brazil endorsed quotas in 2001 to increase minority representation in government service. Afro-Brazilians struggle to pass admissions tests for free public universities, leading to low representation. Quotas for black students in university admissions have been implemented since 2002, with the first university for black students opening in S\u00e2o Paulo in 2004. This has sparked a debate on the use of quotas in education and government hiring programs. The debate on affirmative action in Brazil centers around the use of quotas in university admissions and government hiring programs. While most Brazilians support government programs to address social inequality, there is disagreement on whether beneficiaries should be selected based on race or income. Court cases have challenged the fairness of racial quotas in university admissions, with concerns raised about the lack of budget for financial assistance and support services for minority students. Critics fear that affirmative action programs may create artificial divisions in Brazilian society and lead to racial tensions. The State Department Human Rights Report for Brazil in 2007 highlighted discrimination faced by darker-skinned citizens, particularly Afro-Brazilians. Afro-Ecuadorians also experience discrimination and are subjected to frequent document checks by police. Enforcement of anti-racism laws and access to justice for blacks in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and the Dominican Republic are reported to be weak. Limited data on Latin American prisons shows a high representation of blacks. Blacks in Latin American prisons face overcrowded, violent, and unhygienic conditions. Afro-Colombian communities lack state presence, leading to conflict between paramilitaries and guerrilla forces. In May 2002, a battle resulted in the bombing death of 119 Afro-Colombian civilians. Afro-Colombians make up 22% of the displaced population, with a 20% higher displacement rate than the national average. Over 2,500 young Afro-Colombians have been killed in the last five years. In 2006, 2,500 young Afro-Colombians were killed, with Buenaventura having the highest murder rate in Colombia. The United Nations expressed concern about the disproportionate impact of the Colombian conflict on indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. Afro-Colombian leaders are worried about the lack of government response to their demands for better services and protection. Providing land titles to poor families is seen as a crucial poverty-fighting measure, enabling access to mortgages for home improvements, starting businesses, and education expenses. The World Bank has financed land-titling programs in Latin American countries like Peru, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Guatemala to enable ownership for property taxes. Land reform in the 1980s recognized the historically derived land rights of indigenous and Afro-descendant groups, with Afro-descendant communities facing challenges in gaining collective land rights compared to indigenous groups. Only Afro-Latinos in Honduras and Nicaragua have achieved similar collective land rights as indigenous communities. The Garifuna community in Central America won communal land rights by proving their cultural ties to the land, while Afro-Latinos have integrated into mestizo culture and lack the same group identity. Despite having communal titles, the Garifuna face challenges to their land rights, especially in coastal areas due to tourism development. In Honduras, concerns have been raised about a 2004 law granting land titles for private development, potentially threatening communal land rights. In Colombia, Afro-Colombian communities have been fighting for recognition and rights since the 1990s, with Law 70 granting collective land rights but many still facing displacement due to conflict and private companies using their land. In Colombia, Afro-Colombian lands are being exploited by private companies for African palm oil production, violating Law 70. Laws passed by the Colombian Congress have accelerated this practice to develop the country's natural resources. Illegally armed groups are also involved in extractive activities in Afro-Colombian territories. In Brazil, President Lula's government has improved services for quilombola communities, but many still lack land titles. Only 23 out of over 400 land title requests have been granted by Brazil's federal and state governments. A recent study found that granting all land requests in Brazil would equal half the size of California. Health disparities for Afro-descendants in Latin America are attributed to racial discrimination, limiting access to services and opportunities. PAHO analysts note higher rates of infant mortality, homicide, suicide, and HIV/AIDS among ethnic minorities. Health disparities for Afro-descendants in Latin America are evident in higher rates of infant mortality, homicide, suicide, and HIV/AIDS. Regions with significant Afro-descendant populations, such as Choc\u00f3 in Colombia, Esmeraldas in Ecuador, and the Garifuna community in Honduras, face these challenges disproportionately. Efforts to address these issues have gained attention from both the Bush Administration officials and Members of Congress. Efforts to improve the condition of Afro-Latinos in Latin America have gained attention from US officials. President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have shown interest in supporting African descent populations in the region. Congress has also moved to increase assistance to Afro-descendants in Colombia. With the recent election of Barack Obama, the first African-American President of the United States, it is predicted that US interest in Afro-Latinos may increase. Afro-descendants make up a significant portion of the population in Latin American countries and face challenges of poverty, isolation, exclusion, and racial discrimination. The Inter-American Development Bank notes that Afro-Latinos are among the most \"invisible\" populations in the region. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) highlights the invisibility of Afro-Latinos in political, economic, and educational leadership in the region. They have been excluded from census data and face human rights abuses, particularly in Colombia. Afro-descendant communities lack targeted funding compared to indigenous peoples and are at risk of HIV/AIDS. Their demands for political representation, land rights, and access to health and education programs align with U.S. foreign assistance programs targeting them. The text discusses U.S. foreign assistance programs targeting Afro-descendant communities in Latin America, involvement of multilateral development banks and regional political institutions like the Organization of American States, legislative activity addressing Afro-Latinos' concerns, and proposed policy approaches for further support. While assisting Afro-Latinos has not been a primary U.S. foreign policy objective, agencies like USAID, the State Department, and the Peace have indirectly benefited these communities. Bilateral economic aid to Latin America is primarily administered by USAID, with U.S. policy focusing on strengthening democracy, encouraging development, and enhancing security in the region. The programs serving Afro-Latinos are small and relatively new, with limited independent evaluations available to assess their effectiveness. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a private foundation funded by the U.S. government, while other agencies like the State Department and the Peace Corps also play a role in supporting these communities. In Latin America, USAID supports marginalized groups, including indigenous populations and Afro-Latinos who have faced discrimination. USAID reaches out to these populations through targeted programs and broad efforts. Recent programs include a partnership with the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights to support Afro-Latinos. IIDH has completed research on political participation by Afro-Colombians and Afro-Panamanians. They have helped the Afro-Panamanian movement with their \"Strategic Advocacy Plan\" and influenced laws against discrimination in Panama. USAID supports Afro-Colombians through various programs including alternative development and conflict resolution. USAID has implemented governance programs supporting Afro-Colombian organizations and conferences, established justice houses in 20 departments, and assisted over 170,000 displaced Afro-Colombians. Additionally, a conflict resolution program benefiting Afro-Colombian youth in Buenaventura has helped at least 1,077 children. USAID has provided funding for water and sewage systems in marginalized Afro-Ecuadorian communities, benefiting over 51,000 individuals. They have also built bridges in provinces with significant Afro-descendant populations, benefiting thousands of individuals. Additionally, USAID has supported training for Afro-Ecuadorian human rights promoters, established a network of community advocates, and provided agricultural training and small grants for Afro-Ecuadorians. In FY2005, the State Department began outreach programs to empower Afro-Latinos and marginalized youth in Latin America. Programs include English training, college preparation, and advising for higher education opportunities. The U.S. Embassy in Colombia supports 87 Afro-Colombian university students with English courses, leadership training, and advising on graduate study and scholarships in the U.S. The Inter-American Foundation provides around 60 new grants each year. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) provides grants to non-profit programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on entrepreneurship and economic progress for the poor. In FY2008, the IAF funded 10 grants totaling $2.2 million for Afro-Latino communities in various countries. Additionally, the IAF supported workshops and conferences for development and democracy, including a dialogue with Afro-descendant leaders. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) supports non-profit programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on entrepreneurship and economic progress for the poor. In FY2008, the IAF funded 10 grants totaling $2.2 million for Afro-Latino communities. The Peace Corps sends volunteers to countries with significant Afro-Latino populations, such as the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Ecuador. Peace Corps/Dominican Republic reports that all 176 volunteers are working with Afro-descendant populations, including 20 volunteers focused on healthcare and HIV/AIDS prevention in impoverished areas. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) provides grants to promote democratic governance in various countries, including those with Afro-Latino populations. NED has allocated over $1.7 million in grants to organizations working with Afro-Latinos in Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Peru between FY2002 and FY2008. The focus is on fostering citizen participation in national political systems. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has provided grants to organizations supporting Afro-Latinos in Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Peru. Grantees include the Association of Youth Groups Freedom and the League of Displaced Women, focusing on citizen participation and leadership programs for Afro-Colombian and indigenous women. NED also supports AfroAmerica XXI in Colombia for promoting political participation of Afro-Latino organizations. Additionally, the United States funds multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, which have funded projects benefiting Afro-descendants in Latin America. The World Bank has been assisting Afro-descendants in Latin America through various programs and initiatives. The number of projects and events related to Afro-descendants has decreased in the past two years. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategies for several countries have added a special focus on Afro-descendants, with the number of programs targeting them increasing over the years. The World Bank has supported efforts to include race/ethnicity variables in national censuses in the region. The World Bank has funded Afro-descendant civil society groups in Latin America and co-sponsored conferences for Afro-Latino leaders. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has focused on combating poverty and social exclusion in Afro-Latino communities, forming working groups and committees for social inclusion. The IDB's social inclusion program also targets indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, poor women, and people with HIV/AIDS. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has pledged to increase capacity-building, support research, and expand projects focused on Afro-descendants and indigenous groups. They have published a book on Social Inclusion and Economic Development in Latin America, provided training and grants to NGOs, and supported country-level projects in Brazil, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Examples of IDB operations include a $35 million loan to improve basic services in the Pacific Coast region and a $70,000 grant for Afro-Colombians. The Multilateral Investment Fund of the IDB has approved a $1.4 million grant to increase indigenous and Afro-descendant communities' involvement in Honduras' tourism industry. The IDB launched a Social Inclusion Trust Fund (SITF) funded by Norway and Great Britain to support small-scale initiatives promoting social inclusion. The SITF approved 26 projects totaling $1.4 million, including support for the Afro-Brazilian Observatory and information dissemination. The Social Inclusion Trust Fund (SITF) has supported various projects to promote social inclusion, including funding for the Afro-Brazilian Observatory and information dissemination. The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has been ratified by the United States and Spanish-and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America. Hemispheric leaders have committed to ending poverty and discrimination at Summit of the Americas meetings. Brazil proposed a resolution in 2003 to address racial discrimination. In 2003, Brazil proposed a resolution to draft an Inter-American Convention for the Prevention of Racism and Discrimination. The OAS commissioned a report on racism against Afro-descendants in the region. Cases involving Afro-descendants are being resolved by the IAHCR and the Inter-American Court. The IAHCR created a Special Rapporteur on the Rights of People of African descent. The OAS is negotiating a draft text of the Inter-American Convention. The Inter-American Dialogue founded the Inter-Agency Consultation on Race in Latin America (IAC) to address issues of race, discrimination, and social exclusion facing Afro-descendants in Latin America. The IAC included representatives from various international development institutions and aimed to encourage policymakers and development agencies to address issues of race and discrimination in their programs. The IAC, with input from academics and Afro-descendant groups, organized forums to raise awareness of Afro-Latino issues. Brazil acknowledged racial prejudice for the first time after a national dialogue leading up to the World Conference Against Racism in 2001. The \"Brasilia Declaration\" set regional goals for Afro-Latino concerns, leading to a meeting of Afro-Latino legislators in Bogot\u00e1 in 2004. In May 2004, Afro-Latino legislators, including Members of the U.S. Congress, met in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. They convened again in Costa Rica in August 2005 and in June 2008 to prepare a document on regional progress in addressing racism for the U.N. Durban Review Conference Against Racism in Geneva, Switzerland in April 2009. Congress has shown concern for Afro-Latinos in Latin America, with initiatives introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses, but no action was taken. In November 2003, Congressman Menendez proposed a bill, H.R. 3447, the Social Investment Fund for the Americas Act of 2003, to combat poverty and exclusion in the Western Hemisphere. The bill aimed to assist marginalized populations such as people of African descent, indigenous groups, women, and people with disabilities by providing $250 million to USAID and the IDB annually from 2005 to 2009. In February 2004, Congressman Rangel introduced a resolution, H.Con.Res. 47, to promote research and development programs for Afro-descendant communities. In July 2004, Congressman Meeks submitted a resolution urging the US government to work with Latin American governments and the international community to support Afro-descendants and eliminate racial discrimination. The House passed a resolution in July 2005 recognizing injustices faced by African descendants and recommending improvements for Afro-descendant communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Legislation introduced in the House aimed to provide Temporary Protected Status for Colombian nationals, including Afro-Colombians affected by the conflict. Another resolution recognized the efforts of Afro-Colombian communities and urged monitoring of violence against them. In the 110th Congress, bills addressed provisions related to Afro-Latinos, including requirements for the State Department to certify the protection of land and property rights of Afro-Colombians and indigenous peoples. The House passed resolutions supporting the rights of Afro-Colombians and indigenous communities, providing alternative development assistance and recognizing the plight of internally displaced persons in Colombia. The House passed a resolution supporting the \"Joint Action Plan\" between Brazil and the US to eliminate racial discrimination. The 110th Congress discussed Afro-Colombian issues during the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. The Obama Administration is seen optimistically by Afro-Latinos for increased attention to their issues. U.S. foreign aid has not specifically addressed Afro-Latinos as beneficiaries. The United States has not specifically addressed Afro-Latinos as beneficiaries in foreign aid programs, unlike the attention given to \"women in development.\" While Afro-Latinos are helped by general assistance programs for the poor, some U.S. agencies have developed interventions for specific Afro-descendant communities. Analysts argue for increased assistance and a clearer policy to address the specific problems faced by Afro-Latinos. Proponents advocate for expanded assistance to Afro-Latinos, highlighting the lack of data on their socioeconomic situation, limited support for community organizations, and insecure land titles. They stress the importance of US support for better data collection, legislative initiatives for aid, and capacity-building programs. Advocates also urge for inclusion of Afro-Latinos in program design and implementation to address the specific challenges they face. Advocates call for increased US support for Afro-Latinos through bilateral aid programs, participation in multilateral initiatives, and backing conventions against racism and discrimination. Some question the feasibility of additional assistance due to limited development funding for Latin America. Advocates suggest increasing US support for Afro-Latinos through bilateral aid programs and participation in multilateral initiatives. However, concerns exist about the feasibility of additional assistance due to limited development funding for Latin America. Some caution against mandating the inclusion of Afro-Latinos in specific aid portfolios, citing potential drawbacks such as diverting resources from other needy groups and increasing regulatory burdens on development agencies. Additionally, the sensitivity of race and national identity in Latin America should be considered when approaching this issue. Notions of race and national identity vary widely between the United States and Latin America, and within the countries of the region. Some argue against the United States imposing its views and policies on other sovereign nations."
