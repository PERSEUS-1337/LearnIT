The \"Mutual Bank Capital Opportunity Act of 2017\" defines a mutual capital certificate as a financial instrument issued by a mutual depository that is subordinate to all claims, unsecured by assets, and does not permit preemptive rights. A mutual capital certificate issued by a mutual depository is subordinate to all claims, unsecured by assets, does not permit preemptive rights, does not provide voting or member rights unless changes are proposed by the board, is not eligible as collateral for loans, entitles the holder to dividends, and is not redeemable until a specified date. A mutual capital certificate issued by a mutual depository is not redeemable until 5 years after issuance, except in specific circumstances like merger or reorganization into a mutual holding company or Federal mutual bank holding company. The text discusses the authorization for mutual depositories to issue mutual capital certificates as common equity Tier 1 capital for meeting federal capital requirements. Regulations for implementation are required within 180 days. Regulations must be issued within 180 days for mutual depositories to issue mutual capital certificates as common equity Tier 1 capital. Additionally, other financial instruments may be identified as Tier 1 capital within 90 days. The appropriate Federal banking agencies must report to Congress every 6 months on the progress of promulgating regulations for mutual depositories to issue mutual capital certificates as common equity Tier 1 capital. The report should include outreach efforts to the financial industry and any barriers to implementation."
