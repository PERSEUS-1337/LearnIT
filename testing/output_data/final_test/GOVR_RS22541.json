    "content": "The U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was established in 1974 to provide duty-free entry for thousands of products from beneficiary countries. In 2015, agricultural products accounted for $2.6 billion under the program. Some in Congress are considering changes that could affect certain countries' benefits. The program was last extended until December 31, 2017, and its expiration could be a legislative issue in the 115th Congress. U.S. imports under GSP totaled $17.7 billion in 2015, with manufactured products being the leading imports. In 2015, agricultural products accounted for $2.6 billion in U.S. imports under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), nearly doubling since 2010. These imports make up about 2% of total U.S. agricultural imports, with leading products including processed foods, beverages, fruits, vegetables, sugar, olive oil, and food processing inputs. In 2015, agricultural products worth $2.6 billion were imported under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), nearly doubling since 2010. Leading imports include processed foods, beverages, fruits, vegetables, sugar, olive oil, and food processing inputs. Beneficiary countries like Thailand, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey supply most GSP agricultural imports, with Thailand and Brazil alone accounting for 40% of agricultural imports. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, extended until December 31, 2017, has been somewhat controversial with calls for reforms by some in Congress. House and Senate committees have been evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. trade preference programs, including GSP, and discussing broader reforms. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published reports on U.S. preference programs like GSP, with amendments made during the 109th Congress to address concerns about product coverage and country eligibility. Congress enacted changes to GSP as part of its annual review. In 2006, Congress amended the GSP program by tightening rules on CNL waivers, which are quantitative ceilings on GSP benefits for specific products from beneficiary countries. USTR periodically revokes CNL waivers, as seen with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire losing its waiver for kola nuts in 2006. Amendments allowed for the revocation of waivers in effect for at least five years if trade levels exceed certain thresholds. In July 2015, USTR granted CNL waivers for coconut products from Thailand, and in July 2016 for certain products from Tunisia, Brazil, and Thailand. Other existing waivers include sugar and preserved bananas from the Philippines, sugar, carnations, figs, yams, and gelatin derivatives from Colombia, and animal hides from South Africa and Thailand. The GSP program also designated five new cotton products as eligible for GSP status in 2015. In early 2012, the Obama Administration suspended GSP benefits for Argentina due to failure to enforce arbitral awards in favor of US citizens or entities. This decision affected Argentina, a top beneficiary country under the GSP program, accounting for over 10% of agricultural imports. In October 2016, Argentina requested GSP beneficiary designation, under review by USTR. Gibraltar and Turks and Caicos graduated in 2012 due to \"high income\" status. South Sudan and Senegal became eligible as \"least-developed beneficiary developing countries.\" Bangladesh's GSP benefits were suspended in 2013 and not reinstated. Russia's GSP status was terminated in 2014 after the Crimea invasion. In October 2014, Russia's GSP status was terminated, affecting agricultural exports. President Obama announced Seychelles, Uruguay, and Venezuela no longer eligible for GSP benefits in 2015. USTR reinstated Burma's eligibility in 2016. Changes to GSP have impacted import distribution and volume. Argentina's GSP suspension has affected the program. Argentina's suspension from GSP has impacted agricultural trade, as it was a major beneficiary country exporting various products under the program. Other countries affected by GSP changes were not significant suppliers of U.S. agricultural imports under the program. The GSP program has seen few CNL waivers for duty-free agricultural imports historically. Changes to the program could impact U.S. agricultural imports, such as limits on waivers from certain countries or graduation of beneficiary nations. Some African cotton-producing countries are now eligible to supply cotton products to the U.S., but the impact on imports is unknown. USTR has not conducted a comprehensive review of the program, but stakeholder opinions from the 2006 review varied. The USTR's 2006 review shows varying opinions among U.S. agricultural groups on the GSP program. The American Farm Bureau Federation opposes the program, while the Grocery Manufacturers Association supports it, highlighting certain agricultural products of importance. Other industry associations also generally support GMA's position. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) has previously supported congressional efforts to extend duty-free access for agricultural imports under the GSP. Import tariffs to the United States for various products range from 1% to 12%. These costs may be passed on to the BDCs in terms of lower import prices. The proposed changes could lead to increased costs for BDCs, but higher U.S. prices may offset these costs. Import tariffs could raise input costs for some U.S. food processors and industrial users, potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers. GSP agricultural imports mainly consist of intermediate goods and inputs."
