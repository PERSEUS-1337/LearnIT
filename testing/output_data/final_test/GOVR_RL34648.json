    "content": "Budgeting involves making choices about how to allocate scarce resources among alternative purposes, locations, and recipients in an environment of competing views about the public interest. Conflict is common in budgeting due to differing priorities of federal policy makers, such as views on the proper role of government and who decides on budget allocations. Earmarking is a key area of budgetary conflict, with varying and controversial definitions for terms like congressional earmark and presidential earmark. During the 110th Congress, definitions for congressional earmark, congressionally directed spending item, and earmark were established by the House, Senate, and the George W. Bush Administration. In January 2008, the President announced plans to veto appropriations bills that did not reduce earmarks by half compared to FY2008. Executive Order 13457 directed agencies to limit funding for non-statutory earmarks. The Bush Administration implemented policies to limit non-statutory earmarks, following Executive Order 13457. This report analyzes the veto threat and E.O. regarding congressionally originated earmarks, providing definitions and concerns related to earmarking. The report reviews previous Administration policy statements and proposals on earmarking, analyzes the Administration's veto threat and executive order, and discusses potential issues for Congress and the President in the budget process. Definitions and concerns related to earmarking are also addressed. The use of discretion to allocate specific benefits through law, non-statutory direction, or administrative action to particular purposes, entities, or areas has been a longstanding practice, but with concerns expressed. Definitions for terms like earmark vary and are controversial, with Congress and Presidents asserting their prerogatives. Earmarks, or similar practices, can be initiated by Congress, the President, or agencies in appropriations, authorization, or revenue bills. These earmarks are often included in report language and joint explanatory statements to communicate congressional intent and expectations to agencies. Presidential and agency earmarking, similar to congressional activity, can be legally binding when incorporated into statutes. Earmarks may be requested in budget proposals, embedded in agency spending plans, allocated during the fiscal year, or made eligible for benefits. This practice involves the President, political appointees, and career civil servants. During and after the FY2008 appropriations process, some Members of Congress viewed actions by the President and executive agencies as earmarks. Earmarks may be included in a bill at the prompting of the White House or an agency, raising questions about their origin as congressional or presidential. Joint or hybrid earmarks suggest difficulty in definitively categorizing earmarking decisions. The 110th Congress defined terms like congressional earmark and provided direction on how earmarks are handled in the budget process. Various definitions were developed by the House, Senate, and Bush Administration. Reasons for earmarking resources could include representing constituents, fulfilling constitutional obligations, and preventing encroachment by other branches of government. Congress exercises its power of the purse by defining agency control over public funds, providing flexibility through report language, facilitating interbranch communications, and earmarking for public policy goals or legislative compromise. Earmarking can serve various functions such as assisting with legislative compromise, engaging expertise to accomplish agency goals, representing broad or narrow interests, or proposing measures for Congress's consideration. Concerns about earmarking include perceptions of inefficiency and lack of transparency and scrutiny. Concerns were expressed about Congressional leaders and appropriators using earmarks as leverage to influence votes, leading to increased earmarking for parochial and political reasons rather than legitimate policy differences. Concerns about activities seen as presidential or executive agency earmarking include an increase in sole-sourced contracts, lack of transparency in presidential earmarks compared to Congress, and allocation of funds not approved by Congress. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is financing a facility in a way that may violate reprogramming restrictions and notification requirements. The Administration has previously expressed interest in reducing congressional earmarks, stating that they can distort merit-based resource distribution processes. The Administration focused on reducing congressional earmarks in its budget proposal for FY2004 and subsequent years through the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) initiative. Congress and the Bush Administration paid significant attention to congressionally originated earmarks and budgetary discretion during the 110th Congress. The House of Representatives and the Senate amended rules to define congressional earmarks. The Senate established a new Rule XLIV in 2007 to define congressionally directed spending items, with requirements for disclosure of earmarks. The Bush Administration aimed to cut earmarks by 50% in FY2008 appropriations and issued memoranda defining earmarks and requiring agency actions. The January 2007 memorandum defined earmarks and provided additional guidance on congressional restrictions. It called for agencies to identify and publicize earmark information online to reduce earmark numbers and funding. The OMB February 2007 memorandum instructed agencies on handling non-statutory congressionally originated earmarks for the FY2007 budget. Agencies were told not to fund non-statutory earmarks but could provide input for informed decisions. The memorandum also allowed agencies to use authorized discretion for program objectives in line with Administration policy. The February 2007 memorandum from OMB addressed the handling of non-statutory congressionally originated earmarks for the FY2007 budget. It instructed agencies not to fund these earmarks but allowed input for informed decisions and discretion for program objectives in line with Administration policy. The memorandum also raised questions about the Administration's definition of earmarks and its budgetary decision-making process. OMB later established an \"Earmarks\" website to track earmarks and measure Congress's progress towards the President's budget goals. The OMB established an \"Earmarks\" website to track earmarks and measure Congress's progress towards the President's budget goals for FY2008. The website aimed to inform the debate on taxpayer spending and implemented the Administration's definition of earmarks in practice. Many earmarks focused on congressional specifications, while some items in the database did not specify a recipient or location. The FY2005 appropriations- and authorization-related earmarks datasets include items made by telephone call, language in the Congressional Record, and modified from bill or report language through \"congressional letters of intent.\" A May 2007 memorandum provided a different Administration definition of earmark. Final action on FY2008 appropriations occurred in late 2007, with enactment of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. OMB posted a summary tally of Administration-identified FY2008 earmark numbers and funding on January 29, 2008. In FY2008, there were changes in earmark numbers and funding, with a total of 11,524 earmarks and $16.502 billion identified. The President threatened to veto FY2009 appropriations bills if earmark numbers and funding were not cut by half compared to FY2008. An executive order was issued to reduce earmarks not voted on by Congress. The executive order issued aimed to reduce earmarks by Congress by making their origin and purposes transparent, including them in bill texts, and restricting funding for non-statutory earmarks unless required by law or deemed meritorious. It also provided a new definition of earmarks with binding force on agencies. The executive order issued after January 29, 2008, requires agency heads to base funding decisions on earmarks solely on the text of laws and authorized, transparent, statutory criteria, prohibiting non-statutory means or communications from influencing the process. The executive order issued after January 29, 2008, requires agency heads to base funding decisions on earmarks solely on statutory criteria, superseding competitive awards or merit-based decision-making. Agency heads must handle congressional communications about non-statutory earmarks in writing and post them online within 30 days, unless directed otherwise by the agency head after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. E.O. 13457 reflects the Administration's definition of earmark and its stance on the roles of Congress and the President in resource allocation. The executive order issued after January 29, 2008, requires agency heads to base funding decisions on earmarks solely on statutory criteria, superseding competitive awards or merit-based decision-making. It reflects a view that congressional allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes often leads to wasteful spending if it does not leave discretion to the President and his Administration. Congressional direction that fully limits the President's or an agency's discretion would be considered an earmark. The Administration's definitions use terms like control and manage to mean the Administration's use of discretion to allocate funds based on competition and merit. The executive order issued in January 2008 requires agency heads to base funding decisions on earmarks solely on statutory criteria, superseding competitive awards or merit-based decision-making. The Administration has not explicitly articulated its position on the appropriate roles of Congress and the President in the allocation of resources and benefits for public purposes. If agencies comply with the executive order as written, it might alter the effectiveness of non-statutory earmarking by Congress. Agencies could be required to make formal requests for non-statutory earmarks. The executive order issued in January 2008 requires agency funding decisions to be based on statutory criteria, superseding competitive awards or merit-based decision-making. The resources involved in earmarking by Congress are considerable, likely amounting to billions of dollars. The executive order issued in January 2008 requires agency funding decisions to be based on statutory criteria, superseding competitive awards or merit-based decision-making. The resources involved in earmarking by Congress are considerable, likely amounting to billions of dollars. The Administration's approach seems to call for detailed legislation when allocating resources, while also maintaining the President's discretion and control over agency decision-making, potentially changing the relationship between Congress and executive agencies. The executive order issued in January 2008 aims to limit Congress's legislative activities on resource allocation to statutory text, potentially changing interbranch dynamics. The order allows the White House to decide on honoring non-statutory earmarks, giving OMB influence over the process. The OMB Director can determine the disclosure of congressional requests and issue additional instructions to agencies. The executive order issued in January 2008 allows the White House to influence agency decision-making and leverage interactions with Congress. The OMB Director can determine the disclosure of non-statutory earmark requests and issue additional instructions to agencies. Experience over time will clarify OMB's role in practice, and agencies are not required to disregard non-statutory earmarks. The executive order from January 2008 allows the White House to influence agency decision-making regarding non-statutory earmarks. Agencies are not strictly prohibited from funding earmarks deemed to have no merit, as exceptions exist based on statutory criteria or Administration policy. The executive order from January 2008 allows the White House to influence agency decision-making regarding non-statutory earmarks, which may be influenced by OMB or White House input. The definition of earmark in the order is imprecise, with criteria that could allow for expansive interpretation if desired by the Administration. The OMB emphasizes transparency and merit-based allocation in the President's budget proposal, contrasting it with congressional earmarking. Director Jim Nussle highlighted the detailed justifications behind the proposals, which are often competitively bid, allowing Congress to choose. The OMB emphasizes transparency and merit-based allocation in the President's budget proposal, contrasting it with congressional earmarking. Congress needs to change its ways on earmarking to align with the E.O. definition, which could lead to a broader interpretation of earmarks. The second criterion of E.O. 13457 is vague and could be broadly interpreted by the Administration. It is unclear how the executive branch's ability to manage funds would be affected by non-statutory reprogramming directions from Congress. Reprogramming involves shifting funds within an appropriations account, potentially deviating from the original allocation. Reprogramming allows for shifting funds within appropriations accounts, giving agencies flexibility while maintaining congressional oversight. The Administration's definition of earmarks may not apply to reprogramming requirements. On September 30, 2008, H.R. 2638 was signed into law, including 3 of the 12 regular appropriations acts for FY2009. The FY2009 appropriations acts included 3 of the 12 regular appropriations acts, a long-term CR for the remaining acts, and a supplemental act for disaster relief. The President did not issue veto threats based on earmarks. OMB issued instructions for implementing the consolidated appropriations act. Agencies are obligated to fund earmarks under certain conditions. In implementing the FY09 CR, agencies are legally obligated to fund an earmark only if it meets specific criteria outlined in the E.O. The earmark must have been in the FY08-enacted appropriation, be of a continuing nature, and not be able to be carried out with remaining FY09 funds. If an earmark does not meet all criteria, agencies must fund it only if it has merit under statutory or other criteria. The E.O. directs agencies to be restrictive in funding statutory earmarks during the FY09 CR period, only funding those FY08 earmarks of a continuing nature that cannot be carried out with remaining FY09 funds if they have merit under statutory criteria. The FY09 CR did not direct agencies to fund FY08 statutory earmarks during the FY09 CR period. The memorandum also addressed non-statutory earmarks, stating agencies should not fund them during the FY09 CR period. The FY09 CR did not direct agencies to fund FY08 statutory earmarks during the FY09 CR period. The memorandum also addressed non-statutory earmarks, stating agencies should not fund them during the FY09 CR period. OMB suggested that the prohibition on \"new starts\" in the FY2009 long-term CR would apply to some earmarks, both statutory and non-statutory. Agencies were directed to implement statutory earmarks in a manner consistent with applicable law, while non-statutory earmarks would need to follow provisions outlined in the E.O. It remains unclear how or when agencies will determine which non-statutory earmarks will be made publicly available on the Internet, as required by the E.O. The Bush Administration's policy on earmarks, as outlined in Executive Order 13457, may impact congressional budgeting practices and relationships between Congress, the President, and agencies. Key issues for Congress include defining earmarks, oversight, and implications of the Executive Order and OMB's \"Earmarks\" website. The implications of Executive Order 13457 on Congress and the OMB \"Earmarks\" website and database of congressionally originated earmarks may affect congressional representational activities. The Constitution establishes a framework for the interaction between Congress, the President, and individual agencies in the federal budget process, emphasizing a separation of powers while promoting connectedness and blending among the branches. The Constitution emphasizes a separation of powers while promoting connectedness and blending among Congress, the President, and agencies in the federal budget process. Congress can use its power to specify resource allocation through law or non-statutory means, affecting the President's decisions. Congress can influence the President and federal agencies by expanding or limiting discretion, increasing or decreasing transparency, and affecting agency independence. Presidential influence on congressional decisions can be exerted through tools like the veto power and control over information. Appointments of senior officials and public opinion can also impact agency decisions. The Administration influences agency decisions through appointments of senior officials and other levers, sometimes constrained by Congress. Agencies are caught between Congress and the President in shaping public policy. They also have autonomy in shaping actions with diverse stakeholders. The Administration contrasts congressional earmarks with presidential and agency decision-making processes. Budgetary decision making in the executive branch raises questions about the political nature of the process, the role of access to officials and lobbyists, and how constitutional obligations and practical concerns are balanced. Various considerations such as representation, responsibilities, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, transparency, ethics, and accountability need to be reconciled in this complex process. The President proposed Congress to stop using earmarks in report language and instead place them in statute to enforce accountability. Report language has been used historically to guide agency decisions and facilitate communication, but some argue it lacks scrutiny in the legislative process. Others see it as a way to enhance communication between Congress and agencies. The President's executive order on earmarks in report language raises questions about control over public policy design and implementation, as well as implications for relations between Congress, the President, and agencies. The lack of universally accepted definitions for earmarks adds complexity to the debate. The lack of universally accepted definitions for earmarks adds complexity to the debate, with potential implications for resource allocation activities and public scrutiny. If the Administration's definition of earmarking as solely a congressional activity is widely accepted, future discourse and policy proposals may focus more on congressionally originated earmarks. The lack of universally accepted definitions for earmarks adds complexity to the debate, with potential implications for resource allocation activities and public scrutiny. The definitions of earmarks might be widely accepted, affecting the institutional capacities of Congress and the President to carry out their responsibilities and advance their policy preferences. The lack of universally accepted definitions for earmarks complicates resource allocation and public scrutiny. Transparency in decision-making processes and outcomes is crucial for scrutiny and effective functioning of government institutions. The Administration's online database may not include all instances of earmarks received through \"other communication,\" raising questions about transparency and selective disclosure in legislative negotiations. There is no comprehensive source of information on whether congressionally originated earmarks are funded by agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed OMB to report on the allocation of directed funding by executive departments and agencies to intended recipients. The Senate directed OMB to report on the allocation of earmarks by agencies. The resulting information may show instances where earmarks are not fully provided to recipients due to various reasons. E.O. 13457 and the President's veto threat in the 2008 State of the Union Message could impact this. The President's veto threat in the 2008 State of the Union Message may affect the congressional appropriations process and other legislative activities. The implications of E.O. 13457 are uncertain, and Congress could explore various options in response, such as holding hearings or including non-statutory earmarks in statutory text. Congress could respond to the President's veto threat by considering various options, such as incorporating non-statutory earmarks into statutory text or legislating on the topic to influence practices called for by the Executive Order. Factors influencing the acceptance of earmark definitions include ease of access to corresponding data and the extent of data availability on earmarks. OMB's \"Earmarks\" website provides publicly accessible data on congressionally originated earmarks. The OMB website, known for providing data on congressionally originated earmarks, gained visibility after being designated as the baseline for reducing earmarks. The FY2008 disclosure lists of earmarks in House and Senate reports also garnered media attention. However, data from congressional reports have not been aggregated like on the OMB website. Additionally, a searchable website for federal grant, contract, and loan awards was required by Congress to be established by OMB. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 required OMB to establish USAspending.gov for grant, contract, and loan awards. However, the website does not differentiate between congressionally earmarked awards and those initiated by the President or agencies. OMB's \"Earmarks\" website is the only resource providing aggregate information on congressionally earmarked awards online. The OMB \"Earmarks\" website is the main federal resource for tracking earmarks, providing information reflecting the Administration's perspective on earmarks. Congress could consider various options regarding earmarks, with advantages and disadvantages to each. The OMB \"Earmarks\" website serves as a tool for the President to advocate policy preferences and allow scrutiny over Congress. Congress could create its own earmark database with different definitions, providing an alternative source of information. The OMB \"Earmarks\" website could be used to establish a definition of earmarks in line with congressional rules, ensuring consistency in data collection. This may limit the President's influence over earmarks. Critics argue that current definitions do not allow for sufficient scrutiny of congressional actions. Some suggest the President should use OMB resources to define earmarks and reduce their prevalence. There are concerns about separation of powers if Congress mandates a different definition for OMB. Congress could consider amending the FFATA to require OMB to incorporate its \"Earmarks\" data into USAspending.gov, which may provide the public with more information about federal awards. This option may have advantages and disadvantages, including potential negative reactions from the media and the public. Congress could pursue different options regarding the inclusion of earmark data in federal websites. One option is to require OMB to include its \"Earmarks\" data in USAspending.gov, potentially giving Congress more control over the information provided to the public. Another option is to have the FFATA website include congressionally defined earmarks, creating two sources of information with potentially different definitions. The FFATA website may not capture all congressionally originated earmarks not associated with federal awards. Administration efforts to track earmarks could impact Congress's representational activities. The Framers believed in layers of representation for checks and balances between Congress and the President. Members of Congress represent localized interests that may not align with national interests. Members of Congress act individually, in their chambers, and between chambers to make laws for the Nation. The President proposes policies and ensures laws are executed, using discretion to advance policy preferences. The presidency represents national interests, with layered representation and checks and balances addressing preferences of national and local constituencies through broad laws, specific laws, earmarks, and administrative decisions. The requirements of E.O. 13457 and the OMB \"Earmarks\" website subject Congress to scrutiny in funding decisions, potentially affecting its representational capacity. The goal of transparency in government funding decisions is emphasized, with the impact on Congress's long-term representational capacity being a point of debate."
