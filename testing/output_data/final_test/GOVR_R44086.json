    "content": "Small businesses are often discussed in Congress regarding tax policies for economic growth. The report uses 2015 U.S. Census data to analyze the size of businesses by legal form (corporate and pass-through) and employment distribution. Most corporations and pass-throughs in 2011 had fewer than five employees. Based on 2015 U.S. Census data, most businesses were small with fewer than 500 employees, the common threshold used by the Small Business Administration. While the majority of firms were small, larger firms accounted for the majority of employment, with 53% of employees working at firms with 500 or more employees. Corporate employment drove this statistic, with 76% of corporate employees at firms with more than 500 employees compared to 25% of pass-through employees. The report discusses the tax treatment of business income in the United States, focusing on C corporations and the double taxation they face. It may be useful for Congress when considering policies for businesses based on size. The report does not analyze preferential tax treatment for small businesses or their role in job creation. The income of pass-through businesses is taxed only once at individual income tax rates, unlike C corporations which face double taxation. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and subchapter S corporations. The 2017 tax revision reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The 2017 tax revision reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and provided pass-throughs with a special deduction of up to 23% of their income. The deduction reduces the amount of income subject to tax at individual rates, lowering the effective tax rate on qualifying pass-throughs. Firm size comparison between pass-throughs and corporations is complex due to different ways of measuring size, such as employment, profits, and assets. The Small Business Administration (SBA) considers a business small if it has 500 or fewer employees, although this threshold can reach 1,500 employees. The employment-based metric to measure size leaves unresolved issues on determining the threshold between small and large businesses. The Small Business Administration defines a small business as having 500 or fewer employees, with some exceptions allowing up to 1,500 employees. The data in this report is based on the Census Bureau's 2015 Statistics of U.S. Businesses, focusing on employer data. Nonemployers are excluded as they make up a small percentage of business sales and receipts. In 2015, there were 124.1 million people employed by employer firms, with C corporations employing 54.9 million (44.2%), S corporations employing 32.6 million (26.2%), partnerships employing 14.3 million (11.6%), sole proprietors employing 4.7 million (3.8%), nonprofits employing 15.7 million (12.6%), governments employing 1.3 million (1.0%), and \"other\" entities employing 0.5 million (0.4%). Corporations and pass-throughs together employed 96.5 million workers, with 55% at corporations and 45% at pass-throughs. There were 5.5 million corporations and pass-throughs with at least one employee in 2015, including 2.9 million S corporations, 1.0 million C corporations, 0.9 million sole proprietorships, and 0.7 million partnerships. In 2015, there were 1.0 million C corporations, 0.9 million sole proprietorships, and 0.7 million partnerships. C corporations accounted for 18.1% of firms, while pass-throughs accounted for 81.9%. The majority of both corporations and pass-throughs had fewer than five employees, with 55% of corporations and 64% of pass-throughs falling into this category. In 2015, the majority of corporations and pass-throughs had fewer than five employees. The distribution of sole proprietors, partnerships, and S corporations by firm size shows that most pass-throughs have 0 to 4 employees, with the number of firms decreasing as firm size increases. Sole proprietorships had the highest proportion of small firms, with almost 78% having 0 to 4 employees. In 2015, the majority of firms had fewer than 500 employees, with the largest firms employing over 53% of the workforce. Smaller firms with 5 to 499 employees accounted for a smaller share of the overall employment. In 2015, employment in the corporate sector was skewed towards larger firms, with 76% of employees working at firms with over 500 employees. In contrast, employment in the pass-through sector was more evenly distributed across different size categories, with about 25% of employees at firms with over 500 employees. In 2015, the largest firms in the corporate sector accounted for nearly 76% of employees. Among firms with over 500 employees, C corporations had an average of 4,100 employees, while pass-throughs had an average of 1,100 employees. Partnerships had the most employees on average, followed by S-corporations and sole proprietorships. This analysis highlights the distribution of small and large businesses, employment distribution across different sizes, and employment differences between corporations and pass-throughs. The analysis presented here emphasizes the distribution of employment across businesses of various sizes, highlighting differences between C corporations and pass-through entities. It is crucial for policymakers to consider the impact of tax policies on small C corporations, as 99% of them have less than 500 employees. Neglecting the effects on small C corporations could lead to overlooking a significant portion of small businesses. Additionally, understanding the distribution of employment across firm sizes is essential when formulating policies. While the majority of corporate and pass-through businesses are small with fewer employees, firms with more than 500 employees, accounting for 0.4%, employ over 50% of all employees."
