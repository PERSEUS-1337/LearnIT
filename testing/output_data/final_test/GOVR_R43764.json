    "content": "Recent high-profile incidents of sexual violence on campus have led to increased scrutiny from Congress and the Obama Administration on policies and procedures at institutions of higher education. Several bills have been introduced to address campus sexual violence, including the Campus Accountability and Safety Act (CASA), SOS Campus Act, HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act, Safe Campus Act of 2015, and Fair Campus Act of 2015. There are currently two federal statutes addressing sexual violence on college campuses. The report provides information on the Clery Act and Title IX, laws enforced by the Department of Education to address sexual violence on college campuses. It also discusses the impact of sexual violence on victims' physical and mental health, including academic decline. The prevalence and impact of sexual violence on college students' academic performance is a major concern. Various studies have tried to assess the scope of sexual violence, but there is little agreement on the findings. Data sources for estimating sexual violence include crime reports and surveys, leading to wide variations in estimates. One source of information about campus sexual violence is crime data reported to the police. The FBI tracks and publishes this data in its annual report, Crime in the United States, which includes information collected through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The 2014 edition includes data on reported campus crimes, including rape, by state. Many experts believe official crime statistics underestimate the prevalence of sexual violence, which is often underreported to police due to various reasons such as fear of retaliation, known perpetrator, victim perception, and location of the event. Many estimates of sexual violence come from retrospective survey data, with varying results. For example, a 2007 study found that one in five undergraduate women experienced sexual assault in college, while a 2014 study estimated the rate at 6.1 per 1,000 college females. The rate of rape and sexual assault among college females was found to be 6.1 per 1,000 students. Methodological and research choices can significantly impact the measurement and conclusions in research on sexual violence. Factors such as survey purpose, administration method, respondent privacy, and time frame can influence survey findings. Factors such as survey purpose, administration method, respondent privacy, time frame, response rates, and question wording can impact study conclusions in sexual violence research. Surveys with low response rates or non-random samples may suffer from bias. The DOJ's National Crime Victim Survey and HHS's surveys are the main federal surveys examining sexual violence. The Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) provide data on sexual violence from a public health perspective. Analysis of NCVS data shows varying rates of rape and sexual assault among female student and nonstudent victims. The NISVS data estimates that nearly one in five women and one in 71 men have been raped, with a higher prevalence of sexual violence victimization other than rape. The analysis of 2010 NISVS data on sexual violence did not distinguish between students and nonstudents, making it unclear how the data might apply to campus sexual violence. The data may be limited by low response rates and other factors, prompting the BJS to evaluate its National Crime Victim Survey for better methods of collecting self-report data on rape and sexual assault. The panel recommended best practices for measuring rape and sexual assault on the NCVS and other BJS household surveys in 2014. BJS continues to improve the National Crime Victim Survey, with ongoing efforts to assess collection methods and redesign the survey instrument. Additionally, the Office on Violence Against Women is collaborating with BJS to develop a campus climate survey to measure sexual violence on individual campuses or higher education systems. Campus climate surveys are crucial for measuring rape and sexual assault among college students, collecting information on effective policies and programs, providing services to victims, investigating incidents, and holding perpetrators accountable. The validation study of a new survey instrument was completed in January 2016. Some institutions already conduct their own surveys on sexual violence. The Association of American Universities published findings from a survey involving 150,072 students in 2015. The AAU campus climate survey of 27 institutions found that 11.7% of student respondents reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact. The Clery Act and Title IX aim to protect students from sexual violence on college campuses, with the Obama Administration emphasizing the responsibilities of IHEs under these laws. The Clery Act and Title IX aim to protect students from sexual violence on college campuses. The Clery Act requires disclosure of campus crime statistics and policies for all types of crimes, not just sexual violence, while Title IX focuses on addressing sexual violence incidents on campus. Title IX is a civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs receiving federal funding, including sexual violence. Unlike the Clery Act, Title IX applies to all education programs with federal funding, not just those receiving student financial aid under the HEA. Enforcement and remedies for Title IX differ from the Clery Act. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees compliance with student financial aid requirements, including the Clery Act. FSA conducts program reviews and can impose fines up to $35,000 per violation. It also has the authority to suspend institutional participation in federal aid programs for Clery Act violations. Federal agencies enforce Title IX compliance for education programs receiving federal funding. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Title IX compliance and may sanction institutions with suspension or termination of federal funding. The Clery Act requires institutions to report campus crime statistics and establish safety policies for crimes like sexual violence, murder, and hate crimes. The Clery Act mandates institutions to report campus crime statistics, including crimes like murder and hate crimes, in the Annual Security Report (ASR). Recent amendments to the Act were made under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA). The report also includes data on reported crimes and institutions that violated the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires institutions to report campus crime statistics, including offenses reported to campus security authorities or local police. ASRs must be published by October 1st each year, and data must be submitted to ED annually. Campus security authorities are responsible for collecting and reporting crime statistics as defined by ED's regulations. A campus security authority is an individual or organization responsible for campus security, including monitoring entrance, reporting criminal offenses, and overseeing student and campus activities. This authority is required to collect and report crime statistics as defined by ED's regulations. Campus security authorities are responsible for collecting and reporting Clery Act reportable data and crimes, but are not considered campus security authorities when acting as pastoral or professional counselors. Clery geography includes campus areas, noncampus areas, and public property, as defined in the Clery Act regulations. The Clery Act defines campus security authorities as individuals responsible for reporting Clery Act data and crimes on campus, excluding pastoral or professional counselors. Clery geography encompasses campus, noncampus, and public property. Noncampus buildings or property include those owned by student organizations or institutions of higher education but not within the institution's immediate vicinity. The Clery Act defines campus security authorities as individuals responsible for reporting crimes on campus, excluding counselors. Clery geography includes campus, noncampus, and public property within a contiguous area of the institution. Public property is defined as adjacent to the institution's facilities used for educational purposes. Separate campuses are designated if not within a reasonably contiguous geographic area. The list of reportable crimes is outlined in the statute, with additional details provided in ED's Clery Act regulations. The Clery Act regulations provide detailed categories of reportable crimes, including murder, sex offenses, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, arrests for violations, referrals for disciplinary actions, and hate crimes. The Clery Act requires reporting of various crimes, including hate crimes categorized by bias such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and more. Definitions for crimes are based on the DOJ's UCR system, with specific categories like larceny-theft, assault, intimidation, and vandalism. Dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking are also included in the reporting requirements. The Clery Act mandates reporting of crimes based on various biases like gender identity, sexual orientation, and more. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) must establish safety and security policies, including those related to sexual violence, and include them in their Annual Security Reports (ASRs). ASRs must contain campus crime statistics and policies regarding campus law enforcement. The Clery Act requires institutions of Higher Education to include safety and security policies in their Annual Security Reports (ASRs), which must also contain campus crime statistics and policies regarding campus law enforcement. These policies include procedures for reporting criminal actions, encouraging crime reporting, responding to reports of sexual violence, prevention programs, definitions of sexual violence and consent, bystander intervention options, and sanctions for perpetrators. Procedures for alleged victims of sexual violence include evidence preservation, reporting options to campus authorities or law enforcement, obtaining orders of protection, and institutional disciplinary actions ensuring a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation conducted by trained officials. Both the accuser and accused are entitled to have others present during proceedings. The Clery Act ensures that victims of sexual violence are informed of proceedings, appeal procedures, and final determinations. It also protects victim confidentiality and prohibits retaliation. The Office of Federal Student Aid oversees Clery Act compliance by monitoring Annual Security Reports and may initiate reviews for non-compliance. The Clery Act requires compliance from IHEs and reviews may be initiated based on complaints, media events, audits, or selection processes. Reviews involve examining crime logs, ASRs, and reported incidents, with the possibility of an onsite visit. ED issues a Program Review report with noncompliance concerns, followed by a Final Program Review Determination letter that may lead to adverse administrative action. The Clery Act allows ED to impose fines and suspend participation in financial aid programs for violations. Final Program Review Determinations may or may not result in adverse actions, depending on the case findings. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of Clery Act enforcement at ED. The Office of Postsecondary Education employs staff to monitor compliance with the Clery Act and DFSCA, conducting around 20 reviews per year. They also conduct 300 program reviews annually on financial aid requirements. ED provides information on meeting campus safety and security requirements through the Clery Handbook and online tutorial. Title IX is a federal civil rights law. Title IX (P.L. 92-318) is a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs receiving federal funding. It applies to various educational contexts and institutions, requiring compliance to avoid losing federal aid. The current focus on combating sexual violence on college campuses stems from Title IX's prohibition against sexual harassment, which is considered a form of sex discrimination under the law. Sexual violence in schools is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Guidance released in 2011 clarified this, with supplemental guidance in 2014 focusing on student-on-student sexual harassment. The Obama Administration's initiative in 2014 aimed to prevent sexual violence on college campuses, reinforcing the applicability of Title IX. The Education Department (ED) is reminding institutions of their legal obligations under Title IX and the Clery Act, focusing on enforcing existing laws and providing guidance on Title IX obligations related to sexual violence. ED is also ensuring schools comply with these requirements through administrative enforcement efforts. Federal agencies oversee Title IX compliance among entities receiving federal education funding, with ED administering the majority of these efforts. Title IX compliance is enforced by the Education Department (ED), which administers federal education programs. Enforcement can occur through routine audits or in response to complaints. Individuals can file complaints with OCR or sue their educational institutions for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Schools may be held strictly liable if an employee sexually harasses a student. The Education Department enforces Title IX compliance through routine audits or in response to complaints. Schools may be strictly liable if an employee sexually harasses a student, while liability for student-on-student harassment requires actual knowledge and deliberate indifference. The 2014 initiative to combat sexual violence on college campuses focuses on Title IX administrative enforcement. Two federal agencies have administrative enforcement authority for Title IX. The Education Department enforces Title IX compliance through audits or in response to complaints. If a violation is found, OCR seeks an informal resolution, and if that fails, may suspend or terminate federal funding. The Education Department enforces Title IX compliance through audits or in response to complaints. If a violation is found, OCR seeks an informal resolution, and if that fails, may suspend or terminate federal funding. An agency cannot reach a voluntary resolution agreement with an institution found to be noncompliant. The threat of losing federal funding motivates institutions to comply with Title IX. Enforcement actions can be challenged through hearings before an Administrative Law Judge or in federal court. The Civil Rights Division at DOJ also enforces laws prohibiting sex discrimination in education. The Civil Rights Division (CRD) plays a significant role in enforcing laws that prohibit sex discrimination in education through coordination and litigation. The Federal Coordination and Compliance Section coordinates federal agencies' efforts to implement and enforce Title IX, while the Educational Opportunities Section is authorized to sue in federal court for violations of the statute. The Educational Opportunities Section enforces Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination in public schools and colleges. Despite DOJ's role in Title IX enforcement, ED is the lead agency administering Title IX for traditional educational institutions. ED combats campus sexual violence through compliance reviews and investigations in response to complaints. Data on ED's Title IX enforcement activities are available in Appendix B. ED released guidance in 2011 and 2014 related to sexual violence, defining it as physical sexual acts without consent. The guidance clarifies that sexual violence violates Title IX, creating a hostile environment that hinders a student's participation in educational programs. Schools must take immediate action to prevent harassment and address its effects. Under Title IX, schools are expected to take preventive and responsive measures to comply with the guidance provided by ED in 2011 and 2014. This includes disseminating nondiscrimination notices, designating a Title IX coordinator, providing sexual harassment training, and establishing grievance procedures. The Title IX coordinator is responsible for overseeing the school's response to reports and complaints, as well as identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic issues. Title IX coordinators are responsible for responding to reports and complaints, addressing systemic issues, and providing training. They should not have conflicting job duties. Additional guidance from ED in 2015 provides more detail on coordinator requirements. Grievance procedures must outline investigative measures. The guidance on Title IX grievance procedures specifies investigative measures, time frames, witness presentation, and training requirements for individuals involved in the process. It prohibits direct resolution between the complainant and alleged perpetrator without school involvement. The guidance on Title IX grievance procedures outlines the responsibilities of responsible employees to report incidents of sexual violence to the Title IX coordinator or designated school officials. Training must be provided to all responsible employees on how to report, respond to, and prevent sexual violence. The guidance on Title IX grievance procedures outlines the responsibilities of schools to investigate and resolve complaints of sexual violence promptly, thoroughly, and impartially. Investigations include fact-finding, hearings, and decision-making to determine the occurrence of conduct and necessary actions to address it. A school must investigate sexual violence complaints promptly, regardless of where the incident occurred. They should not wait for law enforcement to start their own investigation. The victim decides whether to file a complaint with the police or the school. Some states have mandatory reporting laws for certain crimes. The guidance also addresses confidentiality requirements. The guidance on confidentiality requirements for sexual violence complaints discusses the school's obligation to accommodate a complainant's request for privacy while also considering the need to prevent discrimination. It highlights the potential conflict between a complainant's confidentiality request and an alleged perpetrator's right to access educational records under FERPA. The Disciplinary Hearing in educational institutions determines Title IX violations and sanctions for perpetrators. Schools can use their regular disciplinary process if it aligns with Title IX requirements, including the standard of proof. The guidance specifies that schools must adopt the preponderance of the evidence standard when resolving Title IX complaints, which is the standard of proof that generally applies in civil rights cases. After the disciplinary process, schools must provide written notice of the outcome to both parties. FERPA requirements address the privacy of educational records. OCR aims to complete investigations in about 60 days, but the timeline can vary. Schools must take action to eliminate harassment and provide remedies for complainants, including interim measures like accommodations. Schools should inform complainants of their Title IX rights and counseling resources available. The guidance outlines remedies for non-compliance with Title IX regarding sexual violence, including negotiation and potential funding suspension. Title IX also prohibits retaliation against those reporting sexual violence. The Education Department (ED) guidance clarifies that Title IX prohibits retaliation against complainants of sexual violence. It also includes protections for gender identity discrimination and special populations like disabled students. FERPA guarantees students access to their education records while limiting disclosure to third parties. FERPA privacy protections may conflict with Title IX rights for victims of sexual violence. Educational institutions must protect a complainant's confidentiality under Title IX, but alleged perpetrators have the right to review the complaint under FERPA. Schools cannot disclose educational records without consent, which includes disciplinary outcomes. FERPA allows schools to disclose final results of disciplinary proceedings involving crimes of violence or nonforcible sex offenses to victims or anyone if the student is found to have violated rules or policies. This permits schools to publicly share outcomes of disciplinary hearings on sexual violence. The curr_chunk discusses policy and legal issues related to the Clery Act and Title IX in the context of underreporting sexual violence on college campuses. The American Association of University Professors highlights the lack of standardized procedures for reporting Clery statistics. Some universities may report more sexual violence complaints due to diligent monitoring, leading to potential discrepancies in reported data. This inconsistency in reporting may impact how the safety of universities is perceived by students and families. Suggestions have been made for more objective measures, such as school climate surveys, to address underreporting and inconsistencies in monitoring sexual violence on campuses. Some critics argue that the preponderance of evidence standard required by Title IX for disciplinary hearings on sexual violence is unfair, depriving alleged perpetrators of due process rights. However, it is established that different rights and procedures apply in administrative versus judicial settings. The standard of proof is higher in criminal cases, while a lower standard is allowed in civil proceedings. The concept of procedural due process originates from the U.S. Constitution's due process clause, ensuring fairness before depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. The level of procedural protection required varies based on the interests at stake, with the Supreme Court emphasizing flexibility in determining the necessary procedures. Ultimately, the degree of protection depends on the specific situation and the interests of both individuals and the government. The due process clause applies to governmental actors, not private entities. Public IHEs must provide due process protections to students in disciplinary proceedings, while private IHEs are governed by contract law. Private IHEs establish rules and policies at their discretion, which may or may not include procedural protections for students violating the code of conduct. Private IHEs are not obligated to provide due process rights to students unless specified. However, if procedural rights are given to one party, they must be available to both. Title IX guidance recommends an appeals process for disciplinary decisions, accessible to all parties. Enforcement mechanisms under Title IX are limited to suspension or termination of federal funding. The enforcement mechanism under Title IX involves the threat of losing federal funding if an institution fails to reach a compliance agreement with the Department of Education. Critics argue that this potential loss of aid can be coercive, leading institutions to enter into agreements even if they disagree with ED's findings. Some also claim that ED relies too heavily on informal resolutions, which are seen as ineffective deterrents. Informal agreements are ineffective deterrents allowing schools to violate Title IX without penalties. Legislative proposals aim to introduce new penalties, such as fines, under Title IX. Some legislators question the legal authority of the Department of Education in issuing Title IX guidance on sexual violence at higher education institutions. Senator Lankford alleges that the guidance functions as a legally binding regulation and should have followed the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), federal agencies like the Department of Education (ED) have the duty to interpret and enforce statutes. They do this through regulations and informal guidance, with regulations being legally binding. Critics argue that agencies use guidance documents to expand their regulatory authority. The APA imposes procedural requirements when agencies issue rules. The APA imposes procedural requirements on agencies when issuing rules, with exceptions for interpretive rules and general statements of policy. Disagreements with agency interpretations can be challenged in court, with deference varying based on circumstances. Deference to agency interpretations of statutes is generally given for ambiguous statutes established through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The level of deference granted to an agency's interpretation of a rule depends on whether it was formally established through rulemaking or presented informally. In cases of informal interpretation, a lesser form of deference applies, as outlined in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. The extent of deference to ED's sexual violence guidance, which has not been definitively ruled on by the courts, remains uncertain. Under Title IX, federal funding recipients must prevent and address all forms of sex discrimination, as outlined in ED's guidance. This guidance, while not legally binding, reflects the agency's interpretation of the law and is influenced by case law. Federal funding recipients should consider these rulings to avoid liability under Title IX statutes. The Education Department (ED) incorporates case law into its guidance to inform federal funding recipients of their non-statutory legal obligations regarding civil rights statutes. Enforcement actions based on this guidance would be decided by a reviewing court. The Clery Act Appendix provides data on reported crimes and institutions that violated the Act. The Clery Act requires IHEs to report campus crimes to ED annually, which are then published in the Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool. This tool allows for searching by various criteria such as institution type and year. Some analysts question the reliability of Clery Act data, which is further discussed in \"Reliability of Clery Statistics.\" Additionally, Table A-2 lists IHEs that received Final Program Review Determinations for Clery Act violations. OCR's enforcement efforts under the Clery Act are limited, with a focus on all forms of sex discrimination in education, not just sexual violence. Over a two-year period, OCR received over 5,800 Title IX-related complaints, including 854 related to sexual harassment and violence. The data does not specify whether these complaints occurred in elementary/secondary education or higher education. During a two-year period, OCR resolved 90 sexual violence-related Title IX investigations, with 25 resulting in resolution agreements. These complaints represented 9% of all civil rights complaints received by OCR. The number of sexual violence compliance reviews conducted by OCR represented 19% of all civil rights compliance reviews during that period. The number of audits and investigations related to sexual violence has increased in recent years according to ED. The number of audits and investigations related to sexual violence has increased in recent years, with 221 cases of sexual violence under investigation at 175 institutions of higher education as of April 6, 2016. Data on the duration and outcome of Title IX investigations are not publicly available. According to analysis, ED dismissed majority of Title IX sexual harassment complaints filed between 2003 and 2013. Results of investigations may be made available online. DOJ and HHS administer programs addressing sexual violence to provide context for ED's activities and legislative efforts in Congress. The DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) Campus Program provides grants to colleges for comprehensive responses to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. In FY2016, $20.0 million was allocated for these activities. Grantees served an average of 850 victims every six months in 2014, offering services like victim advocacy, crisis intervention, counseling, and legal advocacy. OVW estimates issuing 45 awards out of 242 applicants in FY2016. The CDC's Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) Program aims to strengthen sexual violence prevention efforts at various levels. In FY2014, CDC initiated a five-year cooperative agreement cycle for all states and territories, providing funding for activities such as hotlines, prevention plans, and addressing local needs, with a focus on campus sexual violence. The program received $44.4 million in funding in FY2016. OVW estimates issuing 45 awards out of 242 applicants for its Campus Program in FY2016."
