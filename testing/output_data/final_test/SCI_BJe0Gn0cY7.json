    "content": "Our proposed \u03b4-VAEs address the challenge of \"posterior collapse\" in latent variable generative models by optimizing the variational lower bound and ensuring that latent variables encode useful information. This approach resembles slow feature analysis for sequential latent variable models and has shown efficacy in modeling text and images, improving sample quality, and achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32 \u00d7 32. Deep latent variable models trained with amortized variational inference have simple decoders, capturing global structure but struggling with local details. Autoregressive models excel at local statistics but lack global coherence. Combining both could enhance generative quality. The learning capabilities of latent variable models can lead to higher-quality generative models with useful latent representations. However, a common problem arises when the autoregressive decoder is too expressive, causing the model to ignore the latent variables and collapse to the prior. This issue, known as optimization challenges of VAEs, information preference property, and posterior collapse problems, has not been effectively addressed in prior work. In this paper, the authors propose \u03b4-VAEs as a simple framework to prevent posterior collapse in latent-variable models without altering the training objective or weakening the decoder. By restricting the parameters of the posterior, they ensure a minimum KL divergence between the posterior and the prior. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on image and text datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in log-likelihood. The proposed \u03b4-VAE enhances image models by introducing a sequential latent-variable model with an anti-causal encoder structure. Experiments show its effectiveness in learning representations for downstream tasks while maintaining performance on density modeling. The \u03b4-VAE extends VAEs for training latent-variable models with amortized variational inference, aiming to maximize the marginal likelihood log p(x) on a dataset. The rate term in the \u03b4-VAE model addresses the issue of posterior collapse by ensuring a positive KL divergence between the posterior and prior distributions of latent variables. This is achieved through structural constraints that bound the KL divergence, maintaining meaningful representations in the model. In the \u03b4-VAE model, the rate term ensures a positive KL divergence between posterior and prior distributions of latent variables. Choices for p \u03b8 and q \u03c6 are described, aiming to model variations in data through latent variables for control over global and finer attributes. Latent variable sequences are effective for modeling. In the sequential setting, a \u03b4-VAE combines a mean field posterior with a correlated prior in time to model the distribution of latent variables. The prior is a first-order linear autoregressive process, ensuring a wide-sense stationary process if |\u03b1| < 1. The variance is kept constant over time by choosing \u03c3 = \u221a 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2. The mismatch in correlation structures of the prior and posterior leads to a positive lower bound on the KL-divergence between the two distributions. The committed rate can be controlled by equating the inequality to a given rate \u03b4 and solving for \u03b1. The scaling of the minimum rate is shown in Fig. 1, illustrating the effect of \u03b4 in a toy model. The AR(1) prior over latent variables specifies temporal correlation. Increasing correlation leads to smoother trajectories. Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) is effective for learning invariant spatio-temporal features. Inferred latent variables have different slowness filters based on \u03b1 values. High capacity autoregressive network is used. The high capacity autoregressive network as the decoder can accurately estimate p(x t |x <t ). Latent variables may not provide complementary information if conditional independence is imposed between observations and latent variables at other timesteps. There is no advantage for the model to utilize the latent variable unless it can inform the decoder at multiple timesteps. In a setting where the encoder can inform the decoder at multiple timesteps, an anti-causal structure is introduced to encourage leveraging latents for future predictions. This structure ensures that the variational posterior parameters for a timestep do not depend on past observations, leading to better performance compared to a non-causal setup. The main focus of our work is on representation learning and density modeling in latent variable models with powerful decoders. Our architecture for image models uses sequential latent variables to generate the image row by row, unlike prior models. This approach resembles latent variable models used for timeseries but does not rely on KL annealing and has an autoregressive dependence of the outputs over time. Our work introduces an anti-causal structure for the inference network in latent variable models, focusing on representation learning and coding efficiency. The method utilizes the Transformer architecture for the decoder and effectively learns informative latent variables while maintaining model performance. Prior work has addressed posterior collapse by modifying the training objective, with some using an annealing strategy to optimize likelihood. Prior work has proposed various methods to prevent posterior collapse in latent variable models, such as using fixed coefficients, adding terms to the objective function, and incorporating auxiliary tasks. Some approaches include using free-bits to set a target minimum rate, but optimization challenges arise due to non-smooth objectives. These methods aim to encourage the utilization of latent variables for representation learning. The ELBO is criticized for not distinguishing between models with different rates, advocating for model selection based on downstream tasks. Sweeping models with \u03b2-VAE poses challenges due to the nonlinear mapping from \u03b2 to rate. A new approach is presented to achieve a target rate while optimizing the vanilla ELBO objective. Similar work includes constraining the variational family to regularize the model, as seen in VQ-VAE. Recent papers have also utilized the von Mises-Fisher distribution for a fixed KL divergence. Recent papers have used the von Mises-Fisher distribution to address the posterior collapse problem by fixing the KL divergence. This approach, similar to VQ-VAE, allows for varying KL divergences for different data points, enabling the model to allocate more bits to complex inputs. The \u03b4-VAE method is a generalization of fixed-KL approaches and can be useful for outlier detection. Additionally, the Associative Compression Networks (ACN) introduce a new method for learning latent variables with powerful decoders that leverage associations between training data. The ACN method introduces a new approach for learning latent variables with powerful decoders that exploit associations between training examples in the dataset. GECO is a method proposed to stabilize the training of \u03b2-VAEs by finding an automatic annealing schedule for the KL divergence. The decoder network in the study is based on PixelSNAIL and GatedPixelCNN, incorporating elements from both models. It uses a single channel network to output components of discretised mixture of logistics distributions for each channel, with linear dependencies between RGB color channels. Attention layers are interleaved with masked gated convolution layers, following the architecture introduced in previous studies. Conditioning the decoder involves attention over the output. The study introduces a decoder-encoder attention mechanism with anti-causal inference structure. The encoder and decoder share the same blueprint, with the input modified for future context. To address efficiency, each row of the image is encoded with a multidimensional latent variable. Discrepancies between prior and aggregate posterior can impact VAE performance, leading to the \"posterior holes\" problem. The study addresses the \"posterior holes\" problem in \u03b4-VAEs by training an auxiliary prior to match the aggregate posterior. This approach aims to reduce the gap between the prior and posterior without influencing the encoder or decoder training. The auxiliary prior is implemented using a single-layer LSTM network with conditional-Gaussian outputs. Results on CIFAR-10 and downsampled ImageNet 32x32 show promising outcomes compared to prior work. Our models with latent variables show comparable performance to autoregressive models on ImageNet 32x32 and CIFAR-10, achieving state-of-the-art results. The auxiliary prior improves efficiency and reduces the gap between prior and posterior in \u03b4-VAEs. The auxiliary prior improves efficiency by reducing the rate of the model on CIFAR-10 by more than 50%, leading to a 30 bits per image reduction. The models learn meaningful representations in the latent variables, showing similar global structure but different details in generated samples. The model uses latent variables for global structure and autoregressive decoder for local patterns. Linear classification on CIFAR-10 shows higher rate models give better accuracy, with 92 bits per image achieving 68%. Improved log-likelihood doesn't always lead to better classification results. Linear separability of learned features is crucial for this task. The linear separability of learned features is crucial for the task. Extensive comparisons of \u03b4-VAE with other approaches were conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Results of experiments for the CIFAR-10 test set are reported in bits per image in FIG4, highlighting the difference between models in capturing information in latent variables. The \u03b4-VAE approach encodes a significant amount of information in latent variables. Alternative solutions require considerable effort to prevent the KL from collapsing. Linear annealing of KL BID5 did not allow for significant usage of latent variables. The approach offers a simple formula to choose the target minimum rate of the model, unlike \u03b2-VAE which struggles to target a desired rate efficiently. Optimizing models with free-bits loss was challenging and sensitive to hyperparameter values. The performance of anti-causal encoder structure is compared with non-causal structure on CIFAR-10 dataset. Results show that \u03b4-VAEs outperform \u03b2-VAEs in terms of overfitting. The anti-causal structure performs better with powerful decoders, closing the performance gap with non-causal structure. The anticausal structure outperforms the non-causal encoder for high capacity decoders and medium size models with a high rate. Experiments show that neither structure alone can mitigate posterior collapse issue in natural language tasks using the LM1B dataset with Transformer network architecture. Our model employs architecture similar to the Transformer network of BID42, using latent variables with two dimensions. The decoder utilizes causal self-attention, while the encoder employs an anti-causal structure with inverted causality masks. Despite slightly worse log-likelihood compared to autoregressive models, our \u03b4-VAEs offer a solution to posterior collapse without changing objectives or weakening decoders, achieving state-of-the-art likelihoods. The work presents two simple posterior-prior pairs and highlights challenges for latent-variable models to surpass autoregressive baselines and improve downstream applications like classification. The derivation of the KL-divergence between AR(1) and diagonal Gaussian distributions is also discussed. The text discusses removing non-negative quadratic terms involving \u00b5 i in equation 3, expanding f, and using multi-dimensional z i to calculate the committed rate as the sum of KL for each dimension. It also mentions the common choice of assuming independent components in variational families, such as using a multivariate Gaussian with a diagonal covariance. The text further explains how to guarantee a committed information rate \u03b4 by constraining the mean and variance of the variational family. The text discusses solving DISPLAYFORM8 numerically for \u00b5 q and \u03b4, parameterizing posterior parameters as DISPLAYFORM9, comparing it with temporal \u03b4-VAE, and presenting results in Table 3. Independent \u03b4-VAE and temporal \u03b4-VAE models are compared on CIFAR-10 dataset, with the temporal model showing better performance in density modeling. The architecture used in experiments involves establishing an anti-causal context for the inference network by reversing and padding the input image before feeding it to the encoder. The encoder output is then cropped and reversed to give each pixel the anti-causal context. Average pooling is applied to obtain row-wise latent variables for the decoder network. Dropout is used only in the decoder, with rectified linear units and layer activations. Hyperparameters are detailed in Table 4. The architecture involves using rectified linear units and layer normalization after multi-head attention layers. Layer normalization is crucial for stabilizing training. The models were trained with the Adam optimizer and a modified learning rate schedule. Different slowness factors were used for multi-dimensional latent variables per timestep. Hyperparameter values for experiments are detailed in Table 4. The architecture involves using rectified linear units and layer normalization after multi-head attention layers. Our code was developed using Tensorflow. Experiments on natural images were conducted on Google Cloud TPU accelerators. Different hyperparameters were used for ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. The model for text experiments is based on the Transformer network. The encoder anti-causal structure is achieved by inverting causal attention masks. Hyperparameter details are summarized in Table 5. The hyperparameter values for the LM1B experiments are summarized in Table 5, including the number of layers, hidden size, dropout probability, latent variable dimensionality, and AR(1) prior hyper-parameter range. For CIFAR-10 ablation studies, a model was trained with specific configurations listed in Table 4. Posterior distribution means were inferred for each training example, and a logistic regression classifier was trained on top of it. The linear classifier was optimized for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a starting learning rate of 0.003, decayed by a factor of 0.3 every 30 epochs. Rate-distortion curves for CIFAR-10 are also reported. In contrast to the test set, \u03b4-VAE achieves higher negative log-likelihood on the CIFAR-10 training set compared to other methods, indicating less overfitting. Evaluation of the anti-causal encoder architecture against the non-causal architecture shows benefits in different model configurations, using the temporal \u03b4-VAE approach to prevent posterior collapse. The structure is beneficial for the decoder with a large receptive field and encoding high information in latent variables. Images from the same class are expected to map to the same region in the latent space. The t-SNE plot shows classes with close semantic and visual relationships. Additional samples show random samples from different priors in CIFAR-10 models. The high-rate model has a larger value of \u03b1. In the high-rate model with a larger \u03b1 value, samples from the AR(1) prior may appear too smooth compared to natural images due to the gap between the prior and marginal posterior, which is addressed by the auxiliary prior.
