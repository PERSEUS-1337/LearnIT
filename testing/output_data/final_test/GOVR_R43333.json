    "content": "Multilateral negotiations on Iran's nuclear program began in 2003 after the IAEA reported clandestine facilities at Natanz. Iran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and signed an Additional Protocol with France, Germany, and the UK. In 2006, Tehran resumed centrifuge research. Talks with P5+1 countries followed, and the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1929 in 2010, requiring Iran's cooperation. Resolution 1929, adopted in June 2010, required Iran to cooperate with an IAEA investigation, suspend uranium enrichment, halt construction of a heavy water reactor, ratify the Additional Protocol, refrain from ballistic missile activities, and comply with IAEA safeguards. Sanctions were imposed on Iran. Diplomatic progress was made after the 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani, leading to the Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013, aimed at addressing international concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The P5+1 and Iran reached a framework of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on April 2, 2015, and the JCPOA was finalized on July 14, 2015. The IAEA certified on January 16, 2016, that Iran had completed its required JCPOA nuclear-related tasks for Implementation Day. The United States, the U.N., and the EU ceased application of most sanctions that day. Since Implementation Day, the agency has \"verified and monitored Iran's implementation of its [JCPOA] nuclear-related commitments.\" On November 11, 2013, Iran and the IAEA signed a joint statement to \"strengthen their cooperation and dialogue aimed at ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.\" The IAEA issued a \"Final Assessment on Past and Present Outstanding Issues Regarding Iran's Nuclear Programme\" on December 2, 2015, aiming to resolve outstanding questions about Tehran's nuclear program, including potential research on nuclear weapons development. Iran has nuclear programs capable of producing weapons-grade material, such as highly enriched uranium and plutonium. The U.S. and Iran signed a joint statement in 2013 to strengthen cooperation for the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons but has not mastered all necessary technologies. A 2007 assessment stated Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 but kept the option open. Iran would need about a year to produce a nuclear weapon if the decision was made. Iran's implementation of the JCPOA extended the timeline for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for a nuclear weapon from two to three months to one year, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The JCPOA has increased transparency in Iran's nuclear activities, making it easier for the international community to detect any attempts to shorten the production time of fissile material. The intelligence community assesses that Iran is more likely to use clandestine facilities to produce weapons-grade HEU. Director Clapper stated in a March 2015 interview that Iran is more likely to use clandestine facilities to produce weapons-grade HEU. U.S. officials are confident in the ability of U.S. intelligence to detect Iranian covert nuclear facilities. The IAEA's ability to inspect and monitor nuclear facilities in Iran is limited to declared facilities, but additional protocols increase the agency's authority to investigate undeclared facilities. Iran signed such a protocol in December 2003. Iran signed an Additional Protocol with the IAEA in December 2003 but stopped adhering to it in 2006. Iran's subsidiary arrangement to its IAEA safeguards agreement requires providing design information for new nuclear facilities. Iran has not built any new nuclear facilities since January 2014. The JCPOA, effective since January 2014, focuses on Iran's enrichment program and heavy water reactor for potential nuclear weapons material production. Iran operates gas centrifuge enrichment facilities at Natanz, producing low-enriched uranium for reactors and highly enriched uranium for weapons. Tehran claims uranium enrichment is for nuclear power fuel. Iran is enriching uranium at the Natanz Commercial-Scale Fuel Enrichment Plant using IR-1 centrifuges to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU) containing up to 5% uranium-235. They have installed about 15,400 centrifuges, with approximately 8,800 enriching uranium. Additionally, Iran has installed IR-2m centrifuges for greater enrichment efficiency but they are not currently enriching uranium. In the Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, Iran had been using IR-1 centrifuges to produce LEU containing approximately 20% uranium-235 until halting this work. This production has raised concerns due to the effort required being close to producing weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU). Iran is testing centrifuge models at a facility under IAEA supervision. Iran is constructing a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor at Arak, which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. Tehran claims the reactor is for medical use and to replace the Tehran Research Reactor. The Arak reactor could have produced enough plutonium for one to two nuclear weapons per year before JCPOA implementation. Iran froze most aspects of its nuclear program under the JPA to negotiate the JCPOA. Iran had enough uranium for potential nuclear weapons, but converted much material for a research reactor in Tehran. Iran froze most aspects of its nuclear program under the JPA to negotiate the JCPOA. Iran had enough uranium for potential nuclear weapons but converted much material for a research reactor in Tehran. Tehran diluted its uranium stockpile to 5% uranium-235 and agreed to refrain from further advances at its nuclear facilities under the JPA. Limits were imposed on Iran under the JPA to prevent the feeding of uranium hexafluoride into certain centrifuges, replace existing centrifuges with the same type, and only produce centrifuges for damaged ones. Iran was also restricted from installing additional centrifuges at the Natanz facility. Enrichment was limited to 5% uranium-235, with Tehran diluting half of its stockpile of uranium hexafluoride to this level and converting the rest to uranium oxide for the Tehran Research Reactor. Iran agreed to freeze its enriched uranium stocks containing up to 5% uranium-235 and refrain from reconverting uranium oxide back to uranium hexafluoride. They also committed to continue enrichment R&D practices under IAEA safeguards and prohibited the production of enriched uranium hexafluoride with more than 5% uranium-235. Additionally, the JPA allowed for increased IAEA monitoring of enrichment facilities, including daily access to video records. Iran also pledged not to commission the Arak reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the site. Iran agreed to freeze enriched uranium stocks up to 5% uranium-235 and refrain from reconverting uranium oxide. They also committed to continue enrichment R&D under IAEA safeguards and prohibited production of enriched uranium hexafluoride over 5% uranium-235. Iran pledged not to commission the Arak reactor, transfer fuel or heavy water, test or produce additional reactor fuel, or install remaining reactor components. Tehran could continue some construction at the reactor site and produce some components off-site. Iran also agreed to refrain from reprocessing spent nuclear material and building a reprocessing facility. Additional pledges included Iran's commitment to never seek or develop nuclear weapons and providing the IAEA with information on future nuclear facilities. Iran granted IAEA inspectors \"managed access\" to centrifuge assembly and rotor production workshops. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) granted IAEA inspectors \"managed access\" to Iran's nuclear facilities, including centrifuge assembly workshops and uranium mines. The JPA did not explicitly recognize Iran's right to enrich uranium, with the Obama Administration stating that the NPT does not contain this right. The agreement also provided for modest sanctions relief for Iran. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) granted IAEA inspectors access to Iran's nuclear facilities and provided modest sanctions relief for Iran, including access to hard currency, capped oil exports, and resumption of trade in selected sectors. The JPA also mentioned a potential JCPOA with practical limits on Iran's enrichment program. Iran and the P5+1 aimed to reach a comprehensive agreement on sanctions relief in exchange for restrictions on Iran's enrichment activities, facilities, and uranium stocks. Negotiations began in 2014, with a framework accord reached in April 2015 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The parties worked towards finalizing a detailed agreement by June 30, 2015, to comply with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. The Nuclear Agreement Review Act mandated a 30-day congressional review period for the JCPOA, which was not finalized until July 14, 2015. The JCPOA formally came into effect 90 days after endorsement by the U.N. Security Council, on October 18, 2015. On July 20, 2015, Resolution 2231 was adopted to set Adoption Day on October 18, 2015. The 90-day review period allowed for assessment by the U.S. Congress and other parties to the JCPOA. On Implementation Day, the IAEA verified Iran's compliance with nuclear measures, leading to the lifting of specific sanctions by the U.S., U.N., and EU. The U.N. Security Council also terminated previous resolutions on Iran. Resolution 2231 became the sole operative U.N. Security Council resolution on Iran's nuclear program, leading to Implementation Day on January 16, 2016. Transition Day, set for eight years from Adoption Day (October 18, 2023), marks Iran's emergence from U.N. Security Council scrutiny. UNSCR Termination Day is scheduled for ten years from Adoption Day (October 18, 2025), with provisions for the removal of sanctions on specified Iranian entities. On UNSCR Termination Day, ten years from Adoption Day (October 18, 2025), provisions and measures imposed by the U.N. Security Council Resolution endorsing JCPOA will end. The Security Council will no longer be involved in the Iran nuclear issue. However, the JCPOA itself and its remaining provisions will continue. Iran's nuclear program will be treated like that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT after successful implementation of the final steps. Iran's IAEA safeguards obligations and some JCPOA obligations will last indefinitely. Potential nuclear-related exports to Iran will still be subject to the Nuclear Suppliers Group's export guidelines. Resolution 2231 also ended the role of the U.N. panel of experts created by Resolution 1929. The JCPOA places constraints on Iran's nuclear programs, including enrichment and heavy water reactor activities, with monitoring provisions to detect any efforts to produce nuclear weapons. The agreement extends the time needed for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear weapon to at least one year for a duration of 10 years. Additionally, the JCPOA prohibits certain Iranian activities related to fissile material production indefinitely. The JCPOA indefinitely prohibits Iranian activities related to fissile material production, including research and diagnostic activities. An IAEA report on January 16, 2016, certified Iran's compliance with requirements for Implementation Day. The agreement limits Iran's uranium enrichment for fixed durations, with the expiration of enrichment restrictions leading to a gradual evolution of Iran's enrichment program. Iran has submitted an enrichment R&D plan to the IAEA as part of the JCPOA requirements. Iran must adhere to JCPOA requirements, including limitations on centrifuges, enrichment levels, facility usage, and stockpile size for specified durations. Iran's compliance was certified by the IAEA on Implementation Day. Iran must adhere to JCPOA requirements, including limitations on centrifuges, enrichment levels, facility usage, and stockpile size for specified durations. Iran's compliance was certified by the IAEA on Implementation Day. Iran has options to reduce its LEU stockpile, such as diluting the material, selling it to another country, or to an IAEA-established international LEU bank. Iran exported LEU to Russia to meet required levels and all fuel plates for the Tehran Research Reactor were irradiated. Some enriched uranium in Iran is deemed \"unrecoverable\" by the JCPOA-established Joint Commission. The JCPOA-established Joint Commission has deemed certain uranium in Iran as \"unrecoverable\" and not counted against stockpile limits. This includes low-level solid and liquid waste containing up to 3.67% uranium-235, as well as enriched uranium with 20% uranium-235 labeled as \"laboratory contamination.\" Iran was approved to flush enriched uranium from a facility, reducing its stockpile. Iran agreed to the JCPOA and will convert Fordow into a nuclear, physics, and technology center. They will maintain a limited number of centrifuges for stable isotope production and use excess centrifuges for replacement purposes for 10 years. Iran may resume producing IR-1 centrifuges if its stock falls below 500. After 8 years, Iran can manufacture 2 types of advanced centrifuges, and after 10 years, they can produce complete versions and store them under IAEA monitoring. Iran must refrain from R&D on technologies other than gas centrifuge enrichment for 10 years. The JCPOA requires Iran to redesign the Arak reactor to prevent weapons-grade plutonium production and export spent fuel from all nuclear reactors. Iran is managing a project to redesign the Arak reactor's core. Iran is managing an international project to redesign and construct a replacement reactor, with the P5+1 participants establishing a working group to support the effort. China and the U.S. affirmed their readiness to co-chair the group, with the document defining responsibilities issued on November 22, 2015. The U.S. is no longer involved, with the U.K. taking over. Chinese and Iranian companies signed the first consultancy services contract for the project. Chinese and Iranian companies signed the first consultancy services contract for the project on April 23, 2017, and completed the conceptual redesigning of the reactor. The JCPOA prohibits Iran from reprocessing spent reactor fuel, with commitments to sell excess heavy water and refrain from building heavy water-moderated reactors for 15 years. Iran's stock of heavy water has exceeded 130 metric tons on 2 occasions since the JCPOA began implementation. Iran's heavy water stock exceeded 130 metric tons twice since the JCPOA began. Iran resolved the issue by exporting the excess heavy water to Russia, the United States, and Oman. Most of the excess heavy water has been sold to international buyers, with the remainder stored outside Iran under IAEA seal. As of May 6, 2018, Iran had 120.3 metric tons of heavy water, monitored by the IAEA for compliance. The IAEA monitors Iran's compliance with the JCPOA provisions on its enrichment program, Arak program, and nuclear weapon-related activities. Iran has increased inspectors and uses advanced verification technologies. Iran has pledged a long-term IAEA presence, implemented the Additional Protocol, and modified code 3.1 of its safeguards agreement. These steps have been taken since January 2016 when Iran began implementing the JCPOA. Iran's IAEA safeguards obligations are indefinite. The JCPOA ensures Iran's compliance with nuclear-related exports through the NSG guidelines. The agreement includes monitoring and inspections by the IAEA for 15-25 years, ensuring Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful. Iran has agreed to allow the IAEA to monitor its uranium mills and heavy water plant for 25 years under the JCPOA. The IAEA has verified Iran's compliance with nuclear commitments since Implementation Day. The agency's workload will increase, and costs have been integrated into its budget. The Obama Administration believes these measures will prevent Iran from covertly developing a nuclear weapon. The JCPOA and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 include reporting provisions for the IAEA, requiring regular updates on Iran's compliance. The IAEA Director General must report any concerns affecting JCPOA commitments. The intelligence community believes Iran could not maintain a secret nuclear supply chain. The IAEA reports findings of its inspection and monitoring activities, while the JCPOA-established Joint Commission monitors the parties' compliance with the agreement. Access to Undeclared Sites is allowed under the JCPOA if the IAEA has concerns about undeclared nuclear materials or activities. Iran must provide clarification, and if concerns persist, the IAEA may request access to the site. If no resolution is reached within 14 days, further actions may be taken. Iran has 24 days to resolve IAEA's concerns through agreed means, with the Joint Commission advising if necessary. The JCPOA limits IAEA access to specific facilities for nuclear-related reasons only. The IAEA can request access to specific facilities to verify absence of undeclared nuclear materials or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA. A \"procurement channel\" was established for Iran's nuclear program, monitored by the Joint Commission for 10 years. Iran must provide access to intended use locations of listed items and allow exporting governments to verify end-use. IAEA officials have access to information and can participate in meetings regarding transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials, software, and technology. The Security Council received 37 nuclear-related export proposals, approving 24, disapproving three, with five withdrawn and three under review. The JCPOA states that the IAEA will ensure all nuclear material in Iran remains peaceful. The IAEA will pursue drawing a \"Broader Conclusion\" on Iran's nuclear activities, which requires completion of activities under an additional protocol, addressing questions and inconsistencies, and finding no indications of safeguards concerns. The process typically takes five to seven years for states with complex nuclear programs. Former IAEA Deputy Director General Heinonen noted similar timelines for other countries with large nuclear programs. The IAEA is working towards drawing a \"Broader Conclusion\" on Iran's nuclear activities, which may take many years depending on Iran's cooperation. The JCPOA includes various nuclear projects in Iran involving other countries, aimed at ensuring nuclear safety and the supply of nuclear fuel. Some P5+1 countries will participate in these projects. The JCPOA includes nuclear projects in Iran with participation from P5+1 countries. The Obama Administration believed international nuclear cooperation would increase transparency in Iran's nuclear program. US sanctions laws restrict nuclear cooperation with Iran, but waivers can be granted under certain provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. The JCPOA includes provisions to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, such as prohibiting specific activities related to nuclear explosive devices. The U.S. government assesses that Iran has not mastered all necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon. Additionally, Iran is required to refrain from producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals for 15 years. The IAEA has evidence that Iran may have conducted work relevant to nuclear weapons, such as research about a nuclear payload for missiles. Iran was required to resolve these questions by providing full information to the IAEA, but past reports indicated uncertainty about nuclear weapons-related activities in the country. The IAEA had evidence of possible nuclear weapons-related activities in Iran, leading to the implementation of a roadmap for clarification. A final assessment in December 2015 indicated that Iran's information did not fully resolve outstanding issues. The IAEA's report on Iran's nuclear activities indicated that while an organizational structure for nuclear development was in place before 2003, some activities continued after that year. However, these activities did not progress beyond feasibility studies and acquiring technical capabilities. The IAEA found no credible evidence of ongoing nuclear weapon development in Iran. The IAEA found no credible evidence of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009, despite some ongoing activities before 2003. The agency clarified enough elements to provide an assessment of the whole picture, reaffirming their conclusion in December 2015. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's disclosure of documents concerning Iran's past nuclear weapons program further supported this assessment. In January 2016, Iran presented its assessment to the IAEA regarding past research on dual-use technologies. The document acknowledged scientific studies for peaceful purposes but denied work on nuclear weapons. The JCPOA led to the closure of the issue by the IAEA Board of Governors in December 2015. The IAEA Board is now focused on JCPOA implementation and monitoring in Iran under Security Council Resolution 2231. The Director General will issue quarterly reports on Iran's commitments and can report any concerns to the Board and Security Council. Without addressing these issues, the IAEA cannot confirm all nuclear material in Iran is for peaceful purposes. The IAEA Board is focused on JCPOA implementation in Iran under Resolution 2231. The State Department report notes that Iran's past military-related nuclear activities do not preclude further investigation. Resolving these issues is crucial for ensuring Iran's current nuclear program is peaceful. Former Obama Administration official Jofi Joseph and former State Department official Robert Einhorn discussed the challenges of identifying future covert Iranian nuclear weapons efforts and the effectiveness of full Iranian disclosure in designing a monitoring system for the JCPOA. Einhorn argued that intrusive provisions may be necessary for monitoring small-scale weaponization activities. Robert Einhorn explained that reaching agreement on intrusive monitoring arrangements for the JCPOA would have been difficult due to the need for close tracking of scientists and equipment, regardless of past Iranian activities. The United States already has significant knowledge of Iran's past nuclear weapons work, and would assume Iran has made progress in weaponization in planning to thwart a breakout. Iranian disclosures about past weaponization efforts would not significantly impact U.S. planning. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 requires the President to certify Iranian compliance with the JCPOA, including transparency and no material breaches. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson certified Iran's compliance in 2017. Reports from the UN, EU, IAEA, and P5+1 confirm Iran's adherence to the agreement. The IAEA continues to verify and monitor restrictions under the JCPOA, with no evidence of Iranian noncompliance according to Secretary of State Pompeo and EU's Mogherini confirming Iran's full compliance. The agreement allows access to Iranian sites for inspectors and provides alternative means to address concerns. The IAEA continues to monitor Iranian compliance with the JCPOA through various methods, including inspections, open source analysis, and intelligence briefings. The agency has full authority to pursue any new information related to safeguards and JCPOA commitments in Iran. Amano confirmed that the IAEA has been able to access all necessary sites in Iran for inspections. Under the JCPOA, sanctions relief for Iran mainly occurred at Implementation Day. The U.S. sanctions laws waived and executive orders revoked are detailed in CRS Report RS20871, Iran Sanctions by Kenneth Katzman. Iran is still obligated to the JCPOA and Resolution 2231. A \"snap back\" mechanism allows for reinstating sanctions if Iran fails to address noncompliance concerns. The U.S. or any veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council can block the lifting of U.N. sanctions. The U.S. or any veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council can block a resolution to continue lifting U.N. sanctions on Iran despite noncompliance. Resolution 2231 allows for reimposing some sanctions within 65 days of a complaint. The U.S. participation in invoking this mechanism is unclear. The United States is no longer participating in the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Legislation for congressional review was enacted as the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. The review period lasted 60 days, with no statutory sanctions waived during this time. Joint resolutions of disapproval were introduced in Congress, but ultimately the deal was not approved. The House passed H.Res. 411 and H.R. 3460, but the Senate did not take up the bills. The Iranian Majles approved the JCPOA with some reservations. On October 21, 2015, Supreme Leader Khamene'i formally accepted the Majles and Council of Guardians decisions regarding the agreement, expressing reservations and distrust of the U.S. intent. INARA requires the Administration to report to Congress on potential Iranian breaches of the JCPOA within specific timeframes. Compliance Certification under INARA mandates the Administration to certify Iran's compliance within a set period. Under INARA, the Administration must certify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA every 90 days. If certification is not made or a breach is reported, Congress can consider reimposing sanctions. The certification requirement is no longer applicable due to the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. Additionally, INARA mandates a semi-annual report on Iran's nuclear program and compliance with the agreement. The report is required to cover Iranian banks' involvement in terrorism financing, Iran's ballistic missile advances, and support for terrorism. The Obama Administration and the IAEA enforced the JCPOA terms, appointing Ambassador Stephen Mull as Lead Coordinator for Iran Nuclear Implementation. Mull's position was later under review and no longer exists, with its functions now handled by the State Department's Bureau. The position overseeing Iran Nuclear Implementation no longer exists, with its functions now handled by the State Department's Bureau. Donald Trump criticized the JCPOA during his campaign, expressing intentions to renegotiate, enforce strictly, or end the agreement. The President could choose to stop implementing U.S. commitments, allowing the agreement to continue with other parties. The Trump Administration initially supported the JCPOA, as indicated by reassurances to the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy. The Trump Administration initially supported the JCPOA but later expressed increasing hostility towards it, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stating that the agreement fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran. Trump officials argued that Iran may pursue nuclear weapons in the future. The Trump Administration expressed increasing hostility towards the JCPOA, citing inadequately enforced restrictions and Iran's long-range ballistic missile capabilities. President Trump announced the completion of the Iran policy review, stating that the Administration would not certify compliance with the deal and would work with Congress and allies to address its flaws. Secretary Tillerson announced plans to work with Congress and allies to address flaws in the Iran nuclear deal, expressing concerns about the Iranian regime's potential threat with nuclear weapons. President Trump later stated that the United States would not waive sanctions without European allies' agreement to fix the deal's flaws. President Trump demanded new congressional legislation concerning the Iran nuclear deal, including provisions for timely inspections, preventing Iran from producing nuclear weapons quickly, allowing the US to reimpose sanctions if Iran does not comply, and linking Iran's missile programs to severe sanctions. Congress has not taken action on this legislation. On January 12, a senior Administration official announced plans to work with European partners on a follow-on agreement to address Iran's ballistic missile program, JCPOA restrictions, and improved inspections. Despite meetings with France, Germany, and the UK, no agreement was reached to satisfy President Trump's demands. On May 8, Trump announced the US would no longer participate in the JCPOA and would reimpose sanctions. Secretary of State Pompeo was tasked with ceasing US participation in the JCPOA. The United States has decided to cease its participation in the JCPOA and reimpose all sanctions lifted in connection with the agreement. Secretary Pompeo outlined a new approach towards Iran, focusing on financial pressure, deterring aggression, and advocating for the Iranian people in exchange for changes in Iran's behavior. Pompeo outlined key elements for a new agreement with Iran, including declaring past military nuclear activities, stopping enrichment, providing access to all sites, ending missile proliferation, releasing detained citizens, and ceasing aggressive behavior. Iran must end support for terrorist groups in the Middle East, respect Iraqi sovereignty, disarm Shia militias, stop supporting the Houthi militia in Yemen, withdraw forces from Syria, cease support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and halt threatening behavior towards neighbors and allies, including Israel. The United States, along with its allies, is exerting severe economic pressure on Iran to change its destabilizing policies. This includes threats to destroy Israel, firing missiles into Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and cyberattacks. The plan is to create a new security architecture with the help of allies, and joint teams of senior officials have been deployed worldwide to address the issue. The focus is on changing Iran's behavior rather than regime change. The U.S. and its allies are pressuring Iran to change its behavior, not its regime. Secretary Pompeo warned of consequences if Iran ramps up its nuclear program. The U.S. exit from the JCPOA drew criticism from other parties, who argue it violates the agreement. The U.N. sanctions require participants to make good-faith efforts to resolve disputes in the JCPOA. The P5+1 and Iran are committed to implementing the agreement in good faith. There is debate over whether this violates UNSCR 2231. Other P5+1 countries reaffirmed their support for the JCPOA and intend to fulfill their commitments despite U.S. sanctions. The European countries France, Germany, and the United Kingdom reaffirmed their commitment to the JCPOA and vowed to protect their companies from U.S. sanctions. Iran stated its willingness to uphold its JCPOA commitments as long as the U.S. does, rejecting renegotiation of the agreement. Foreign Minister Zarif mentioned Iran's readiness to return to pre-JCPOA conditions if necessary. Iranian officials are prepared to respond to a U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions by resuming uranium enrichment, decreasing cooperation with the IAEA, and potentially withdrawing from the NPT. They assert that Iran can quickly reconstitute its fissile material production capability but have stated that developing nuclear weapons is not part of their plans. Iranian officials are prepared to respond to a U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions by resuming uranium enrichment, decreasing cooperation with the IAEA, and potentially withdrawing from the NPT. They assert that Iran can quickly reconstitute its fissile material production capability but have stated that developing nuclear weapons is not part of their plans. Foreign Minister Zarif emphasized the importance of Iran receiving benefits from the JCPOA and stated that Iran would not do a one-sided implementation of the agreement. Iranian officials rejected negotiating any new agreements following Trump's announcement, and Zarif called for Iran to be compensated unconditionally to ensure the survival of the JCPOA. Iran has decided to resort to the JCPOA mechanism to address the United States' non-performance and withdrawal. Iran demands concrete guarantees from Europe to maintain its oil revenue and asserts its right to resume nuclear activities. Iran has begun preparations to expand its uranium enrichment program within the parameters of the JCPOA. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran will increase capacity to produce uranium hexafluoride and resume operations at its uranium conversion facility. Iran will also start manufacturing centrifuge rotors and building a centrifuge rotor plant. Iran is expanding its uranium enrichment program within JCPOA limits, including using an advanced centrifuge assembly center in Natanz. Iran will abide by JCPOA commitments but may produce centrifuges beyond limits if the agreement collapses. Iran faces potential reimposition of sanctions if it violates JCPOA obligations. Negotiations are ongoing to maintain Iran's economic benefits from the JCPOA, with the EU announcing practical measures to support the agreement on May 16, 2018. The EU is working on maintaining economic relations with Iran, including the sale of oil and gas products, banking transactions, transportation relations, export credit, investments, and legal protection for European businesses. Despite multilateral meetings, Iran has not firmly committed to the JCPOA. President Rouhani expressed disappointment with the EU's lack of concrete solutions to counter the impact of companies leaving the Iran market due to the threat of reimposed U.S. sanctions. The U.S. plans to fully enforce reimposed sanctions on Iran and is unlikely to grant waivers or exemptions. Efforts by the EU and other countries to preserve economic benefits of the JCPOA are analyzed in CRS reports. Iran has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but has not yet decided to do so. Iran has the capability to produce nuclear weapons but has not yet decided to do so. Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and would need about one year to produce a nuclear weapon if the decision is made. The most challenging task would be producing weapons-grade highly enriched uranium. Iran has the capability to produce nuclear weapons, with estimates ranging from one to two years to make a deliverable nuclear weapon. The acquisition of fissile material is a key factor in determining Iran's timeline for producing a nuclear device. It is assumed that Iran would need two to three months to produce enough weapons-grade highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon, possibly using covert enrichment facilities. Iran has the capability to produce nuclear weapons, with estimates ranging from one to two years. Covert enrichment facilities could be used to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, requiring a longer period of time. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated that Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities is driven by its strategic goals of enhancing security and regional influence. It is uncertain if Iran will ultimately decide to build nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency is confident in detecting any Iranian attempt to produce weapons-grade HEU at safeguarded facilities. They also trust the United States' ability to uncover covert Iranian enrichment plants."
