    "content": "Four species of nonindigenous Asian carp are expanding in U.S. waterways, with bighead, silver, and black carp causing environmental concerns. Controversy surrounds preventing Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes through the Chicago Area Waterway System. Congressional focus is on a feasibility study to prevent carp establishment in the Great Lakes and stop their spread in the Mississippi River. The grass carp, also known as white amur, was introduced to the U.S. in 1963 for vegetation control in aquatic environments. They are stocked to manage invasive aquatic plants and have spread widely across the country, including the Great Lakes. Most grass carp are now stocked as sterile triploids. The black carp, Mylopharyngodon piceus, arrived in the U.S. in 1973 with silver and bighead carp. It is primarily found in deep waters of large rivers, feeding on mussels and snails. Black carp has a limited distribution compared to other carp species in U.S. waterways. Black carp primarily feed on mussels and snails, posing a threat to native mollusks. Silver carp, introduced in 1973, were used to control algae in water bodies but proved unsuitable for aquaculture. Their distribution is mainly in the Mississippi River drainage, with no presence in the Great Lakes. The silver carp, primarily found in the Mississippi River drainage, is a filter-feeder that consumes phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus. They are easily startled by outboard motors, causing them to jump out of the water. Population estimates are lacking, but in the La Grange Reach of the Illinois River, there were about 4,000 fish per river mile in 2007-2008. Bighead carp, introduced in 1973, are economically important in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama for aquaculture. Bighead carp, discovered in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the 1980s, are primarily found in the Mississippi River drainage. They were captured in Lake Erie between 1995 and 2003. Like silver carp, bighead carp require large rivers for spawning but inhabit various water bodies during their life cycle. They are filter-feeders, consuming phytoplankton and zooplankton. Non-native species that become established may experience rapid population growth and range expansion. Silver carp population in the U.S. began to grow rapidly in 1999 after floods in the early 1990s provided ideal spawning conditions. They follow bighead carp in colonizing new habitats. Dumping of unused bait by sport fishermen may contribute to their spread. Carp and other non-native fish species have been traded for human consumption in metropolitan areas with limited regulation. Eradication of non-native species in aquatic environments is challenging and costly, so management efforts focus on preventing their entry into new habitats. Asian carp pose a significant threat to the Great Lakes fisheries due to their potential to rapidly expand and alter the ecosystem by consuming various food sources. This could harm resident fish species in the Great Lakes. Asian carp pose a substantial environmental risk to the Great Lakes fisheries by competing for food and modifying habitat, potentially harming native species like mussels, aquatic invertebrates, and fish. Bighead and silver carp have out-competed native fish in certain areas and are likely to spread in the Great Lakes, especially in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. The Maumee, Sandusky, and Grand Rivers in the Lake Erie basin are identified as potential spawning grounds for Asian carp. Asian carp, including bighead and silver carp, pose a significant threat to the Great Lakes fisheries by competing for food and altering habitat. There are concerns about their potential impact on native species like mussels, aquatic invertebrates, and fish. A Risk Assessment for Grass carp in 2016 indicated that their invasion process in Lakes Michigan and Erie had begun, with predictions of establishment within 10 years. While black carp are not expected to establish in the Great Lakes, silver carp are not likely to spread rapidly or be considered a nuisance. A 2015 study suggested that Asian carp could eventually make up a third of the fish weight in Lake Erie, potentially leading to a collapse of the fishery. The intentional introduction of non-native species has significantly altered the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, leading to the depletion of native species like lake trout and whitefish. The arrival of non-native species through various means has had substantial ecological impacts on the region's fisheries, which depend on the Great Lakes for both recreational and commercial purposes. The economic impacts of Asian carp on the Great Lakes fisheries could be negative, affecting recreational and commercial fishing industries. However, there is a possibility of new fisheries development. The Great Lakes fisheries generate approximately $7 billion annually, but caution is advised in using this figure for policy decisions. Asian carp introduction may harm Great Lakes fisheries and ecosystems, impacting anglers and economic activity. Valuation studies are needed to estimate changes in social welfare. Economic input-output studies cannot fully assess the potential effects of Asian carp. The potential harm of Asian carp introduction to Great Lakes fisheries and ecosystems is not well understood. Accurate predictions of changes are questionable due to the complexity of ecological and economic systems. Data and models needed for assessments are lacking, making complete assessments costly and time-consuming. Despite the lack of definitive predictions, the threat of Asian carp to the Great Lakes is significant, and action should not be delayed. The economic impact of recreational activities in the Great Lakes region is significant, with expenditures on fishing trips contributing to local and state economies. The focus is on various fish species targeted by recreational fisheries. The potential threat of Asian carp introduction is not considered in the economic assessments. Great Lakes fisheries support a variety of fish species targeted by recreational anglers, including perch, black bass, walleye, lake trout, salmon, pike, and steelhead. In 2011, 1.7 million anglers fished 19.7 million days, generating economic impacts of 50,000 jobs, $2.2 billion in salaries, and over $7 billion in total impacts on the U.S. economy. Charter boat fishing businesses also benefit from Great Lakes fisheries, with 1,746 firms making over 93,000 charter trips in 2002. Commercial fishing in the Great Lakes produced 14.9 million pounds of fish valued at $22 million in 2015. Great Lakes commercial fisheries have seen a decline in landings and value due to various factors like invasive species, pollution, overfishing, and regulatory changes. Specific lakes contribute significantly to commercial landings of species like whitefish, yellow perch, chubs, and smelt. Record harvests were seen in 1899, dominated by lake herring, chubs, lake trout, and yellow perch. The Great Lakes have nearly 4.3 million registered boats, with an estimated 911,000 operating on the lakes. The introduction of Asian carp to the Great Lakes could potentially have negative effects on boating, as silver carp have caused injuries and damage to equipment when disturbed by boat motors. A study on recreational boating in the Great Lakes states showed that boaters spent billions of dollars, supporting thousands of jobs and generating billions in salaries. Economic predictions on the impact of Asian carp on Great Lakes boating are not available. The introduction of Asian carp to the Great Lakes could potentially damage the public image of the lakes and lower the feeling of well-being and pride of area residents. The popularity of live Asian carp in some ethnic markets continues to stimulate illegal transport of these fish across state and international borders, with intercepted shipments bound for Toronto. The Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) is a segment of the Illinois Waterway in northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana. The Illinois Waterway, maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, connects the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. The Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) includes modified rivers, locks, and canals in the Chicago metropolitan area. There are concerns about Asian carp potentially migrating from the Mississippi River into the Great Lakes through this system. The historic Chicago Portage separated the drainage basins of the two bodies of water. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, connecting the Chicago River to the Illinois River, was the first artificial connection between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. It was replaced by the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) which includes the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, North Shore Channel, and Cal-Sag Channel. The flow of the Chicago River and Calumet River was reversed to prevent sewage discharge into the canals. The Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) includes locks operated by the Corps to prevent invasive species like Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago operates sluice gates for flood control at the O'Brien Lock and Dam and Chicago Lock. The Wilmette pumping station on the North Shore Channel also connects the CAWS to the Great Lakes. The Corps manages the Lockport Powerhouse and Lock. The Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) includes locks operated by the Corps to prevent invasive species like Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. The Chicago Lock is one of the country's busiest locks, handling recreational traffic, while the O'Brien Lock sees more commodity-laden commercial barges offloading onto deepwater vessels. The O'Brien Lock at the Chicago Area Waterway System sees approximately 4 million tons of commodities, including sand, gravel, coal, and steel, passing through annually. A study commissioned by Michigan concluded that the locks have less value than estimated by the Corps, with a potential shift from barge to overland shipping resulting in additional costs of $64-69 million annually. The costs of lock closure in the Chicago Area Waterway System are estimated to be approximately $64-69 million annually, with a separate study from Illinois projecting much higher costs of $530-580 million annually over the next eight years. These differing estimates are due to various assumptions, including indirect costs for transitioning to overland shipping. Both studies have implications for proposals to prevent the spread of Asian carp, with Congress directing specific actions to block their upstream passage. The Corps has been primarily responsible for this work. Efforts to impede the spread of Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System have intensified over time, with the federal government and various agencies coordinating planning and funding. The White House has prioritized the issue due to the increasing profile of Asian carp and its potential establishment in the Great Lakes. The White House prioritized the issue of Asian carp in early 2010 with the announcement of a forum of Great Lakes governors and new actions to control the spread. Federal funding for Asian carp activities has totaled approximately $463 million since the announcement, with a significant portion coming from the EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Congress directed the Corps and the ANS Task Force to investigate methods to prevent the dispersal of aquatic nuisance species from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi River drainage. An advisory panel recommended an electronic dispersal barrier demonstration project at the southwestern end of the CSSC. An electronic dispersal barrier demonstration project was implemented at the southwestern end of the CSSC to stop the movement of invasive species through the CAWS. The barrier uses steel cables to create a pulsating field of electricity to deter fish from passing. It was completed in 2001 and became operational in 2002. Concerns about power outages leading to Asian carp migration prompted the upgrade to a stronger, more permanent barrier (Barrier I). Construction of Barrier II, located 800 feet downstream from Barrier I, with two sets of electrical arrays (Barriers IIA and IIB), began in 2004 and was completed in 2010 at a total cost of approximately $23 million. The operational costs of these barriers are estimated at $16.7 million per year. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee (ACRCC) was formed in 2009 to supplement the barrier protection system. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee (ACRCC) was formed in 2009 by the Council on Environmental Quality to address the presence of aquatic species, including Asian carp, in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). Congress directed the Corps to study various technologies to prevent the spread of Asian carp, including the construction of concrete and chain link barricades. The report recommended a network of concrete and chain link barricades to deter fish passage over the Des Plaines River during flooding or through culverts connecting the CSSC to the I&M canal. The project was completed in 2010 with $13 million in funding. Interim Report II includes two phases: Report IIA studied optimal operating parameters for electrical barriers and was finished in 2011, while Report IIB is ongoing to improve barrier operations. Interim Report III examined how locks and structures could minimize Asian carp infestation, concluding that partial changes in operating parameters would not be effective. The Corps installed fish screens on sluice gates and modified operations to prevent Asian carp migration. The Corps completed a study in July 2010 on deterrent measures to prevent Asian carp migration into the Great Lakes. Interim Report IV, currently in progress, will document ongoing testing and analysis, including a risk assessment of barrier failure modes and an environmental assessment. The release date for the study was extended due to recent research efforts on barrier efficacy. Various agencies, including the FWS, EPA, and USGS, have contributed resources to monitor Asian carp presence and movements in the CAWS using methods like electrofishing and netting. The Corps collaborated with the University of Notre Dame to use eDNA testing to search for Asian carp in the CAWS. Positive eDNA results for silver carp suggest their presence on the lake side of barriers. Studies analyzed alternative sources for positive eDNA samples and worked to clarify eDNA interpretation. The ANS task force initiated nationwide management actions through its Asian Carp Working Group in response to USGS risk assessments of Asian carp species. FWS listed black, silver, and bighead carp as injurious under the Lacey Act, and a Management and Control Plan was developed in collaboration with stakeholders. The final plan outlines seven broad goals with 133 short- and long-term recommendations to exterminate wild Asian carp. Recommendations include using electric barriers, bubble curtains, and sonic barriers to stop Asian carp encroachment. eDNA testing in 2009 and 2010 showed Asian carp presence upstream of electric barriers. In June 2010, a live bighead carp was captured at Lake Calumet, leading to White House involvement in control efforts. In 2017, a live silver carp was found in the Little Calumet River, marking the first live Asian carp discovered upstream of barriers. The White House held a summit in 2010 with Great Lakes governors to address the threat of Asian carp, unveiling the Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework to combat their spread. This framework is updated annually to report on new actions and funding for Asian carp control. The FY2010 framework outlined actions and funding to eliminate the threat of Asian carp in the Great Lakes, with funding from the Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Subsequent frameworks included less GLRI funding and more agency base budgets for actions like monitoring, commercial harvesting, waterway separation, research, and technology development. The Asian Carp Action Plan, formerly known as the FY2010 framework, focuses on waterway separation, research, eDNA analysis, enforcement, outreach, and closure of pathways to prevent the spread of Asian carp in the Great Lakes. The long-term prevention option includes potentially separating the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins to stop interbasin movement of aquatic nuisance species. Reported funding levels are detailed in the plan. Efforts to prevent interbasin movement of aquatic nuisance species, such as Asian carp, involve significant changes to existing navigation and water control structures. The Great Lakes and Mississippi River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) evaluates options to reduce the spread of invasive species between the two basins, including the possibility of hydrologic separation. This study was authorized by Congress in WRDA 2007. The GLMRIS study, authorized by Congress in WRDA 2007, considered hydrologic separation as an option to prevent the spread of invasive species. The study, released on January 6, 2013, differed from traditional Corps feasibility studies by analyzing various alternatives without recommending a specific plan. Concerns have been raised in Congress about the lack of actionable recommendations in the report. The GLMRIS study, authorized by Congress in WRDA 2007, considered hydrologic separation as an option to prevent the spread of invasive species. The Corps explained that the study included eight alternatives, including a \"no action\" option, focusing on preventing interbasin transfer of aquatic nuisance species in the CAWS. The study was expedited due to MAP-21 requirements, making a full study process impossible within the timeframe. The GLMRIS study analyzed eight alternatives to prevent the spread of invasive species, ranging from nonstructural methods to major structural changes. Costs for the options range from no cost to over $18 billion for complete hydrologic separation. The report includes a new structure called a \"GLMRIS lock\" to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species. The Brandon Road Lock and Dam is identified as a promising location to control the movement of carp upstream into the Great Lakes basin. The Brandon Road dam controls carp movement into the Great Lakes basin, with the only aquatic connection through the adjacent lock. Public opinion on control technologies was split, with 40% favoring physical separation and 35% preferring navigation within the CAWS. The Corps planned a formal evaluation of options near the BRLD based on this feedback. The Brandon Road dam controls carp movement into the Great Lakes basin through the adjacent lock. A formal evaluation of options and technologies near the BRLD was directed by Congress to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. The Trump Administration released a draft plan for the BRLD in August 2017 after pressure from Congress. Bills were introduced for further planning and coordination until a new Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works was appointed. The Draft Brandon Road Study, a follow-up to the broader GLMRIS, evaluated six alternatives to prevent the encroachment of Asian carp and other invasive species into the Great Lakes. The study selected a technology alternative involving complex noise and an electric barrier based on various criteria such as safety risk and construction costs. The Corps expects a final feasibility study to take roughly two years to complete after public comment closes in October 2017. The study selected a technology alternative involving complex noise and an electric barrier to prevent Asian carp from traveling further upstream. This plan includes nonstructural control measures and could cost over $275 million, with completion possible by 2025. While the lock closure alternative was deemed most effective, it would cost the shipping industry over $300 million annually. Concerns have been raised about the plan's impact on commercial navigation, despite the success of current control strategies in keeping Asian carp out of Lake Michigan. Section 5016 of WRDA 2007 and Section 1039 of WRRDA 2014 authorized projects to prevent the spread of Asian carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Basins. Federal agencies spent $2.3 million in FY2015 on these activities. Federal agencies spent $2.3 million on activities in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Basins to prevent the migration of Asian carp into the Great Lakes via the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. Michigan and other Great Lakes states sought legal options to restrict the entry of Asian carp into Lake Michigan, including petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to amend a 1967 decree regarding water diversion. Michigan sought legal action to prevent the spread of Asian carp into Lake Michigan by requesting the closure of shipping locks, but the Court denied their requests. Despite new evidence of Asian carp presence in the lake, the Court again denied Michigan's motion. Subsequently, multiple states sued federal agencies over the spread of Asian carp beyond the electric barrier in 2010. The states sued the Corps of Engineers and MWRD in federal court to address the Asian carp migration into the Great Lakes. The court rejected proposed remedial measures due to lack of consensus on the threat extent and solution efficacy. It emphasized the potential harm in a worst-case scenario. The court emphasized the potential harm in a worst-case scenario but concluded that the level of certainty of harm is low based on the evidence. A federal appeals court denied the states' motion in July 2014. The US and Canada have a cooperative program to deal with the non-native sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. Canada has assessed the risks of Asian carp introduction, concluding that the risk would be high in some parts of Canada. Canada is addressing concerns about the invasion of Asian carp in the Great Lakes through participation in the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and the ACRCC. The 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement aims to prevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species. The 2017 State of the Great Lakes report indicates a poor status of invasive species with a deteriorating trend. While the number of new invasive species in the Great Lakes has slowed, 30% of aquatic invasive species still have a significant environmental impact. Congress has held hearings on Asian carp, with a focus on preventing their introduction into the Great Lakes. The Senate and House committee reports for the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill for FY2018 address concerns regarding Asian carp prevention in the Great Lakes. They recommend quarterly updates on federal efforts, funding for electric barriers, and the release of the Brandon Road Study. Congress is debating whether to authorize the study's findings. The question for Congress is whether to authorize the Brandon Road Study's findings, which could face procedural hurdles as long as the study remains in draft form. Bills introduced in the 115th Congress aimed to release the draft study, while previous authorities have been enacted to address Asian carp prevention in the Great Lakes. In the 113th Congress, emergency measures were authorized to exclude Asian carp from the Great Lakes, with a focus on preventing their passage beyond the Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Congress directed the Corps to expedite completion of the Brandon Road Study."
