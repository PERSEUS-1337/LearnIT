    "content": "Following the 2003 electric grid blackout, Congress took action to promote investment in the nation's electrical grid to increase capacity and efficiency. The blackout was caused by inadequacies in the transmission system, leading to a widespread outage. A task force report made 46 recommendations to address system deficiencies, including clarifying that investments for bulk system reliability would be recoverable through transmission rates. Upgrading grid reliability and modernization became a clear priority, leading to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 prioritized grid modernization and reliability. FERC was directed to establish incentive rates for transmission infrastructure construction to benefit consumers. FERC Order No. 679 promoted transmission investment through pricing reform. FERC opened an investigation into the scope and implementation of transmission incentives regulations. 75 applications for incentive rate treatment of transmission projects were received by FERC, totaling over $50 billion in proposed investments. The report focuses on concerns about transmission incentives impacting consumer rates, despite FERC's obligation to provide incentives. With issues such as federal policies, regulatory policies, and aging infrastructure, Congress may need to consider the need for continuing transmission incentives. In August 2003, a major electrical blackout hit the United States and Canada due to a cascading failure in the power grid. The Northeast US faced transmission capacity issues and bottlenecks, leading to power plants shutting down to avoid overloading. Modernized transmission capacity could have prevented the failure. Obtaining financing for improvements may be necessary. In response to the 2003 electricity blackout, Congress acted to promote investment in the nation's electrical grid to increase capacity and efficiency. Data from the Edison Electric Institute shows a decline in transmission investment from 1975 to 1998, despite a doubling of electric load. This led to difficulties in obtaining financing for major transmission line projects. Before the 2003 blackout, there was an increase in transmission investment. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission established incentive-based rates for electric power transmission investment through EPACT Section 219. FERC's Final Rule, Order No. 679, issued in 2006, allows applicants to tailor proposed incentives for transmission investments. FERC's Final Rule under EPACT Section 219 allows for incentive-based rates for transmission investments to ensure just and reasonable rates. The incentives aim to benefit consumers by improving reliability and reducing costs through new infrastructure construction. The balance between investor compensation and consumer protection is emphasized in determining incentive levels. The Commission authorizes incentive-based rate treatments for transmission infrastructure investment, ensuring they are just, reasonable, and not discriminatory. Utilities must explain how the proposed rate treatment complies with the Federal Power Act and demonstrate its benefits for reliability or cost reduction. The Commission authorizes incentive-based rate treatments for transmission infrastructure investment to ensure reliability and reduce costs. The incentives must be tailored to address specific risks or challenges faced by the applicant, resulting in just and reasonable rates. Incentive-based rate treatment includes a rate of return on equity, recovery of construction costs, pre-commercial operations costs, hypothetical capital structure, accelerated depreciation, and recovery of transmission facility costs. Incentive-based rate treatments for transmission infrastructure investment include recovery of costs, deferred cost recovery, and other approved incentives by the Commission. These incentives can be tailored to address specific risks and challenges, with FERC deciding on a case-by-case basis. Stand-alone transmission companies and public utilities joining a transmission organization may be eligible for additional incentives. FERC's Order No. 679 establishes criteria for incentive rates for transmission projects, requiring them to ensure reliability or reduce power costs. Applicants must demonstrate a \"nexus\" between requested incentives and investments. FERC uses \"rebuttable presumptions\" to determine if projects meet these criteria. The transmission project must meet criteria to ensure reliability or reduce power costs. Projects must result from a fair planning process or receive state approval. FERC uses rebuttable presumptions to determine eligibility for incentives. The best candidates for incentives are projects with special risks or challenges, not routine investments. FERC released a Notice of Inquiry on the scope and implementation of its transmission incentives regulations and policies in Order No. 679. Over $50 billion in proposed investments have been received, prompting FERC to seek comments on the program's scope and implementation. 74 specific questions have been asked regarding factors to consider in evaluating incentive applications and obstacles faced by transmission developers. The FERC released a Notice of Inquiry on transmission incentives regulations and policies in Order No. 679, seeking comments on the program's scope and implementation. Questions include obstacles faced by transmission developers and the best incentives to address them. Most incentives under the Final Rule aim to reduce risk and lower borrowing costs, with basis point adders for attractive ROEs being the most requested. FERC granted ROE adders ranging from 50 to 250 basis points for various incentives, including advanced transmission technologies and offshore wind projects. Other approved incentives included CWIP in rate base and costs for project cancellation. No applications for performance-based incentive rates were found. FERC seeks comments on the effects of incentives granted for transmission projects and how to balance promoting investment with ensuring reasonable rates. The goal is to benefit customers while encouraging new infrastructure development. The goal of the incentives policy is to encourage new infrastructure investment that benefits consumers by increasing competition. FERC clarifies that incentives are for projects with special risks, not routine expansions. FERC's incentives policy aims to encourage infrastructure investment for projects with special risks, not routine expansions. The change in EPACT Section 219(a) language could potentially increase consumer electric costs, especially for reliability-specific projects. The Department of Energy (DOE) highlighted the impact of transmission congestion on consumer prices, estimating that lack of infrastructure cost customers over $1.4 billion in 2010. Transmission costs make up about 8% of a U.S. electricity consumer's bill, expected to rise to 9% from 2015 to 2025. There are expectations of significant investments in generation, transmission, and distribution systems in the coming decades. The aging electric power infrastructure in the United States requires significant investment in transmission systems. Studies estimate that $298 billion will be needed over the next 20 years, with an additional $82 billion to $90 billion for smart grid investments. Investor-owned utilities have increased transmission investment from $2 billion per year in the 1990s to $8-9 billion per year in 2008-2009. The report projects that transmission construction may result in an annual investment of between $12 billion and $16 billion per year (in 2011 dollars) over the period from 2011 to 2015, with reliability needs, economic needs, and renewable generation integration driving the investment. The report highlights that transmission investment is driven by reliability, generator interconnection needs, federal and state policies, and FERC transmission pricing incentives. EEI's member companies have shown increased investment in transmission infrastructure. EEI believes that current incentive policies effectively support the development of needed transmission projects. The report emphasizes that transmission investment is increasing due to reliability, generator interconnection needs, and federal and state policies. EEI estimates that total transmission investment is 19% higher than expected without Order No. 679. Approval of electric infrastructure investment is traditionally based on perceived need as outlined in integrated resource plans. The ratemaking process allows utilities to recover investments through cost recovery in rates from electricity consumers. This process also permits a limited return on equity for plant investments. State or federal regulatory bodies authorize book depreciation rates for recovering capitalized investments. Transmission projects are driven by reliability and economic concerns, but FERC Order No. 1000 aims to consider public policy goals, such as meeting state renewable portfolio standards, alongside reliability and economic factors. The positive impact of EPACT and FERC Order No. 679 on transmission investments may not be entirely necessary, as transmission investment trends show a positive trajectory even without these incentives. EEI views Order No. 679 as providing regulatory certainty to encourage ongoing transmission investment. FERC is required by EPACT to provide transmission incentives for projects meeting FPA Section 219 requirements. Since the issuance of Order No. 679 in 2006, FERC has approved 51 proposals for incentive rate treatment for 56 projects, totaling over 10,700 miles of transmission lines at a cost of $44.8 billion. Projects under the Final Rule must benefit consumers by ensuring reliability or reducing congestion. FERC reviews incentives to match risks and challenges of the investment, with recipients required to report annual spending on the project to FERC. FERC requires annual reports on transmission project spending, capital details, completion status, and reasons for delays. The agency does not track or report to Congress on transmission incentives' effectiveness. EEI believes Order No. 679 incentives provide regulatory certainty and support transmission development. Industry data suggest these incentives have positively impacted transmission infrastructure investment. FERC has regulatory discretion moving forward. FERC has regulatory discretion in establishing criteria for project approvals under Order No. 679. The agency may grant, deny, or modify incentives requested by applicants, ensuring a nexus between the incentive and project risks. It remains unclear if FERC can impose specific incentives not originally proposed by applicants. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates FERC to oversee transmission infrastructure investment. The Commission must establish incentive-based rate treatments for electric energy transmission to benefit consumers by ensuring reliability and reducing costs. The rule aims to promote capital investment in transmission facilities, provide a return on equity to attract new investments, and encourage deployment of transmission technologies. The Commission must establish incentive-based rate treatments for electric energy transmission to benefit consumers by ensuring reliability and reducing costs. The rule also encourages deployment of transmission technologies and allows recovery of prudently incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development. Incentives are provided to utilities that join a Transmission Organization to recover costs through transmission rates. The rates approved under the rules adopted for transmission service must be just and reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and subject to Sections 205 and 206 requirements."
