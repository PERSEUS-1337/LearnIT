    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act\" and includes amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to allow the Secretary to reduce or eliminate royalties for promoting development or production on leases. Modifications can be made with lessee consent to achieve these goals. The Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act exempts certain leases from royalty payments on new production in specific areas of the Gulf of Mexico until a set volume of production is reached, with the Secretary required to make a determination within 180 days of application submission by the lessee. The Secretary must determine if new production from a lease or unit would be economically viable within 180 days of the lessee's application. Factors considered include technological and financial risks of deep water development, exploration, development, and production costs. The lessee must provide necessary information for the application, which can be for an individual lease or unit. If deemed economically viable, royalty relief may be granted. The Secretary determines economic viability of new production from a lease or unit within 180 days. Factors considered include technological and financial risks, exploration, development, and production costs. Royalty relief may be granted if deemed economically viable. If new production is not economically viable without royalty relief, a minimum volume of production is required for economic viability. The Secretary will reevaluate the applicability of clause (i) upon request by the lessee before new production begins or if significant factors change. The determination must be made within 120 days of a complete application, with a possible 30-day extension. The lessee will receive written notification of the decision, which will be considered final. The redetermination by the Secretary is a final agency action and can be judicially reviewed under the Administrative Procedures Act. If the Secretary fails to make a determination within the specified time frame, no royalty payments are due on new production. For new production, no royalty is due for one year after production starts. New production is defined as production from a lease with no prior royalties or production resulting from lease development activities expanding significantly. During new production, no royalties are due for one year after production starts. New production is defined as production from a lease with no prior royalties or production resulting from lease development activities expanding significantly beyond anticipated levels. If the average price of light sweet crude oil exceeds $28 per barrel, royalties will apply to oil production, counted towards the total production volume. Estimated royalty payments will be made if the average closing price for the previous year exceeds $28. Lessees will pay royalties with interest or can apply for a refund of any overpayment. Production of natural gas subject to royalties when the average price exceeds $3.50 per million BTUs. Estimated royalty payments will be made if the average closing price for the previous year exceeds $3.50. Lessees can pay royalties with interest or apply for a refund of any overpayment. Prices can be adjusted based on the percentage change in the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product. SEC. 3. NEW LEASES. Section 8(a)(1) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include a new cash bonus bid with royalty provision for tracts in specific areas of the Gulf of Mexico. This provision allows for a fixed royalty rate of at least 12.5% with the Secretary determining the suspension of royalties based on production value. In Mexico, lease sales in specific water depths will use a bidding system with set suspension of royalties based on production volume: 17.5 million barrels for 200-400 meters, 52.5 million barrels for 400-800 meters, and 87.5 million barrels for depths over 800 meters. The Secretary must create rules and regulations to implement the Act within 180 days of its enactment."
