    "content": "The THUD appropriations subcommittees draft bills for annual appropriations for DOT, HUD, and related agencies. The DOT primarily provides grants and regulatory oversight for transportation infrastructure. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is unique within the Department of Transportation (DOT) as it focuses on operating the U.S. air traffic control system. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which primarily addresses housing issues for low-income households and individuals with special needs through rental assistance programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) receives the majority of nonemergency funding through block grant programs like HOME Investment Partnership Program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). These programs help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for home buyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds transportation and housing agencies like the Access Board and National Transportation Safety Board. The Office of Inspector General, NeighborWorks, and government conservatorship costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are discussed in relation to the FY2015 THUD appropriations bill. There is a discrepancy in funding allocation between the Senate and House subcommittees, making agreement on the final appropriation level challenging. Tables provide details on funding for FY2014, Administration requests for FY2015, and allocations by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Total funding for each title in the bill for FY2014 is also listed. The President's FY2015 budget included a request for $126.7 billion for THUD, $22 billion more than appropriated for THUD in FY2014. Most of this increase was for highway, transit, and rail funding under the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal. The request for HUD is $4 billion more than provided in FY2014, but $3 billion of that increase reflects a decline in offsetting receipts. The House bill for FY2015 would provide $105.5 billion, a reduction of $2 billion from FY2014 due to a $3 billion decline in offsetting receipts. The committee recommended cuts in DOT's TIGER grant program, New Starts transit grant program, Amtrak, and other DOT funding. HUD's funding would increase by $1 billion less than the reduction in offsetting collections. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $108.1 billion, $700 million more than the FY2014 level after accounting for the $3 billion reduction in offsetting receipts in FY2015. The Office of Management and Budget reported that no sequester reductions are required for FY2015 due to discretionary spending limits set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Funding trends for DOT and HUD over FY2009-FY2014 are shown in Table 4, excluding emergency and supplemental funding. Different totals for THUD appropriations bill funding may be reported by various sources. The THUD appropriations bills include various funding and savings mechanisms, leading to different reported figures for the same programs. Most programs in the bill are funded through regular discretionary appropriations drawn from the Treasury's general fund. Advance appropriations and emergency appropriations are also sometimes provided by Congress, especially in response to disasters. Emergency appropriations are funds provided outside of regular appropriations acts, often in emergency supplemental spending bills. They are not always included in the discretionary appropriation total for an agency. The Department of Transportation's budget mainly consists of contract authority, which controls spending from federal trust fund resources. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than necessary. The Appropriations Committee subcommittees are given \"302(b) allocations\" which divide the total amount the committee has to spend for a fiscal year among the subcommittees. This figure includes only net discretionary budget authority, with offsets and rescissions taken into account. Offset receipts and collections are also used to help offset a higher level of discretionary funding. The Appropriations Committee subcommittees receive 302(b) allocations to divide the total funds for the fiscal year. The majority of funding goes to HUD, but when contract authority is included, DOT has more resources. Subcommittees must decide how to allocate funds across different agencies within their jurisdictions. In determining new appropriations for the THUD subcommittees, the amount of savings from rescissions and offsets plays a crucial role. Without these savings in FY2014, it would have cost an additional $12.8 billion to provide the same level of appropriations. The budget savings can vary yearly, affecting the cost of providing appropriations. In FY2015, a $3 billion reduction in offsetting collections would require an additional $3 billion in discretionary funding to maintain the same level of total funding as in FY2014. In FY2015, the House THUD subcommittee faced a funding shortfall compared to FY2014 due to a limited discretionary allocation. Roughly three-fourths of DOT's budget comes from mandatory budget authority derived from the highway trust fund, which is projected to reach insolvency. The FY2015 budget request for DOT is $90.9 billion, $20 billion more than FY2014. Congress is considering DOT appropriations amidst uncertainty about its future program structure and funding. The Administration's transportation reauthorization proposal requests $302 billion over four years for highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail, averaging $78 billion annually. This is a significant increase compared to the current authorization of $105 billion over two years. The House bill proposes $70.2 billion in new budget authority, while the Senate Committee recommends $71.7 billion. Concerns about the highway trust fund's status remain a key issue. The federal highway funding, mostly from the highway trust fund, faces a shortfall due to stagnant gas tax since 1993. Revenues fall short of authorized outlays, leading to transfers from the general fund to keep the trust fund solvent. The Congressional Budget Office projected insolvency in FY2015, with potential payment delays even before FY2014 ends. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, leading to a shortfall in the highway trust fund. Revenues are insufficient due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency, with projected annual revenues of $37-38 billion through 2024. The federal gas tax has not been raised since 1993, causing a shortfall in the highway trust fund. Revenues are projected to be $37-38 billion annually from FY2014 to FY2024, falling short of the $53 billion authorized expenditures. Congress faces decisions on surface transportation funding, including reducing programs, raising fuel taxes, or seeking funding from other sources. Long-term challenges include fuel efficiency improvements and electric vehicle usage impacting motor fuel tax revenue. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program, established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding distribution. It provides grants for projects with national, regional, or metropolitan significance in various transportation modes. The TIGER grant program provides competitive grants for transportation projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance. It is heavily oversubscribed, with $9.5 billion in applications for $600 million available in FY2014. The program is the main discretionary grant program for surface transportation after the restructuring of DOT programs. The TIGER grant program, oversubscribed with $9.5 billion in applications for $600 million available in FY2014, has faced criticism for awarding grants to lower-ranked projects over higher-ranked ones without clear explanations. The Administration requested $1.25 billion for the program in FY2015, but the House bill only allocated $100 million, emphasizing equitable fund distribution. The EAS program, funded at $550 million in FY2014, aims to support small community air service by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Program costs doubled from FY2008 to FY2012 due to airline route reductions. Changes in 2012 included capping subsidies per passenger and limiting subsidies for communities close to hub airports. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program aims to support small community air service by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Supporters argue that it preserves airline service to small communities and promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger and the proximity of some airports to major airports. The Administration requested $155 million for the EAS program in FY2015, $8.6 million less than the previous year. The House bill proposes $149 million in discretionary funding for the Essential Air Service program, with a potential reduction in overflight fee revenues. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommends the requested $155 million. The budget also includes a proposal for a new National High Performance Rail System program with a total of $4.8 billion in funding. The Administration proposed funding for a Current Passenger Rail Service grant program and a Rail Service Improvement grant program, totaling $2.3 billion. The funding would come from a transportation trust fund. Congress previously provided $10.5 billion for DOT's high speed and intercity passenger rail grant program, but no additional funding has been allocated since FY2011. California is the only state actively pursuing a high-speed rail line with speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour. The project has received $3.6 billion in federal funding, but the total cost is estimated at over $70 billion. The Administration proposed placing Amtrak's funding into a new Federal Railroad Administration account, requesting $2.45 billion for passenger rail asset development and maintenance. Congress provided $1.39 billion for Amtrak in FY2014. Amtrak requested $1.62 billion for FY2015, almost $1 billion less than in FY2014. The request asked for less money for capital improvements, debt service, and omitted funding for various projects. The request was $600 million less than the Administration's request. Some differences in funding categories were evident between the two requests. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for Amtrak in FY2015, with the Senate recommending the same as FY2014. The majority of FTA's funding goes to state and local transit agencies, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. In 2012, the Capital Investment Grants program was reauthorized with three components: New Starts, Small Starts, and Core Capacity. New Starts funds projects over $250 million seeking over $75 million in federal funding, while Small Starts funds projects under $250 million seeking less than $75 million. Core Capacity funds expansions to existing fixed-guideway systems at capacity. The program provides funding over several years, with $1.41 billion in New Starts funding required for FY2015. The Capital Investment Grants program requires $1.41 billion in New Starts funding for FY2015. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for the program, with the House bill proposing $1.69 billion and the Senate Committee recommending $2.161 billion. The federal share for New Starts projects can be up to 80%, but the House bill aims to lower it to 50%. The House bill aims to lower the federal share for New Starts projects from up to 80% to 50%. Critics argue that this makes highway projects more attractive for communities, while advocates believe it allows for more projects to be supported with available funding and encourages careful cost estimation. The House and Senate bills also include policy provisions. The Senate bill includes amendments to prohibit funds for the California high-speed rail project, subsidize Amtrak services, approve an application for a Norwegian air carrier, administer a survey on alcohol and drugged driving, and promote motorcycle safety. Additionally, the bill suspends portions of commercial driver hours-of-service rules for a year pending a cost-benefit study. New requirements for drivers include mandatory rest periods after working a certain number of hours. The 2013 change in the hours-of-service rules limits drivers to working for 60 hours in a seven-day period, with a 34-hour \"restart\" allowed once in a 168-hour span. This change aims to reduce driver fatigue and promote highway safety. Drivers who work less than 60 hours in a week are not required to take the 34-hour restart. The 2013 change in the hours-of-service rules limits drivers to working for 60 hours in a seven-day period, with a 34-hour \"restart\" allowed once in a 168-hour span to reduce driver fatigue and promote highway safety. The proposed amendment would suspend the requirement for the 34-hour restart period covering two 1 a.m.-5 a.m. periods for roughly a year, returning it to the pre-2013 rule. The proposed amendment would suspend the 34-hour restart period requirement for a year, returning it to the pre-2013 rule. DOT would study the impact of current requirements to assess if benefits outweigh costs, with commercial trucking groups supporting the change and highway safety groups opposing it. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures private mortgage lenders against losses on certain mortgages made to eligible borrowers, aiming to make mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) specifies how the costs of federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans, are recorded in the federal budget through credit subsidy. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) administers the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) to insure mortgages on single-family homes. The MMI Fund historically has a negative credit subsidy cost, generating offsetting receipts for the government. In FY2015, the MMI Fund was estimated to generate $12.2 billion in negative credit subsidy. The President's budget estimated that FHA would generate about $13.1 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2015, which could be used as offsetting receipts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates for the MMI Fund in FY2015 are $4.2 billion lower than the President's budget, with CBO estimating $8 billion in negative credit subsidy rather than $12.2 billion. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account provides funding to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. HUD provides subsidies to make up the rent difference for eligible low-income families in subsidized units. Newly subsidized units have not been added since the early 1980s, and contracts were funded for 20- to 40-year periods. The PBRA account administers and renews project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts with private property owners. Contracts require new annual appropriations once they expire, with some needing additional funding to complete their terms. The account has grown to be the second-largest in HUD's budget, with a proposed decrease in funding for FY2015. HUD aims to fund all PBRA contracts on a calendar year schedule, moving away from the current month-based system. The President's budget proposed using FY2015 funding to cover contracts through CY2015, with FY2016 funding allocated for the full 2016 calendar year at an estimated cost of $10.8 billion. Both the House-passed bill (H.R. 4745) and Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill (S. 2438) support calendar year funding for PBRA, providing $9.7 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee reluctantly agreed to the shift, citing budget constraints for FY2015. The Committee accepts the approach for preserving HUD's housing assistance programs due to budget constraints for fiscal year 2015. The President's budget requested $950 million for the HOME program, a 5% decrease from the FY2014 enacted level. The House-passed bill (H.R. 4745) would provide $700 million for the HOME program, $250 million less than the President's budget request. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill (S. 2438) would fund the HOME account at $950 million, the same level as requested in the President's budget. Both bills allocate $10 million for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), with differences in how SHOP is funded. The President's budget proposes changing the thresholds for local jurisdictions to receive HOME funds, removing the lower threshold and revising provisions for \"grandfathering\" of participating jurisdictions. The budget proposal aims to change the HOME funds thresholds for local jurisdictions, eliminating grandfathering and allowing a five-year qualification period. This change would result in fewer participating localities but higher grant amounts for those that continue to participate. The House-passed bill includes language to disregard the lower threshold for localities to become participating jurisdictions during the fiscal year. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill does not include permanent changes proposed in the President's budget, such as altering the threshold requirement or grandfathering provision. It also disregards the lower threshold for localities to become participating jurisdictions in FY2015. The bill maintains appropriations levels for various agencies within the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations. NeighborWorks America, a government-chartered nonprofit corporation, receives funding for community revitalization, affordable housing, and foreclosure prevention counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. The President's FY2015 budget requested $182 million for NeighborWorks. NeighborWorks requested $182 million in funding, with $132 million for core activities and $50 million for the NFMCP. The House-passed bill also allocated $182 million, citing housing market improvements for reducing NFMCP funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill proposed nearly $187 million for NeighborWorks, with $137 million for core programs and $50 million for NFMCP. NeighborWorks requested $182 million in funding, with $132 million for core activities and $50 million for the NFMCP. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill proposed nearly $187 million for NeighborWorks, with $137 million for core programs and $50 million for the NFMCP."
