    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Timber Fair Trade and Forest Conservation Act of 1994\" and includes export controls on unprocessed timber. Section 7 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include monitoring and imposing export restrictions on unprocessed timber in case of a critical shortage for domestic manufacturing purposes. The Secretary may impose export restrictions on unprocessed timber to ensure an adequate domestic supply for manufacturing needs. Restrictions can be removed upon reporting to Congress that they are no longer necessary. The Secretary must submit quarterly reports to Congress on monitoring results, determinations of timber shortages, and any imposed export restrictions. The Secretary can impose export restrictions on unprocessed timber to secure domestic manufacturing supply. Quarterly reports to Congress must detail export quantities, domestic timber supplies, origins of timber, and whether supplies meet domestic needs. The Secretary can impose export restrictions on unprocessed timber to secure domestic manufacturing supply. When shortages exist, export restrictions will be specified to meet domestic needs, with preference given to small woodland owners in allocating export licenses. The export of unprocessed timber can be restricted to ensure domestic manufacturing supply, with preferences for small woodland owners. Private lands exclude Federal or State lands, and those held in trust by the United States for Indian tribes or individuals. The term 'Federal lands' refers to lands owned by the United States, excluding specific exceptions. 'State lands' are those owned by a State or political subdivision, also with exceptions. A 'critical shortage of unprocessed timber for domestic manufacturing purposes' includes periods of high timber exports. The term 'person' refers to any individual. A critical shortage of unprocessed timber for domestic manufacturing purposes may lead to serious economic impacts, such as domestic mills shutting down due to lack of timber supply. The term 'person' includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and legal entities. 'Forest land' is defined as land with at least 10% tree cover. Unprocessed timber is not considered an agricultural commodity. The President has the authority to suspend export restrictions after a 90-day public comment period if a ruling under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade finds the restrictions violate Article XI prohibitions on export restrictions. The Congress acknowledges a shortage of unprocessed timber for domestic manufacturing in certain states and authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to impose export controls on unprocessed timber from Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Montana."
