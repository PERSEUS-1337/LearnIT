    "content": "The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program is outlined in Section 1. The Secretary of the Army will establish a pilot program to provide environmental assistance in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, focusing on water-related infrastructure projects. This includes erosion control, shoreline protection, wastewater treatment facilities, and beneficial use of dredged material. The Secretary may provide assistance for publicly owned projects that will be publicly operated and maintained. Before providing assistance, a local cooperation agreement must be made with a non-Federal interest for design and construction. The agreement should include a plan for facilities or resource protection and development. The development plan must include engineering plans, specifications, and resource benefits estimates. Legal and institutional structures must be established for long-term project operation. The Federal share of project costs in local cooperation agreements is 75%, with the non-Federal contribution determined by the value of lands, easements, and relocations. The Secretary provides credit to non-Federal interests for lands, easements, and rights-of-way in local cooperation agreements, not exceeding 25% of total project costs. Non-Federal share of operation and maintenance costs is 100%. Other Federal and State laws and agreements still apply. The Secretary cooperates with various Federal agencies in carrying out projects under this section, without affecting the applicability of other Federal or State laws. The Secretary will establish demonstration projects in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania to protect environmental, historic, and cultural resources. A report on the program's results will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1998, with a recommendation on national implementation. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1995 to carry out this section."
