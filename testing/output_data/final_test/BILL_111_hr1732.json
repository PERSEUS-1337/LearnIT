    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Outdoor Lighting Efficiency Act\". The Congress finds that 4.4 percent of electricity in the US is used for outdoor lighting, which accounts for 20 percent of all lighting electricity consumption. Efficient outdoor lighting technologies offer quality light and longer lifetimes compared to other technologies. Using these technologies can reduce waste, emissions, and electricity costs in commercial and government applications. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include outdoor luminaires, high light output lamps, and other industrial equipment classified by the Secretary. The definitions of \"luminaire\" and \"outdoor luminaire\" are also provided. The curr_chunk states that the product is suitable for wet locations according to UL standard UL 1598 and labeled as 'Suitable for Wet Locations' as per the National Electrical Code 2005, with exceptions for specific types of luminaires not intended for general lighting applications. The curr_chunk defines terms related to outdoor lighting, including landscape luminaries, outdoor high light output lamps, and outdoor lighting controls. A luminaire can adjust light levels based on signals from sensors or input signals communicated through wired or wireless technology. The standards for adjusting light levels in a luminaire are outlined in Section 4. Section 342 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include new requirements for outdoor luminaires manufactured after specific dates. These requirements include minimum lighting efficiency and lumen maintenance standards. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act amended Section 342 to include new requirements for outdoor luminaires manufactured after specific dates. These requirements include minimum lighting efficiency and lumen maintenance standards, as well as the capability of producing at least two different light levels. The Secretary is required to issue a final rule by January 1, 2017, amending the standards if technologically feasible and economically justified, with the rule becoming effective by January 1, 2020. The final rule under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act establishes efficiency standards at the maximum feasible and justified level. The Secretary may amend product exclusions and lumen maintenance requirements if consistent with the Act's purposes. Amended standards apply to products manufactured after January 1, 2020, or one year after the final amended standard is published. The final rule sets efficiency standards for outdoor high light output lamps manufactured after January 1, 2012, requiring a lighting efficiency of at least 45 lumens per watt. SEC. 5. TEST PROCEDURES. Section 343(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include test procedures for outdoor lighting based on Illuminating Engineering Society procedure LM-79 or other consensus test procedures. If LM-79 is amended, the Secretary will adjust the test procedures accordingly. The Secretary may revise test procedures for outdoor luminaries or high light output lamps in accordance with the amended LM-79 test procedure, incorporating consensus test procedures developed by relevant standards bodies. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Amends section 345 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to apply section 327 to outdoor luminaries in the same manner as part B, except for State standards adopted before January 1, 2015, for reducing outdoor lighting energy use."
