ICTY conditionality policy has delayed Euro-Atlantic integration for some Balkan countries, incentivizing compliance with war crimes judicial proceedings. ICTY, established in 1993, continues preparations for its eventual closing. The ICTY, established in 1993, is preparing for its closure. Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte stepped down in 2008, succeeded by Serge Brammertz. By mid-2008, the tribunal had completed proceedings for 113 of 161 indicted suspects. The completion strategy aims to finish initial trials by 2009 and appeals by 2011, with efforts to refer cases to domestic courts in the region. The ICTY is making efforts to refer cases to domestic courts in the region, but delays may occur if the remaining suspects are not detained. Officials urge the Security Council not to close the tribunal before Karadzic and Mladic face trial. High-profile cases include Milosevic's trial ending without a verdict, Seselj's trial opening in 2007, and Haradinaj being acquitted in 2008. The court's prosecutor plans to appeal the judgment in the Haradinaj case. One co-defendant was acquitted, another sentenced to six years in prison. U.S. interest in Balkan cooperation with the tribunal is rooted in support for ICTY and the transfer of top indictees to The Hague. The goal is Balkan integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions like the EU and NATO, with full ICTY cooperation seen as crucial. The Bush Administration backs the tribunal's completion strategy, and Congress has tied some funding to ICTY cooperation. In July 2008, the Serbian government announced the arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, indicted by ICTY for war crimes and genocide. Congress has conditioned U.S. assistance to Serbia on ICTY cooperation, with funds being released after improved cooperation was certified. The second session of the 110th Congress may revisit certification requirements for Serbia in foreign aid legislation. Radovan Karadzic was arrested under a false identity as Dragan Dabic, with analysts attributing the timing to the new Serbian government's push for EU membership. Stojan Zupljanin, a former security commander, was also arrested for war crimes against Muslim and Croat communities in Bosnia. Karadzic is expected to be transferred to The Hague soon. In June 2007, Serbia facilitated the transfer of two fugitive suspects to The Hague: former General Zdravko Tolimir and Vlastimir Djordjevic. This move followed the capture of Stojan Zupljanin, a major war crimes suspect, who was transferred to The Hague on June 21. These arrests, along with previous transfers of Bosnian Serb indictees, were seen as positive steps for Serbia's negotiations with the EU. Former Yugoslav Army generals surrendered, including former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj and former Croatian General Ante Gotovina. ICTY officials praised Belgrade's commitment to cooperate but criticized their reliance on negotiated surrenders. The arrest of Stojan Zupljanin in June 2008 confirmed the Prosecutor's assertion that fugitives were \"within reach.\" The arrest of Karadzic raised expectations for capturing the remaining indicted war crimes suspects. Gen. Ratko Mladic's capture is highly anticipated, with some predicting he may not surrender peacefully. Gen. Ratko Mladic is predicted to not surrender peacefully or be captured alive. He, along with Radovan Karadzic, is charged with genocide and other crimes for their actions in the Bosnian Serb campaign from 1991 to 1995. Carla del Ponte criticized Serbia for not taking action to arrest the remaining fugitives, including Mladic and Karadzic. Despite earlier optimism, there is no evidence of Serbia cooperating fully with the ICTY. In recent years, there have been reports of sightings and surrender negotiations with local authorities regarding Karadzic and Mladic. NATO and EU forces in Bosnia have targeted associates of the fugitives. The arrest of Zupljanin in 2008 led to speculation about further arrests of top suspects. The US and EU have used conditionality policies to encourage Balkan cooperation with ICTY, supporting the region's Euro-Atlantic aspirations. In the western Balkans, closer ties to NATO and the EU are a key priority, with a focus on meeting international commitments and the rule of law, including cooperation with the ICTY. NATO invited Serbia and Bosnia to join Partnership for Peace despite Mladic and Karadzic still being at large. The EU resumed negotiations with Serbia after progress in extraditing suspected war criminals to The Hague. Some believe western institutions should engage with Serbia to support its integration prospects post Kosovo's independence. ICTY officials advocate for maintaining EU conditionality policy to ensure arrests of war crimes suspects like Ratko Mladic. Delays in capturing Mladic and Karadzic could impact ICTY's timeline for closure. Russia opposes extending ICTY's mandate, while officials stress the tribunal's importance. Bosnia and Herzegovina's goal was to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program and complete a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. Limited cooperation with ICTY, especially by Republika Srpska, hindered these efforts. Former High Representative Ashdown used the ICTY issue to remove obstructionist officials and reshape governing institutions. The EU began SAA negotiations with Bosnia in 2005 after leaders reached a preliminary agreement on police reforms. In mid-June 2008, Bosnia signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU after gaining entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace program in late 2006. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) praised Bosnia's improved cooperation and the work of its war crimes chamber. Croatia had a positive record of cooperation with ICTY, except for a case involving Gen. Ante Gotovina. EU members indefinitely postponed the opening of negotiations in March 2005. In March 2005, EU members indefinitely postponed membership talks with Croatia due to the case involving Gen. Ante Gotovina. Croatia adopted an Action Plan to track down Gotovina, leading to his capture and resolving the ICTY cooperation issue. Serbia's cooperation with ICTY remained limited despite extraditing Slobodan Milosevic in 2001. The Kostunica government increased efforts to encourage indicted persons to surrender, resulting in the transfer of over 15 individuals. After the capture of Gen. Ante Gotovina in Croatia, Serbia's limited cooperation with the ICTY improved under the new government. Efforts were made to encourage indicted individuals to surrender, resulting in the transfer of over 15 accused. Despite resistance from Serbia's security services, progress was noted in political commitment and responsiveness to tribunal requests. The International Court of Justice's judgment on Serbia's role in the Srebrenica massacre further emphasized the need to resolve the ICTY fugitive issue. In 2008, Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY improved with the arrest of Zupljanin and Karadzic, signaling a stronger commitment to justice. However, the expectation to bring Mladic to justice remains. The United States suspended aid to Serbia over war crimes issues in previous years. At the NATO summit in April 2008, alliance members expressed a desire to strengthen relations with Serbia, which had soured due to Belgrade's resentment over Kosovo's independence. The EU suspended SAA negotiations with Serbia in 2006 over ICTY cooperation but resumed talks in 2007 after progress was made. EU members eventually agreed to sign the SAA with Serbia in late April. In November, EU members agreed to sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia in late April 2008 to boost pro-European forces before parliamentary elections. Serbia's ambition for EU candidate status led to the new government's arrest of Karadzic, potentially bringing Belgrade closer to capturing the last remaining fugitives."
