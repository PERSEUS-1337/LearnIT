    "content": "Foreign nationals must obtain a visa to come to the United States, with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice playing key roles in administering immigration laws. DOS issues visas, USCIS approves immigrant petitions, ICE operates the Visa Security Program, CBP inspects all arrivals, and EOIR makes policy decisions on immigration cases. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to ignite an explosive device on a flight in 2009, raised concerns about visa processes and information sharing among government agencies. Policymakers are reviewing potential revisions to address gaps in security measures. The 112th Congress is interested in visa security issues, focusing on strengthening immigration law, increasing funding, and determining the leading agency. Visas are issued to immigrants and nonimmigrants, with humanitarian admissions handled separately. Asylum or refugee status can lead to legal permanent residency, while illegal aliens entered without inspection, with fraudulent documents, or violated visa terms. Aliens wishing to live permanently in the United States must meet specific criteria outlined in the INA. They can qualify based on various relationships or employment opportunities, such as being a spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, a refugee, or a winner of the diversity lottery. Petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by a sponsoring relative or employer. The process is called \"adjustment of status\" if the immigrant is already in the U.S., otherwise, it is handled differently. Aliens seeking to come to the United States temporarily rather than to live permanently are known as nonimmigrants. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with over 70 specific types of nonimmigrant visas issued currently. Most of these visa categories are defined in the INA. These visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subparagraph in the INA, e.g., B-2 tourists, F-1 foreign students, H-1B. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows visitors from 35 countries to enter the US without visas. CBP inspectors conduct background checks for VWP entrants. Visa issuance policy dates back to 1924, assigning consular officers the responsibility to approve or deny visas. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1947 observed the importance of a double check system for screening aliens entering the United States, as established in the Immigration Act of 1924. This system was deemed crucial for protecting the country against criminals and undesirables, and was later codified into law in 1952. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 codified statutes on immigration and nationality, giving the Secretary of State the authority to administer and enforce immigration laws. Consular officers have the sole authority to issue visas under the act, and their decisions are not appealable. The Secretary of State may direct a consular officer to deny a visa under certain circumstances. After the 9/11 attacks, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 increased consular officers' access to electronic information for alien screening and required biometric identifiers on visas by October 2004. It also expanded training requirements for consular officers. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 expanded training requirements for consular officers who issue visas, giving the Department of Homeland Security authority to develop programs for homeland security training in addition to the training provided by the Department of State. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Department of Homeland Security authority over visa issuances, while the Department of State remained responsible for issuing visas. A memorandum of understanding signed by the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security outlined the division of responsibilities, with DHS assigning personnel to diplomatic posts and DOS proposing visa regulations subject to DHS approval. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted DHS authority over visa issuances, while DOS remained responsible for issuing visas. A memorandum of understanding outlined the division of responsibilities, with DHS assigning personnel to diplomatic posts and DOS proposing visa regulations subject to DHS approval. The Secretary of State retains responsibility over certain visa decisions, including those of a foreign policy nature, visa validity periods, and fees based on reciprocity. Homeland Security must be consulted before lengthening visa validity periods, and has authority to deny certain persons or classes of persons the maximum validity period for security reasons. The Secretary of State also has authority over foreign policy-related grounds of visa denial. The MOU outlines the division of responsibilities between DHS and DOS regarding visa issuances. DHS officers abroad may provide input on consular officer evaluations, but the evaluations will be written by State Department supervisors. DHS officers come under the authority of the Chief of Mission. In congressional testimony, C. Stewart Verdery, Jr. discussed DHS' role in visa security. Verdery reported that DHS officers in Saudi Arabia review all visa applications before adjudication, providing assistance, expert advice, and training on fraudulent documents and fingerprinting techniques. They have access to various law enforcement databases for the review process. The Visa Security Program (VSP) allows DHS employees to be assigned to diplomatic and consular posts, with a MOU outlining administrative support, security, and collaboration between ICE and State for VSP operations. The Visa Security Program (VSP) involves the roles and responsibilities of VSP agents and consular officers, formal training for consular officers, dispute resolution process clarification, and collaboration on fraud investigations. Congress revised visa security policies based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated technology and training improvements for detecting terrorist travel. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandated new requirements for nonimmigrant visa applicants, including in-person consular interviews and accurate information submission. Foreign nationals must undergo admissibility reviews and provide biometric data such as fingerprints and photographs. Foreign nationals applying for visas must provide personal information such as name, age, gender, and birth details. Certain documents need certification by government authorities. Physical and mental examinations are required to ensure eligibility for visas, screening for health, criminal history, security concerns, and other inadmissibility criteria. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database to screen visa applicants. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) is used to screen visa applicants, storing records dating back to the mid-1990s. It includes photographs and 10-finger scans of applicants, links with other databases like IDENT and IAFIS, and grants access to CBP officers at ports of entry. Consular officers have access to DHS' Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS) to track foreign nationals' entries and exits from the US. They also check the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database, which has grown significantly since 9/11 due to improved data sharing. The Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system has increased the percentage of CLASS records from other government agencies to almost 70%. Consular officers use the Visa Viper system to refer visa cases for greater review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Visa Viper communications are sent to the NCTC if concerns arise about a foreign national. In 2009, approximately 3,000 Visa Viper communications were sent to NCTC. Consular officers use the Visa Viper system to refer visa cases for further review by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Visa Viper communications are sent to the NCTC if concerns arise about a foreign national. The SAO procedures involve sending suspect names to the FBI for a name check program called Visa Condor. The \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" (TEL) includes organizations designated as terrorist-supporting and individuals associated with them. Consular officers and the Secretary of State have the authority to revoke visas if the alien is ineligible or overstays the visa limits. Consular officers may prudentially revoke visas for safety reasons, especially if there are concerns about U.S. law enforcement interests. The Foreign Affairs Manual instructs consular officers to seek advisory opinions before making determinations of ineligibility for visa revocations related to issues like misrepresentation, terrorist activity, or foreign policy. In such cases, the consular officer must enter the alien's name in the CLASS under a quasi-refusal code until the advisory opinion is received. When a consular officer suspects a visa revocation may involve U.S. law enforcement interests, they consult with law enforcement agencies and inform State officials before making a decision. This consultation is to avoid compromising legal or intelligence investigations that may be ongoing. Visa revocation has been a ground for removal since 2004, with limited judicial review available if it is the sole basis for removal. DOS regulations in 2011 expanded the authority for revocation by consular officers. Regulations were expanded in 2011 to allow consular officers to revoke nonimmigrant visas at their discretion. They can also provisionally revoke a visa while assessing the holder's eligibility. The visa holder must be notified of the revocation, but it is effective regardless of notification. The revocation of a nonimmigrant visa results in its cancellation by marking \"REVOKED\" on the visa. The visa is no longer valid for travel to the United States once entered into the Department's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS). These regulations aim to improve the visa revocation process and information sharing among federal agencies. The HSA \u00a7428 authorized the Secretary of DHS to assign employees to diplomatic and consular posts for visa security activities through the Visa Security Program (VSP) operated by ICE OIA. The VSP sends ICE special agents to high-risk consular posts to provide expert advice, training, review visa applications, and conduct investigations related to security threats. The Visa Security Program (VSP) sends ICE special agents to high-risk consular posts overseas to perform visa security activities. VSP units were established in various countries, with a proposed expansion plan to cover 75% of the highest risk visa activity by 2013. VSP agents screen visa applicants using DHS's Traveler Enforcement Compliance System (TECS). ICE agents have access to DHS's Traveler Enforcement Compliance System (TECS) to vet visa applicants, conduct research, and investigate possible matches. They engage in discussions with consular officers and provide training on threats to the visa process, including fraud trends and identifying fraudulent documents. The Visa Security Program aims to improve integration and monitor the threat environment specific to each post and host country. Congress appropriated $5 million to establish an SAO review unit within VSP headquarters in FY2007 to improve VSP integration in the SAO process. Some argue that DOS retains too much power over visa issuances, with concerns that consular officers prioritize tourism and trade over scrutinizing visa applicants for security. Senator Joseph Lieberman raised these concerns following the attempted bombing of Flight 253. Senator Joseph Lieberman suggested transferring visa application and admission responsibility from the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security in light of terrorism threats. Senator Patrick Leahy emphasized the need for further deliberation on changing visa security policies post-9/11. The near tragedy on Christmas Day prompts a reevaluation of intelligence agencies and the need for additional reforms. Proponents argue for maintaining the current division of responsibilities between the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, citing the balance it strikes and the expertise of consular officers in visa issuances. Legislation has been proposed to give the Secretary of Homeland Security exclusive authority in this area. Homeland Security has exclusive authority over visa regulations and enforcement, as per H.R. 1741 introduced by House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith in June 2011. Amendments clarified the Secretary of State's power to direct visa refusals or revocations in U.S. interests. The issue of whether the Secretary of Homeland Security should have visa revocation authority remains unresolved. Legislation has been introduced to give the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to revoke visas and immediately remove foreign nationals. Some argue that aliens should be deported if their visas are revoked, without a hearing before an immigration judge. Others believe that current law strikes a balance between consular officer discretion and deportation standards. The House Judiciary Committee rejected an amendment to H.R. 1471 that would have allowed judicial review of the DHS Secretary's decision to refuse or revoke a visa. An exception in the INA allows judicial review if a visa revocation is the sole grounds for deportation. The authority of the chief of mission remains intact despite added authorities given to DHS. The authority of the chief of mission remains intact despite added authorities given to DHS. A 2008 report discussed tensions between DOS and DHS in establishing VSP units abroad. DOS officials believe ICE special agents can conduct visa security activities remotely, but VSP managers argue that agents assigned overseas provide unique value. ICE special agents assigned to VSUs at overseas posts use their expertise in immigration law, investigations, document examination, intelligence research, and counterterrorism to enhance the consular visa adjudication process with law enforcement vetting and investigation. Top-level DOS leadership supports the expansion of VSP units to additional consular posts, despite previous difficulties in working relationships between VSP agents and consular officials. The recent evaluation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified shortcomings in the VSP program, including tensions between VSP agents and consular officials. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified several shortcomings in the Visa Security Program (VSP), including tensions between consular officials and VSP agents, lack of standard operating procedures, additional administrative functions slowing visa security activities, staffing shortages, coverage problems, and inconsistent training. GAO also noted that ICE has not expanded VSP to key high-risk posts as planned in 2007. ICE developed a 5-year expansion plan for the Visa Security Program (VSP) in 2007 but has not fully followed or updated it. The plan prioritizes risk analysis for site selection, ranking visa-issuing posts by factors like terrorist threats. However, 11 of the top 20 high-risk posts identified in the plan are not covered by the VSP. ICE has not addressed visa risk in high-risk posts without VSP presence, citing budgetary and space limitations. No alternatives have been identified to enhance security at these posts. H.R. 1741 would require DHS to conduct on-site reviews of visa issuances at high-risk posts without VSP presence in various countries. Visa processing costs are mainly covered by applicants, with fees of $355 for immigrant visas and nonimmigrant processing fees. The immigrant visa application processing fee is $355, and the nonimmigrant processing fee is $131. The 107th Congress authorized the collection of Machine-Readable Visa (MRV) fees at $65, with a $10 surcharge for machine-readable visas in nonmachine-readable passports. These fees help offset costs for consular services. The FY2012 Budget Request shows an increase in Border Security Program funding from $1.990 billion to $2.085 billion, with additional fee receipts contributing to the overall funding. Concerns may arise about whether the Department of State is adequately funded to process visas efficiently while maintaining security procedures. The Visa Security Program (VSP) funding has increased over the years, with Congress almost doubling President Bush's request in FY2009. Funding fell short of President Obama's request in FY2010, but DHS has been expanding VSP units in high-risk consular posts. Congress required DHS to use remaining enhancement funds by FY2010 or risk losing them. The Visa Security Program (VSP) funding has increased over the years, with Congress almost doubling President Bush's request in FY2009. The Obama Administration requested $29.5 million for VSP in FY2012, with questions raised about staffing levels at high-risk consular posts. Congressman Gus Bilirakis has called for shifting funding from DHS administrative functions to VSP. The expansion of the Visa Security Program (VSP) has faced challenges related to its added value, inter-department negotiations, and funding. Several applications have been pending since 2008 and 2009. The legislative history of visa functions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 also raised debates on the location of visa issuance functions within the Department of Homeland Security. The Administration's proposal for a homeland security department aimed to consolidate various agencies, including INS, under a new department. The plan suggested placing all INS functions under the border and transportation security division. There was debate on whether Consular Affairs should retain visa issuance responsibilities or if they should be moved to the proposed DHS. Critics of moving Consular Affairs's visa issuance responsibilities to the proposed DHS argued that consular officers prioritize tourism, commerce, and cultural exchange over thorough screening of foreign nationals entering the United States. Concerns were raised about the \"Visa Express\" program in Saudi Arabia, which allowed travel agents to pre-screen nonimmigrants, potentially enabling terrorists to enter the country. Critics believed that visa issuance was crucial for homeland security and should be handled by a department without conflicting diplomatic priorities. Keeping INS adjudications and Consular Affairs visa issuances separate could lead to mistakes and oversights. Proponents of retaining visa issuances in Consular Affairs argue that consular officers have country-specific knowledge necessary for admissibility decisions. They believe that transferring this adjudication to homeland security may lead to judicial appeals or due process issues. Critics of moving visa issuance to DHS are concerned about potential conflicts with diplomatic priorities and the prioritization of tourism, commerce, and cultural exchange over thorough screening of foreign nationals. The MRV fees contribute almost 10% of DOS total budget. Strengthening provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act have addressed problems in visa issuances. Supporters of retaining immigrant adjudications in DOJ and visa issuances in DOS argue that each department brings specialized functions. The \"dual check\" system by INS and Consular Affairs provides greater security in determining whether an alien enters the United States. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, introduced as H.R. 5005, aimed to transfer all functions of INS to the newly created DHS. Some argued that failures in intelligence gathering, not lax immigration enforcement, enabled terrorists to obtain visas. Concerns were raised about DHS potentially prioritizing more generous immigration elements over restrictive ones. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, H.R. 5005, aimed to transfer INS functions to the newly created DHS. The House Committees approved language on visa issuances, retaining DOS's administrative role but addressing policy and security concerns. The House Judiciary Committee proposed placing INS adjudication responsibilities under a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services at DOJ. The House Select Committee on Homeland Security approved language on immigrant processing and visa issuances in H.R. 5005, clarifying the Secretary of DHS's authority to issue regulations and assign staff to consular posts abroad. It also expanded the exclusion authority of the Secretary of State for foreign policy and security interests of the U.S. Amendments reformed grounds for exclusion and clarified consular officers' decisions are not reviewable. Only one immigration-related amendment was considered during the floor debate on H.R. 5005, which aimed to move the consular visa function to DHS but failed. H.R. 5005 was passed on July 26, 2002. The National Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002 included immigration enforcement functions but did not transfer other immigration services and visa issuance functions. Representative Mac Thornberry sponsored a bill similar to S. 2452 that would have created a homeland security department. H.R. 4660, a bill similar to S. 2452, aimed to create a homeland security department without transferring immigration adjudications and visa issuances functions. The Senate Government Reform Committee introduced a substitute for S. 2452, known as S.Amdt. 4471, which differed on immigration issues from H.R. 5005. S.Amdt. 4471 proposed transferring INS to a new DHS with two bureaus under a Directorate of Immigration Affairs. It also granted the Secretary of DHS authority over visa policy, with the option to delegate to the Secretary of State. The House passed H.R. 5710 as a compromise bill to establish a Department of Homeland Security, which included provisions for the Secretary of DHS to issue regulations regarding visa issuances and delegate authority to the Secretary of State. It also transferred all of INS to two new bureaus in DHS. H.R. 5710 transferred INS to two new bureaus in DHS: the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Bureau of Border Security. The Senate passed a similar language amendment to H.R. 5005, which was signed into law as P.L. 107-296 on November 25, 2002. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted visa and immigration inspection failures contributing to the terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized failures in visa and immigration inspections that contributed to the terrorist attacks. It contended that there were missed opportunities to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities, including known operatives with fraudulent passports and suspicious indicators of extremism. Border security was not seen as a national security concern before 9/11, leading to a lack of collaboration between agencies in counterterrorism efforts. The report made urgent recommendations for implementing legislative provisions. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted failures in visa and immigration inspections that contributed to the terrorist attacks. Urgent recommendations were made to implement legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control. Specific suggestions included targeting terrorist travel, integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger network of screening points, and completing a biometric entry-exit screening system. The 9/11 Commission report emphasized the need for a biometric entry-exit screening system to prevent terrorists from entering the country. Legislation implementing these recommendations was passed in the 108th Congress, with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 incorporating some immigration provisions. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, signed on December 17, included provisions to expand terror-related grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, deport aliens who received military training from terrorist organizations, and enhance technologies for detecting terrorist indicators on travel documents. Additionally, it established an Office of Visa and Passport Security and trained consular officers in detecting terrorist travel patterns. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established an Office of Visa and Passport Security to target fraudulent production, distribution, and use of visas and passports. It also increased the number of consular officers and assigned anti-fraud specialists to high-risk posts. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established an Office of Visa and Passport Security to combat visa and passport fraud. It also increased consular officers by 150 annually from FY2006 to FY2009 and provided training to detect terrorist indicators and fraudulent documents."
