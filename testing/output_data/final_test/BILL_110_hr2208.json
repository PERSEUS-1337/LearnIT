The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes provisions for standby loans for qualifying coal-to-liquids projects, with definitions for terms like cap price, full term, and market price specified in the agreement. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes provisions for standby loans for qualifying coal-to-liquids projects, with definitions for terms like cap price, minimum price, output, and primary term specified in the agreement. The primary term is the initial term of the agreement, not exceeding 20 years or 75% of the projected useful life of the project. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides standby loans for qualifying coal-to-liquids projects, with definitions for terms like cap price, minimum price, output, and primary term specified in the agreement. The primary term is the initial term of the agreement, not exceeding 20 years or 75% of the projected useful life of the project. A qualifying CTL project involves converting coal or petroleum refinery waste products into transportation fuels while capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide produced in the process. The applicant's dioxide sequestration plan, certified by the Administrator of the EPA, produces fuel with low carbon emissions compared to traditional petroleum facilities. Standby loan agreements may be entered into with qualifying CTL projects. The Secretary will make a direct loan to qualifying CTL projects with set cap and minimum prices. Disbursements will occur when market prices fall below the minimum price during the primary term of the agreement. The Secretary will establish terms for loan repayments for CTL projects, based on market price and output, with limitations on deferring repayment obligations in case of market price fluctuations. During the primary term of the agreement, the project must meet scheduled repayment obligations and deferred repayment obligations based on market price and output, with a cap on the amount payable if market price exceeds the cap price. Interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid obligations. The Secretary may enter into a profit-sharing agreement with the project at the time of executing the standby loan agreement. If the market price exceeds the cap price in a quarter, a profit-sharing payment will be made based on the excess market price multiplied by the project's output, minus any loan repayments made. Compliance with the federal credit reform act is required. The Secretary may enter into a profit-sharing agreement with the project at the time of executing the standby loan agreement. Compliance with the federal credit reform act is required, including upfront payment of the cost of the loan and minimization of risk to the government. The Management and Budget must consider historical volatility in oil prices when determining minimum and cap prices. Payments and profit-sharing will impact the cost to the Federal Government under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Federal Government's cost for standby loans is determined under specific conditions. Projects receiving a loan under this subsection cannot receive a Federal loan guarantee simultaneously. Subrogation, fees, and full faith and credit provisions apply to standby loans to the same extent as loan guarantees."
