    "content": "The Act titled \"United States-Republic of Korea Defense Cooperation Improvement Act of 2007\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. Congress finds that close cooperation in defense between the United States and the Republic of Korea is in the national security interest of the United States. The Republic of Korea is a Major Non-NATO Ally and a significant purchaser of US defense articles, totaling $6.9 billion in the last 10 years. Purchases of US defense items enhance interoperability between the two countries' military forces. Congress has enacted defense cooperation arrangements for the Republic of Korea, enhancing defense ties and ensuring favorable consideration for acquisitions of weapons systems. Enhanced support for defense cooperation with the Republic of Korea is crucial for US national security, including creating a status in law similar to NATO countries for consideration of foreign military sales to South Korea. The sense of Congress is that quick consideration of certifications for defense sales to South Korea is in line with US security interests and world peace. Amendments to the Arms Export Control Act are also proposed. Amendments to the Arms Export Control Act include inserting \"the Republic of Korea\" in various subsections, emphasizing its importance in defense sales alongside other countries like Japan and Australia.
