The Securities Investor Protection Act is amended to increase the cash protection limit from $100,000 to $250,000, with adjustments for inflation every 5 years. The Board of Directors of SIPC will consider factors and prescribe an inflation-adjusted increase in the standard maximum cash advance amount for customer claims based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index. The standard maximum cash advance amount is adjusted annually based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index. The Department of Commerce publishes the values used for the calculation, which are rounded down to the nearest $10,000 if not a multiple of $10,000. The Commission publishes the adjusted amount in the Federal Register, and SIPC submits a report to Congress containing the calculated amount. The Securities Investor Protection Act allows for an increase in the standard maximum cash advance amount, which takes effect on January 1 of the following year. The Board of Directors of SIPC considers various factors, including the state of the fund and economic conditions, when determining the increase. Additionally, the Act allows for an increase in the SIPC line of credit with the Department of Treasury. The Securities Investor Protection Act is amended to change the maximum cash advance amount to the lesser of $2,500,000,000 or the target amount specified in the SIPC Fund's bylaws.
