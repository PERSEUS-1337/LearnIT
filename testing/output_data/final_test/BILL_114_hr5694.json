    "content": "The \"Senior Citizen Protection Act of 2016\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a provision for a model elder abuse registry. The Attorney General will establish guidelines for States to create elder abuse registries within one year of the Act's enactment. The guidelines will specify who should be included on the registry and what information should be provided for each individual, such as the circumstances and type of abuse committed. The guidelines for elder abuse registries include specifying who should be included, the type of abuse committed, the relationship to the victim, notification to individuals on the registry, appeal process, duration of placement, removal process, and public accessibility. The Attorney General will consult with relevant entities to develop guidelines for elder abuse registries, ensuring they are searchable on the Internet. The Attorney General may provide grants to States for establishing elder abuse registries. States can apply for grants to create registries and must use the funds to establish a registry and enact legislation requiring healthcare providers to check the registry before hiring staff. Additionally, there is a provision for a National Elder Abuse Registry. The Attorney General will establish a national database of State elder abuse registries that comply with guidelines. The Act defines abuse as knowingly causing harm or deprivation of necessary goods/services to an elder. A caregiver is someone responsible for an elder's care, whether compensated or not. An elder is defined as an individual aged 60 or older, and elder abuse includes neglect, mistreatment, or exploitation. The term \"exploitation\" in elder abuse refers to fraudulent or illegal acts that benefit the perpetrator at the expense of the elder's resources. A \"fiduciary\" is a person or entity legally responsible for making decisions for another's benefit, acting in good faith and fairness. An executor, agent under a financial power of attorney, or representative payee can be considered neglectful if they fail to provide necessary goods or services for an elder's health and safety. Mistreatment includes inappropriate medication use, isolation, or physical/chemical restraints. The term \"State\" refers to any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia."
