The Act is titled the \"Special Care Dentistry Act of 2011\" and highlights findings regarding the impact of oral diseases on vulnerable populations, including low-income elderly, individuals with disabilities, and racial and ethnic minority groups. The burden of oral problems is extensive and can have severe consequences, with associations between oral infections and other health issues. Providing oral health benefits under Medicaid to aged, blind, or disabled individuals can prevent health problems like diabetes and heart disease. Despite these populations making up 28% of Medicaid enrollees, they consume 72% of the budget due to high medical costs. Dental benefits are often not covered for these groups, leading to unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In 2003, only 6 states provided basic oral health services to adult aged, blind, and disabled Medicaid recipients. Lack of Medicaid coverage leads to infected mouths with no access to dental care. Additional federal investment is needed to cover dental office overhead costs and improve oral health services for these vulnerable populations. Investments are needed for an oral health initiative to reduce disparities and improve oral health for vulnerable adults, ensuring they receive necessary benefits. The Medicaid program will now provide oral health services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals under a new section added to Title XIX of the Social Security Act. The Medicaid program will now offer oral health coverage for aged, blind, or disabled individuals through a separate State adult dental program, ensuring services are equivalent to those provided to children and include age-appropriate care. Services must be provided at intervals to detect potential illnesses or conditions, meeting reasonable dental practice standards. Aged, blind, or disabled individuals eligible for medical assistance under specific criteria are considered for coverage under the Medicaid program, meeting certain eligibility requirements without regard to income or resources for receiving supplemental security income benefits. The State must provide transportation for aged, blind, or disabled individuals to access oral health services as part of the Medicaid program. Oral health services include relief of pain and infections. The Medicaid program covers a range of dental services including pain relief, tooth restoration, periodontal treatment, preventive care, surgical evaluations, denture care, house calls, anesthesia, and behavior management. Long term care facilities are defined as nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and board and care facilities. The term 'house call' in Medicaid refers to delivering dental services in long term care facilities to overcome mobility and transportation barriers. 'Behavior management' in Medicaid refers to necessary services. In Medicaid, 'behavior management' refers to services needed for physical or behavioral impairment. Amendments include changing \"dental\" to \"oral health\" and making oral health services available to aged, blind, or disabled individuals. The Medicaid program includes provisions for aged, blind, or disabled individuals to receive oral health services, ensuring availability, provision upon request, arranging corrective treatment, and reporting to the Secretary. The Medicaid program requires reporting to the Secretary on oral health services provided to aged, blind, or disabled individuals, including the number of individuals receiving services and referrals for corrective treatment. The Medicaid program requires reporting on oral health services provided to aged, blind, or disabled individuals, including referrals for corrective treatment, preventive, surgical, restorative, and other oral health services needed and provided. Services are disaggregated into emergency, preventive, surgical, restorative, and periodontal categories. The Medicaid program now includes coverage for oral health services such as periodontal, endodontic, and prosthodontic care for aged, blind, or disabled individuals in nursing facilities. Federal funding has been increased to cover these services for this population. Increased FMAP for Medical Assistance for Aged, Blind, and Disabled Individuals to 100 percent. Effective date for amendments is October 1, 2011, with allowance for state plan delays. The Social Security Act requires State legislation for the plan to meet additional requirements imposed by amendments. State plans won't fail to comply solely for not meeting these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session."
