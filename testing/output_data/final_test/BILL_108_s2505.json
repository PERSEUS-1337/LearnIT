The Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry, which has raised concerns about too much consolidation in some local radio markets. A commitment to localism in radio operations, programming, and content could enhance radio listening. Despite efforts by local communities to launch radio stations, limited spectrum availability and high costs hinder their establishment. In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio station was over $2.5 million. In 2000, the FCC introduced low power FM (LPFM) to promote community-oriented radio broadcasting and provide opportunities for local groups to offer programming tailored to local needs. In 2000, the FCC introduced low power FM (LPFM) to promote community-oriented radio broadcasting. Small rural broadcasters were concerned about interference complaints, so a simple process was created to address them. Congress delayed full implementation of LPFM until an independent engineering study was completed to address concerns about interference in the FM band. This delay prevented millions of Americans from having a locally operated, community-based radio station. Approximately 300 LPFM stations are currently on the air, run by various local organizations such as government agencies, schools, religious groups, and environmental organizations. After a 2-year study costing $2,193,343, concerns about interference were found to be unsubstantiated. SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PRIOR LAW.\n\nSection 632 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 is repealed.\n\nSEC. 3. MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission will modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF RADIO READING SERVICES.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission will retain rules that provide third-adjacent channel protection for full-power non-commercial FM stations broadcasting radio reading services via a subcarrier frequency from potential low-power FM station interference.\n\nSEC. 5. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES. The Federal Communications Commission will retain rules for third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations in populated States. The FCC will evaluate the impact of translator licensing on low power and full power radio stations to promote opportunities for local low power stations while protecting full power stations from interference."
