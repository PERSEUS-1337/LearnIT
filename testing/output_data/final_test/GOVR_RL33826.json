    "content": "In 1992, nations signed the UNFCCC to address concerns about increasing greenhouse gases. The treaty included voluntary pledges to reduce emissions and report progress at annual COP meetings. In 1995, parties to the UNFCCC decided to move beyond voluntary measures and enter into legally binding commitments to address the impact of human activities on global climate systems. Negotiations began on a protocol to establish legally binding limitations or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on developed countries listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol established that developed countries, known as Annex I countries, have a responsibility to take the first steps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to their historical contributions and economic capabilities. This principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" guides climate negotiations. The Kyoto Protocol, completed in late 1997, mandates emissions reductions for major greenhouse gases by Annex I countries. Each country has individual targets based on their situations. The United States signed but Senate ratification is needed for it to take effect. The Senate objected to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, and President Clinton did not submit it for ratification. President George W. Bush rejected the Protocol in 2001, leading to the US not participating in negotiations. The Protocol entered into force in 2005 with 175 nations ratifying it. The US, not being a party to the Protocol, is not bound by its terms. Negotiations continued after the 1997 treaty was finalized to establish detailed rules for the Kyoto Protocol. The annual meetings are now referred to as COP/MOP meetings, with the US participating in COP discussions but not in Kyoto-related negotiations. COP-13/MOP-3 convened in Bali, Indonesia in December 2007. In December 2007, COP-13/MOP-3 met in Bali, Indonesia to formulate an agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. The negotiations aimed to address the challenge of climate change, with the Bali Action Plan outlining considerations for developing and developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol requires all Parties to contribute to scientific research and monitoring of climate change and greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol requires all Parties to contribute to scientific research and monitoring of climate change and greenhouse gases. Developing countries are committed to improving local emission factors, promoting environmentally sound technologies, and conducting national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions. The Protocol recognizes the low per capita greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and their need for increased energy use. Developing countries are not bound by binding requirements under the Protocol, with commitments in Article 10 considered voluntary. The Kyoto Protocol focuses on legally binding emissions reductions for Annex I countries, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. Parties are obligated to ensure their emissions do not exceed assigned amounts in Annex B. The Kyoto Protocol requires Annex I countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions collectively by 5% below 1990 levels. The agreement lists 39 nations, including the United States and the European Union, with varying reduction targets. The United States committed to a 7% reduction below 1990 levels for major greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol requires Annex I countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions collectively by 5% below 1990 levels. Two unresolved issues from the 1997 Kyoto discussions are emissions trading and carbon sequestration counting towards emission reductions. Developed countries have flexibility mechanisms under the Protocol for reducing emissions. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries have emissions \"budgets\" for the compliance period 2008-2012 based on their 1990 or 1995 levels. Emissions trading allows countries to purchase credits from others who exceed their limits, incentivizing cost-effective emissions reductions. This scheme benefits both sellers and buyers by lowering costs. The Kyoto Protocol allows developed countries to trade emissions credits to meet their reduction commitments. This \"cap-and-trade\" program is restricted to Annex 1 parties, which are developed countries. The largest scheme under the Protocol is the EU's Emissions Trading system. The EU-ETS is a key part of the EU's efforts to meet Kyoto Protocol obligations, covering energy-intensive facilities in 27 EU Member countries. It includes oil refineries, powerplants over 20 megawatts, coke ovens, iron and steel plants, cement, glass, and pulp and paper installations. Covered entities emit 45% of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions. The trading program does not cover non-CO2 greenhouse gases, which make up 20% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. The first trading period started in 2005, with subsequent periods planned for 2008 and 2013 under the Kyoto Protocol. The CDM is a mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol that allows Annex 1 countries to receive Certified Emissions Reduction credits for reductions achieved in non-Annex 1 countries. These credits can be used to meet emission caps. The process is overseen by a CDM Executive Board, ensuring that CERs represent additional reductions. China, India, and Brazil were major players in this scheme according to Point Carbon in 2005. In 2005, China, India, and Brazil accounted for 63% of projects at the Project Design Document stage. China's high volume of CDM contracts is mainly from HFC-23 reduction projects. JI allows Annex 1 countries to receive ERUs from joint projects. There are two tracks under JI - Track 1 is simplified, while Track 2 mirrors the CDM process. ERUs issued under JI must show additional reductions. In 2005, CDM projects accounted for 93% of tonnage transacted, compared to 28 MMt for JI projects. One contentious issue in Kyoto Protocol negotiations is how to give credit for carbon sinks like forests and land use changes. This falls under \"Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry\" (LULUCF). The Kyoto Protocol negotiations in 2005 focused on giving credit for carbon sinks such as forests and land use changes, known as \"Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry\" (LULUCF). Specific activities like afforestation, reforestation, deforestation prevention, and others were deemed eligible for use as offsets against Protocol obligations. Country-specific limits were set for each category of sinks activities, with ongoing discussions on how carbon absorbed in sinks will count towards a nation's obligations. Achieving agreement on compliance and penalties for non-compliance by Annex B Protocol parties was a challenging process during the Kyoto Protocol negotiations. The Marrakech accords at the COP-7 meeting in 2001 resolved controversial issues, including the establishment of a Compliance Committee with a penalty of 30% for falling short of emissions targets in the first commitment period. The Kyoto Protocol established a Compliance Committee with two branches: the Facilitative Branch provides advice and assistance, while the Enforcement Branch applies consequences for non-compliance. A Protocol rulebook outlines procedures for addressing non-compliance cases and reviewing eligibility for financial mechanisms. Compliance includes meeting emissions reductions commitments and preparing GHG inventories, with penalties for failing emissions targets during the commitment period. At COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal, parties to the Kyoto Protocol discussed difficulties in achieving emissions reductions targets. The United States and developing countries resisted negotiating new commitments for the post-Kyoto period. A compromise was reached to consider next steps involving major emitters like the United States, China, and India. A compromise was reached at COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal to consider next steps for developed country parties in the Post-Kyoto period. An \"Ad hoc Working Group\" was established under the Protocol, while a non-binding \"dialogue on long-term cooperation\" was launched under the UNFCCC involving the United States and all parties. The dialogue aims to support existing commitments, voluntary actions by developing countries, and the development of new commitments. The discussions at COP-12/MOP-2 in Nairobi in 2006 focused on sustainable development, adaptation, technology transfer, and market-based opportunities related to climate change. The Ad hoc Working Group (AWG) and the Dialogue were involved in workshops and discussions to formulate a work program for future meetings. The meeting also included a review of the Protocol's effectiveness. The COP/MOP meetings in 2006 and 2007 addressed sustainable development, adaptation, technology transfer, and market-based opportunities related to climate change. The review process for future commitments was a controversial issue, with little progress made at COP/MOP. The Bali negotiations in 2007 were seen as crucial for addressing global warming and its impacts, with the Kyoto Protocol recognized as a first step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol set a timetable for reviewing progress and considering next steps after 2012. Developing countries were hesitant to make binding commitments on greenhouse gas limitations. The challenge at the COP/MOP meeting in Bali and subsequent negotiations is to find agreement on future measures for both developed and developing nations. The challenge at the COP/MOP meeting in Bali and subsequent negotiations is to find agreement on future measures for both developed and developing nations, including the nature of commitments acceptable to all major players. Negotiations need to be completed by the end of 2009, with observers noting the tight timeframe due to the current U.S. administration's stance on mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Negotiations in Bali in December 2007 focused on key elements for a \"Bali road map\" including mitigation of climate change, adaptation, financial assistance, and technology development. Future talks will aim for legally binding commitments from all parties, considering differing national circumstances and abilities. The absence of U.S. commitment may hinder major countries from making binding commitments. Negotiations in Bali, Indonesia in December 2007 extended beyond the original end date to reach consensus on the \"Bali Action Plan.\" The final agreement sets a negotiating framework for developed and developing countries to address mitigation measures for greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation, financial support, and technology transfer. Key elements include the need for deep cuts in global emissions to avoid dangerous climate change. The Bali Action Plan, established in December 2007, emphasized the urgency to address climate change and set a negotiating framework for developed and developing countries. A two-track negotiating process was launched, including the establishment of an Ad hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC. This allowed for negotiations to include developing countries and address specific limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The Bali Action Plan, established in December 2007, emphasized the urgency to address climate change and set a negotiating framework for developed and developing countries. A two-track negotiating process was launched, including the establishment of an Ad hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC. This allowed for negotiations to include developing countries and address specific limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The shared vision for cooperative action includes a long-term global goal for emission reductions, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Mitigation measures for developing countries are also being considered. The negotiations under the Bali Action Plan faced controversy over mitigation actions for developed and developing countries. Developing countries objected to language regarding nationally appropriate mitigation actions, leading to a proposed reversal of clauses by India. This nearly caused a breakdown in negotiations on the final day in Bali. The United States opposed India's proposed language on mitigation actions, almost causing negotiations to break down. After objections and booing, the adopted phrase includes measures for developing countries supported by technology, financing, and capacity building. Developed countries' actions should also be measurable, reportable, and verifiable. Developing countries reassured their commitment to consider mitigation actions. The United States raised concerns about the ambiguity in the language adopted for mitigation actions by developing countries in future negotiations. The decision to include reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the post-Bali negotiations was seen as a positive step by many participants. Negotiations following Bali are seen as a positive step, opening discussions on incentives for developing countries to reduce deforestation. Mitigation considerations include policy approaches, positive incentives, conservation, and forest carbon stocks. Other elements in the action plan include adaptation considerations, international support, risk management, disaster reduction, and strengthening the role of the Convention. The decision mandates that the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the UNFCCC completes its work in 2009 and presents the outcome to the 15th COP/MOP in Copenhagen. Observers expect the working groups under the Kyoto Protocol and UNFCCC to eventually connect their considerations. Making this linkage has not been directly addressed. The UNFCCC working groups met in Bangkok, Thailand to discuss various issues and agreed on a work program for 2009. Negotiations involved different country approaches and ended positively. Future meetings are scheduled in Bonn, Germany and Accra, Ghana, with a final meeting in Poznan, Poland in December. Groups will meet concurrently with the COP-14/MOP-4 meeting in Poznan, Poland, December 1 - 12, 2008. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are assessing their ability to meet future commitments post-2012, facing challenges due to recent increases in emissions. Compliance with the Kyoto Protocol is focused on Europe, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan. The majority of Annex 1 signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, including Europe, are under pressure to comply with their commitments. The European Commission has reviewed and conditionally approved all Member countries' National Allocation Plans. The focus is on the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to ensure smooth Kyoto compliance, with improvements in emissions data and project-based development. The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has made progress in improving emissions data, promoting the Kyoto Protocol's project-based mechanisms, and influencing corporate behavior. However, issues like allocation schemes and new entrant reserves remain contentious as the ETS moves into its Kyoto phase. The EU is committed to meeting its Kyoto Protocol targets and is developing post-2012 goals. The European Environment Agency (EEA) projected that 15 EU Members would collectively meet their GHG reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, although seven countries would not meet their individual targets. The EEA estimated that all 10 new Member countries and non-EU countries Iceland and Switzerland would meet their obligations, while Liechtenstein and Norway would not. The EC agreed to link the ETS with emission trading systems in Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. The Russian Federation is expected to meet its obligations, and other major Kyoto signatories include New Zealand, Canada, and Japan. New Zealand, Canada, and Japan are facing challenges in meeting their Kyoto Protocol obligations. New Zealand implemented an emission trading scheme in 2008 but may not comply with its obligations. Canada has admitted it cannot meet its targets and has set alternative goals. Japan is also struggling to meet its obligations and is seeking credits from flexibility mechanisms. Compliance with Kyoto is not necessarily threatened by emissions growth in some countries due to these mechanisms. Potential compliance with Kyoto is not necessarily threatened by emissions growth in some countries, as surplus credits from economies in transition can be purchased to offset deficits. Russia, Ukraine, and other eastern European countries are expected to have sufficient surplus credits for countries with deficits to purchase. This surplus does not include anticipated credits from CDM and JI projects, which could provide additional credits. The potential for additional credits from sources like China is substantial, despite risks such as projects not being built or certified. There are potential challenges to compliance, including the requirement that credits from emissions trading and joint implementation be supplemental to domestic actions. The Conference of Parties decided not to place a quantitative limit on these mechanisms but emphasized the need for them to complement domestic actions. The use of the mechanism shall be supplemental to domestic action, with no finalized means of determining the significance of domestic actions. Some countries, like Japan, are expected to heavily rely on the mechanisms. Volatility in credit markets poses challenges for emissions reduction programs. The United States signed the 1997 Kyoto Protocol but did not submit it for approval. The United States did not submit the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for approval, following a non-binding resolution that expressed concerns about obligations for developing countries and potential harm to the U.S. economy. President George W. Bush rejected the Protocol in 2001, leading to the U.S. not formally participating in further negotiations. Meetings to negotiate the Protocol's rules occurred annually, with the U.S. attending but not formally participating. Regaining U.S. participation and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol remains uncertain. President Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, leading to the U.S. not formally participating. The goal is to reduce the net \"greenhouse gas intensity\" of the U.S. economy by 18% over the next 10 years through voluntary action, aiming for efficiency. The administration's goal is to reduce emissions per GDP from 183 to 151 metric tons by 2012 through voluntary action. If the goal is not met, additional measures may be implemented. President Bush announced a goal to halt U.S. greenhouse gas emissions growth by 2025. The U.S. is engaged in scientific research and international cooperation on climate change. The United States is involved in international activities to support voluntary action on climate change, including initiatives like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate and Major Economies Meetings on Energy Security and Environment. The formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership in 2005 aimed to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in six nations, including the US, China, and others. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate included major emitters like the United States, China, and India, focusing on technology development and reducing greenhouse gas intensity voluntarily. Concerns were raised about whether this partnership would hinder mandatory emissions commitments in the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate aims to create a voluntary framework for international cooperation on technology development and reducing greenhouse gas intensity. Task forces were established for eight industrial sectors to review status, set objectives, and recommend actions. Task force reports, called Action Plans, are now available for access. The Task Force Action Plans, part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, have been completed and are accessible on the partnership website. These plans outline projects such as sectoral assessments, best practices, capacity building, and technology research. Questions remain about funding, investment, and the involvement of developing country partners like China and India in addition to those receiving outside funding. The largest developing country emitters of greenhouse gases, China and India, may view the parallel effort as complementary to the Kyoto Protocol. President Bush announced a meeting in Washington for major economies on Energy Security and Climate Change to develop a new Post-2012 framework on climate change by the end of 2008. This initiative could impact Kyoto Protocol negotiations. The White House fact sheet indicated that the proposal aims to advance common interests between developed countries and major emerging economies in dealing with climate change. President Bush announced a meeting in September 2007 for major economies to discuss a new framework on climate change, inviting various countries and organizations to participate. President Bush invited heads of governments from Russia, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, and the United Nations to collaborate on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy security. The proposed meetings aimed to establish a detailed contribution for a new global framework by the end of 2008, leading to a global agreement under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2009. This initiative was seen as potentially undermining G-8 discussions on climate change. The Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change in September 2007 aimed to integrate high-level dialogues into UNFCCC negotiations. Attendees welcomed the acknowledgment by the United States of climate change as a global problem and endorsed the U.N. process for international action on climate change. The discussions emphasized that any long-term goal is aspirational. The discussions at the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change in September 2007 emphasized the rejection of mandatory limits in favor of \"aspirational goals.\" Follow-on meetings were held in Honolulu and Paris. In addition, the United Nations Security Council held its first-ever debate on the relationship between climate change, energy, peace, and security in April 2007. In April, the UN Security Council discussed climate change as a security issue, with some delegations supporting the need to address it. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon prioritized climate change on the UN agenda. The G-8 leaders met in June 2007 in Germany to discuss climate change, seen as crucial for post-Kyoto negotiations. European nations faced resistance from the US on proposed greenhouse gas emission reductions. The G-8 Summit in June 2007 proposed a framework for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and establishing a global GHG trading market. The final declaration was seen as a compromise and a step in the right direction by the US and G-8 leaders, committing to taking strong action to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations and halving global emissions by 2050. The G-8 Summit in June 2007 proposed halving global emissions by 2050, considering decisions by the EU, Canada, and Japan. It emphasized the need to address climate change, energy security, economic growth, and sustainable development. The statement recognized the UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of new approaches for contributions by all countries. It highlighted the UN climate process as the appropriate forum for negotiating global action on climate change. At the U.N. General Assembly meeting on September 24, 2007, a high-level heads of state and ministerial meeting on climate change was held. The meeting included statements from many members emphasizing the importance of addressing climate change. President Bush did not speak at the meeting but attended a dinner afterward. The United States offered to host a meeting later in the year to engage major energy-consuming and greenhouse gas-emitting countries in combating climate change."
