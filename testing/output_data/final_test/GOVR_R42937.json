    "content": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing challenges due to the increasing number of inmates. These challenges include increased use of double and triple bunking, waiting lists for education and drug treatment programs, limited work opportunities, crowded visiting rooms, and higher inmate-to-staff ratios. The growing federal prison population is also straining BOP's infrastructure. The federal prison population growth is straining BOP's infrastructure and increasing maintenance costs. BOP's budget has grown significantly from $330 million in FY1980 to $7.479 billion in FY2016, consuming a larger share of DOJ's appropriations. This could potentially impact funding for other DOJ initiatives. The federal prison system is overcrowded and aging, leading to staffing issues. Congress could address the growing inmate population by expanding prison capacity, investing in rehabilitation programs, or utilizing private correctional facilities. Increasing funding for the Bureau of Prisons to expand capacity is a straightforward approach to managing the rising number of federal inmates. The federal prison system is overcrowded and aging, leading to staffing issues. Congress could address the growing inmate population by appropriating more funding for BOP to expand prison capacity, update facilities, and hire staff. However, there is concern that investing in a large-scale expansion may not be necessary if the prison population continues to decrease. If the federal prison system's capacity increases and the population decreases, older facilities could be closed. Expanding capacity would require more maintenance and higher staff-to-inmate ratios. Critics argue that this does not address the population growth since the 1980s and could worsen the rising costs. Alternatives to reduce the population include prosecuting fewer people, early release, diversion programs, and community supervision. A review of rehabilitative programs suggests they are effective at reducing recidivism, potentially helping to manage the increasing federal prison population. The Bureau of Prisons offers various programs such as education and work programs. One way to reduce the federal prison population is by ensuring the Bureau of Prisons has enough resources for rehabilitation programs like education, work programs, substance abuse treatment, and cognitive-behavioral programs. However, there may be efforts to limit funding for these services, potentially hindering the ability to provide necessary programming for inmates. The growing cost of operating the federal prison system has led to discussions about reducing funding for rehabilitative programming and focusing solely on providing for inmates' basic needs and maintaining adequate staffing for security. However, cutting programming could lead to increased inmate idleness and misconduct, as well as hinder opportunities for early release through successful completion of substance abuse treatment programs. There is potential for long-term cost savings through effective rehabilitation programs, as shown by research from the Washington State Institute for Public Policy. Rehabilitation programs can lead to cost savings for the Bureau of Prisons. Policymakers may need to consider increasing resources for these programs to reduce recidivism among federal offenders, which could impact the demand for prisons and inmate services. The Bureau of Prisons may need increased resources for inmate programs and services, even if the federal prison population growth slows. Congress could consider housing more federal inmates in private facilities to reduce crowding and costs. The number of inmates in contract facilities, especially Residential Reentry Centers, has been increasing since the 1980s, mostly for low security, non-citizen offenders. The debate over housing inmates in private correctional facilities focuses on cost and service quality. Evaluations of the Taft Correctional Institution (TCI) found it cheaper to operate than comparable BOP facilities, but there are differing opinions on the actual savings. The cost savings of operating TCI as a private institution are debated due to differing conclusions based on economies of scale and per diem rate calculations. TCI had a lower assault rate than expected, similar to other BOP facilities, but higher drug use among inmates. TCI also had two escapes compared to BOP's three escapes from over 100 facilities. Research on privatizing correctional systems found that cost savings and service quality are questionable. Regardless of public or private operation, factors like economies of scale, prison age, and security level impact daily costs. Privatization may offer modest savings, but overall, it is unlikely to significantly reduce state correctional budgets. The research on privatizing correctional systems found that neither cost savings nor improvements in quality are guaranteed compared to publicly managed prisons. Placing more inmates in private facilities could help alleviate overcrowding in federal prisons without the need for large-scale expansions. Contracting for additional bedspace instead of building new prisons could provide Congress with flexibility to reduce capacity if the federal prison population decreases. However, research suggests that moving federal prisoners to private prisons may not control rising costs. Medium and high security facilities are the most crowded, and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is hesitant to place these inmates in private facilities. Congress should consider placing more federal prisoners in private custody, which would reduce BOP oversight. Policymakers should also review changes in federal criminal justice policy over the past three decades, which have led to more offenders being sent to federal prisons. The increasing number of offenders sent to federal prisons is partly attributed to mandatory minimum penalties, leading to a growing federal prison population. Repealing some or all mandatory minimum penalties could help manage this growth by allowing for more individualized sentencing using federal sentencing guidelines. Opponents argue that mandatory minimum penalties are too harsh and should be replaced with a more nuanced approach to sentencing. Opponents argue that mandatory minimum penalties are too broad and high, leading to sentence inflation. Repealing some penalties could reduce federal prison time. Proponents believe Congress should set minimums post-Booker ruling. The sentencing guidelines are advisory, but Congress should set minimum penalties to limit judicial discretion and prevent sentencing disparities. Mandatory minimum penalties promote fairness, transparency, and integrity in sentencing. Repealing these penalties would relinquish control over inmate sentencing. States implemented alternatives to incarceration in the 1980s. In the 1980s, states introduced alternatives to incarceration to address prison overcrowding and a rise in convicted offenders. These alternatives provided options between probation and imprisonment, such as house arrest, electronic monitoring, and community service, offering a middle ground for punishment. These programs offer more accountability and restraint than traditional probation, with some also providing additional treatment options. Intensive supervision and electronic monitoring programs offer more accountability and treatment options for offenders, but studies show no significant difference in recidivism rates compared to traditional probation. However, increased surveillance may lead to more violations being detected, potentially increasing the number of incarcerated individuals for technical violations. The research on intensive supervision programs suggests that increased surveillance may lead to more offenders being caught, potentially skewing the comparison of criminality levels between treatment and control groups. Some evaluations show that inmates in these programs receiving treatment are less likely to be arrested, prompting consideration for alternative ways to manage minor offenders without prison sentences. Congress could explore amending penalties for certain offenses to provide more options for defendants. One option Congress could consider is amending penalties for certain offenses to allow more defendants to be placed on probation instead of incarceration. The Booker decision made federal sentencing guidelines advisory, potentially impacting the debate on probation placement. Judges can now impose probation unless certain conditions are met, such as the defendant being convicted of a class A or B felony. Data suggest that probationers have a high risk of recidivism, especially in the first year. Advocates argue for front-loaded surveillance and services to reduce recidivism. It is argued that community supervision is cheaper than incarceration, with probation costing $3,909 per probationer annually in FY2014. The average annual cost of probation in FY2014 was $3,909 per probationer, much lower than the $30,621 per inmate for incarceration. Expanding probation as a sentencing option for more offenses could increase costs, but using risk assessment tools to focus on higher-risk offenders and offering evidence-based treatment could help reduce recidivism. Offenders benefit more from programs that combine treatment and surveillance to reduce recidivism. Probation programs with random drug testing and intermediate sanctions for violations are effective. Congress could consider early release for probationers who comply and earned discharge strategies to further reduce recidivism. An earned discharge strategy can reduce recidivism by placing low-risk inmates directly into halfway houses. However, investigations have revealed issues with security, violence, and questionable rehabilitative services in these facilities. The New Jersey Department of Corrections and local sheriffs' departments used halfway houses to reduce prison overcrowding, leading to violent offenders being placed in these facilities. Employees with little training supervised these inmates, causing safety concerns due to high inmate-to-staff ratios. If RRCs are used to reduce federal prison populations, placement should be limited to low-level, non-violent offenders to ensure security. To reduce federal prison populations, the BOP may need to increase oversight of RRCs and provide additional staff for more frequent visits. Policymakers could consider funding a program like the Cooperative Agreement Program to contract with local jails for short-term bedspace. The Cooperative Agreement Program (CAP) could be expanded to secure bedspace for lower-level federal inmates serving short sentences in local jails, which may be more secure than Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs). Congress could also consider placing offenders in RRCs for violating supervised release terms instead of returning them to prison, providing additional bedspace for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Placing short-term inmates in RRCs instead of returning them to prison for supervised release violations could provide additional bedspace for BOP. Offenders with technical violations may be suitable for less secure placement, allowing for monitoring while in the community. There is a level of risk involved in all alternatives to incarceration due to the lower level of control over the individual. Expanding early release options for federal inmates, such as reinstating parole, expanding good time credits, and allowing courts to reduce sentences, could help reduce the federal prison population. Currently, inmates sentenced after November 1, 1987, are not eligible for parole in the federal system. Parole could be a way to release low-risk inmates into the community. Reinstating parole for federal inmates could release low-risk individuals into community supervision. Policymakers need to consider how a parole system would function within the current determinate sentencing structure. Concerns arise about potential arbitrariness and unfairness in sentencing under an indeterminate system. Congress eliminated parole and replaced indeterminate sentencing with sentencing guidelines to limit the discretion of the federal judiciary and executive branch. Reinstating parole could allow for some control over inmate sentences through the U.S. Parole Commission, potentially leading to varying prison terms for similar crimes. Reinstating parole for federal inmates could potentially reduce the prison population, but would require increased resources for the U.S. Parole Commission and Probation office to manage the caseload. Eligibility for parole may be made retroactive to inmates sentenced after November 1, 1987. Research shows that concerns about recidivism among federal inmates released on parole are valid, with high rates of rearrest and conviction for new crimes. Intensive supervision programs have been implemented in some jurisdictions to address this issue, but evidence suggests they do not effectively reduce recidivism. Intensive supervision programs may not reduce recidivism and could potentially increase it by detecting more technical violations. Policymakers should consider evidence-based measures if parole is reinstated to help inmates successfully transition back into the community. This includes using risk assessment tools and providing access to rehabilitative programming for parolees in need. To reduce recidivism among parolees, evidence-based rehabilitative programs should be accessible, intermediate sanctions should be imposed for parole violations, and early release should be considered for compliant parolees. Intensive supervision during the first year of parole is crucial, along with combining supervision with treatment programs. Congress could expand the Bureau of Prisons' authority to grant good time credit to inmates as a potential policy option to address the federal prison population growth. BOP can grant up to 54 days of good time credit per year to inmates serving a sentence of more than one year, based on exemplary behavior and progress towards completing a GED. Non-violent inmates can also have their sentence reduced by up to one year for participating in substance abuse treatment. This approach aims to address federal prison population growth by combining good time credit with evidence-based programs for inmates with specific needs and risks. Expanding good time credit for participation in rehabilitative programs could reduce recidivism and prison costs, but would require additional funding for programs and assessments. Concerns include reducing sentences without court approval and early release before serving a significant portion of the sentence. Some may argue that inmates should serve their full sentence as punishment for their crimes, despite efforts to rehabilitate. Congress could consider granting more good time credit and amending conditions for sentence reduction. The USSC outlined \"extraordinary and compelling reasons\" for sentence reduction, including terminal illness or severe medical conditions that diminish self-care ability in a correctional facility. The USSC outlined \"extraordinary and compelling reasons\" for sentence reduction, such as terminal illness or severe medical conditions that limit self-care ability in a correctional facility. The court can also impose probation or supervised release for the remaining sentence time if a reduction is granted. Critics point out that the program relies on BOP to request sentence reviews, leading to narrow interpretations. The BOP's policy on sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) has been criticized for limiting applications to cases of terminal illness. In August 2013, the policy was revised to include broader circumstances like serious medical conditions, elderly inmates, and family caregiver incapacitation. The BOP's policy on sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) has been expanded to include cases of family caregiver incapacitation or spouse/partner incapacitation. Before submitting a compassionate release request, BOP assesses the safety risk to the community. Congress could consider allowing courts to consider rehabilitation as a reason for sentence reduction, potentially benefiting low-risk inmates. The potential benefits of sentence reduction for low-risk inmates include freeing up bedspace in federal prisons and allowing for supervised release. However, additional resources may be needed to process more applications and monitor inmates on supervised release. Concerns may arise about the courts becoming de facto parole boards due to the elimination of parole in the federal system. Inmates could be released early under a new system, but Congress could require them to serve a certain portion of their sentence first. Judges may have more authority to reduce sentences, leading to concerns about inconsistency. Congress could amend requirements for early release before age 70. Research suggests that older inmates are less likely to commit new crimes, leading to the possibility of releasing elderly inmates before they turn 70. While they may pose a reduced threat to public safety, there could be resistance to early release regardless of age. Congress could also consider other amendments, such as expanding the \"safety valve\" provision to potentially reduce the federal prison population. The defendant may be eligible for reduced sentencing without mandatory minimums for certain drug offenses if specific conditions are met, including having a low criminal history score, no involvement in violence or use of weapons, no harm caused, not being a leader in the offense, and providing truthful information to the government. The safety valve provision allows for reduced sentencing without mandatory minimums for certain drug offenses if specific conditions are met. Congress may consider expanding this provision to apply to defendants facing mandatory minimum sentences for offenses other than drug crimes, allowing judges to sentence less culpable offenders appropriately. One proposal suggests amending current law to allow judges to apply the safety valve provision for less serious offenders with sentencing guideline ranges below mandatory minimum penalties, as long as no death or serious bodily injury occurred and the defendant cooperated with the government. Conditions like no violence or weapon possession would still apply, but as factors for the court to consider. One proposal suggests allowing judges to use the safety valve provision for less serious offenders with guideline ranges below mandatory minimum penalties, as long as certain conditions are met. Judges would need to justify sentencing below the minimum penalty, subject to appellate review. The USSC has integrated many mandatory minimum sentences into sentencing guidelines, potentially making the safety valve provision irrelevant. One solution could be for the USSC to consider, but not necessarily align, guidelines with mandatory minimum penalties. The federal prison population has grown due to the \"federalization\" of offenses traditionally under state jurisdiction. Policymakers could revise the U.S. Code to focus federal law enforcement on crimes where states lack jurisdiction or where federal involvement is necessary. For example, immigration offenses are solely federal jurisdiction. However, federal government involvement in drug offenses and felonies has increased over the years. The federal prison population has increased due to federalization of offenses traditionally under state jurisdiction. One expert argues that federal drug cases should target international organizations financing criminal activities. States have the capacity to prosecute high-level local drug traffickers. The federal prison population has increased due to federalization of offenses traditionally under state jurisdiction. State and local police and prosecutors outnumber federal agents and prosecutors. State prisons far exceed the capacity of federal prisons. Almost none of the crack [cocaine] dealers in U.S. neighborhoods warrant federal prosecution. Inadequate state laws do not warrant wasting federal resources on serious neighborhood criminals. Scaling back the federal criminal code could reduce the federal prison population by decreasing the number of people prosecuted in federal courts. This policy option may increase the burden on state criminal justice systems. According to the BJS, many state correctional systems are operating at or near capacity, with some at 90% or higher. If the federal government stops prosecuting certain offenses, states may need to expand prisons or choose not to prosecute some crimes. This could have a significant impact on state finances, as state correctional spending has nearly quadrupled in the past two decades. State correctional spending has nearly quadrupled in the past two decades, making it the fasting-growing budget item after Medicaid. Any expansion in correctional expenditures would require cuts to other state services, increased taxes, or issuing bonds due to states typically not being able to run a budget deficit."
