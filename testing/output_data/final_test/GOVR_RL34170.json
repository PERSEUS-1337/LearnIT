    "content": "The Republic of Yemen is strategically located next to Saudi Arabia and the Bab al Mandab strait, a key oil shipping route. U.S. officials have long been concerned about terrorism emanating from Yemen, particularly from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most likely AQ affiliate to target the United States. Yemen has been a target for transnational attacks against the United States by a terrorist group, with unsuccessful attempts in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Saudi Arabia helped disrupt two of these plots. Yemen faces challenges in terrorism, political stability, and economic viability, ranking 154 out of 187 countries in the 2014 United Nations Human Development Index. Poverty has worsened due to population growth, water shortages, political strife, and lack of investment, leading to heavy dependence on food imports. Yemen's dire socio-economic situation has led to a significant portion of the population facing severe food insecurity. The country serves as a transit and destination point for migrants and refugees from Africa and the Arab Gulf states. Thousands of asylum-seekers and economic migrants make the perilous journey to Yemen each year, with many seeking passage to wealthier Gulf monarchies. Expatriate remittances from Yemenis working abroad provide a major boost to the local economy, but tensions have arisen with Saudi Arabia over the deportation of Yemeni workers. Yemen's political transition post-2011 Arab Spring faced challenges as various factions vied for power, leading to instability. The National Dialogue Conference aimed to bring consensus on governance, but armed groups acted as spoilers. By early 2014, key steps in the transition, like drafting a constitution, remained incomplete. After two years of transition, key steps like drafting a constitution and holding a referendum were still pending. Concerns arose that momentum could shift from President Hadi to opponents like former president Saleh and the Houthi allies. The Houthi movement launched a military offensive, culminating in the 2014 takeover of the capital Sana'a and other parts of Yemen. The Houthi movement's battlefield successes in Yemen have shifted the balance of power, challenging outside powers like the United States. They disrupted the political transition orchestrated by the US and Saudi Arabia, taking over the capital and forcing the central government to sign a cease-fire deal. This has sparked internal conflicts and renewed calls for independence in southern Yemen. Southern Yemenis are calling for independence and threatening to secede. AQAP is recruiting Sunni Arabs to fight against the Houthis, whom they see as \"Shia heretics.\" The Houthis face resistance from various groups, including former president Saleh, Sunni tribes in Marib, Saudi Arabia, AQAP, and Islah. The loyalty of Yemeni military brigades is uncertain, with the possibility of some engaging the Houthis or staying neutral. The US has closed its Embassy in anticipation of further unrest. The United States has closed its Embassy in Yemen and relocated government personnel due to domestic unrest. Concerns about the safety of U.S. personnel arose after a shooting incident involving Houthi gunmen. Despite ongoing counterterrorism cooperation, recent political instability has impacted U.S. capabilities. Reports indicate three drone strikes against AQAP targets since President Hadi's resignation. The international community has not recognized recent Houthi declarations. The United States has recognized President Hadi as the legitimate leader of Yemen and urged all parties to adhere to previous agreements. International aid, including grants from Saudi Arabia, has supported Yemen's central government, but Saudi Arabia has suspended payments. If the Houthis continue to control the political process, they may struggle to finance Yemen's national budget, risking economic collapse. Many analysts believe that the recent Houthi-driven crisis in Yemen may benefit the Iranian regime, as Iran backs state and non-state actors in sectarian conflicts throughout the Middle East. Yemeni leaders have claimed that Iran meddles in Yemeni affairs by supporting secessionist movements at odds with Saudi Arabia, with recent U.S. reports detailing increased Iranian activity in Yemen. President Obama noted in a War Powers letter to Congress in January 2013 about a U.S. Navy warship with Yemeni Coast Guard personnel aboard entering Yemen. In January 2013, a U.S. Navy warship with Yemeni Coast Guard personnel aboard entered Yemeni territorial waters to assist in intercepting a vessel suspected of smuggling contraband. Various conventional weapons and explosives of Iranian origin were found on the vessel. Iranian smugglers backed by the Quds Force were reportedly involved in shipping arms to Houthi rebels. In the south, the leader of the Southern Mobility Movement boasted of his movement's willingness to act. The Southern Mobility Movement leader has openly accepted assistance from any regional actor, likely referring to Iran. Hezbollah has provided financial aid and media training to southern Yemeni leaders in Beirut. Analysts compare the Houthis in Yemen to Hezbollah in Lebanon for their state-building aspirations. A Houthi spokesman emphasized their common stance against Israel and the U.S., willing to cooperate with regional actors opposing U.S. designs. Iranian officials have openly supported the Houthis in Yemen, with Ali Akbar Velayati stating Iran's backing for the group. AQAP, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, poses a threat to the U.S. with attempts to target commercial aircraft. AQAP, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, has attempted attacks against the United States, including failed bomb attacks and disrupted plots. They focus on targeting the US as well as seizing territory in Yemen and attacking Saudi Arabia. AQAP, also known as Ansar al Sharia, has been successful in the country's remote southern provinces, particularly in Hadramawt. The group's insurgency thrives in areas with limited government presence and widespread disaffection due to lack of investment. Various factions' interests overlap in the complex political landscape of South Yemen. The complex political landscape of South Yemen sees the overlap of tribes, southern secessionists, local officials, and AQAP militants. Yemenis returning from battlefields seek recruits, posing challenges for the government in countering AQAP. Despite some success in turning local actors against AQAP, eradicating the group entirely remains difficult. AQAP continues to harass government and tribal-allied forces through tactics like car bombings and kidnappings, presenting formidable counterterrorism challenges for the United States. Reports suggest that the United States has expanded covert operations in Yemen to include a broader counterinsurgency effort, with increased airstrikes since 2011. The Administration is cautious about labeling these operations as war and getting involved in Yemeni domestic politics. John Brennan, Director of the CIA, plays a key role in U.S. policy in Yemen. John Brennan, Director of the CIA, has highlighted the challenge of balancing U.S. air operations in Yemen with the need to address terrorist threats on the ground. He emphasized the importance of taking direct action to prevent terrorist attacks and stated that the Obama Administration believes it has legal authority to conduct military operations in Yemen. The Obama Administration believes it has legal authority to conduct military operations against AQAP in Yemen under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. The U.S. military targets AQAP members based on information about their association with al-Qaeda. The AUMF authorizes the use of force against AQAP due to their connections to al-Qa'ida and history of attacks against the US. President Obama sees US counterterrorism policy in Yemen as a model for other countries like Iraq and Syria. In Yemen, President Obama views the government as a committed partner in counterterrorism efforts, without deploying large numbers of US troops. The focus is on developing capacities and creating models to combat terrorism in Syria and Iraq, emphasizing the importance of inclusive political policies. The President's statement on ISIL on September 10, 2014 emphasized a non-combat approach, using air power and support for partner forces to take out terrorists. This strategy aligns with previous efforts in Yemen and Somalia, focusing on protecting America's core interests while mobilizing partners to address broader challenges. Evaluating U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen is crucial for future military operations. The end goals in the fight against Islamist extremism remain unclear, with questions on containment or elimination of the terrorist threat. The current approach has seen success in degrading AQAP's leadership without American casualties, maintaining international support. Yemen's stability and direction are uncertain, but the U.S. wields significant influence. Critics argue that despite U.S. efforts in Yemen, AQAP remains a persistent threat, with the terrorist group evolving into a broader movement. The current approach focuses on targeting leaders rather than defeating the insurgency, leading to concerns about the need for a larger military response. Yemen's internal divisions and socio-economic challenges suggest that U.S. military involvement may be necessary indefinitely to address the enabling environment for extremism. The U.S. military is active in Yemen indefinitely to combat transnational terrorism. The effectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen is difficult to assess due to classified activities and lack of transparency. Evaluating U.S. drone strikes in Yemen is challenging as the costs and benefits are hard to measure. Factors to consider include minimal U.S. civilian casualties and the secrecy surrounding the drone program's effectiveness in achieving counterterrorism objectives. AQAP, formed in 2009 by Yemeni and Saudi militants, has not directly killed U.S. civilians in the continental United States. However, Anwar al Awlaki, an AQAP terrorist, inspired attacks like the Ford Hood mass killing and the Boston bombings. AQAP's \"Inspire\" magazine aims to radicalize homegrown extremists. There have been no reported U.S. military casualties in Yemen since 2009. The Obama Administration's policy in Yemen aims to counter AQAP with minimal military presence to reduce casualties. Despite this, AQAP continues to target American and diplomatic personnel in Yemen, leading to a reduction of U.S. government personnel in the country. U.S. strikes have successfully degraded AQAP's leadership since 2009, but high-value targets remain at large, with rewards offered for information on them. The State's Rewards for Justice Program offers up to $45 million for information on key leaders of AQAP in Yemen. President Hadi allows U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, stating that permission is sought before each operation. Drone strikes are described as a \"necessary evil\" by Yemen's Foreign Minister. In Yemen, drone strikes are seen as a \"necessary evil\" and are coordinated with the Yemeni government. Proponents argue that drone warfare is safer for U.S. forces and less politically complicated. However, a U.S. strike on a Yemeni wedding party led to calls for an end to drone strikes in Yemen by the Yemeni parliament. President Obama has sought international support, including from Arab Gulf States, to address conflicts in Yemen through the United Nations. The United Nations, along with the United States and Great Britain, supported President Hadi's Administration in Yemen. The UN Security Council passed resolutions, including one that could impose sanctions on those threatening Yemen's stability. President Obama acknowledged the challenges of countering extremist groups, warning against perpetual war without a strategy to address the root causes of extremism. In Yemen, U.S. policymakers aim to stabilize the country politically and economically, but concerns remain about political, geographic, and religious divisions. President Hadi has been a strong U.S. ally, but future leaders may not always cooperate against terrorism. Cooperation with the U.S. is often unpopular among Yemeni public opinion. In Yemen, cooperation with the United States is unpopular due to civilian casualties, Guantanamo Bay incarcerations, and lack of financial support. Government corruption is widespread, with doubts about its ability to provide services and security. AQAP successfully freed militants from prison in 2014, highlighting the lack of partner ground force capacity. The military in Yemen remains divided despite efforts to unify command structure, with front-line units ill-equipped to counter AQAP. Popular Committees, armed militias, are relied upon for local law enforcement but have limited capacity. Yemen's Air Force is underequipped and unable to conduct nighttime missions. The Yemeni Air Force lacks navigational instruments and precision-guided munitions for targeted strikes. Reports indicate a decline in serviceability, with many aircraft grounded as unsafe. Without U.S. support, it would be challenging for Yemen to conduct operations against remote targets. Critics argue that U.S. airstrikes in Yemen lead to civilian casualties, fueling anti-American sentiment and boosting terrorist groups like AQAP. Yemen has been formally unified since 1990, but power remains with non-state actors. The country is divided by regional, sectarian, and tribal conflicts, posing a threat to the United States. Some Yemenis support U.S. drone strikes as the best option among bad choices. The conflicts in Yemen, once of minimal consequence to the United States, now pose a threat by exacerbating terrorism. Internal turmoil diverts government attention and resources, reducing its ability to counter transnational terrorism. The Houthi family, a Zaydi religious clan, has led an armed revolt against the central government and clashed with northern tribes and AQAP. They seek to address historical grievances, expand their political base, and counter Saudi influence in Yemen. The recent opposition to President Hadi's efforts to create federal regions has further escalated tensions. Hadi's efforts through the National Dialogue Conference to create six federal regions in Yemen, including absorbing Sa'da into a region tied to the capital, have faced opposition. Southern Yemenis feel marginalized due to perceived second-class status since the 1990 unification. Civil unrest in southern Yemen began in 2007, with protests over low salaries and lack of promised pensions for former civil servants and military officers from the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. Southern Yemenis began protesting low salaries and lack of promised pensions, demanding equality, decentralization, and a greater share of state welfare. They feel cut off from services and jobs, accusing the government of selling valuable land to northerners and benefiting disproportionately from oil extraction in the south. Aden's commerce has declined, with business now mostly conducted in Sana'a. Former southern secessionist leader Ali Salim al Beidh has resumed political activities after two decades in exile in Oman. He declared himself leader of the Southern Mobility Movement (SMM) and called for the resurrection of the PDRY. Despite having many supporters, there are enough rivals to his leadership claim, keeping the SMM divided and less effective against the government. Beidh is currently in exile in Beirut, Lebanon, occasionally broadcasting messages on southern Yemeni television. The SMM has resisted attempts to create six federal regions in Yemen, with the NDC proposing Aden and Hadramawt as the south's new federal regions. The NDC proposed Aden and Hadramawt as the south's new federal regions, with SMM abandoning the NDC due to northern influence. Southerners support a two-federal region plan for self-determination, with international actors like the US and Saudi Arabia backing Yemen's unity. Oil discovery in the Arabian Peninsula has impacted Yemen's economy. In the 1960s, North and South Yemen were underdeveloped agrarian economies. Oil wealth in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s led to Yemeni laborers migrating and sending remittances back home, boosting national incomes. However, the influx of cash did not spur long-term growth, causing labor shortages and hindering reinvestment in productive sectors. Saudi Arabia expelled Yemeni laborers in 1990, impacting the economy. Yemen became an oil producer in the mid-1980s, but royalties from oil production have not led to long-term growth. Former president Saleh used oil funds to buy tribal loyalties, expand the bureaucracy, and depress energy prices, leading to oil smuggling. His exploitation of natural resources helped solidify his rule. Yemen's oil production peaked in 2001 at 440,000 bpd but has since decreased to 100,000 bpd. Revenue from oil accounts for most exports and up to 50% of government revenue. Economists predict Yemen will deplete its oil reserves between 2017 and 2021. The main oil export pipeline is the Marib pipeline, stretching from Marib province to the Red Sea terminal of Ras Isa. Yemen's oil production has significantly declined, with the main export pipeline frequently attacked, leading to a drop in exports. Sabotage has played a significant role in the decrease, with LNG production also being affected. In 2013, Yemen exported 124,000 bpd, down from over 350,000 bpd a decade earlier. In 2013, Yemen's oil sector faced challenges with declining production and frequent attacks on its energy infrastructure, leading to a drop in exports to 124,000 bpd from over 350,000 bpd a decade earlier. Sabotage has cost the government billions of dollars in import replacement and repairs, with estimates of $4.75 billion in losses over a two-year period. Yemen's economy suffered a $400 million loss from the Marib pipeline in 2014. The country spent more on oil imports than it earned in 2013, ranking low in per capita GDP. Despite a slight recovery, the IMF noted insufficient progress in reducing unemployment and poverty. A $554 million lending agreement was signed with the IMF, contingent on cutting fuel subsidies. However, ongoing conflict and potential subsidy reinstatement raise doubts about Yemen's commitment to economic reform. Yemen faces a balance-of-payments crisis, needing $1.6 billion annually in external aid. IMF loan conditions include raising funds from other sources. With only $5.2 billion in foreign reserves, Yemen can cover only a few months of imports. The country has high poverty (54%) and youth unemployment (35%) rates. Approximately 60% of Yemenis need humanitarian aid, with 44% designated as \"food insecure.\" Yemen is considered one of the most food-insecure countries in the world. The Friends of Yemen Group, formed by the United States and Great Britain, has pledged $8 billion to support Yemen's development. $2.6 billion has been disbursed, with funds earmarked for capital spending and humanitarian needs. Disbursement to the Yemeni government timeline remains unclear. The disbursement of international aid to Yemen is linked to concerns about domestic corruption. Yemen's government, economy, and elites are interconnected in a patronage system that hinders reform efforts. Saudi Arabia is Yemen's main economic supporter, aiming to influence political and security conditions to prevent threats. Yemen ranks poorly in corruption perception, making it challenging to address issues effectively. The Saudi royal family is concerned about a united Yemen challenging their hegemony on the Arabian Peninsula. They aim to prevent Yemen-based terrorists and Houthi rebels from establishing an Iran-aligned theocracy in northern Yemen. The United States seeks a stable, unified Yemen free from terrorist threats, but achieving this goal remains uncertain. Yemen's unity has been more aspirational than functional, with the US supporting unity while devolving some power. The United States supports Yemen's unity and devolution of power to provinces through the National Dialogue Conference. They call for peaceful participation in Yemen's transition process for inclusive governance. The US remains committed to supporting President Hadi and countering threats from al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. and international efforts to support Yemen's political transition are unraveling as regional revolts disrupt the country's unity. Houthi rebels and separatist movements are challenging the transition process, raising questions about the focus of U.S. policy. The U.S. State Department has called on the Houthis to cease efforts to take territory by force and abide by a cease-fire, but separatist actions are driving the situation. The actions of separatist movements are driving Yemen's delicate transition, with President Obama issuing sanctions to deter threats to peace and stability. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned three individuals, including former President Saleh and two Houthi leaders, under Executive Order 13611. The impact of U.S. sanctions on disrupting Yemen's transition remains uncertain. In most cases, U.S. sanctions may not affect targets with substantial assets in the U.S. International sanctions like UNSCR 2140 could have a greater impact. Sanctions on former president Saleh could impact thousands of people and millions of dollars, but may not affect the Houthis who lack bank accounts and travel. Congress does not typically allocate aid to Yemen in annual foreign operations legislation, but funds are allocated by federal agencies across various aid accounts. The United States provides aid to Yemen through 17 different programs managed by multiple agencies, including the Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Defense. In FY2014, over $142 million in assistance was committed to Yemen, with additional amounts in FY2013 and FY2012. Program details are available in congressional aid obligation notification documents. The United States provides economic aid to Yemen through various accounts, including the Economic Support Fund, Development Assistance, and Global Health Child Survival. Funds are channeled into democracy assistance, global health, education, economic development, and humanitarian aid programs. Democracy assistance focuses on voter registry updates, judicial reform, and women's empowerment. Global health programs aim to improve access to water, nutrition, and healthcare. Education programs target school facilities, student attendance, reading skills, and teacher training. Economic development funding supports micro-finance projects and market access. In FY2013 and FY2014, the United States provided over $180.9 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen through various international aid organizations. The U.S. is the largest single contributor of humanitarian aid to Yemen, with assistance nearly double that of the next largest donor. U.S. military and security assistance to Yemen comes from State Department and Department of Defense-managed accounts. The U.S. provides Yemen's armed forces with modest amounts of FMF grants. The US provides Yemen with military aid through FMF grants and the 1206 \"train and equip\" fund to enhance its armed forces' capabilities, including air force, special operations, border control, and coast guard. Yemen has received $401.326 million in 1206 aid since FY2006. Various statutes could restrict US assistance to Yemen under certain conditions. The FY2014 Omnibus Appropriations Act prohibits funds for Yemen's Armed Forces if controlled by a foreign terrorist organization. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act restricts U.S. military assistance to countries using child soldiers. President Obama waived aid sanctions for Yemen in 2013. The United States may restrict foreign aid from certain governments that do not show progress in eliminating human trafficking. The President has waived this restriction for Yemen in FY2015. Budget transparency measures could restrict government-to-government assistance, but the Obama Administration has waived these restrictions, citing national interest. The U.S. has long detained Yemeni prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, causing tension in U.S.-Yemeni relations. Concerns exist about Yemen's ability to monitor returnees due to public pressure from Islamists. President Obama aims to close the detention facility and resume repatriating Yemenis, with 58 cleared for transfer. Yemeni prisoners in Guantanamo Bay have been on hunger strikes to raise awareness, with 17 reportedly force-fed. Yemen has the lowest per capita GDP in the Arab world and struggles with governance due to its rugged terrain and tribal structure. Tribal leaders often hold more power than government authorities outside the capital. Zaydi Islamic dynasties ruled Yemen until 1962, and the Ottoman Empire briefly occupied part of the coastline. In 1839, the British Empire captured Aden in Yemen, holding it until 1967. Political upheavals in the 1960s led to the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in the north and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in the south, which developed close ties to the Soviet Union. The Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen had close ties to the Soviet Union and supported terrorist organizations. The United States assisted the YAR during the Cold War, and relations between North and South Yemen improved in the mid-1980s. The Republic of Yemen was formed in 1990 by the merger of the two states. Ali Abdullah Saleh became president of the unified state, but Yemen's support for Iraq during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 led to economic troubles. In 1994, government forces loyal to Saleh clashed with separatists. During Saleh's rule, political power centralized around his family, leading to rampant corruption and economic challenges. Yemen remained one of the poorest nations globally. U.S.-Yemeni relations were strained due to weak military ties, Yemeni disapproval of U.S. policies, and lack of commercial relations. Since Yemen's unification, the United States has been focused on combating Al Qaeda and similar terrorist groups in the country. The USS Cole attack in 2000 and the September 11, 2001 attacks heightened concerns, leading to improved bilateral relations under the George W. Bush Administration. However, Yemen's lenient policy towards suspected terrorists and U.S. worries about corruption and governance limited support. Saudi Arabia's efforts against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula pushed militants to seek refuge in Yemen, exacerbating the terrorism struggle. The Obama Administration initiated actions in 2009 to address these challenges. The Obama Administration initiated a major review of U.S. policy toward Yemen in 2009, leading to a new strategy focused on combating AQAP in the short term, increasing development assistance for long-term challenges, and supporting global efforts to stabilize Yemen. In 2011, a youth-led popular demonstration movement challenged President Saleh's rule in Yemen amid the Arab Spring unrest. The popular demonstration movement in Yemen in 2011 led to violent confrontations between Saleh's loyal forces and his opponents, creating a security vacuum in areas vulnerable to Islamist militants and separatists. The 2011 popular demonstration movement in Yemen created a security vacuum in areas vulnerable to Islamist militants and separatists. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula seized territory in one province, prompting international efforts to broker a political compromise. Saleh resisted pressure for his departure but eventually succumbed due to international pressure, UNSCR 2014, defections from loyalist forces, and losses to rival militias. In November 2011, mounting losses and international pressure led President Saleh to sign a transition plan brokered by the GCC and backed by the US. The plan granted him immunity and allowed him to retain a political role. Yemen held a presidential \"election\" in February 2012 with one consensus candidate, former Vice President Al Hadi. After winning the presidential \"election\" in February 2012, former Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour al Hadi was inaugurated as president. The next phases of the GCC plan included a national dialogue, redrafting the constitution, holding a constitutional referendum, developing an electoral law, and conducting parliamentary and/or presidential elections. In January 2014, Yemen's National Dialogue Conference concluded without agreement on a new federal system of democratic governance. The National Dialogue Conference in Yemen aimed to address political issues, including power sharing between northern and southern regions. President Hadi formed a committee to decide on dividing Yemen into two or six federal regions, with southern Yemenis preferring a two-region system for equal representation and access to resources. The conference extended past its timeline, with participants supporting a presidential transition in February 2014. Yemen's National Dialogue Conference extended President Hadi's term until February 2015. The transition process faces challenges as the old regime still holds power and key steps like drafting a new constitution and holding elections remain incomplete. The transition in Yemen could take several more years."
