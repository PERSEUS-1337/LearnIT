    "content": "The Act titled \"Citizens Access to Justice Act of 1997\" is also known as the \"Short Title.\" It includes findings outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that property rights have been undermined by government actions, laws, and regulations, affecting the value and use of private property. Certain legal provisions hinder property owners from obtaining full relief for violations of the fifth and fourteenth amendments. Current laws lack a solid basis for splitting jurisdiction in cases involving constitutionally protected property rights. Protected property rights are at stake, adding complexity and cost to takings and litigation, affecting taxpayers and property owners. Property owners seeking just compensation from the Federal Government must choose between equitable relief in district court or monetary relief in the United States Court of Federal Claims. This jurisdictional issue is used to urge dismissal in complaints against the Federal Government in both district court and the Court of Federal Claims. Property owners face challenges in seeking just compensation from the Federal Government, as they must decide between equitable relief in district court or monetary relief in the United States Court of Federal Claims. There are concerns that property owners cannot fully vindicate their rights in one lawsuit and that certain provisions of the Tucker Act should be amended to address these issues. To address challenges faced by property owners in seeking compensation from the Federal Government, amendments to the Tucker Act are proposed. This includes granting jurisdiction to both district courts and the Court of Federal Claims for property rights claims. Additionally, the repeal of section 1500 of title 28 is suggested to allow the Court of Federal Claims to hear suits pending in other courts by the same plaintiff. Furthermore, there is a need to safeguard property owners' constitutional rights through simplifying permitting procedures. To protect property rights, it is essential to define what constitutes a final agency decision for claimants to defend their rights in court. Federal judges should handle cases where property owners seek redress for violations of constitutional rights without state law claims. Amendments to sections 1343, 1346, and 1491 of title 28 are needed to clarify when a claim for constitutionally protected property rights is ripe for a judge to decide on the merits. The purpose of the amendments to sections 1343, 1346, and 1491 of title 28 is to clarify when a claim for constitutionally protected property rights is ripe for a judge to decide on the merits. The Act aims to establish a streamlined judicial process for property owners to vindicate their rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. It also seeks to amend the Tucker Act and eliminate the requirement for property owners to litigate Federal constitutional issues in State courts before accessing Federal courts. The Act aims to streamline the judicial process for property owners to assert their rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments. It eliminates the need for property owners to first litigate Federal constitutional issues in State courts before accessing Federal courts. Additionally, it provides guidelines for cases involving constitutionally protected property rights, allowing for adjudication by a Federal court after a final agency decision is made following a denial of a meaningful application to develop the land in question. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"agency action\" refers to any action, inaction, or decision by a Federal agency that adversely affects private property rights. \"District court\" includes various US district courts with appropriate jurisdiction. \"Federal agency\" encompasses departments, agencies, independent agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States. The curr_chunk defines terms related to private property rights, including the definition of \"owner\" and \"private property.\" It also clarifies what constitutes a \"taking of private property.\" The curr_chunk defines a \"taking of private property\" as any action that restricts ownership, possession, or use of private property, requiring compensation under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution. The curr_chunk focuses on private property actions. An owner can challenge the validity of a Federal agency action affecting private property by filing a civil action in district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Both courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims for monetary relief and invalidation of Acts of Congress or regulations. The plaintiff can choose where to file the action, and this section waives the sovereign immunity of the United States. The waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States is applicable to actions filed challenging Federal agency actions affecting private property. SEC. 6. STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES. Any person affected by a Federal agency action can challenge it in court without exhausting administrative remedies. A civil action can proceed after a final decision causing actual injury is made by the United States. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions under which a party can seek redress for alleged infringement or taking of property, including the submission of a denied application and the exhaustion of appeal or waiver options. The party seeking redress may not need to apply for an appeal or waiver if no process is available, relief cannot be provided, or success is unlikely, warranting intervention by the district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims. SEC. 7. APPEALS. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over actions filed under section 5. SEC. 8. JURISDICTION OF UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS AND UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS. The United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to render judgment on claims against the US for monetary relief based on the Constitution, Acts of Congress, regulations, or contracts with the US. The Court of Federal Claims has the power to grant injunctive and declaratory relief when appropriate and has supplemental jurisdiction to render judgment on related tort claims authorized under section 2674. In judicial review proceedings, the provisions of section 706 of title 5 shall apply. The Court of Federal Claims can grant injunctive and declaratory relief, with supplemental jurisdiction over related tort claims. Section 706 of title 5 applies to judicial review proceedings. Section 1500 of title 28 is repealed, and amendments are made to sections 1346(a) and 1343 of title 28. The new subsections added to section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) state that a claim under this section can be adjudicated by district courts upon a final decision causing injury by a person acting under state law. A final decision exists if a person makes a definitive decision on permissible property uses without regard to any other factors. The new subsections added to section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) outline the conditions for redress in cases where property rights have been infringed. This includes a requirement for a denied application or appeal, with exceptions if no process is available, relief cannot be provided, or success is unlikely. The new subsections added to section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) outline conditions for redress in property rights cases. A final decision for a ripe claim does not require exhausting state judicial remedies. District courts must not abstain from jurisdiction in real property cases without state law violation claims. The district court may certify unsettled State law questions to the State appellate court in real property cases that significantly affect the injured party's Federal claim. This certification is only allowed if the State law question is unclear and requires a limiting construction before deciding on the constitutional or legal issue in the case. The statute of limitations for actions filed under section 5 is 6 years from the date of taking private property. The court must award costs of litigation to prevailing plaintiffs in any final order under section 5. The Act does not interfere with State authority to create additional property rights. The Act is effective upon enactment and applies to agency actions occurring after that date."
