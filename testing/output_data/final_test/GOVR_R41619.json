    "content": "National Security Letters (NSLs) are similar to administrative subpoenas, issued by intelligence agencies to gather information from various institutions. The 111th Congress considered proposals to amend NSL authority, with S. 193 introduced in the 112th Congress by Senator Leahy. This bill aimed to extend provisions approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and USA PATRIOT Act-related amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The Senate Judiciary Committee reported an amended version of S. 193 in April 2011, and Congress later extended the FISA amendments separately. Senator Leahy reintroduced the bill. Senator Leahy reintroduced S. 1125, stripped of FISA extension provisions, while Representative Conyers introduced companion legislation in the House as H.R. 1805. Senator Paul offered several bills addressing similar issues. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 would repeal one NSL authorizing statute, return others to pre-USA PATRIOT Act form, amend judicial review procedures, and adjust audit/reporting requirements. S. 1073 would require minimization procedures for NSLs, S. 1075 would require FISA court judge orders for NSL issuance, and S. 1050 and S. 1070 would combine proposals for minimization procedures and FISA court orders. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, NSL statutes required communications providers to supply customer information upon FBI request, with specific criteria for different types of information. S. 1070 would combine proposals for minimization procedures and FISA court orders for NSLs. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the requirements for communications providers to supply customer information to the FBI for foreign counterintelligence purposes. Specific criteria and articulable facts were needed to justify the request for customer information under different statutes. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded requirements for customer information to be provided to the FBI for foreign counterintelligence purposes. The obligation was triggered by certification from the FBI Director or designee, based on specific facts indicating involvement in international terrorism or criminal activities. Section 802 of the National Security Act extended this obligation to a wider range of recipients for a more limited purpose, including consumer reporting agencies and financial institutions. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FBI's NSL authority under Section 2709, altering requirements for information access related to national security investigations. It included heads of FBI field offices, eliminated the need for specific facts linking to foreign power, and extended to various national security inquiries involving \"U.S. persons\". The USA PATRIOT Act expanded FBI's NSL authority under Section 2709 for national security investigations involving \"U.S. persons\". A new Fair Credit Reporting Act NSL Section 627 was added, requiring consumer reporting agencies to provide information for investigations related to international terrorism. Senior federal agency officials could issue NSLs with a certification of necessity. The NSL statutes were amended in 2005 and 2006 to provide more explicit enforcement authority due to constitutional concerns. The amendments included creating a judicial enforcement mechanism and a review procedure for NSLs with nondisclosure provisions. The 2005 and 2006 amendments to the NSL statutes established a judicial enforcement mechanism and penalties for non-compliance with nondisclosure requirements. The Department of Justice Inspector General reports highlighted a significant increase in FBI's use of NSLs, with a growing percentage used to investigate Americans. The use of National Security Letters (NSLs) to investigate Americans increased from 39% in 2003 to 53% in 2005, with a majority involving telephone or email communications. Reports showed how NSL statutes like 18 U.S.C. 2709 were used to obtain telephone records in counterterrorism cases, enabling the FBI to identify potential terrorist cells. The FBI used NSLs to investigate individuals suspected of terrorist activities, with the main objective being to gather evidence for FISA orders. The RFPA NSL statute allowed access to various information, such as bank transaction records, which proved useful in a counterterrorism investigation involving convenience store owners sending funds to Hawaladars in the Middle East. The FBI used NSLs to investigate suspected terrorist activities, including money transfers to Al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East. Violations included money laundering, fraud, and sale of illegal substances. National security letters were issued for convenience store owners' bank records, revealing large money transfers to individuals overseas. The bank analysis helped identify sources and recipients of the funds, aiding in the investigation. The FBI used National Security Letters (NSLs) to gather information on suspected terrorist activities, including money transfers to Al Qaeda affiliates. The FCRA NSLs allowed the FBI to monitor subjects' daily activities, financial transactions, and potential white-collar crimes. The information obtained from NSLs was used to determine the need for further investigation, generate leads for other agencies, and support FBI analytical reports and databases. The FBI's initial performance in utilizing NSLs was criticized in the report. The FBI's use of NSLs was criticized for violations of statutes, guidelines, and policies. They issued \"exigent letters\" to obtain information without proper authorization, sought records without national security investigations, and obtained financial records without following protocol. The report identified numerous possible violations that went unnoticed. The FBI's use of NSLs was criticized for numerous violations, including not identifying or reporting possible violations, producing inaccurate results, issuing over 700 exigent letters circumventing the NSL statute, initiating NSLs without effective review, showing violations of internal control policies in 60% of cases, not retaining signed NSL copies, and lacking clear guidance on investigative techniques. The FBI's use of NSLs was criticized for various violations, including lack of oversight by SAC supervisors, reluctance to question investigations, no indication of criminal conduct, NSLs considered indispensable, and information fed into FBI systems. Prior to ECPA, Supreme Court ruled no Fourth Amendment protection for telephone records privacy. The ECPA prohibits communication service providers from disclosing customer records without exceptions like a grand jury subpoena or NSL. Violating this prohibition can lead to civil liability, not criminal penalties. The FBI's use of NSLs was criticized for lack of oversight and reliance on them without evidence of criminal activity. The FBI obtained telephone records using \"exigent letters\" before serving NSLs or grand jury subpoenas. The FBI has stopped using exigent letters but can still request emergency disclosures under 18 U.S.C. 2702(c)(4) if there is immediate danger of death or serious injury. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel advised the FBI that under certain circumstances, the ECPA does not prohibit electronic communications service providers from disclosing information. The ECPA does not prohibit electronic communications service providers from disclosing call detail records to the FBI voluntarily. The second IG Report reviewed the FBI's use of national security letters in 2006, showing an increase in requests from investigations of U.S. persons. The FBI and DOJ are making progress in addressing the issues identified in the first IG Report. The third IG Report examined the FBI's use of exigent letters and informal means to acquire communication service providers' customer records instead of using NSL authority from 2003 to 2007. The FBI's use of exigent letters became casual, routine, and unsupervised, with employees sometimes generating letters for FBI personnel to sign. Some informality was due to assigned employees from communication providers working in FBI offices. The FBI's use of informal means to acquire communication service providers' customer records, such as sneak peeks and relaxed exigent letter processes, led to widespread misuse. Employees assigned to FBI offices facilitated this practice, allowing FBI personnel to view telephone records without proper justification or legal process. This casual culture of requesting telephone records was described as having the ATM in your living room. The FBI obtained telephone records through improper means, violating guidelines and policies. They also made inaccurate statements to the FISA Court regarding exigent letters. The IG's Report criticized the FBI's initial response but acknowledged appropriate action was taken to stop the misuse of exigent letters. NSL secrecy and judicial review provisions must be considered in light of legal decisions. The curr_chunk discusses the certification required for disclosing requests or responses that may pose a danger to national security or interfere with investigations. Recipients can disclose to comply with the request and consult with an attorney. They must inform necessary parties of secrecy requirements and identify those informed to the requesting agency. Recipients can petition the court to modify or lift NSL secrecy requirements within a year of issuance. The court may modify or set aside NSL secrecy restrictions if no danger to national security is found. Recipients can petition the court to change or lift NSL secrecy requirements within a year of issuance. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide protection against undue burdens and protect privileged communications for grand jury subpoenas. Compliance with NSLs may be burdensome, but few privileges are recognized in their use. A motion to quash an NSL in a grand jury investigation will be denied unless it can be shown that the requested materials are not relevant. The court has the authority to modify or set aside an NSL if it is deemed unlawful, and can enforce compliance against a recipient who refuses to comply with the court's order. The NSL can be enforced against a recipient who refuses to comply with the court's order, punishable as contempt of court. Breach of confidentiality requirements can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine. The Second Circuit has outlined procedures for NSLs to withstand First Amendment scrutiny, including notice to recipients, government review of secrecy orders, and annual judicial review opportunities for recipients. The NSL provisions under the USA PATRIOT Act are not set to expire, but proposed bills S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 aim to repeal Section 627 and return others to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form. These bills would establish a transition provision for investigations or offenses initiated before December 31, 2013. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the issuing authority for National Security Letters (NSLs) to include FBI field office heads, removed the requirement for specific facts linking to a foreign power, and prohibited NSL investigations solely based on First Amendment activities. Proposed bills aim to repeal these changes and return NSL statutes to their pre-USA PATRIOT Act form. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded NSL issuing authority to FBI field office heads, removed specific facts requirement for foreign power links, and prohibited NSL investigations solely based on First Amendment activities. Repealing these changes would require FBI Director approval based on specific and articulable facts related to a foreign power or agent. The \"specific and articulable\" facts standard, originating from counterintelligence investigations, may not always be suitable for counterterrorism cases due to the complexity of networks and larger volume of communication involved. Counter-terrorism cases involve complex networks with a large volume of communication and financial transactions. Investigators struggle to meet the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard due to the unclear nature of terrorist organizations. The NSL statutes prior to the USA PATRIOT Act prohibited disclosure of requests without providing a means to challenge or seek limited release. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act addressed the issue of nondisclosure requirements in NSL statutes by outlawing unjustified disclosures, allowing recipients to seek counsel before complying, and creating a nonexpiring statutory section for review of NSLs. Congress created a nonexpiring statutory section for review of NSLs, 18 U.S.C. 3511, which governs judicial review of NSL nondisclosure requirements. Section 3511 places the burden on the government to justify gag orders, and proposed amendments reinforce recipient protections. Section 627 of the USA PATRIOT Act is considered the most extensive NSL statute, providing a wide range of information to various federal agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the scope of National Security Letters (NSLs) to allow issuance by the FBI to a wider range of requesters. Repealing this provision could centralize NSL authority in the FBI, simplifying oversight. The Justice Department found confusion between different NSL statutes. The National Security Act NSL statute, unaffected by the USA PATRIOT Act, is less intrusive, only applying to federal employees who consent to disclosure. Some Senate Judiciary Committee members oppose reverting to previous NSL statutes. S. 193 rescinds valuable tools by requiring the government to follow pre-PATRIOT Act NSL standard, hindering early evidence development in investigations. Rolling back sensible NSL reforms made in the USA PATRIOT Act is illogical. The USA PATRIOT Act allows criminal investigators to use administrative or grand jury subpoenas to obtain relevant records. NSL statutes include a nondisclosure provision, allowing agencies to prohibit recipients from disclosing the request unless necessary for compliance. Agency officials must certify that disclosure may endanger national security, individual safety, or interfere with investigations. A federal district court may modify or set aside an NSL secrecy requirement if it concludes that disclosure poses no danger or interference. The proposed legislation S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 aim to modify the statutory provisions governing NSL nondisclosure orders. The Second Circuit in John Doe, Inc. v. Mukasey ruled that such provisions must be narrowly crafted to meet adverse consequences of disclosure and survive First Amendment scrutiny. The bills would establish a procedure similar to the court's requirements, allowing the agency issuing the NSL to determine the need for a nondisclosure provision. The proposed legislation aims to modify NSL nondisclosure orders, allowing the agency to determine the need for a nondisclosure provision based on concerns for national security, individual safety, diplomatic relations, or ongoing investigations. Recipients would have the right to judicial review within 30 days, with the agency required to provide a statement of facts supporting the need for nondisclosure. The proposed legislation aims to amend NSL statutes to require agency certifying officials to document specific facts supporting the belief that the information sought is relevant to a qualified investigation. The legislation does not mention minimization, in contrast to previous versions, but Senator Paul's bills include specific NSL minimization proposals. Minimization standards in the context of information acquisition involve limitations on acquiring, maintaining, accessing, disclosing, preserving, and expunging information. These standards are based on the purposes, authority, interests, and governmental goals related to the information. They often align with statutory and regulatory restrictions, such as those outlined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides procedures for electronic surveillance and physical searches in national security cases, with oversight by judicial and legislative bodies. Minimization procedures are implemented to protect private information of Americans. Section 119(f) of the USA PATRIOT Act requires reports on the feasibility of NSL minimization procedures to safeguard constitutional rights. The Inspector General's reports highlighted the need for NSL minimization standards to ensure the least intrusive collection techniques are used in national security investigations. Concerns were raised over the lack of clear guidance for Special Agents on reconciling limitations with the broad authority provided in NSL statutes. The Justice Department formed a working group to address these issues and make recommendations for NSL minimization standards. Attorney General Holder approved Procedures for the Collection, Use, and Storage of Information Derived from National Security Letters on October 1, 2010. The FBI's current practice aligns with these procedures, and formal policy implementation is underway. A joint report by DOJ and ODNI on NSL 'minimization' is in progress as required by the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act of 2005. Senate Judiciary Committee's S. 193 directs the Attorney General to periodically review NSL procedures. Senator Paul's proposals, like S. 1125 and H.R. 1805, call for the Attorney General to review NSL procedures with a focus on privacy rights and civil liberties. They emphasize the need for standards on disposing of NSL-generated information and returning or destroying data outside the scope of the letter. Some NSL statutes require periodic reports to congressional committees, and the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act mandates an annual report on NSL issuance. S. 1125 and H.R. 1805 aim to expand reporting requirements for NSLs, including demanding twice yearly reports on the number of requests for information on individuals not under investigation. They also call for audits by the Justice Department's Inspector General for the years 2007 through 2013. Financial institutions are required to comply with NSL requests for customer financial records. The Federal Bureau of Investigation can request customer records from financial institutions for foreign counterintelligence purposes if specific facts indicate the customer is a foreign power or agent. Information obtained can only be disseminated according to approved guidelines, and relevant information can be shared with authorized agencies semiannually. The Attorney General must inform congressional committees semiannually about requests for financial records made by the FBI for foreign counterintelligence purposes. Financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing FBI access to customer records. The FBI can request financial records for foreign counterintelligence purposes, with certification from high-ranking officials. Information obtained can only be disseminated according to approved guidelines, and must be relevant to authorized investigations. The Attorney General must inform congressional intelligence committees about requests for financial records made by the FBI for national security reasons. Financial institutions cannot disclose information if it poses a danger to national security or ongoing investigations. Financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing to anyone, except those necessary for compliance or legal advice, that the FBI has accessed a customer's financial records. Recipients must also adhere to the nondisclosure requirement. Financial institutions must disclose names and addresses of financial institutions to the FBI upon request, with exceptions for attorney-client privilege. The FBI can request addresses of financial institutions where a consumer has or had an account for foreign counterintelligence investigations, with specific criteria to be met for such a request to be certified. The FBI can request identifying information about a consumer from a consumer reporting agency for foreign counterintelligence investigations, limited to name, address, former addresses, places of employment, or former places of employment, with specific criteria to be met for such a request to be certified. The FBI can request consumer information from a reporting agency for counterintelligence investigations if there is reason to believe the consumer is in contact with a foreign power. This includes providing names and addresses of financial institutions where the consumer has accounts. The FBI Director or designee can certify compliance with information requests for authorized investigations to protect against terrorism or intelligence activities, with restrictions on investigations of US persons based solely on First Amendment activities. A consumer reporting agency must provide limited identifying information about a consumer to the FBI upon written request from the Director or their designee for authorized investigations related to terrorism or intelligence activities, with restrictions on investigations of US persons based solely on First Amendment activities. The FBI can request subscriber information and toll billing records from wire or electronic communication service providers for authorized investigations related to terrorism or intelligence activities, with restrictions on investigations of US persons based solely on First Amendment activities. The FBI can request subscriber information and toll billing records from electronic communication service providers for authorized foreign counterintelligence investigations involving foreign powers or agents, with specific facts supporting the belief of involvement. The FBI can request subscriber information and toll billing records from electronic communication service providers for authorized foreign counterintelligence investigations involving foreign powers or agents, with specific facts supporting the belief of involvement. Wire or electronic communication service providers are prohibited from disclosing information if there are specific reasons to believe that the communication facilities have been used in communications related to international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The FBI can request information from communication service providers for foreign counterintelligence investigations. The FBI is required to follow guidelines approved by the Attorney General for dissemination of information obtained. The Director of the FBI must inform certain congressional bodies semiannually.

This includes libraries that provide access to various forms of communication. The USA PATRIOT Act, effective October 26, 2001, allows consumer reporting agencies to disclose consumer information to government agencies for investigations related to international terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act allows consumer reporting agencies to disclose consumer information to government agencies for investigations related to international terrorism, with certification required by a designated official for confidentiality and national security reasons.
