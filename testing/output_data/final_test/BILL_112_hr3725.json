    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Libyan Assets Taxpayer Reimbursement Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges that the US froze over $30 billion in assets owned by Muammar Qaddafi and his regime. Military actions were taken to protect the Libyan people, exposing US forces to risks. The Libyan uprising succeeded with US assistance, and Libya's oil wealth can fund its development. Libya, with Africa's largest oil reserves and a population of 6.5 million, had high oil export revenues in 2010. The US spent under $3 billion on military and humanitarian efforts in Libya. Funds from the US-Libya Claims Settlement Agreement are insufficient to fully compensate victims of Libyan state-sponsored terrorism, with a shortfall of up to $400 million.
