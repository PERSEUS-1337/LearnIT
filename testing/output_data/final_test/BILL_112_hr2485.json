The \"All Children are Equal Act\" or the \"ACE Act\" amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to target funds for schools with the highest concentrations of economically disadvantaged students. The Act aims to allocate more funds per formula student to local educational agencies with higher concentrations of such students. The allocation of Targeted and Education Finance Incentive Grant funds is determined by a weighting system based on the percentage and absolute number of eligible students in a local education agency. This system aims to distribute funds fairly, but any gain in allocation for one agency results in a loss for others. The number weighting alternative may benefit larger agencies. The Congressional Research Service found that number weighting in funding formulas has shifted funds from smaller to larger local educational agencies, regardless of poverty levels, contrary to Congress's intent. The Congressional Research Service discovered that number weighting in funding formulas has led to unintended consequences, with many high-poverty local educational agencies losing out on funding under the Targeted Grant program. Congress is urged to address this issue and consider allocating funds using the Basic Grant formula without any weighting system. Congress should reduce the power of the number weighting system in funding formulas to prevent high-poverty local educational agencies with low student numbers from being disadvantaged in grant allocations. Targeted grants will be provided to local educational agencies to address funding disparities and prevent high-poverty agencies with low student numbers from being disadvantaged.
