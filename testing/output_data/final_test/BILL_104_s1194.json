    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Mineral Resources Research Act of 1996\" amends the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 to include a new section on a Marine Mineral Resources Research Program. The Act \"Marine Mineral Resources Research Act of 1996\" defines key terms such as 'contract,' 'cooperative agreement,' 'eligible entity,' 'grant,' and 'in-kind contribution' related to research and educational entities, individuals, and agencies involved in specific projects or programs. The Act \"Marine Mineral Resources Research Act of 1996\" defines marine mineral resources as sand, aggregates, placers, phosphates, manganese nodules, cobalt crusts, metal sulfides, and other resources excluding oil and gas, fisheries, or marine mammals. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Marine Mineral Resources Research Act of 1996 defines marine mineral resources and excludes oil, gas, fisheries, and marine mammals. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the 'Secretary'. The Secretary is required to establish a research program on marine mineral resources to promote responsible exploration, develop technologies, coordinate federal assistance, and encourage joint research with academia and industry. The Secretary is responsible for promoting partnerships between industry, government, and academia to research marine mineral resources in an environmentally sound manner, developing necessary information for national interests, and identifying technologies that may facilitate undersea applications related to marine mineral resources. The Secretary is responsible for promoting partnerships between industry, government, and academia to research marine mineral resources in an environmentally sound manner, developing necessary information for national interests, and identifying technologies related to vessels, underwater vehicles, survey systems, remote power sources, data collection, seabed research systems, and fostering communication between Federal and State agencies, universities, and private entities concerning marine mineral research on seabeds. \"SEC. 203. GRANTS, CONTRACTS, AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.\" The Secretary will award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to eligible entities for research on marine mineral resources, environmental impact detection and remediation, and education in marine mineral research and resource management. Cost-sharing is required for contracts or cooperative agreements. The Federal share of project costs under this subsection is limited to 80%, with the remaining non-Federal share allowed in cash, in-kind contributions, or funds from other Federal programs. Non-Federal funds must cover at least 10% of the total project cost, and the Secretary will establish terms and conditions in consultation with other Federal agencies within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Federal funding terms and conditions for projects must be consistent with the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Entities must submit proposals and undergo evaluation by a competitive review panel to be eligible for grants or contracts under this subsection. A competitive review panel, chaired by the Secretary or designee, consists of members appointed by the Secretary. Over 50% of members must be from private marine resource companies. Panel members cannot have an interest in grants or contracts under evaluation and receive no compensation. The competitive review panel, chaired by the Secretary or designee, evaluates proposals based on criteria developed by the Secretary. Criteria include the merits of the proposal, research methodology and costs, entity capability, and matching funds provided. The Secretary evaluates proposals based on criteria such as matching funds, collaboration with other entities, environmental stewardship promotion, and other relevant factors. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the total amount allocated for the program. The program authorized by this section prohibits using funds for construction projects. Eligible entities must submit progress and technical reports detailing project activities and potential benefits. SEC. 204. MARINE MINERAL RESEARCH CENTERS. The Secretary must designate 3 marine mineral research centers within 90 days of this section's enactment. Each center will focus on research in specific regions: continental shelf, deep seabed/near-shore islands, and arctic/cold water. Priority will be given to universities with federally funded marine minerals research centers, programs for advanced degrees in relevant fields, and established programs in the United States. The designated United States university focuses on marine mineral resources, collaborates with industry and government agencies, and has expertise in seabed exploration, marine mining, and mineral processing systems. The center provides technical assistance to the Secretary and advises on international activities in marine mineral resources development. The center focuses on marine mineral resources development, research, training, and education transfer. It promotes efficient identification, assessment, exploration, and management of marine mineral resources in an environmentally sound manner. Funds are allocated equally to designated centers, with limitations on administrative expenses and construction costs. Construction costs are restricted from using funds allocated for marine mineral resources development, research, training, and education transfer. This includes new building construction, acquisition, expansion, remodeling, or alteration of existing buildings. Authorization of appropriations is granted for carrying out the specified title."
