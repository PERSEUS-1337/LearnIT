    "content": "The \"DME Access and Stabilization Act of 2015\" revises payments for durable medical equipment under the Medicare program. The \"DME Access and Stabilization Act of 2015\" revises payments for durable medical equipment under the Medicare program by implementing payment adjustments using information from competitive bidding programs for items and services furnished between January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2019. The area under this section shall be adjusted to the lesser of the applicable percent of the regional price determined for the region or the fee schedule amount determined on January 1, 2015, updated by the covered item update for the year the items and services are furnished. The adjustment described in the previous section shall be implemented over a two-year period and in a manner that phases in such changes. The applicable percent for rural areas or frontier states is 130 percent, while for other areas, it is 120 percent. The adjustment will be phased in over a two-year period, with equal increments each year. The bid ceiling for durable medical equipment under the Medicare program is amended. The bid ceiling for durable medical equipment under the Medicare program is amended to ensure that the Secretary may not establish a ceiling on bids that is less than the amount that would have been paid for such items in 2015, updated for the year the item is furnished. The Social Security Act is amended to require adjustments in competitive bidding programs to consider factors like travel distance, volume of services, clearing price, and provider numbers in different areas. SEC. 3. LIMITING FEDERAL MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT TO STATES FOR DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME) TO MEDICARE PAYMENT RATES. The amendment to Section 1903(i) of the Social Security Act limits federal Medicaid reimbursement to states for durable medical equipment (DME) to Medicare payment rates. The Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman will monitor DME reimbursement under Medicaid to evaluate the impact of the competitive acquisition program on beneficiary health outcomes, effective January 1, 2020."
