    "content": "The \"Higher Education for Freedom Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to provide findings and purposes related to higher education. Congress finds the importance of preserving American history and principles of free government for future generations to participate fully in civic life and uphold the American experiment in self-government. Despite this importance, most colleges and universities no longer require the study of US history or Western civilization. The purpose of this act is to promote and sustain post-secondary academic centers, institutes, and programs that offer a systematic study of Western civilization and free institutions as a prerequisite to graduation. Distinguished historians and intellectuals fear that without a common civic memory and understanding of American history, individuals risk losing what it means to be an American and fulfilling their responsibilities as citizens in a democracy. Post-secondary academic centers, institutes, and programs offer courses in traditional American history, the American Founding, free institutions, and Western Civilization for undergraduate students in teacher education programs, K-12 teachers needing additional training, and graduate students and faculty looking to teach these subjects effectively. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the subject matter. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a higher education institution, a specific program within a higher education institution, or a non-profit organization associated with higher education. Eligible institutions can apply to award subgrants to other eligible institutions with oversight from the Secretary. The term \"free institution\" refers to institutions rooted in Western Civilization, such as democracy, individual rights, market economics, religious freedom, tolerance, and freedom of thought. The term \"institution of higher education\" has the same meaning as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"traditional American history\" encompasses significant constitutional, political, intellectual, economic, and foreign policy trends that have shaped American history. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Education. The curr_chunk discusses key episodes, turning points, and leading figures in American history, including constitutional, political, intellectual, diplomatic, and economic aspects. SEC. 4.
