Foreign nationals must obtain a visa to enter the United States, meeting specific criteria and avoiding legal bars to admission. Visa application is the initial step for foreign nationals seeking entry, providing essential biometric and biographic data to the U.S. The United States collects biometric and biographic data on foreign nationals for visa issuance. The Department of State and Department of Homeland Security play key roles in administering immigration visas, with various bureaus responsible for different aspects of the process. The current visa issuance policy dates back to 1924, following legislation passed by Congress after World War I. The Immigration Act of 1924 required aliens to present specific documents for visas. In 1947, the Senate Committee emphasized the need for a double check system to screen aliens entering the US, a view supported by Congress in 1952. The Immigration Act of 1924 mandated specific visa documents for aliens. In 1952, Congress enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act, focusing on visa integrity to protect the US from threats while welcoming legitimate foreign nationals. The ongoing challenge lies in balancing security and efficiency in the visa issuance process. The section discusses consular screening procedures, visa revocation, and the visa security program. It distinguishes between immigrants and nonimmigrants issued visas, as well as handling humanitarian admissions separately. It also addresses illegal aliens and the process for aliens wishing to live permanently in the United States. Aliens wishing to live permanently in the United States must meet specific criteria outlined in the INA, such as being a spouse or minor child of a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident's family member, an employee with approval from the Department of Labor, a person of extraordinary ability, a refugee, diversity visa lottery winner, or meeting other specialized provisions. Petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by a sponsoring relative or employer. If the immigrant is already in the U.S., USCIS handles the process known as \"adjustment of status.\" Foreign nationals seeking to live permanently in the United States must meet specific criteria outlined in the INA. Petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by a sponsoring relative or employer. If the immigrant is already in the U.S., USCIS handles the process known as \"adjustment of status.\" Nonimmigrants are foreign nationals who come to the U.S. temporarily for specific reasons, with over 70 types of nonimmigrant visas currently issued. Most visitors enter the United States without nonimmigrant visas through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), allowing waiver of visa requirements for visitors from 38 countries. CBP inspectors at the port of entry conduct background checks for VWP entrants. Visa application requirements are more extensive for those seeking permanent residency compared to visitors. The visa application process for coming to the United States is similar to the IRS tax forms, with simpler cases requiring fewer forms and hurdles. There are over 70 USCIS and DOS forms involved, stored in an electronic database accessible to immigration officials. The process includes submitting a photograph as required by statute. The visa application process for coming to the United States involves submitting personal information and documents, such as photographs, full name, age, gender, and birth details. Physical and mental examinations may be required for prospective immigrants. Consular officers have the authority to disqualify visa applicants if they are deemed ineligible under the law. Consular officers can disqualify visa applicants if they fail to meet eligibility criteria or if there are reasons to believe they are ineligible under the law. This disqualification, known as \u00a7221(g), is the most common reason for LPR visa denials. In FY2013, 290,369 LPR visas and 775,201 nonimmigrant visas were disqualified by the DOS. In FY2014, 240,876 LPR visas and 689,379 nonimmigrant visas were disqualified. The most common reason for DOS denying nonimmigrant visas is the failure to establish entitlement to nonimmigrant status under INA \u00a7214(b). In FY2013, 1.4 million nonimmigrant visas were denied on this basis, and in FY2014, 1.7 million were denied. Additionally, decisions on visa qualification and admissibility under INA \u00a7212(a) are crucial, with criteria including health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, unauthorized work, and illegal activities. Foreign nationals seeking visas must undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers abroad. They are required to submit personal information, photographs, and fingerprints, as well as relevant documents like birth certificates. All prospective LPRs must undergo physical and mental examinations. In some cases, individuals may overcome exclusion under \u00a7212(a) if new information is provided, but the consular officer's decision is final and not subject to judicial appeals. LPRs and prospective nonimmigrants undergo physical and mental examinations to ensure visa eligibility. Consular officers use the CCD database to screen visa applicants, storing biometric data and photos since 2001. The CCD contains over 143 million records, linking with other databases to flag potential issues. Consular officers use the CCD database to screen visa applicants, linking with other databases like IDENT, IAFIS, and TSC to flag potential issues. The system also connects to TECS, providing CBP officers at ports of entry access to CCD. Consular officers have limited access to DHS' Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS) to track foreign nationals' entries and exits. LPR visa denials fluctuated over the past 20 years, with a spike in FY1998-FY1999 and a peak of 53,220 denials in FY2014. Nonimmigrant \u00a7212(a) denials showed a steady upward trend, reaching 71,500 denials in FY2014. Public charge exclusions contributed to the spike in denials after the Illegal Immigration Reform. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, public charge exclusions dominated inadmissibility for LPRs until FY2003-FY2005. Prior removals/illegal presence became the top ground of inadmissibility since FY2008. IIRIRA increased consequences for foreign nationals with prior removal orders or illegal presence in the US. Employers' failure to meet labor certification requirements consistently ranked third. Prior removals/illegal presence also became the top ground for nonimmigrants. Since FY2008, prior removals/illegal presence has been the top ground of inadmissibility for both LPRs and nonimmigrants. Criminal history and INA violations are common reasons for denying nonimmigrant visas, with criminal history comprising 25% of nonimmigrant exclusions in FY2014. Nonimmigrants seeking admission or benefits in the US can be excluded for fraud or misrepresentation. Consular officers use the CLASS database to check backgrounds, with 70% of records from other agencies. Automated algorithms are used to match visa applicant names with derogatory information. The CLASS search algorithm checks visa applicants against the CCD for prior visa applications, refusals, or issuances. The Visa Viper system alerts officials about foreign nationals who may be suspected terrorists. Consular officers send Visa Viper cables to the NCTC if they receive concerning information about a foreign national. Consular officers use various programs like Visa Condor, TEL, and KFE in partnership with NCTC for counterterrorism screening of visa applicants. The NCTC compares visa applicants' information with TIDE for known and suspected terrorists. A \"hit\" in KFE triggers a Washington-based interagency review of the visa application. KFE conducts post-issuance reviews of valid visas to check for new information on emerging threats. It examines 100 percent of the approximately 11 million visa applicants each year to identify any connections to terrorism by comparing applicant data to classified data holdings in TIDE. This has reduced unwarranted counterterrorism security advisory opinions by 80 percent, saving the State Department millions of dollars annually. KFE is an interagency program with a secure online vetting platform that allows FBI, DHS, and the Terrorist Screening Center to participate in applicant reviews, ensuring a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The number of aliens denied visas under terrorist grounds has increased since the 1990s. Consular officers and the Secretary of State have the authority to revoke visas if the alien is ineligible or has overstayed their visa. The Foreign Affairs Manual instructs consular officers to enter an alien's name in the CLASS under a quasi-refusal code if warranted. DOS officials may prudentially revoke visas as a safety precaution, especially if U.S. law enforcement interests are involved. Consultation with law enforcement agencies and State officials is required before a visa revocation is made to avoid compromising legal or intelligence investigations. Visa revocation under the INA \u00a7237(a)(1)(B) may compromise legal or intelligence investigations, leading law enforcement to monitor individuals for further inquiry. The DOS regulations allow consular officers to revoke nonimmigrant visas at their discretion, with limited judicial review available if revocation is the sole basis for removal. Provisional revocation is also permitted for safety reasons, following consultation with relevant authorities. The Secretary or designated official can provisionally revoke a nonimmigrant visa to assess eligibility. The revocation has the same effect as any other visa revocation under INA 221(i). Consular officers must notify the visa holder of the revocation if possible, but once entered into the system, the visa is no longer valid for travel to the US. Revoked visas are physically canceled in writing. The regulations allow for physically canceling visas by writing or stamping \"REVOKED\" on the visa. The failure to physically cancel the visa does not affect the revocation's validity. These regulations address concerns about timely information transmission among federal agencies. Homeland Security Act \u00a7428 gives the Secretary of DHS authority to assign employees to diplomatic and consular posts for security threat advice and training. The Visa Security Program (VSP) was established by statutory language to review and investigate visa applications, with ICE special agents operating in high-risk consular posts to enhance visa screening with law enforcement resources. The first VSP units were set up in Saudi Arabia, as mandated by HSA \u00a7428, and there are currently 21 units in over a dozen countries. The Visa Security Program (VSP) was established to screen visa applicants in high-risk consular posts, with ICE agents using resources like TECS to assess risk profiles. VSP agents collaborate with consular officers, conduct additional vetting on potential matches, and monitor threats to the visa process. The Visa Security Program (VSP) collaborates with consular officers to screen visa applicants in high-risk posts. VSP has implemented the PATRIOT screening system for automated visa application checks. Concerns have been raised about the balance of power between the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in visa security. Some argue that visa issuance is crucial for homeland security against terrorists, suggesting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should have the primary responsibility instead of the Department of State (DOS). Others are satisfied with the current law, believing it strikes a balance between the two departments. Proponents of DOS leading visa issuances argue that consular officers have the necessary country-specific knowledge, and staffing 250 diplomatic posts worldwide would overwhelm DHS. The 114th Congress has been concerned about visa security issues, especially after the Paris terrorist attacks. Legislation includes visa security provisions, with the House Committee on the Judiciary ordering the reporting of Title IV of the Michael Davis, Jr. in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act (H.R. 1148), giving the Secretary of Homeland Security exclusive authority over consular officers' functions. The bill aims to broaden exceptions to confidentiality requirements for sharing information with foreign governments related to visa eligibility. It also narrows the Department of State's authority to waive personal interviews for visa applicants and adds national security as a reason for requiring interviews. H.R. 1148 would give consular officers the authority to skip interviews for ineligible visa applicants and allow DHS to refuse or revoke visas for security reasons. It aims to expand the Visa Security Program by requiring onsite reviews of visa applications at high-risk posts and expedited placement of DHS personnel at overseas embassies. In the previous Congress, a similar bill (H.R. 2278) with visa security provisions did not pass. The Senate-passed immigration reform bill did not include visa security provisions, but focused on enhanced visa processing. Visa security is crucial in preventing terrorist travel to the US, especially after the Paris attacks. It relies on proactive intelligence and monitoring to identify security threats. Efforts are being made to improve intelligence gathering for better visa security. Some argue for expanding sharing visa information with foreign governments to enhance intelligence gathering, while others stress the need to protect personal privacy. There are concerns about oversight and the potential for data misuse. The debate also includes whether to broaden visa security procedures to all foreign nationals, with warnings of possible travel hurdles. Critics highlight flaws in the current visa issuance process that need addressing. Some argue for expanding sharing visa information with foreign governments to enhance intelligence gathering, while others stress the need to protect personal privacy. Concerns about oversight and potential data misuse exist. Critics see holes in the current visa issuance process that should be addressed, such as limiting circumstances for waiving personal interviews. Congressional oversight of visa security is ongoing, with possible legislative reforms under consideration. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 resolved issues regarding visa issuance functions, but concerns over department roles and responsibilities persist. The powers and duties of the Secretary of State in the Immigration and Nationality Act are delineated in \u00a7104. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives consular officers the authority to issue visas, with decisions not being appealable. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 aimed to improve visa issuance and immigration inspections after 9/11. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 aimed to improve the visa issuance process abroad and immigration inspections at the border. It increased consular officers' access to electronic information for alien screening, required the development of an interoperable electronic data system, and mandated biometric identifiers on visas issued by October 2004. Additionally, it expanded training requirements for consular officers issuing visas. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 designated the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with the authority to formulate regulations on visa issuances. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Secretary of DHS exclusive authority to issue regulations, administer, and enforce immigration laws related to consular officers' functions in visa issuance. DHS could assign staff to consular posts abroad for advice and investigations. DOS's Consular Affairs remained responsible for visa issuance. The 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined their respective responsibilities in visa issuances. DOS could propose and issue visa regulations with DHS consultation and approval, while DHS would assign personnel to diplomatic posts based on DOS decisions. The Secretary of State retains key responsibilities related to visa decisions, including establishing validity periods and fees based on reciprocity. Consultation with Homeland Security is required for extending validity periods, and Homeland Security can restrict certain individuals from maximum validity for security reasons. The Secretary also has authority over foreign policy-related grounds for visa denial, including denial for those who have confiscated American citizens' property without compensation. The MOU acknowledges the Secretary's control over officers in their chain of command. The MOU recognizes the Secretary of State's control over officers in his chain of command. DHS officers abroad may provide input on consular officer evaluations, but the evaluations will be written by State Department supervisors. All officers, including DHS, come under the authority of the Chief of Mission. DHS officers in Saudi Arabia review visa applications before adjudication as required by law. The Secretary of DHS has the authority to assign officers to diplomatic and consular posts, providing assistance, advice, and training on fraudulent documents and fingerprinting techniques. DHS officers have access to various law enforcement databases for visa security purposes. The Visa Security Program (VSP) was established in 2004 through a MOU between DHS and DOS, outlining support, security, and training for personnel assigned overseas. A 2011 MOU further defined roles and collaboration between VSP agents, consular officers, and diplomatic security officers in daily operations at posts. This included collaboration between ICE and State, responsibilities of VSP agents and consular officers, and formal training by VSP agents for U.S. government officials at post. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated improvements in technology and training for detecting and combating terrorist travel, based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. This included collaboration between diplomatic security officers and VSP agents on fraud investigations. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required the Secretary of State to establish a Visa and Passport Security Program and mandated in-person consular interviews for most nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 14 to 79. Applicants must accurately respond to all information requests in their application."
