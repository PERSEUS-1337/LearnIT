    "content": "Both the House and Senate have rules requiring committees to submit reports detailing their activities. These reports serve as records of legislative and oversight actions, providing valuable information for Members of Congress and staff. The activity reports of congressional committees serve as public records of their actions and provide insight into their role in legislative oversight. These reports also highlight differences in committees' internal structure, norms, and operations. The CRS report will cover the purpose, history, required contents, rules for filing, types of information included, variations in organization, and provisions for additional views. The committee activity reports serve as public records of congressional committees' actions, providing insight into their legislative oversight role. They highlight differences in committees' internal structure, norms, and operations. The reports include supplemental, minority, additional, or dissenting views, historical changes to House and Senate Rules, differences from other congressional publications, and examples of information found in each publication. The development of these reports is tied to congressional reform and reorganization efforts. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 reorganized the House and Senate committee system, requiring standing committees to monitor the execution of laws within their jurisdiction. This led to the regular publication of committee activity reports outlining their activities. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 transformed the function of committees to provide for \"legislative review\" and required standing committees to review and study the application of laws within their jurisdiction. This act also formalized the requirement for periodic activity reports. The requirement for committee activity reports every two years was established to appraise legislation results and emphasize the House's legislative review function. House Rules mandate that these reports include summaries of legislative and oversight activities, authorization plans, actions taken, recommendations made, and additional oversight activities. The committee activity reports must include summaries of legislative and oversight activities, actions taken, recommendations made, and any hearings held on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement topics. Senate Rules do not specify required contents but mention activities under Senate Rule XXVI(8)(a). Each standing committee (except the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget) must review and study the application, administration, and execution of laws within their jurisdiction. House and Senate reports are filed every odd-numbered year by January 2, with a House chair able to file the report after sine die adjournment or December 15 of an even-numbered year. Committee approval is not required for the report, but it must be available to members for at least seven days. House committee activity reports must be available to each committee member for at least seven calendar days. The House Ethics Committee includes a transmittal letter signed by both the chair and ranking minority member. Some committees include a disclaimer in their transmittal letters. Senate committees must file reports by March 31, except for the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Budget Committee, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regularly files activity reports, which may vary in organization and detail. Committees must adopt their own rules, which may further address the filing process for these reports. Individual chairs can influence the content and priorities of the reports, leading to variations in organization and information covered. Comparisons across committees or time periods using only these reports may be challenging due to these variations. Some House committee activity reports are organized by topic or full committee and subcommittee activities. They may include an overview, a foreword from the committee chair, subcommittee information, and staff listings. Reports are required to include any additional views from committee members, but the frequency of these views varies among committees. For example, the Committees on Homeland Security, Rules, Education and the Workforce, and House Administration often include additional views in their reports. The inclusion of additional views in committee activity reports varies among different committees, with some including them frequently and others rarely. Senate Rules do not specifically address the inclusion of additional views. Committees have broad discretion in preparing their reports, leading to variations in the level of detail provided, including lists of actions, descriptions, analysis, and appendices. Some reports even contain full-text reproductions of documents, correspondence, or publications. The activity reports for the House and Senate committees vary in length and content, providing an overview of issues within their jurisdiction, actions taken, and work produced. They may include committee publications, hearings information, public statements, press releases, \"Dear Colleague\" letters, and committee resolutions. The use of committee resolutions may differ but can involve internal agreements on rules, plans, or organization. Committees may consider resolutions specific to their jurisdiction, correspondence with officials, views and estimates on budgetary matters, minority comments, jurisdictional agreements, member or staff travel details, consultant contracts approval, committee witnesses information, and Senate-specific activities. The curr_chunk discusses activities specific to Senate committees, including consideration of treaties and nominations, roles and responsibilities of certain committees, investigations, support from the Government Accountability Office, special studies, regulatory review efforts, and examinations into waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. The curr_chunk provides information on committee activity reports, including details on regulatory review efforts, publications by committee members, and statistical summaries of committee meetings. Since 1970, one report has been required each Congress, with the House recently reverting to issuing one report at the end of each Congress. The House Rules require committee activity reports at the end of each Congress. Since the 94th Congress, all House committees have been required to submit these reports, except for a few exempt committees before that. The House Rules mandate committee activity reports at the end of each Congress, with exceptions for certain committees. The exception for some committees was removed in 1974 with the adoption of H.Res. 988. The Senate Budget Committee was exempted from the reporting requirement in 1974. Both the House and Senate produce various publications documenting their activities. The House and Senate produce various publications documenting their activities, including committee reports, documents, and online resources. Committee activity reports provide discussion, analysis, and statistics, aggregating information about a committee's actions retrospectively."
