Congress recognizes the need to disseminate information and provide incentive grants to establish programs offering care management to individuals awaiting discharge from hospitals, in order to provide long-term health care services in home- and community-based settings as an alternative to nursing home care. Congress recognizes the need to provide long-term care services in home- and community-based settings as an alternative to nursing home placement. SEC. 3. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INCENTIVE GRANTS TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOSPITAL LINKAGE PROGRAMS. This section adds a new provision to provide information, assistance, and grants for the development of hospital linkage programs. The Secretary will compile, evaluate, publish, and disseminate information to assist in replicating successful care management programs for hospitalized individuals needing long-term care. Incentive grants will be provided to support the development of hospital linkage programs by public and private agencies. Incentive grants are awarded to assist agencies in developing programs that facilitate the discharge of individuals from hospitals to home- and community-based settings. Eligible entities include State agencies under the Older Americans Act or responsible for home and community care programs under title XIX of the Social Security Act. To be eligible for an incentive grant, an entity must submit an application assessing the need for programs to transition individuals from hospitals to home- and community-based care. This includes providing individually tailored services. The curr_chunk discusses the need for planned, flexible services in home- and community-based settings instead of nursing homes or institutions. It also mentions the establishment of a program to identify individuals in hospitals who require individualized long-term care in non-institutional settings. Additionally, it emphasizes that case management agencies funded under grants should not directly provide home- and community-based services. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for community-based long-term care services, including availability, individualized care, program continuation after grant termination, and any necessary waivers or approvals. The curr_chunk discusses the need for waivers or approvals to expand federally funded home- and community-based long term care programs to ensure adequate services are available. Preferences are given to entities that can coordinate activities with individualized care programs when awarding grants. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of grants for home- and community-based long term care programs, ensuring equitable distribution and availability of services. The grants for home- and community-based long term care programs can be used for projects in urban and rural areas, including expanding existing hospital linkage programs or establishing new ones. The Secretary will expedite waiver applications under title XIX of the Social Security Act for grant applicants to meet required assurances. Grant recipients can use the funds for planning, development, evaluation services, and service provision. The grants aim to support home- and community-based long-term care programs by providing reimbursements for case managers in selected hospitals. These case managers would identify patients in need of personalized care, develop care plans with hospital discharge planning staff, and arrange for community care post-hospitalization or nursing home stay. No direct services other than case management are covered by the grant funds. Grants awarded under this section are for terms of less than 3 years and shall not exceed $300,000 per year per entity. The funds cannot be used to supplant existing State funds. The Secretary may waive the amount limitation if justified by the number of hospitals or individuals to be served. The entity receiving a grant must evaluate the effectiveness of services in facilitating the transition of individuals from hospitals to home- and community-based care. A report with relevant information must be submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary will also prepare a report on the grant activities by the end of the third fiscal year. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on evaluations and reports conducted under paragraph (1). Authorization of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year 1994 through 1996 is provided for this section."
