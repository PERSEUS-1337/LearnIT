    "content": "Morning hour debates were introduced in the 103rd Congress on February 23, 1994, for a 90-day trial period to provide a platform for non-legislative debates following new restrictions on special order speeches. The trial period was later extended for the remainder of the Congress, and continued in the 104th Congress with slight modifications. Morning hour debates on Tuesdays after the first Tuesday in May are governed by a unanimous consent agreement in the House, not provided for in the rules. The agreement establishes the days and meeting times for these debates in the 111th Congress. During morning hour debates, Members must follow the unanimous consent agreement, House rules, precedents, and Speaker's policies on House procedure. Morning hour debates lack established precedents due to being a new feature. Speaker's policies cover decorum, electronic votes, and recognition for speeches, excluding recognition in morning hour debates governed by the unanimous consent agreement. During morning hour debates, House-controlled television cameras are restricted from panning the chamber. These debates occur on Mondays and Tuesdays, with Monday debates starting 90 minutes earlier than the regular session time. The length and start time are determined by a joint leadership unanimous consent agreement. The hour debate period begins at 10:30 a.m. on Monday mornings and can last up to one hour, with 30 minutes of debate on each side. Tuesday morning hour debates follow a similar format, but start 60 minutes earlier after May 18, 2009, lasting 50 minutes with 25 minutes allocated to each side. These procedures were established in a joint leadership unanimous consent agreement in 1995 to accommodate the chamber's practice of convening earlier for legislative business after early May. The House conducts morning hour debates on Tuesdays after early May when the chamber meets at 10:00 a.m. If the meeting hour is later, debates follow the same format as Monday mornings. After debates, the House recesses until the scheduled meeting hour, where daily rituals like prayer and approval of the previous day's Journal take place. The majority and minority leaders provide the Speaker with a list allocating time for morning hour debates among party members. A majority party Representative may preside as \"Speaker pro tempore\" during debates. During morning hour debates, the \"Speaker pro tempore\" alternates recognition between majority and minority members for speeches limited to five minutes. Reservations for debate time are made through party leadership, with Democratic Representatives through the Office of the Minority Leader and Republican Members through the Republican cloakroom or party leadership desk on the House floor. Reservations can be made no earlier than one week before the speech date. During morning hour debates, Members reserve varying amounts of time to deliver speeches on a wide range of topics, including eulogies, policy issues, and announcements relevant to the day's session. The chairman of the Rules Committee has used this time to announce emergency meetings. During morning hour debates, Members use this time to disseminate information among colleagues, similar to how one-minute speeches are used as a visual \"Dear Colleague\" letter. Party Members may deliver speeches on specific bills or policy issues, coordinating their use of morning hour debates. This is akin to how parties utilize \"leadership special orders\" to focus on a particular theme with participation from other Members."
