    "content": "Three versions of the homebuyer tax credits were enacted since 2008, with the most recent one costing $10.8 billion over 10 years. The tax credit was extended and expanded to repeat homebuyers, increasing its value and expiration date. The first-time homebuyer tax credit was intended to reduce excess inventory of homes and stabilize falling home prices. Recent data suggests home prices may be stabilizing and inventory returning to normal levels. While the tax credit may have contributed to these improvements, correlation does not imply causation. Falling home prices and low mortgage rates also likely influenced more homebuyers to enter the market. This report provides an economic analysis of the homebuyer tax credit. The economic analysis of the homebuyer tax credit includes an overview of the tax credit, data on credits claimed, market conditions review, and analysis of the effect on mortgage payments. Estimates of home purchases attributable to the tax credit are compared to industry estimates, with a focus on supporting the housing market moving forward. The original (HERA) version applied to first-time buyers purchasing a home between April 8, 2008, and January 1, 2009. Eligible buyers received a refundable credit equal to 10% of a home's value. The 2008 first-time homebuyer tax credit allowed a refundable credit of up to 10% of a home's purchase price, with income limits for eligibility. Repayment of the tax credit is spread over 15 years, making it an interest-free loan with annual repayments equal to one-fifteenth of the original credit amount. The 2008 first-time homebuyer tax credit was refundable, allowing lower-income households to benefit fully. Repayment of the tax credit is spread over 15 years, with annual repayments equal to one-fifteenth of the original credit amount. If the home is sold or no longer used as the principal residence, the entire tax credit must be repaid in the year of the change. The second version of the homebuyer tax credit, passed in February 2009, was available for first-time buyers who purchased a home between January 1, 2009, and November 6, 2009. The credit amount was up to $8,000, based on 10% of the home's purchase price. Income limits applied, with reduced credit for individuals earning over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers). The third version, WHBAA, was for purchases made after November 6, 2009, with a binding contract required by May 1, 2010, and completion by July 1, 2010 to qualify for the credit. The homebuyer tax credit, known as WHBAA, is available for first-time and repeat homebuyers. First-time buyers can receive up to $8,000, while repeat buyers can get up to $6,500. Income limits apply, with reduced credit for those earning over $150,000 ($225,000 for joint filers). The credit is not available for homes priced over $800,000. Special rules apply for members of the Armed Forces and certain individuals. The homebuyer tax credit, known as WHBAA, is available for first-time and repeat homebuyers, with special rules for members of the Armed Forces and certain individuals. The requirement to repay the tax credit if the home is no longer used as the principal residence within three years is waived for certain individuals on qualified official extended duty. Deadlines for the tax credit have been extended for individuals serving on qualified official extended duty outside the US. The deadline for home purchases to qualify for the credit was extended to September 30, 2010, with a binding contract required before May 1, 2010. The Homebuyer Assistance and Improvement Act of 2010 extended the deadline for home purchases to qualify for the tax credit to September 30, 2010, with a binding contract required before May 1, 2010. Homebuyers can elect to treat an eligible purchase as occurring in the previous year for tax purposes, allowing them to claim the tax credit more quickly. This provision enables homebuyers in 2009 to claim the credit on a 2008 tax return by filing an amended return, and homebuyers in 2010 to claim the credit on a 2009 tax return. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has released conditions for monetizing the first-time homebuyer tax credit. The tax credit can be monetized through a loan or purchase, but only with an FHA-insured mortgage. It cannot be used for the FHA required down payment, but can be used for additional down payment, mortgage rate buy down, or closing costs. The IRS has reported that 1.4 million first-time homebuyers claimed $10 billion in tax credits, with most claims for the $7,500 credit. California, Florida, and Texas accounted for 28% of the credits claimed. The IRS data shows that tax credits claimed were concentrated in California, Florida, and Texas, with no other state accounting for more than 4% of claims. The average credit amount ranged from $6,540 to $7,377. The effectiveness of the credit in stimulating home purchases is uncertain, as some claimants may have been incentivized by the credit while others may have claimed it fraudulently. Recent reports suggest that some individuals may have fraudulently claimed the homebuyer tax credit. The IRS data includes four months of first-time homebuyer activity that may not have been influenced by the credit. The credit was enacted on July 30, 2008, but could be claimed retroactively for purchases as far back as April 9, 2008. Those who claimed the credit retroactively may not have been incentivized by it. This section provides a summary of current housing market conditions and identifies risks moving forward. The first-time homebuyer tax credit was extended and expanded to repeat buyers to support the housing market and stimulate the economy. Current conditions show signs of stabilizing home prices. The S&P/Case-Shiller and FHFA home price indexes indicate a temporary halt in declines. Home prices have shown signs of stabilization after a period of decline. The Case-Shiller index remained steady between March and May 2009 before increasing in June and July. The FHFA index has also been relatively flat since November 2008. Different markets have experienced varying price behaviors, with some still falling while others are on the rise. Home prices in low-, mid-, and high-priced markets are starting to converge, indicating stabilization. Home prices across different price tiers are starting to stabilize, with low-priced markets seeing the fastest increase. However, prices in all tiers have not yet moved uniformly in every region, suggesting potential further price corrections. Foreclosures in the high-end market are on the rise, with reports indicating a significant increase compared to previous years. The increase in home prices at the higher end is driven by foreclosures and rising unemployment, leading to a delay in stabilization. Foreclosures are rising in the higher-end market, while the lower-priced market is close to stabilizing. The housing inventory is returning to a more normal level, currently standing at a 7.0 months supply. The existing home inventory is at a 7.0 months supply, down from 11.0 months in November 2008. New home inventory stands at 6.7 months supply, down from 13.3 months in January 2009. Indicators suggest the housing market may be stabilizing, with pending home sales rising for the sixth straight month. Builder confidence for single family homes is also increasing. Home building activity remains weak despite improving builder confidence. Housing starts were at 598,000 in August 2009, well below the historical average of 1.5 million. Affordability has improved, with homeownership near its highest level in 18 years. First-time buyers find homeownership more affordable due to falling home prices and low mortgage rates. This increased affordability could attract more buyers to the market. Mortgage rates play a crucial role in home buying activity. Despite rising slightly initially, rates fell after the homebuyer tax credit was enacted and modified. This led to increased home buying as rates dropped to around 5.0%. The impact of mortgage rates on encouraging home purchases is discussed in the economic analysis section. The economic analysis section discusses the impact of foreclosure rates on home buying. Initially concentrated among subprime borrowers, the issue now affects prime borrowers as well. Despite facing more scrutiny from lenders, prime borrowers are now experiencing rising foreclosure rates due to falling home prices and increasing unemployment since late 2007. In late 2007, foreclosure rates among prime and FHA borrowers have been increasing, driven by elevated unemployment. High unemployment rates, such as the 10.2% in October 2009, can hinder housing market recovery. Elevated unemployment may lead to a decrease in home buying activity and a rise in foreclosure rates, putting pressure on home prices. The housing market was under pressure due to high unemployment rates leading to a decrease in home buying activity and foreclosures. However, there are signs of stabilization in home prices and inventory. The analysis questions if the first-time homebuyer tax credit was the cause of the market improvement, noting that correlation does not imply causation. Factors like falling home prices and low mortgage rates may have also influenced homebuyer activity. The effects of home prices, mortgage rates, and the tax credit on a typical buyer's mortgage payment are examined. The analysis questions the impact of the first-time homebuyer tax credit on the housing market, suggesting that home prices and mortgage rates may have played a more significant role in reducing the cost of homeownership. Estimates of additional first-time purchases attributed to the tax credit are compared to industry estimates, raising questions about its effectiveness. The analysis also evaluates the potential effects of extended tax credits on supporting the housing market. The analysis estimated the impact of falling prices and mortgage rates on the typical buyer's mortgage payment. Assumptions were made regarding the peak of the housing market, with discrepancies in home price indices. The analysis questions the effectiveness of the first-time homebuyer tax credit in comparison to the effects of home prices and mortgage rates on reducing homeownership costs. The housing market peak was chosen as January 2007, with discrepancies in peak times among indices. Home price decreases were calculated using different indices, and the first-time homebuyer tax credit was assumed to lower purchase prices effectively. The $7,500 tax credit available in 2008 must be repaid, reducing its impact on a home's purchase price. After repayment, it was estimated to lower a home's purchase price by $2,104 or 1.0%. The $8,000 ARRA tax credit for 2009 homebuyers was straightforward in lowering purchase prices. Table 2 shows the estimation results for both tax credits. At the peak of the housing market, a potential buyer of a median price home would have had to make a monthly mortgage payment of $1,293. Home prices decreased by an average of 11% from the peak to when the tax credit was enacted. The decrease in home prices from $210,600 to $187,595, or an average of 11%, reduced a potential buyer's mortgage payment by $141 a month, or $1,694 annually. Mortgage interest rates increased slightly from 6.22% to 6.43%, raising a buyer's monthly payment by $29 and annual payment by $346. The HERA homebuyer tax credit lowered a typical first-time homebuyer's mortgage payment by about $13 a month or $156 annually. The $7,500 tax credit had less impact on reducing mortgage payments compared to falling home prices. The total effect of falling home prices, mortgage rates, and the 2008 tax credit resulted in a typical homebuyer's mortgage payment decreasing by $129 a month or $1,544 a year compared to the peak of the housing market. The ARRA version of the homebuyer tax credit, available in February 2009, combined with the 19% average home price decline, decreased a typical homebuyer's monthly mortgage payment by $247 and annual payment by $2,970. Additionally, the decrease in mortgage rates starting in mid-2008 further reduced the median mortgage payment by $145 a month. The 2009 homebuyer tax credit reduced median mortgage payments by $145 a month or $1,743 annually. Compared to the HERA version, the ARRA tax credit had a larger impact on homeownership costs. It was estimated to have one-fifth the impact of falling home prices and one-third the effect of lower mortgage rates. Home prices and mortgage rates were eight times more powerful at lowering costs than the tax credit, making them the primary incentives for home purchases. Unlike the tax credit, which only benefited first-time buyers. Lower home prices and mortgage rates played a larger role in stabilizing the housing market than the tax credit, benefiting all buyers. The Case-Shiller index fell significantly in bubble-prone markets before the tax credit's enactment. Prices in harder hit markets like Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco fell by up to 30% before the tax credit, and up to 50% before its modification. The effect of falling home prices in these markets could reduce the relative impact of the tax credit. Smaller housing markets in the Midwest saw smaller price declines compared to larger \"bubble\" markets, where prices were already lower than the national average. Understanding regional differences in price declines is crucial for a comprehensive analysis. Understanding regional differences in falling home prices is crucial for analyzing the impact of the homebuyer tax credit. Markets with the largest home inventories saw significant price declines, which may have been a stronger incentive for home purchases than the tax credit itself. The estimates in Table 2 were based on national median purchase prices at the peak of the market, showing similar effects regardless of when the tax credit was modified. Estimates of price elasticity for home purchases range from -0.5 to -1.0, indicating that home sales increase by 0.5% to 1.0% for every 1.0% decrease in home prices. This allows for estimating the additional home sales attributable to the tax credit. The CRS estimated number of additional home purchases attributable to the ARRA and WHBAA versions of the tax credit is reported in Table 3. Estimates were based on varying price elasticity values of -0.5, -1.0, and -1.5, considering buyer responsiveness to price changes. The ARRA and WHBAA tax credits were estimated to result in additional home purchases, with private industry analysts providing higher estimates than those reported by the CRS. Industry estimates likely consider a \"trade-up\" effect for existing homeowners. The ARRA and WHBAA tax credits led to additional home purchases, with industry analysts estimating a \"trade-up\" effect for existing homeowners. However, the exact methodology and assumptions behind these estimates are unclear. The ARRA version of the homebuyer tax credit aimed to reduce the total home inventory by 4% to 8%, from a 9.7 months supply to between 8.9 to 9.3 months supply. The impact of this reduction on stabilizing the housing market may have been limited, considering the high inventory levels. Additionally, the tax credit's effect on home purchases may have been smaller compared to the influence of lower home prices and mortgage rates. The combined effect of falling home prices and mortgage rates on a buyer's mortgage payment was significant, benefiting all homebuyers. The improvements in the housing market around the time of the tax credit may have been more due to lower prices and interest rates. The extended tax credit aims to support the housing market and stimulate the economy. The tax credit expansion to repeat buyers may increase home buying activity and stabilize the housing market sooner. The temporary nature of the credit is crucial to prevent price increases and maintain buyer incentives. The tax credit expansion to repeat buyers may have limited stimulative effect on home buying activity due to higher home prices and reduced credit amounts for repeat buyers. This could potentially reduce the incentive for repeat buyers to take advantage of the tax credit. The tax credit expansion to repeat buyers may not effectively stimulate home buying activity, especially if low home prices and mortgage rates are the main drivers. Rising foreclosure rates, driven by increasing unemployment, pose a significant threat to the housing market. The tax credit may not directly address this issue, potentially limiting its impact on preventing foreclosures. The expanded tax credit may reduce the time foreclosed homes are on the market, but lower home prices remain the main factor for buyers. Appendices provide details on tax credits claimed, regional home prices, and methods for estimating additional home purchases due to the tax credits. The NAR reported 4,913,000 existing home purchases and the Census Bureau reported 485,000 new home purchases in 2008, totaling 5,398,000 home purchases. First-time buyers accounted for 40% of purchases, estimated at 2,159,200. The ARRA homebuyer tax credit reduced home prices by 4.76%. The WHBAA homebuyer tax credit reduced home prices by 4.76%. The tax credit was estimated to reduce the purchase price for first-time buyers by 3.67% and for repeat buyers by 2.98%. The price elasticity of demand was used to estimate the annual increase in home purchases. The tax credits induced price reductions leading to an increase in home purchases. The ARRA tax credit resulted in 51,348 to 154,045 additional first-time purchases, while the WHBAA tax credit led to 39,600 to 118,801 first-time purchases and 48,263 to 144,788 repeat home purchases. Overall, the WHBAA tax credit resulted in 87,863 to 263,589 additional home purchases. The tax credits induced price reductions, leading to an increase in home purchases. The ARRA tax credit was enacted in February and set to expire in December 2009, while the WHBAA tax credit was enacted in November 2009 and set to expire in July 2010. The results reported in Table 3 were calculated by adjusting the annual increase in home purchases attributable to each tax credit based on the months they were available."
