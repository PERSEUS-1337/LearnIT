This report adopts a functional definition to analyze sectors typically labeled as \"shadow banking,\" excluding insured deposits of chartered banks. Both banking and shadow banking offer financial intermediation services. Simple banking, also known as illuminated banking, involves gathering funds through deposits, holding special charters as depositories, offering loans, and holding the loans they originate. This is in contrast to shadow banking, which provides financial intermediation with a reliance on securities markets to fund loans. Shadow banking involves firms and activities that deviate from traditional banking by providing financial intermediation through methods such as using repos as a substitute for deposits and offering loans without holding them. This contrasts with illuminated banking, which follows a more traditional \"originate-to-hold\" model of depository banking. The second shadow banking example shows non-bank intermediaries as a substitute for firms with special bank charters, while the third example involves selling loans through securitization. The five shadow banking sectors listed will be further analyzed in the policy section to understand their role in financial intermediation compared to traditional banking. The Repo Market is highlighted as a method for chartered banks and nonbanks to borrow funds through repurchase agreements, similar to a loan and interest arrangement. The repo market functions like a loan and interest arrangement, allowing financial firms to gather funds from savers. Chartered banks can use repo markets to fund lending activities, resembling traditional banking. Non-bank firms can also borrow and lend through repos, similar to illuminated banking. The ice cream shop in Pennsylvania offered banking services through deposits and loans. Financial intermediation can be similar to traditional banking when firms fund themselves with deposit-like loans while extending credit or purchasing debt. Commercial paper allows firms to borrow without going to banks, issuing marketable debt like asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) collateralized by commercial loans. ABCP represents short-term borrowing used to fund longer-term commercial debt, not funded by deposits and can involve acquiring commercial loans. Securitization allows banks to sell loans to other banks or nonbanks and fund them by issuing securities, different from traditional banking. Securitization by banks involves intermediaries interacting with borrowers, not savers. It can also enable lending by nonbanks. Money Market Mutual Funds gather funds from investors to buy low-risk short-term debt in securities markets, operating similarly to banks but without a bank charter. Investor withdrawals from MMFs are similar to depositor withdrawals from banks. Loan defaults on an MMF have similarities to loan defaults on a bank. Various \"banking\" charters in the US, including credit unions and thrifts, accept insured deposits and offer loans. IDIs, which include banks, credit unions, and thrifts, can engage in shadow banking activities like repurchase agreements. The United States has a shadow banking sector that includes activities like repurchase agreements and loan origination outside of traditional banking charters. Treasury borrowing is mainly conducted through shadow banking, with loans taking the form of bonds originated in securities markets. The size and growth of the shadow banking sector are not clearly defined. The shadow banking sector in the United States is significant, funding most of the debt outstanding. Deposits at commercial banks have decreased, but began rising after the financial crisis. Shadow banking is a global phenomenon with varying permissible activities for chartered banks. The shadow banking sector in the United States is globally significant, with varying activities for chartered banks. The US holds the largest share of global nonbank assets, drawing attention from international institutions like the IMF and FSB. The US accounted for 44% of total world nonbank financial assets in 2005, but saw a decline post-financial crisis. The relative share of the U.S. shadow banking institutions declined to 35% of world nonbank assets post-financial crisis. The FSB study highlights the complexity of shadow banking's organizational structure and regulation. Various nonbank organizations engage in financial intermediation, with structured finance vehicles and money market funds holding significant portions of global assets. The shadow banking sector in the United States may exist due to historical or institutional reasons, such as restrictions on chartered banks' geographic reach and services. Financial markets evolved to aggregate funds through securities markets to assist large industrial enterprises. Savings associations in the eastern U.S. could buy whole loans from western financial institutions. The United States has a long tradition of funding debt through securities markets and illuminated banking. Shadow banking faces policy problems due to different bank-like functions. Economic vulnerabilities in financial intermediation can exist in shadow banking sectors. Luminated banks accept deposits to fund loans. One vulnerability in the banking system is credit risk, where borrowers may not repay loans, leading to solvency issues for both illuminated and shadow banks. The 2007-2009 mortgage crisis highlighted this risk, as mortgage defaults reduced the value of loans held by financial institutions, impacting their ability to lend and raising solvency concerns. The 2007-2009 mortgage crisis raised credit risk concerns in the banking system, impacting financial institutions' solvency and liquidity. Examples include the failure of IndyMac and the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Another issue faced by banks is interest rate risk due to maturity mismatch, where the bank's borrowing terms differ from its lending terms. Interest rate risk is a significant concern for banks, especially when interest rates rise. This can lead to higher interest payments on deposits while still receiving lower rates on loans, causing sustainability issues. Additionally, the market value of fixed-rate bonds held by banks decreases with rising interest rates, resulting in capital losses. Mortgage-related interest rate risk was evident in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with significant capital losses estimated in 1981. Shadow banks, like traditional banks, face similar risks with maturity mismatches between short-term obligations and long-term assets. The 2007-2009 mortgage crisis further highlighted the complexities of interest rate risk in the banking sector. During the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis, assessing interest rate risk was challenging as policy rates fell, but spreads widened for private firms. Shadow banks with maturity mismatches faced vulnerabilities similar to savings and loans in the past. Maintaining liquidity is crucial for banks, as even with sound assets, a sudden withdrawal of funds by depositors could lead to problems. During the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis, shadow banking activities faced liquidity problems due to uncertainty in the mortgage market, causing assets to become less liquid and difficult to sell without discounts. Like traditional banks, shadow banking can also experience liquidity issues when trying to convert assets to cash quickly. During the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis, shadow banking faced liquidity issues as assets became less liquid, making it harder for investors to fund illiquid assets. Gary Gorton described the reduction in non-deposit liabilities as a nonbank run, highlighting information asymmetry in financial transactions. This asymmetry can lead to vulnerabilities and magnify financial risks. Information asymmetries can impact the quality of a bank's assets and its ability to screen loan applicants. This is particularly important for shadow banking relying on securities markets. During the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis, there was a decrease in private issuance of mortgage-related securities due to potential information asymmetries leading to a lack of trust in asset quality. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis, private issuance of mortgage-related securities dropped significantly, despite the majority of mortgage borrowers not defaulting. Collateralized bank lending, such as auto loans and residential mortgages, exposes lenders to fluctuations in collateral prices, leading to potential fire sales during declining house prices. During declining house prices, borrower defaults can lead to more houses being seized and sold at foreclosure sales, reinforcing the price decline. Shadow banking relying on collateral, like mortgage-backed securities, can also face self-reinforcing fire sales during crises, as seen in the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis. This can result in firms selling their assets at fire sale prices due to capital constraints. The vulnerabilities of financial intermediation during crises can lead to fire sales of assets at low prices, reinforcing price declines. Systemic risk arises when the financial system amplifies losses from a single institution to the wider economy. Excessive reliance on borrowing between financial intermediaries can weaken the overall resilience of the system. Financial intermediaries may not take enough precautions against interest rate risk, maintain a sufficient reserve of liquid assets, or diversify their collateral, leading to potential systemic risks. This lack of preparedness could result in a domino effect of financial firms needing to acquire additional funding simultaneously, impacting solvency. Shadow banking faces similar systemic concerns, where unexpected defaults could prompt a rush for liquidity and capital, potentially overestimating availability during stable periods. During bad times, financial firms may struggle to raise capital and maintain liquid assets, leading to a decline in interbank lending and higher interest rates. Shadow banking activities are diverse and not necessarily unregulated, but the regulations applied are different from traditional banking regulations. Banking regulation typically considers linkages between banks, securities regulation involves disclosure of risks but doesn't limit risk-taking by sophisticated market participants. Reform proposals for shadow banking aim to apply banking regulation principles to nonbank financial intermediaries. It's important to stabilize traditional banking before addressing specific shadow banking sectors. Bank regulators can enforce regulations to limit risks in chartered banks, focusing on credit and interest rate risks. Safety and soundness regulation allows examiners to assess assets and liabilities for potential issues and limit risks to individual counterparties or asset classes. Capital requirements are a key aspect of safety and soundness regulation in the banking system, ensuring that banks have enough equity to absorb losses before depositors and creditors are at risk. This helps address credit risk and establish resilience in the financial system. Risk-based capital requirements incentivize institutions to limit asset risk and evaluate loan types based on capital requirements. Higher capital requirements limit total assets held. Applying capital requirements to nonbank intermediaries is a proposed policy in shadow banking. A lender of last resort provides emergency loans during financial instability. The Federal Reserve System acts as a lender of last resort during financial turmoil, following the Bagehot Rule by providing emergency loans to solvent institutions at penalty rates. Good collateral may be required for lending, which insolvent firms may lack due to their liabilities exceeding assets. One critique of the 2008 financial crisis is that the lender of last resort should also lend to insolvent institutions if they are interconnected to the financial system. A policy proposal is to extend lender of last resort eligibility to shadow banking institutions. Financial intermediaries face the risk of a depositor run during times of financial panic, where funding sources may disappear, leading to an inability to fund assets. Deposit insurance provides assurance to bank depositors. Credible deposit insurance can prevent panic-driven depositor withdrawals and bank runs. Extending bank regulation principles to shadow banking is a proposed solution to regulate nonbank financial intermediation. Shadow banking involves financial intermediation outside traditional banks, funded by nondeposits. Various regulatory options exist, including regulating activities regardless of the firm type or addressing mispricing in shadow banking. Specific elements highlighted by various financial institutions include repurchase agreements, which are similar to banking deposits. A repurchase agreement is like a banking deposit where one party sells an asset to another party with an agreement to repurchase it at a higher price in the future. It is similar to a loan with the asset serving as collateral. Intermediaries can borrow funds through repos instead of insured deposits, potentially exposing them to interest rate risk. Tri-party repos involve a third party providing clearing and settlement services. The intermediary's assets are potentially exposed to interest rate risk and maturity mismatch in repurchase agreements, which are not eligible for deposit insurance like deposits. Nonbanks using repos for financial intermediation may face challenges without lender of last resort assistance. Repurchase agreements use assets as collateral, and doubts about their value can reduce funding availability. High repo defaults can lead to market dumping and fire sales, as seen during the financial crisis. Economist Gary Gorton has documented a nonbank run on firms relying on the repo market for financing. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is assessing repo vulnerability to runs. Liquidity and collateral constraints make repos susceptible to fire sales. Policy concerns include regulating nonbanks like banks if they rely on repos for intermediation. Dodd-Frank Act allows for this regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act allows for the regulation of nonbanks with more than $50 billion in assets designated as systemically important. Some propose reforming how repos are handled to prevent runs on failing firms. Repo contracts are exempt from the bankruptcy estate, reducing creditors' incentive to race for assets. The exemption from the automatic stay for repo agreements may have contributed to the nonbank run in the 2008 market. The FDIC can avoid bankruptcy for firms deemed a systemic risk under Title II of the DFA, even without over $50 billion in assets. Calls for reform in repo trade techniques have been made, including improving settlement system features and reducing credit risk in tri-party repos. Nonbank intermediaries, such as mortgage companies and investment firms, gather funds from savers to fund loans. They can partner to generate mortgages, sell short-term bonds, or fund themselves through repo transactions. The exact form of nonbank intermediation can vary greatly. Nonbank intermediaries like Fannie Mae and MF Global operate with varying regulatory oversight. During the mortgage crisis, nonbank intermediaries faced liquidity issues, leading to some failures. The evaluation of complex mortgage-related securities was hindered, contributing to price declines. Failing nonbanks are typically resolved through bankruptcy, treating creditors similarly. During the financial crisis, policymakers responded by setting up special lending facilities to support nonbanks like Bear Stearns and AIG, avoiding bankruptcy filings. Congress also enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, leading to a conservatorship of GSEs with curtailed returns on some securities. Nonbank intermediaries faced liquidity issues during the crisis, with failing ones typically resolved through bankruptcy. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) addresses the involvement of nonbanks in consumer loan originations through the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Nonbanks with over $50 billion in assets can be regulated for safety and soundness before a crisis, and even smaller nonbanks can be resolved by the FDIC if their failure poses a risk to financial stability. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate nonbanks in consumer loan originations. Nonbanks with over $50 billion in assets can be regulated for safety and soundness, and smaller nonbanks can be resolved by the FDIC if their failure poses a risk to financial stability. Title XI of the DFA limits the Federal Reserve's ability to provide emergency lending to a single nonbank, requiring more general eligibility criteria for future emergency lending facilities. Commercial paper is a type of security where commercial loans are funded through securities markets, with Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) being short-term debt securities backed by commercial loans issued by both banks and nonbanks. ABCP facilities receive fees for managing assets and providing emergency loans. During the housing bubble, ABCP financed part of the mortgage boom. In 2007, ABCP for subprime mortgages struggled to secure funding, leading to liquidity issues. Sponsors had to provide liquidity, revealing undisclosed subprime assets on balance sheets. The value of mortgage-related assets had to be written down, causing a liquidity crunch in late 2007 and early 2008. This uncertainty led to mistrust in the interbank lending market and fire sales of mortgages. The Federal Reserve created the Term Asset Backed Loan Facility (TALF) during the financial crisis to alleviate fire sales of ABCP assets. Policy changes and accounting revisions have been implemented to address future problems in ABCP, including FAS 166 and 167 amending FAS 140 to address concerns about asset sales to ABCP. Banking regulators have also revised capital treatment for contingent liabilities related to ABCP sponsorship. Securitization involves creating a trust that acquires assets with a stream of payments, like loans, and issuing new securities that pass through these payments to holders. This process can be applied to various payment streams, such as mortgages or credit card payments. Securitization involves creating a trust that acquires assets with a stream of payments, like loans, and issuing new securities that pass through these payments to holders. Chartered banks and nonbank lenders can participate in securitization by selling their loans. Private label firms typically do not include an issuer guarantee to cover credit risk, while government-sponsored enterprises do include a guarantee for credit risk. Securitization is believed to have contributed to the financial crisis, with differing views on how or why. The financial crisis was exacerbated by the collapse of the mortgage market, leading to the failure of mortgage finance companies and private label securitizers. Banks and firms suffered losses due to overestimating the safety of mortgage-backed securities. Insurers providing coverage for MBS securitization also failed, including monoline insurers and AIG. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced credit losses from the mortgages they securitized. In response to the financial crisis, Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in government conservatorship to cover credit losses from securitized mortgages. Legal challenges by defaulting homeowners delayed resolution of foreclosed homes, potentially prolonging surplus distressed homes in high-default areas. Changes were made to securitization practices, with new regulations established by the HERA and Dodd-Frank Act. The final fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remains uncertain, while private label securitization remains at low levels compared to pre-crisis times. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new regulations for securitization, including the creation of a new office within the SEC to regulate credit rating organizations. Financial derivatives used in securitized products must be standardized and cleared on an organized exchange. Firms sponsoring securitizations must retain a portion of the risk, and mortgages must meet certain standards for legal protections in case of default. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new regulations for securitization, including legal protections in case of default (QM rule) for securitized mortgages. Title X regulates consumer financial products like credit cards, mortgages, and student loans under the CFPB. Industry participants are concerned about regulatory uncertainty affecting securitization volume, especially for mortgages. Consistency between QM and QRM rules is desired, but legal contexts may pose challenges. The creation of a national mortgage database is seen as a potential solution to address uncertainty. The SEC describes money market funds (MMFs) as a type of mutual fund that invests in low-risk securities like government securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. MMFs raise funds by selling shares that are not insured. MMFs can be structured as open-ended or closed-ended, with the Net Asset Value (NAV) representing the difference between assets and liabilities. Investors aim to receive more than a dollar for every dollar invested in MMFs. MMFs aim to maintain a NAV above $1 to ensure investors receive positive returns. The industry faced a crisis after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008, causing a prominent MMF to \"break the buck.\" This led to a run on MMFs as investors withdrew their shares due to credit risk concerns. During the financial crisis, MMFs lost their traditional funding sources, leading to emergency measures to stabilize the industry. Treasury announced an insurance plan backed by the ESF, but Congress later prohibited its use for MMFs. Government assistance during crises may create moral hazard, encouraging excessive risk-taking. MMFs still face the risk of runs and other fundamental problems like credit risk and liquidity issues. The SEC's regulatory approach to Money Market Funds (MMFs) has shifted post-financial crisis, with calls for a more prudential regulatory approach similar to banking. Other financial regulators have urged the SEC to adopt additional regulations to address the potential for runs. The SEC proposed new rules for MMFs in June 2013, but final rules had not been issued as of the time of the report. The SEC proposed new rules for Money Market Funds in June 2013 to prevent runs in the industry. The rules included a floating net asset value for prime institutional funds and the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress. Additional diversification and disclosure measures were also part of the proposal. The concept of shadow banking involves debt funded by insured deposits of firms with special banking charters, facilitated by nonbanks through securities markets. This practice poses economic vulnerabilities related to financial intermediation, such as runs or fire-sales. While shadow banking is subject to federal regulation, the type of regulation varies between banking and securities regulation. Securities markets and firms with banking charters are both regulated entities in the shadow banking system. Securities regulation is not limited to firms with a special charter, unlike banking regulation. Bank holding companies involved in shadow banking are subject to prudential regulation. The FSOC and FSB have highlighted concerns with shadow banking practices. Policy proposals often aim to apply bank-like regulation to nonbanks, with the Dodd-Frank Act extending regulatory principles to designated systemically important nonbanks. There is debate over whether bank-like regulation is suitable for all nonbank firms, such as insurance companies. Some argue that the Dodd-Frank Act did not sufficiently regulate nonbank intermediaries, like MMFs, which could pose financial risks."
