    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Beginning on March 1, 2023, each licensing authority in California must submit an annual report to the Legislature detailing funds spent, number of licenses issued, and processing times for medical cannabis licensing. The annual report to the Legislature must include details on processing times for state license applications, appeals, complaints, enforcement activities, and disciplinary actions taken by licensing authorities. Section 11362.775 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 11362.775 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow qualified patients, caregivers, and collectives in California to cultivate cannabis for medical purposes without facing state criminal sanctions. Collectives operating under this section must comply with specific requirements to manufacture medical cannabis products without legal consequences. The amended Health and Safety Code allows collectives in California to manufacture medical cannabis products using solventless processes or closed-loop systems with safe solvents to prevent risks during the manufacturing process. The collective or cooperative must have a licensed engineer certify the closed-loop system meets engineering standards and safety codes, with a certification document containing a professional engineer's signature and stamp. Approval from the local fire official is required for the system and facility, meeting fire, safety, and building code requirements such as the California Fire Code. The collective or cooperative must comply with various standards including the California Fire Code, NFPA standards, IBC, and IFC. They also need a valid seller's permit and local license for manufacturing medical cannabis products. Section 11362.9 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define \"manufacturing\" as the process of producing medical cannabis products. This section will be in effect until licenses are issued under the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, and will be repealed one year after the issuance of licenses. The Legislature aims to commission scientific research on marijuana at the University of California to determine its medical efficacy and safety. The California Marijuana Research Program will conduct studies on marijuana's medical benefits and develop guidelines for its use. The California Marijuana Research Program will solicit research proposals focusing on marijuana's medical efficacy and safety. Proposals must include key personnel, outreach procedures for patients with medical conditions, a patient registry, and an information system for data collection and analysis. Proposals for the California Marijuana Research Program must include protocols for research on marijuana for patients with specific medical conditions, a specimen laboratory for studying cannabinoids, and an analysis laboratory for purity and cannabinoid content. The California Marijuana Research Program uses a peer review process based on the National Institutes of Health to evaluate proposals objectively and prevent biased funding. Peer reviewers are chosen for their expertise and lack of bias, judging proposals on scientific merit and potential bias in research design. The California Marijuana Research Program utilizes a peer review process to evaluate research proposals based on scientific expertise and lack of bias. Grant proposals approved by the program must also undergo review by a research advisory panel. The California Marijuana Research Program is intended to be established at one or more University of California campuses with experienced faculty in multidisciplinary scientific endeavors, particularly in clinical trials with psychopharmacologic agents. The program will follow principles similar to other statewide research programs, including peer review evaluation of grant applications. The California Marijuana Research Program will operate at University of California campuses and other postsecondary institutions with experts in conducting studies. Funds will be allocated to research studies based on a scientific plan developed by the Scientific Advisory Council. Requests for additional studies will be reviewed by the Council. The California Marijuana Research Program will fund studies based on available funding. All personnel implementing approved proposals must be authorized. Studies will focus on new scientific research on medical uses and hazards of marijuana, consulting with other agencies to avoid duplication. Efforts will be made to recruit qualified patients and physicians statewide, and employ state-of-the-art research methodologies. The marijuana studies will use state-of-the-art research methodologies and ensure the quality of marijuana used. If federal agencies fail to provide an adequate supply within six months, the Attorney General will provide it. The program may also approve studies by independent groups with valid protocols for medical research. The program will conduct clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of marijuana in patients with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, seizures, or muscle spasms. Research may expand to other serious illnesses if resources allow, focusing on different administration methods, dosage, timing, and cannabinoid effects. The program will conduct clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of marijuana in patients with various medical disorders, including its interaction with other drugs, different forms of administration, and effects on mental function in medically ill individuals. The program will focus on objective scientific research to determine the benefits of marijuana as part of medical treatment, without promoting social or recreational use. It will seek research protocol guidelines from the National Institutes of Health before approving proposals. The program conducting clinical trials on marijuana may proceed with its own research protocol guidelines if no approved guidelines are obtained within a year. Additionally, the program is allowed to seek funding from various sources to expand the scope of the studies, with a limit of 5% of its General Fund allocation for external funding efforts. The program conducting clinical trials on marijuana can seek external funding for research projects meeting specific requirements. Donors must understand funds will be used to study both benefits and detriments of marijuana. A report on the progress of the studies must be submitted to the Legislature, Governor, and Attorney General within six months. The program conducting clinical trials on marijuana must issue a report every six months to the Legislature detailing the progress of the studies, including data on diseases studied, patient enrollment, and any preliminary findings. The President of the University of California appoints a Scientific Advisory Council for policy guidance on the marijuana clinical trials program. The council members, chosen for scientific expertise, serve voluntarily with reimbursement for expenses. No more than 10% of funds can be used for administration. Implementation depends on funding from the Legislature."
