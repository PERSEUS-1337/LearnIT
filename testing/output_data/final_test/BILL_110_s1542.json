    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that up to $150 billion is needed for school repairs and renovations in the US, with 14 million students attending schools needing extensive repairs. $29 billion was spent on education infrastructure, with a new high school costing $27 million. Research shows a link between school facilities and student achievement. Research at Georgetown University shows that students in poor school conditions have lower test scores, with improvements of up to 20% seen when students move to better facilities. Many local educational agencies struggle to finance school improvements. The challenges in public schools and libraries require collaboration from all levels of government and communities to maintain the US's competitive position in the global economy. The state of collections in public school libraries in the United States has increased demands on public libraries, which often substitute for school libraries. Research shows that a child's intellectual development is crucial before age 4, and public and school libraries play a critical role in providing resources for early childhood development. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program allows the Secretary of Education to enter cooperative agreements with States to establish infrastructure banks for providing loans to local educational agencies for school construction or renovation. Grants are awarded to States for initial capital. Congress grants consent to States to establish a multistate infrastructure bank for school and library construction. Congress reserves the right to alter or repeal this section. Each infrastructure bank established under this section must use repayments to make additional loans. States creating an infrastructure bank must contribute at least 25% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources and appoint an operating entity capable of managing loan funds. The infrastructure bank must use repayments to make additional loans. States must contribute at least 25% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources and appoint an operating entity capable of managing loan funds. Contributions related to the grant allow funds to be used as reserves for debt issued by the State. Investment income generated by funds must be credited to the account, available for use in providing loans for eligible projects, and invested in approved financing instruments. Loans from the bank will bear interest. The infrastructure bank must ensure loans have low interest rates, timely repayment, and limited repayment terms. The bank must report annually to the Secretary and provide other required reports. Loans can be made to educational agencies or public libraries for project costs. The infrastructure bank offers loans to local educational agencies or public libraries for renovation projects. Applications must include a description of deficiencies to be corrected with loan funds. The infrastructure bank requires applicants to provide a description of deficiencies to be addressed, criteria for determining corrective actions, improvements to be made with cost estimates, energy conservation promotion plans, and any other information requested by the bank. An infrastructure bank must make a final decision on loan applications within 90 days. Criteria for loans include assessing the fiscal capacity of the applicant and the condition of the physical plant for educational agencies. The eligibility criteria for a loan from an infrastructure bank under this section include the need for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of schools based on safety concerns, enrollment growth, and the age of the facility. The eligibility criteria for a loan from an infrastructure bank include repair or upgrading of classrooms, increasing physical safety, enhancing access for individuals with disabilities, addressing environmental hazards, and providing basic infrastructure at educational facilities. The provision of basic infrastructure at educational facilities includes communications outlets, electrical systems, power outlets, and a communication closet. Work may also be done to bring facilities into compliance with environmental protection and health and safety programs, as well as hazardous waste treatment requirements. The Solid Waste Disposal Act and Davis-Bacon wage requirements apply to projects like energy efficiency improvements, asbestos hazard detection, and public library construction or upgrades in educational facilities. Additionally, guidelines for healthy high performance schools will be established after consultation with States. After consultation with States and consideration of green building standards, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will establish Healthy, High Performance School Guidelines for energy efficiency, renewable energy, water use, building materials, and indoor environmental quality for schools, educational facilities, and libraries. These guidelines will apply to local educational agencies or public libraries using a loan for new construction or renovation. The infrastructure bank loan for school or library construction projects must adhere to Healthy, High Performance School Guidelines. The loan should supplement, not replace, other available funds. Repayments from grants cannot count towards future grant contributions. The Secretary will establish procedures for an infrastructure bank, with Federal funds not creating obligations to third parties. Income from interest will be tax-exempt. The infrastructure bank established under this section will be tax-exempt from Federal taxation. Additionally, the management of Federal funds and program administration for the infrastructure bank are outlined, with a provision for the Secretary to review and report on the financial condition of each infrastructure bank to Congress within 90 days.
