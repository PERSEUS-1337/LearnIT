    "content": "The \"Health Care Liability Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. This Act focuses on health care liability reform. Punitive damages may be awarded against a manufacturer or product seller in a civil action if clear evidence of actual malice is proven. Manufacturers and health care providers are exempt from punitive damages for harm caused by approved drugs or devices unless relevant information is withheld from the FDA or patients. In civil actions, punitive damages may be awarded against a manufacturer or product seller if clear evidence of actual malice is proven. The amount of punitive damages awarded shall not exceed 3 times the economic injury amount or $250,000, whichever is greater. Liability for noneconomic damages is several only, with each manufacturer or seller responsible in proportion to their percentage of responsibility as determined by the trier of fact. In product liability actions, punitive damages can be awarded if clear evidence of malice is proven. The amount awarded is limited to 3 times the economic injury amount or $250,000, whichever is greater. Liability for noneconomic damages is shared among manufacturers or sellers based on their percentage of responsibility determined by the trier of fact. Definitions for \"claimant\" and \"malice\" are provided in this section. Manufacturer in product liability actions is defined as a person engaged in producing, creating, or constructing a product, including those who design or formulate the product. This definition also includes product sellers who design or formulate an aspect of the product after it was initially made by another party. The term \"product\" refers to any object, substance, mixture, or raw material with economic value intended for sale or lease to persons for commercial or personal use. Product seller refers to a person involved in selling, distributing, leasing, preparing, packaging, or labeling a product, or in installing, repairing, or maintaining the harm-causing aspect of a product. This term excludes manufacturers. The term \"product seller\" excludes manufacturers and includes individuals involved in selling, distributing, leasing, preparing, packaging, labeling, installing, repairing, or maintaining a product. It does not include manufacturers, sellers or lessors of real property, providers of professional services where the sale of a product is incidental, persons acting in a financial capacity, or persons leasing a product where control is with someone other than the lessor. This Act preempts State law on punitive damages and joint liability for noneconomic damages against manufacturers or product sellers. Any issues not covered by this Act will be governed by State or Federal law."
