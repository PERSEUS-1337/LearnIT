    "content": "After World War I, Lebanon was created as a new entity by French authorities in 1920, combining the Maronite Christian enclave of Mount Lebanon with primarily Muslim coastal cities like Beirut. This formed the boundaries of the modern Lebanese state. Lebanon was created as a new entity by French authorities in 1920, combining Maronite Christians with Muslim residents. The debate over Lebanese identity shaped the country's politics. In 1943, Lebanon gained independence from France, with a National Pact ensuring representation of religious groups in government. Lebanon's sectarian balance, established in 1932, reserved key government positions for different religious groups. The lack of a census since then has caused tension, with fears of demographic shifts upsetting the status quo. This balance was challenged by events like the influx of Palestinian refugees and the mobilization of the Shia Muslim community, leading to a civil war from 1975 to 1990. The civil war in Lebanon from 1975 to 1990 resulted in an estimated 150,000 deaths, with sectarian communities and external actors like Syria, Israel, Iran, and the United States involved. Foreign intervention included Syrian military forces in 1976, Israeli forces in 1978 and 1982, and the establishment of UNIFIL by the U.N. Security Council in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Israel's presence in southern Lebanon led to the emergence of Hezbollah, backed by Iran. The civil war in Lebanon from 1975 to 1990 involved various sectarian communities and external actors like Syria, Israel, Iran, and the United States. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, emerged during Israel's presence in southern Lebanon. The United States deployed forces in 1982 but withdrew after the 1983 marine barracks bombing. The Taif Accords in 1989 formalized Lebanon's confessional system, allowing Syria to influence the country's politics post-war. The Taif Accords in 1989 called for the dismantling of Lebanese militias, with most integrating into the Lebanese Armed Forces. Hezbollah, however, refused to disarm, citing resistance to Israeli presence in southern Lebanon. The assassination of Rafik Hariri in 2005 led to Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, though Damascus continued to influence Lebanese politics. The Hariri assassination in 2005 reshaped Lebanese politics into two major blocks: March 8 and March 14, representing pro-Syria and anti-Syria segments. In 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers, leading to a 34-day war with Israel that resulted in significant damage and casualties on both sides. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 brokered a ceasefire. In 2008, the Doha Agreement was signed in Lebanon to resolve political tensions, including Hezbollah seizing control of parts of Beirut. The agreement was brokered by Qatar. In 2011, unrest broke out in Syria. In 2011, unrest broke out in neighboring Syria, leading to Hezbollah supporting the Asad regime and Lebanese Sunni leaders siding with Sunni rebels. This resulted in rebel forces being defeated by the Syrian military with Hezbollah's help, causing some rebels to retreat into Lebanon. Syrian refugees also started entering Lebanon, leading to retaliatory attacks targeting Shia communities and Hezbollah strongholds. The Lebanese Armed Forces and Hezbollah worked to contain border attacks by Syria-based groups like the Islamic State and the Nusra Front. U.S. policy in Lebanon aimed to limit threats posed by Hezbollah domestically and to Israel. The United States aims to limit threats from Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Israel, strengthen Lebanon's border security and state capacity, amidst complex regional dynamics and internal political tensions. Congressional debate continues on how to best achieve U.S. policy goals of weakening Hezbollah and building state capacity without destabilizing Lebanon. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have sought to weaken Hezbollah without risking Lebanon's stability. Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon can be addressed by strengthening legitimate security institutions like the LAF. Concerns arise over Hezbollah's cooperation with the LAF and the need for continued Foreign Military Financing assistance. Questions also arise about coordination between the military and Hezbollah fighters along the Syrian border. Lebanon faced attacks from Syria-based groups seeking to gain a foothold, prompting the need for the LAF to defend the borders against encroachment by the Islamic State and other militants. The United States has provided aid to Lebanon to defend its borders against the Islamic State and assist Syrian refugees. Economic aid aims to strengthen Lebanese institutions and improve public services. Economic challenges have led to limited government spending, filled in part by sectarian patronage networks. Lebanon's political system divides power among religious communities to prevent dominance. Disagreements over electoral laws delayed parliamentary elections until 2018, resulting in increased seats for Hezbollah allies. The political coalition March 8, including Hezbollah, Amal Movement, and FPM, gained a majority in parliament with 68 seats, falling short of a two-thirds majority for major initiatives. March 14 coalition lost 10 seats, with Future Movement absorbing the largest loss. Lebanese Forces party increased its seats from 8 to 14. The conclusion of Lebanon's 2018 legislative elections paved the way for a new government formation. President Aoun reappointed Saad Hariri as prime minister for his third term. Hariri has been consulting with political blocs to select ministers for a new cabinet, which must be approved by the president. A draft cabinet proposal was presented in September, but President Aoun declined to endorse it due to concerns over representation balance. Aoun emphasized the need for a balanced Cabinet formula to prevent monopolization or marginalization of any sect. Cabinet formation has been stalled since October 2018 due to disagreements over Christian representation, particularly between the Free Patriotic Movement and the Lebanese Forces. The LF seeks deputy premiership or a \"sovereign ministry\" in the new Cabinet. Traditionally, Lebanon's largest sectarian communities each receive one sovereign ministry. The FPM holds Maronite and Greek Orthodox seats and is reluctant to cede them to the LF. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt aims to name three Druze ministers, potentially blocking a key rival. Prime Minister Hariri's Future Movement is the largest Sunni party. The largest Sunni party in Lebanon, Prime Minister Hariri's Future Movement, is seeking to claim all ministerial seats allotted to Sunnis in the Cabinet. However, a group of Sunni MPs not affiliated with the Future Movement is challenging this and calling for non-Future Sunni MPs to be represented. The Lebanese government is currently in caretaker status as no agreement on a new Cabinet has been reached. Government formation in Lebanon has historically taken anywhere from 44 days to over ten months. Hezbollah's presence in the Lebanese Cabinet has complicated U.S. engagement with Lebanon. In May 2018, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Hezbollah officials, expressing concerns about their role in the government. The U.S. urged caution regarding including Hezbollah in the political system. Prime Minister Hariri emphasized the need for a government that includes everyone, suggesting Hezbollah may not be excluded. Lebanon's parliament elected Michel Aoun as president in October 2016 after multiple failed attempts due to boycotts by FPM and Hezbollah allies, causing an electoral stalemate and government paralysis. In 2015, Lebanon experienced mass protests over the government's failure to collect garbage, leading to legislative boycotts to block controversial issues. Future Movement leader Saad Hariri's support helped elect Michel Aoun as president in 2016, who then appointed Hariri as prime minister. Aoun, a former military officer and founder of the Maronite Christian Free Patriotic Movement, has been allied with Hezbollah since 2005. Lebanon faces security challenges from internal and external sources, including the conflict in neighboring Syria. The alliances between political coalitions have evolved since 2005, impacting government formation. The State Department's 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism highlighted Lebanon's ongoing security concerns. According to the State Department's 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, Lebanon remains a safe haven for certain terrorist groups, particularly in undergoverned and Hizballah-controlled areas. The government has not taken significant action to disarm Hizballah, which maintains its weapons in defiance of UNSCR 1701. Hizballah also controls access to parts of the country and influences some elements within Lebanon's security services. The 2017 report highlighted ungoverned areas along Lebanon's border with Syria as safe havens for extremist groups like Islamic State and Al Qaeda-linked militants. Despite Lebanon's official policy of disassociation from the Syrian war, segments of society have been involved to varying degrees, leading to security repercussions for the state. Hezbollah's military involvement in Syria in support of the Asad government has also been a significant factor. In December 2013, the Nusra Front in Lebanon claimed responsibility for suicide attacks in retaliation for Hezbollah's involvement in Syria. The Islamic State also targeted Shia Muslims and Hezbollah in Lebanon, including a twin suicide bombing in Beirut in November 2015. Hezbollah has collaborated with the Lebanese Armed Forces to counter extremist groups in Lebanon. In 2013, fighting in the Qalamoun mountain region transformed the Lebanese border town of Arsal into a base for Syrian armed groups. Clashes in August 2014 between the LAF and Islamic State/Nusra Front militants resulted in casualties and hostages. The hostages' remains were disclosed in August 2017 as part of a cease-fire arrangement with the Islamic State. The clashes between the Islamic State and the LAF in Arsal led to a shift in U.S. policy towards Lebanon, with increased support for the LAF. The situation in Arsal was worsened by the influx of Syrian refugees, causing tensions and security concerns in Lebanon. In 2016, a terrorist attack in the town of Al Qaa heightened anti-refugee sentiment, leading to the arrest of hundreds of Syrians. In June 2017, five suicide bombers attacked refugee settlements in Arsal, Lebanon, during an LAF raid against IS militants. The LAF detained 350 people, including alleged IS officials, after the attacks. Four Syrian detainees died in custody, prompting criticism. Hezbollah supported LAF operations in Arsal and called for efforts to prevent terrorist infiltration. President Aoun praised LAF's anti-terrorism efforts and warned about the security risks posed by Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon. President Aoun and Prime Minister Hariri have differing views on the repatriation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Aoun emphasizes the social, economic, educational, and security benefits of their return, while Hariri believes that forcing refugees back to Syria is not the solution. Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement supports coordinating refugee returns with the Syrian government, a stance opposed by Hariri. Hezbollah and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have deployed forces along Lebanon's eastern border to counter the infiltration of militants from Syria. In 2017, Hezbollah withdrew from a 67 km area near the Syrian border, with LAF taking over. Operations were conducted to clear HTS and Islamic State militants from the border areas. Hezbollah's involvement in these operations has sparked controversy among Lebanese politicians. Hezbollah conducted operations around Arsal in late July 2017, retaking territory from HTS militants. A ceasefire was brokered between Hezbollah and HTS fighters, with HTS agreeing to relocate to Syria's Idlib province. Nasrallah expressed readiness to hand over recaptured Lebanese lands to the Lebanese Army if requested. Prime Minister Hariri clarified that the LAF did not participate in Hezbollah's operations, but Nasrallah mentioned LAF securing the area west of Arsal to prevent HTS militants from escaping into Lebanon. In August 2017, the Lebanese government launched a 10-day offensive to clear Islamic State militants from the outskirts of Ras Baalbeck and Al Qaa, north of Arsal along Lebanon's northeast border. The operation, in conjunction with Syrian government and Hezbollah forces, trapped the militants in a small enclave. LAF Commander General Joseph Aoun declared the operation complete on August 30, 2017, resulting in the deaths of seven LAF soldiers and dozens of IS fighters. The conclusion of the operation involved an agreement for IS fighters to withdraw to Abu Kamal on the Syrian border with Iraq. In return, IS revealed the location of remains of captured LAF soldiers and Hezbollah fighters. Extremist groups in Lebanon shifted focus from targeting Israel to Hezbollah and Shia communities. The Al Qaeda-linked Abdallah Azzam Brigades targeted Hezbollah in 2013. The Abdallah Azzam Brigades began targeting Hezbollah in 2013, responsible for bombings in Hezbollah-controlled areas of Beirut. Other Sunni extremist groups in Lebanon include Hamas, PFLP, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Fatah al Islam, and Jund al Sham, operating from Palestinian refugee camps with their own security forces. Iran's support for Lebanese Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist movement, includes providing weapons, training fighters, and financial assistance amounting to over $700 million per year. This support helps Iran gain leverage against regional adversaries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and facilitates its intervention on behalf of the Asad regime in Syria. Hezbollah emerged in the early 1980s during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. Shia leaders disagreed on how to respond, leading to the formation of Hezbollah, which launched attacks against Israeli and U.S. targets. Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000, but Hezbollah continued its resistance to foreign occupation. Hezbollah's conflict with Israel escalated in 2006, resulting in a 34-day war with significant casualties and infrastructure damage. The war began when Hezbollah captured IDF members, leading to Israeli air strikes and ground operations in Lebanon. In 2006, a full-scale ground operation in Lebanon aimed to establish a security zone free of Hezbollah militants. Hostilities ended with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701. Israeli officials have since highlighted Hezbollah's weapons buildup and alleged use of civilian areas as strongholds. Israel has targeted Syria and Lebanon to prevent arms transfers to Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated in 2016 that advanced weaponry supply to Hezbollah and a terror front on the Golan Heights are red lines for Israel. In 2017, reports focused on Iran aiding Hezbollah in setting up underground weapon factories in Lebanon. Israel has targeted convoys supplying weapons to Hezbollah in Syria since 2012. Israeli Air Force struck Syrian facilities linked to chemical weapons and precision weapons for Hezbollah. UNIFIL has been in Lebanon since 1978. Since 1978, the United Nations Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been deployed in the Lebanon-Israel-Syria triborder area to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and assist in restoring peace and security. The Blue Line, a reference line between Lebanon and Israel, was established in 2000 to confirm the withdrawal. In 2007, Israel and Lebanon agreed to visibly mark the Blue Line on the ground, with UNIFIL measuring points and constructing markers along the line. UNIFIL, established in 1978, has 282 points along the Blue Line and 268 Blue Line Barrels as markers. Its mandate was expanded after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war via UNSCR 1701 to monitor hostilities, support the Lebanese Armed Forces, and ensure humanitarian access. UNIFIL assists Lebanon in establishing an area free of armed personnel between the Blue Line and the Litani River. It also helps secure Lebanon's borders and is headquartered in Naqoura with over 10,500 personnel. UNIFIL, headquartered in Naqoura, has over 10,500 peacekeepers from 41 countries, including ground troops and naval personnel. Major General Stefano Del Col leads UNIFIL since July 2018. The U.S. does not participate in UNIFIL but supports the mission through peacekeeping programs. UNIFIL assists Lebanon in border security and implementing UNSCR 1701. Disputes over maritime boundaries arose after the discovery of gas fields in 2009, leading to calls for a maritime equivalent of the Blue Line. UNIFIL, with over 10,500 peacekeepers from 41 countries, assists Lebanon in border security and implementing UNSCR 1701. The U.N. does not authorize UNIFIL to establish a maritime boundary, but it monitors violations by all sides, including Hezbollah and Israel. In January 2017, UNIFIL underwent a strategic review that did not include its mandate or troop strength. In March, the results of a strategic review were presented to the Security Council, finding the Force well configured for its tasks and making recommendations. On August 30, 2017, the U.N. Security Council renewed UNIFIL's mandate for another year after tense negotiations. The U.S. and Israel pushed for changes allowing UNIFIL to access private property for Hezbollah weapons, opposed by Ambassador Haley. Lebanon faces roadblocks, UNIFIL's mandate changes opposed by troop-contributing countries like France and Italy. Lebanon calls for mandate renewal without changes. Concerns raised about deploying forces in Shia areas. UNSCR 2373 renewed UNIFIL's mandate with limited wording changes. New language requests detailed reports on UNIFIL's movement restrictions. In July 2018, the U.N. Secretary General reported to the Security Council on UNIFIL's implementation of UNSCR 1701, noting that UNIFIL's freedom of movement was generally respected. Annex I of the report detailed ten incidents between March and June. On August 31, 2018, the Security Council renewed UNIFIL's mandate for another year. Hezbollah's influence in southern Lebanon grew after forcing Israeli troops to withdraw in 2000, making it a prominent political party among Lebanese Shia. Hezbollah provides various services to gain support, including schools, clinics, and youth programs. Hezbollah's popular support base contributes significantly to its influence in Lebanon, despite criticism of its vast apparatus. The group has been participating in elections since 1992, gradually increasing its electoral success. In the 2018 legislative elections, parties allied with Hezbollah saw an increase in their share of seats. The coalition known as March 8, including Hezbollah, Amal, and the FPM, won 68 seats in the Lebanese elections, securing a simple majority in parliament. Hezbollah did not gain additional seats but has been a destabilizing force in the past. Hezbollah has withdrawn its ministers from the cabinet in protest of government actions in 2008 and 2011, causing the government to collapse. Despite differences, Lebanese leaders consult with Hezbollah on critical security issues. Prime Minister Saad Hariri acknowledged disagreements with Hezbollah but emphasized the need for cooperation on issues like handling refugees and maintaining stability. Hezbollah's withdrawal from the cabinet in protest of government actions has caused the collapse of the government. Lebanese leaders consult with Hezbollah on security issues, despite disagreements. Hezbollah's relationship with Syria is pragmatic, as it serves as a key transshipment point for Iranian weapons. The group rebuilt its weapons cache with Syrian assistance after the 2006 war with Israel. Regime change in Damascus is seen as a threat to Hezbollah's interests. Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian conflict has evolved from advisory to operational, with fighters supporting Syrian troops and playing a key role in protecting regime supply lines and targeting rebel positions. Estimates suggest Hezbollah maintains between 4,000 and 8,000 fighters in Syria. In mid-September, Nasrallah declared victory in the war in Syria. Nasrallah declared victory in the war in Syria, stating that the remaining fighting consists of scattered battles. Lebanon saw a significant influx of refugees from Syria starting in 2011, with the country having the highest per capita refugee population in the world by 2014. UNHCR suspended new refugee registrations in 2015 at the government's request, but officials estimate the actual refugee presence to be around 1.2 million to 1.5 million. Additionally, there are 450,000 Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA in Lebanon. The 2017 census found roughly 174,422 Palestinians living in formal camps and informal gatherings in Lebanon. There are also 20,725 other refugees and asylum seekers registered, with 84% being Iraqi refugees. The influx of refugees has strained Lebanon's infrastructure and created resentment among Lebanese residents. The Lebanese education system is also affected, with an estimated 500,000 school-age Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. The Lebanese government has been unwilling to take action. The Lebanese government is hesitant to enable Syrians to become permanent refugees in Lebanon, fearing a repeat of the Palestinian refugee situation that contributed to Lebanon's civil war. Most Syrian refugees in Lebanon live in urban areas in sub-standard shelters or apartments, as the government blocks the construction of refugee camps. Some Syrian refugees have settled in existing Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. In May 2014, Lebanon enacted entry restrictions closing the border to Palestinian refugees from Syria. In January 2015, new visa requirements were implemented for all Syrians entering Lebanon, raising concerns among U.S. officials. Syrians can only enter if they fit into one of the seven approved categories, which do not include fleeing violence. The criteria specifically apply to unaccompanied and/or separated children, persons with disabilities, urgent medical needs, and those to be resettled to third countries. The legal status of Syrian refugees in Lebanon was jeopardized by increased residency renewal fees in January 2015, leading many to seek informal employment. This made them vulnerable to exploitation. In February 2017, Lebanese authorities waived the $200 fee for refugees registered with UNHCR, excluding those who arrived after a certain date. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, present for at least 70 years due to Arab-Israeli wars, face restrictions on citizenship, access to public services, employment, and land ownership. Despite a 2010 labor law revision, barriers remain, making them reliant on UNRWA for education, healthcare, and social services. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon face restrictions on citizenship, employment, and access to public services. The United States announced in August 2018 that it will no longer contribute to UNRWA, which provided essential services to Palestinian refugees. The presence of Palestinians in Lebanon has influenced the country's approach to Syrian refugees, raising concerns about the long-term status of stateless populations. Since 2017, the Lebanese Armed Forces and Directorate for General Security have assisted in the return of thousands of Palestinian refugees to Syria, some transferred to rebel-held areas. This has caused tension with international humanitarian actors, as conditions in Syria are deemed unsuitable for assisted returns. Lebanese Foreign Minister accuses UNHCR of discouraging refugee returns to Syria, leading to a freeze on residency permit renewals for UNHCR staff in Lebanon. UNHCR denies discouraging returns and highlights the impact of the freeze on their work in Lebanon. Russian officials are planning logistical support for refugee returns to Syria under Syrian government supervision, including special crossing points and camps. Many Lebanese leaders support Russian efforts for Syrian refugee return. Lebanese leaders, including Caretaker Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil, support Russian efforts to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees from Lebanon to Syria. Bassil emphasizes Lebanon's commitment to this proposal, stating that refugee return should not be tied to a political solution in Syria. UNHCR Representative in Lebanon, Mireille Girard, acknowledges obstacles facing refugees, such as documentation and property restitution issues, but emphasizes that UNHCR cannot currently encourage refugee returns. Lebanon's economy is service-oriented, with key sectors including banking, financial services, and tourism. The country faces economic challenges such as high unemployment and a high debt-to-GDP ratio. The war in Syria has negatively impacted Lebanon's traditional growth sectors. Lebanon's economy has been affected by the Syrian conflict since 2011, leading to a slowdown in economic growth. Foreign direct investment dropped significantly during the early years of the conflict but has shown some recovery. The government struggles to provide basic services, leading citizens to rely on private providers linked to political parties. This has created a patronage network where support for political parties is exchanged for services. Political dynamics continue to impact Lebanon's economic and fiscal situation. Lebanon's economic struggles worsened due to unresolved political dynamics, leading to a loss of international donor funding. The country's relationship with Gulf states also affects its economy, with Saudi Arabia suspending aid over political disagreements. Lebanon's real estate and tourism sectors are impacted by Gulf states' travel warnings and urging citizens to leave the country. Despite challenges, the Central Bank of Lebanon, led by Governor Riad Salameh, has maintained stability with over $43 billion in foreign reserves. Salameh supports measures to prevent financial engagement with Hezbollah. The country presented the Capital Investment Plan at the CEDRE international donor conference in Paris in April 2018. Lebanese officials presented the Capital Investment Plan (CIP) seeking $20 billion in funding at the Paris CEDRE conference in April 2018. The project aims to rehabilitate and expand Lebanon's infrastructure, with $11.8 billion generated in soft loans from various international organizations and countries including the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar, and the United States. The plan would increase Lebanon's public debt significantly. The Levant Basin holds oil and gas resources with potential for significant revenue generation. Lebanon's dispute with Israel over maritime boundaries complicates offshore gas exploration. Lebanon's Energy Ministry announced plans to auction energy development rights to offshore areas, including blocks disputed by Israel. Total, Eni, and Novatek were awarded licenses to explore blocks 4 and 9, with drilling set to begin in 2019. Israel disputes part of Block 9. The United States is providing military and economic assistance to Lebanon to counter Syrian and Iranian influence, combat Sunni jihadist groups, address challenges from neighboring Syria, and support Israel's military edge. Drilling for energy development rights in offshore areas, including disputed blocks, is set to begin in 2019, more than 15 miles from Israel's claimed border. The U.S. provides assistance to Lebanon to counter Syrian and Iranian influence, combat Sunni jihadist groups, and support Israel's military edge. Concerns in Congress over U.S. aid to Lebanon stem from Hezbollah's involvement in the Syria conflict, strengthening its military capabilities. In 2017, $208 million in assistance was provided, with $110 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF) aid and $80 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) aid. President Trump's FY2018 budget requested $103 million in aid, mostly in economic aid. The FY2018 appropriations act makes aid available on conditional terms. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocates $115 million in ESF for Lebanon, with some funds potentially enhancing border security. The act requires a report on military assistance to Lebanon by September 1, 2018, assessing the LAF's performance in combatting terrorism and securing borders. The FY2019 aid request for Lebanon seeks $152 million in total funding, including $85 million in economic aid (ESDF) and $50 million in FMF. The influx of over 1 million Syrian refugees has strained Lebanon's weak infrastructure, leading to limited government spending on basic services. U.S. programs aim to increase the public sector's capacity to provide services to refugees and Lebanese host communities, including water, sanitation, health services, and education. Other programs focus on fostering inclusive economic growth. The United States provides over $1.7 billion in assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) since 2006 to reinforce Lebanon's sovereignty, secure its borders, counter internal threats, and build up legitimate state institutions. U.S. security assistance supports UN Security Council Resolutions and helps the LAF extend governmental control with UNIFIL. The United States has provided significant military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) since 2006, including aircraft, helicopters, missiles, artillery, small arms, and training. This support aims to reinforce Lebanon's sovereignty, secure its borders, counter internal threats, and build up legitimate state institutions. Additionally, the US conducts annual bilateral military exercises with the LAF known as Resolute Response. The United States provides military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and conducts annual bilateral military exercises called Resolute Response. Ambassador Richard stated that over 32,000 Lebanese troops have been trained by the U.S. Special Operations Forces have been in Lebanon since at least 2012, providing training and support to the LAF. Congress is concerned about U.S. assistance for border security in Lebanon due to threats from the conflict in Syria. The United States provides military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to improve border security in response to threats from the conflict in Syria. Funding has been realigned to support security cooperation activities, with Lebanon receiving $42.9 million for border security improvement programs. DOD may provide security assistance to Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Tunisia for border security efforts on their respective borders with Syria, Iraq, and Libya. The United States provides military assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) for border security improvement programs in response to threats from the conflict in Syria. Funding conditions have been established for security assistance to Lebanon, with restrictions on funding if either the ISF or LAF is controlled by a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. ESF funding for Lebanon may be available despite certain conditions, and FMF assistance to the LAF is subject to obligations. The House and Senate bills for the FY2019 Foreign Operations appropriations address funding conditions for assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), with the House version not providing an exception that has allowed unrestricted Economic Support Fund (ESF) provision to Lebanon in recent years. The Senate bill includes the exception for ESF and both bills emphasize that funds for Lebanon should be used to professionalize the LAF, strengthen border security, and combat terrorism. The FY2019 Foreign Operations appropriations bills aim to fund assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to strengthen border security and combat terrorism. The House bill does not provide an exception for unrestricted Economic Support Fund (ESF) provision to Lebanon, while the Senate bill includes the exception for ESF. Both bills emphasize the importance of using funds to professionalize the LAF and implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. The FY2019 Foreign Operations appropriations bills aim to fund assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to strengthen border security and combat terrorism. $1.3 billion in CTEF funds is allocated to support efforts of the armed forces of Lebanon to increase security along the border with Syria. Funds are provided to enhance the border security of nations adjacent to conflict areas, with recipients assessed for associations with terrorist groups or groups linked to the government of Iran, including Hezbollah. In 2012, Hezbollah was designated under E.O. 13582 for supporting the Syrian government. Additional sanctions were imposed on Hezbollah members in May, including Muhammad Qasir, members of Hezbollah's Shura Council, Muhammad Ibrahim Bazzi, and Abdullah Safi al Din. In December 2015, the 114th Congress enacted a sanctions bill targeting certain parties. In December 2015, the 114th Congress enacted a sanctions bill targeting parties facilitating financial transactions for Hezbollah's benefit (H.R. 2297, P.L. 114-102). The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (HIFPA) requires the President to prohibit or impose strict conditions on foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions for Hezbollah or engaging in money laundering. Some Lebanese observers are concerned that the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 could harm Lebanon's economy or banking sector if regulations broadly target Lebanese financial institutions. U.S. Treasury officials are considering whether Lebanese government payments to Hezbollah members could be seen as terrorist financing or money laundering. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has downplayed the law's effects. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah downplayed the impact of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, stating that their funding from Iran will continue regardless of the law. He criticized Lebanese banks for overcompliance with the legislation, accusing them of being more American than the Americans. Some analysts question the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Hezbollah due to their cash-based economy and Iran's ability to use alternative financial channels. Lebanon's largely cash-based economy allows for cash transfers through land and air corridors. Concerns have been raised about potential unintended consequences of new sanctions on groups with ties to Hezbollah, as Hezbollah is deeply embedded in Lebanon's political and social spheres. Sanctions on the Lebanese banking sector could reduce foreign remittances, which make up 15% of the country's GDP and support the solvency of Lebanon's banks. Congressional leaders have discussed imposing additional sanctions on Hezbollah since the enactment of the HIFPA in late 2015. Congressional leaders are considering imposing additional sanctions on Hezbollah and its associates, focusing on their involvement in criminal activities. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2017 was introduced to target Hezbollah, not the broader Lebanese state. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, expanding upon previous sanctions in various ways. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2017, passed in October, expands sanctions on foreign persons supporting Hezbollah-linked entities, fundraising, recruitment, and narcotics trafficking. It also targets foreign financial institutions owned by state sponsors of terrorism and agencies providing support to Hezbollah. Additionally, the bill requires reports on jurisdictions allowing Hezbollah activities outside Lebanon. The bill focuses on jurisdictions outside Lebanon that support Hezbollah's terrorist activities, calling for enhanced due diligence policies for financial institutions. It includes a national security waiver and is part of ongoing efforts in Congress to address Hezbollah-related issues. The House passed several acts targeting Hezbollah, including the Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, the Hezbollah Kingpin Designation Act, and the Disarm Hizballah Act. However, Lebanon's government formation has stalled, hindering progress on key issues like economic reforms. Lebanon's vulnerability to regional tensions, particularly with Iran via Hezbollah, poses a destabilizing force. Lebanese leaders are hesitant to confront Hezbollah directly, viewing it as a regional issue. Tensions between Israel and Iran in Syria could spill over into Lebanon, impacting its evolving relationship with Syria. Lebanon's relationship with Syria is changing as the conflict shifts in favor of the Syrian government. Lebanese leaders are under pressure to normalize relations to access trade routes. They also need to balance policies on refugee return with safety concerns raised by humanitarian organizations."
