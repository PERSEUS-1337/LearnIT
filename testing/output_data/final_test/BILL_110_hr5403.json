    "content": "The \"13th Regional Corporation Land Entitlement Act\" authorizes a land entitlement for the 13th Regional Corporation to provide equitable distribution of land for its shareholders under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The 13th Regional Corporation is entitled to select up to 1,453,388 acres of public lands within 5 years of the enactment of the 13th Regional Corporation Land Entitlement Act. The selection must be consulted with the relevant Regional Corporation before finalizing. The 13th Regional Corporation can select up to 1,162,710 acres of lands with approval from the relevant Regional Corporation. The Secretary will convey the surface and subsurface estate of the selected lands, subject to limitations and restrictions. The 13th Regional Corporation can select lands, but selections are subordinate to valid selections made by the State of Alaska or other corporations. This includes lands not yet conveyed under the Alaska Statehood Act or other laws. Selections made by the 13th Regional Corporation must be subordinate to valid selections on file with the United States. Valid selections are those not finally adjudicated or with appeal rights not exhausted, regardless of compliance with standards. The corporation cannot select land without approval from Native individuals or entities. Any land that a Native individual or entity owns a partial interest in, or that the State of Alaska, Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, or Group Corporation could select or acquire through statutory or contractual rights, without needing approval. Selected lands within withdrawn areas for selection by Village or Regional Corporations must be conveyed subject to valid existing rights and the same reservations and restrictions as other Regional Corporations under this Act. The 13th Regional Corporation's lands are reserved for traditional uses unless safety concerns arise. They must be managed according to adjacent Native Corporation land policies until developed. The Corporation cannot select lands within conservation units, acquired lands, or areas surrounding buildings. The 13th Regional Corporation's lands are restricted from being transferred without offering them to the Regional Corporation first. This includes lands surrounding buildings, national defense areas, the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, and the Tongass and Chugach National Forests. The Regional Corporation must be offered the opportunity to purchase any land or interest therein before it can be transferred to a third party. The offer must be made at least 30 days before the proposed transfer, and the Regional Corporation has the option to purchase all or part of the land within 20 days of receiving the offer. If the Regional Corporation does not purchase all of the land within the required time, the 13th Regional Corporation may transfer all the offered land to a specified third party, maintaining the original price and terms. Any land not transferred within 60 days reverts to the original restrictions. Transfer includes sale, exchange, or transfer of land or interests. The curr_chunk states that the sale, transfer, or exchange of land or interests in gravel, oil and gas, minerals, water, or timber that have been leased to a third party for consideration is allowed, with exceptions for certain circumstances. Revenue sharing is addressed in Section 4. Section (1)(A) of Section 7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to allocate 70% of revenues from timber and subsurface estate to 12 Regional Corporations and 15% to the 13th Regional Corporation. An additional 10% of revenues is to be shared among the Regional Corporations based on the number of Natives enrolled in each region. An additional 10 percent of revenues received by the 13th Regional Corporation will be distributed to the Regional Corporation for the geographical region where the resources are located. If the resources are on lands originally withdrawn for selection by a Village Corporation, half of the 10 percent paid to the local Regional Corporation will be given to the Village Corporation. Revenues from the 13th Regional Corporation are not subject to certain requirements. The Regional Corporations, including the 13th Regional Corporation, will determine the distribution of revenues according to this subsection. The 13th Regional Corporation will distribute revenues according to the section 7(i) Settlement Agreement with the other Regional Corporations. The 13th Regional Corporation is bound by any amendments to the Agreement unless they are not applicable to the other Regional Corporations. The 13th Regional Corporation does not have rights to revenues distributed by the other Regional Corporations or the power to approve amendments to the Agreement."
