    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State of California enacts Part 9.5 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, emphasizing the importance of grocery workers in maintaining health and safety standards in supermarkets and other grocery retailers. Experienced workers play a crucial role in upholding sanitation procedures and understanding the needs of their communities. A transitional retention period for grocery retail workers ensures stability during changes in ownership, preserving health and safety standards. Definitions for \"change in control\" are provided for clarity. An \"eligible grocery worker\" is defined as an individual working at a grocery establishment undergoing a change in control, employed by the incumbent grocery employer for at least six months. The \"employment commencement date\" is when the worker starts with the new grocery employer under specified terms and legal requirements. A \"grocery establishment\" in this state is a retail store over 15,000 square feet that primarily sells household foodstuffs for offsite consumption. The \"incumbent grocery employer\" is the person who owns, controls, or operates the grocery establishment at the time of the change in control. \"Person\" refers to any legal or commercial entity, domestic or foreign. Upon a change in control of a grocery establishment, the successor grocery employer must be provided with a transfer document detailing eligible grocery workers within 15 days. The successor employer must maintain a preferential hiring list from this information and hire from it for 90 days after the establishment is fully operational. The successor grocery employer must retain written verification of any job offers made to eligible grocery workers for at least three years. Eligible grocery workers hired must be retained for at least 90 days under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, if applicable. During the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer must retain eligible grocery workers by seniority within job classifications or as per a collective bargaining agreement. Workers cannot be discharged without cause during this period. At the end of the 90-day transition employment period, the successor grocery employer must provide a written performance evaluation for each eligible grocery worker retained. If the worker's performance is satisfactory, they may be offered continued employment. The successor grocery employer must keep a record of the evaluation for at least three years. The incumbent grocery employer must post public notice of change in control at the affected establishment, including contact information and effective date. The notice should be visible to workers, customers, and the public. Parties can override these requirements through collective bargaining agreements. The text chunk discusses exemptions for grocery establishments in food deserts, rights of eligible grocery workers for legal action, and the non-preemption of local ordinances providing protection for grocery workers. The provisions of this part are severable, meaning that if any provision or its application is deemed invalid, it will not affect other provisions that can still be enforced."
