    "title": "AB 1293",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The purpose of this article is to establish standards for the use of personal services contracts in the State of California. Personal services contracting is permissible to achieve cost savings under certain conditions, including demonstrating actual overall cost savings to the state. This includes comparing costs and considering additional expenses such as salaries, benefits, space, equipment, and materials needed to perform the function. When comparing costs for personal services contracts in California, indirect overhead costs should only be included if they are directly related to the function and would not exist otherwise. Contractor costs should include state expenses like inspection and supervision. Proposals to contract out work in California must meet specific criteria: contractor wages must be industry-level, not significantly undercut state pay rates, not displace civil service employees, and not adversely affect affirmative action efforts. The contract must meet specific criteria to ensure it does not adversely affect the state's affirmative action efforts, includes provisions for staff qualifications and nondiscrimination practices, and minimizes future economic risks from contractor rate increases. The contract must also be awarded through a competitive bidding process and be with a firm, defined as a corporation, partnership, nonprofit organization, or sole proprietorship. Personal services contracting is permissible under certain conditions, such as when functions are exempt from civil service, for new state functions mandated by the Legislature, or for highly specialized services not available within civil service. Personal services contracting is allowed under specific conditions, including when services are incidental to a property purchase or lease, when regular civil service personnel cannot achieve legislative goals, and when emergency appointments are necessary. These contracts may involve servicing leased office equipment, obtaining expert witnesses, or meeting Government Code standards for emergencies. State agencies may need private counsel when a conflict of interest prevents the Attorney General's office from representing them. Contracts must have the Attorney General's written consent. Private contractors provide services that cannot be feasibly provided by the state, conduct training courses when civil service instructors are not available, and offer urgent services that cannot wait for civil service implementation. All individuals providing services to the state under specified conditions must be retained through civil service appointments, unless exempted by the California Constitution. Personal services contracts are prohibited if they lead to the displacement of civil service employees, which includes layoff, demotion, and involuntary transfers."
