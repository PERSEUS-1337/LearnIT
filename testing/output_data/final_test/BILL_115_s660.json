    "content": "The \"Native American Indian Education Act\" ensures Federal funding for colleges to waive tuition charges for Native American Indian students, including those from out of state. Congress acknowledges the valuable role of Native American-serving nontribal college institutions in providing educational opportunities to Native American Indian students. Some of these institutions offer tuition-free education to hundreds of Native American students with state support, exceeding the original value of the land and facilities granted to them. The financial burden of providing tuition-free education to Native American Indian students is no longer equitably shared among states and colleges. Native student tuition waiver benefits are at risk of being terminated due to severe budget constraints. State relief from federal higher education mandate is addressed in Section 4 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, providing a way for states to alleviate the financial burden of tuition-free education for Native American Indian students. The Secretary may pay eligible colleges the tuition charges waived for Native American Indian students who were not residents of the State. Payments are treated as reimbursements from the State fulfilling Federal mandates. No relief is provided to States from existing mandates. The Secretary may reimburse eligible colleges for tuition charges waived for Native American Indian students, based on residency. States are not relieved from existing mandates regarding reimbursement. The section outlines that funds paid under this part shall not apply, and funds received by eligible colleges for Native American students will not affect their eligibility. Definitions include eligible colleges waiving tuition charges for Native American students as mandated by Federal statute. The term 'Native American Indian students' includes 'Indian pupils' as defined in Federal statutes for tuition waivers. 'Native American-serving, nontribal institution' is defined in section 319(b). Funds under this section are to supplement, not supplant, any Federal or non-Federal funds for Indian education programs. Section 399(a)(1) of the Higher Education Act is amended to authorize $17,400,000 for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2022 for section 319A."
