    "content": "This report summarizes laws and regulations allowing the federal government to restrict disclosure of scientific and technical information for national security reasons. It also discusses controversies surrounding White House policies on sensitive information and identifies issues that could impact the development of guidelines for sensitive unclassified information. The federal government has laws allowing the classification of scientific and technical information for national security reasons, including patent law secrecy and atomic energy restricted data. The U.S. Patent Commissioner can issue secrecy orders to prevent disclosure of inventions that could harm national security. The Patent Commissioner can issue secrecy orders to withhold publication or granting of a patent if it is deemed detrimental to national security. The agency head can determine if disclosure is harmful, and the invention may be kept secret for a period as deemed necessary for national interest. The owner of the application can appeal the decision to the Secretary of Commerce. The Patent Commissioner can issue secrecy orders to withhold publication or granting of a patent if it is deemed detrimental to national security. The secrecy order can be renewed by the Commerce Secretary as needed. During war, the order remains in effect for the duration of hostilities and one year after. In a national emergency, it remains in effect for the duration of the emergency and six months after. A license is required from the Patent Commissioner before filing for a foreign patent. Violation of the law can result in a fine or imprisonment. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 created the Atomic Energy Commission to secure atomic energy-related information. Laws allow the government to issue secrecy orders on patents for national security reasons, with potential fines or imprisonment for violations. The Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy, can restrict access to atomic energy-related information, classified as \"restricted data,\" even if developed by private researchers. Initially limited to defense, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allowed non-governmental entities to access this data for peaceful commercial or international cooperative purposes with security clearances. \"Restricted data\" includes information on atomic weapons, special nuclear material production, and use. The Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy, can restrict access to atomic energy-related information, classified as \"restricted data,\" even if developed by private researchers. This includes data on atomic weapons, special nuclear material production, and use. Current penalties for violating the law include imprisonment or a fine. The Export Administration Act and the Arms Export Control Act provide authority to control the dissemination of scientific and technical data to foreign nationals. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) control the export of scientific and technical data related to items requiring licenses. ITAR regulates defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List, while EAR controls dual-use items on the Commerce Control List. Licenses are required for exporting controlled items, with regulations administered by the Department of Commerce and Department of State. Fundamental research is excluded from these regulations. The ITAR regulations treat the disclosure of technical data to foreign nationals as an export. Academic researchers may believe they need to register with the State Department to discuss scientific developments with foreigners in the US. However, publicly available scientific information and academic exchanges are not considered controlled technical data under ITAR. There is ambiguity at academic institutions regarding which research projects may not be excluded due to the use of certain technologies on the Munitions List. Since 1999, information about satellites and spacecraft instruments, including technical discussions, falls under State Department and ITAR jurisdiction. Some academic researchers feel these rules limit their presentations, on-campus research, and international collaborations. Under National Security Directive 189, U.S. universities are now exempt from obtaining ITAR licenses for certain space-based fundamental research information. This rule allows for the export of information to NATO, EU, ESA, Japan, and Israel. Additionally, exports of services and unclassified technical data are permitted for scientific purposes. The exemption under National Security Directive 189 allows U.S. universities to export certain services and unclassified technical data for assembly of products into scientific, research, or experimental satellites. However, a license is required for the export of exempted information and hardware to researchers from non-approved countries. Some university researchers feel that the rules are not clear enough and may find it challenging to implement controls to block access to restricted information by individuals from disallowed countries. Several laws and directives govern the classification of federally owned or funded scientific and technical research results. Executive Order 12958, National Security Decision Directive 189, and rules on pre-publication review dictate the classification levels of federal information as \"top secret,\" \"secret,\" and \"confidential.\" Executive Order 13292, issued on March 25, 2003, amended the classification policy by allowing the classification of certain scientific, technological, or economic matters related to national security. The amendment to Executive Order 12958, under Executive Order 13292, allowed for the classification of scientific, technological, or economic matters related to national security, including defense against transnational terrorism. It also added a new category for information on \"weapons of mass destruction.\" The policy reflected in Executive Order 12958 was based on National Security Decision Directive 189 from the Reagan Administration, which stated that federally funded basic scientific research should be classified for national security reasons. NSDD189 states that fundamental research findings should generally remain unrestricted, but if national security requires control, information from federally funded research should be classified. Agencies sponsoring research are responsible for determining if classification is necessary before awarding contracts or grants. No restrictions can be placed on federally funded fundamental research that hasn't been classified, except as allowed by U.S. statutes. NSDD 189 allows for unrestricted fundamental research findings, but if national security deems necessary, information from federally funded research can be classified. The federal government conducts pre-publication review of scientific and technical information by current and former employees with access to classified information to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Pre-publication review controls are implemented in federal government contracts for research and development information, particularly by the Defense Department. This allows for review of research generated with federal support before publication, especially if classified information is involved or sensitive information needs to be protected. In 1980, an agreement was made with the American Council on Education for academic cryptography research to undergo voluntary pre-publication review by the National Security Agency. The U.S. Government has the authority to purchase exclusive rights to commercial satellite imagery for national security reasons. In 2002, the Department of Defense proposed mandatory procedures for research protection, which was later withdrawn due to academic objections. Laboratories transporting dangerous biological agents had to register with the government before the 2001 terrorist attacks. The USA PATRIOT Act and other related acts imposed limits on public access to select biological agents and toxins to prevent misuse by potential terrorists and criminals. Registration requirements were extended to include those using these agents, with controls placed on access by individuals deemed security risks. The USA PATRIOT Act and related laws restrict access to select biological agents to prevent misuse by terrorists. The Justice Department administers controls on individuals with ties to terrorism or dishonorable discharge. Labs using these agents must register, control access, and undergo background checks. Some researchers find the process costly and burdensome. The USA PATRIOT Act and related laws restrict access to select biological agents to prevent misuse by terrorists. Researchers, including some foreign ones, face costly and burdensome requirements for genetic engineering experiments. Laboratories handling select agents must comply with new rules by fall 2003, with penalties for noncompliance. Some agencies have procedures to safeguard sensitive unclassified information. The term SBU, defined in various directives and agency guidances, is used interchangeably with terms like \"for official use only\" and \"sensitive but unclassified.\" Agencies have discretion to define SBU to safeguard information, with no uniformity in definitions. Official definitions of SBU were issued as early as 1977, with directives like PD/NSC-24 and NSDD-145 mandating protection of unclassified but sensitive information. Agencies have discretion in defining SBU to safeguard information, with no uniformity in implementation. Various penalties may be assigned for improper release of SBU. The term \"sensitive, but unclassified\" was not defined in NSDD-145, leading to concerns that it could encompass information affecting national security interests. The lack of a precise definition was criticized by the General Accounting Office. President Reagan's National Security Advisor, John Poindexter, issued a document on October 29, 1986, titled National Policy on Protection of Sensitive, but Unclassified Information in Federal Government Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems, NTISSP No. 2, which expanded the protection of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information to include \"other government interests\" in addition to national security reasons outlined in NSDD-145. The National Policy on Protection of Sensitive, but Unclassified Information in Federal Government Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems, NTISSP No. 2, issued by President Reagan's National Security Advisor in 1986, expanded protection to include \"other government interests\" besides national security concerns. This policy applied to all federal executive departments, agencies, and contractors handling sensitive, unclassified information. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) was created to improve the security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems. It established minimum security practices without limiting access to information. Some agencies, like the Department of Energy, still use a broad conceptualization of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) aimed to establish minimum security practices for Federal computer systems without restricting existing security measures. It also defined \"sensitive\" information as data that could harm national interests, Federal programs, or individual privacy. The Computer Security Act of 1987 defined \"sensitive\" information as data that could harm national interests, Federal programs, or individual privacy. Agencies were given discretion to identify and protect sensitive unclassified information in their systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued guidance in 1992 on agency implementation of systems to protect sensitive information. This includes ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information. NIST urged agencies to use a risk-based approach to determine the harm of inadequate protection of information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance in 1992 emphasized that information 'owners' should determine the protection needed based on the nature of the information and the environment. The controls used should match the risk and harm resulting from unauthorized access or modification of the information. P.L. 100-235 applied to \"sensitive\" but unclassified information, defining it as \"sensitive but unclassified.\" The Freedom of Information Act allows agencies to exempt certain information from public disclosure. The Computer Security Act allows agencies to exempt certain information from public disclosure based on adverse effects on national interest, federal programs, and privacy. The Act does not designate information exempt from FOIA as \"sensitive.\" The Computer Security Act allows agencies to exempt information from public disclosure based on national interest, federal programs, and privacy. Federal agencies have applied the label SBU to sensitive information, including that exempt from FOIA. Agencies have implemented procedures to safeguard information, using classification categories and various methods. The Computer Security Act allows agencies to exempt information from public disclosure based on national interest, federal programs, and privacy. Agencies use administrative control markings to restrict access to unclassified information, including privacy data, law enforcement information, health information, and information exempt from FOIA. Various protective markings are used on unclassified information, such as 'Sensitive But Unclassified,' 'Limited Official Use,' 'Official Use Only,' and 'For Official Use Only.' Notable categories include DEA sensitive information and DoD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information. There is no uniformity in Federal agency definitions or rules for safeguarding \"sensitive but unclassified\" information. The term encompasses information controlled under the Computer Security Act and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. Agencies have discretion to identify and safeguard sensitive information. Since 2001, agencies have been given discretion to make nondisclosure decisions related to homeland security and terrorist attacks. The State Department replaced the designation \"limited official use\" with \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) for information exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act and FOIA. SBU requires protection and administrative control exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. The State Department replaced \"limited official use\" with \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) for protected information that could harm individuals or foreign relations if released. SBU includes medical, financial, investigatory, visa, and law enforcement information, as well as confidential advice arising from deliberative processes. The State Department replaced \"limited official use\" with \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) for protected information to minimize classified material and provide limited access based on need-to-know basis, subject to FOIA and Privacy Act provisions. Unauthorized disclosure carries criminal penalties. In 1995, the U.S. Agency for International Development equated \"sensitive\" with \"sensitive but unclassified\" and linked procedures needed to protect it to FOIA and the Computer Security Act. DoD's guidance in 1997 stated that \"For Official Use Only\" designations should be used for unclassified information that should be protected, including \"sensitive but unclassified\" information exempt from mandatory release under FOIA. According to DoD directives, information labeled as \"For Official Use Only\" (FOUO) and \"sensitive but unclassified\" can be shared within DoD Components, with contractors, consultants, and grantees, as well as with other government departments and agencies for official purposes. Special restrictions may apply to information covered by the Privacy Act, and specific guidelines govern the release of FOUO information to Members of Congress and the General Accounting Office. The U.S. Army designates SBU information as exempt from disclosure under FOIA, citing regulations. Examples of SBU include intelligence activities, cryptological activities, and data integral to military missions. The Army Materiel Command encrypts SBU data categories like logistics and medical care. Definitions of SBU vary, with factors like risk management considered. The Department of Energy uses a definition of \"sensitive but unclassified\" information, which includes factors like risk management and timeliness. A matrix is provided as a guide for determining Sensitive But Unclassified data categories. The Department of Energy uses a definition of \"sensitive but unclassified\" information, citing Executive Order 12958 and DOE regulations. Other agencies like the General Services Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration have issued directives to define and safeguard SBU information, including details that could benefit terrorists. The Department of Energy, General Services Administration, and Federal Aviation Administration have directives to safeguard sensitive but unclassified information, which could be detrimental to personal privacy or transportation safety. NASA labels this information as \"administratively controlled information\" and protects it from unauthorized disclosure. NASA designates certain information as \"For Official Use Only\" citing statutes such as the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Arms Export Control Act. They also use exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act for predecisional materials related to national space policy and sensitive travel itineraries. The Department of the Navy follows guidance on \"sensitive but unclassified\" information under the Computer Security Act of 1987. In 1998, the equivalence between \"sensitive\" and \"sensitive but unclassified\" was codified by DoD in administrative law. DoD defined \"sensitive but unclassified\" using the definition of \"sensitive\" from the Computer Security Act of 1987. The Department of the Interior issued guidance in 2002 stating that all unclassified DOI systems are considered SBU. The White House released a memo in 2002 calling for agencies to reconsider measures for safeguarding information regarding weapons of mass destruction and other sensitive documents related to homeland security. Agencies were instructed to review their policies and holdings to determine if information should be classified or handled as sensitive but unclassified. They were required to report their findings to the White House within ninety days. The memo also included guidance on using FOIA exemptions to control the disclosure of information. The ISOO and OIP memo instructed agencies to safeguard sensitive information related to America's homeland security and consider FOIA exemptions 2 and 4 for categorizing information as \"sensitive but unclassified.\" The memo emphasized the need to carefully balance protecting sensitive information with the benefits of open exchange of information. The memo referenced guidance on FOIA issued by Attorney General Ashcroft in October 2001, emphasizing the Administration's intent to comply with FOIA while considering national security, law enforcement effectiveness, business information protection, and personal privacy. The Department of Justice stated that the Ashcroft FOIA Memorandum replaced the predecessor and established a new \"sound legal basis\" standard for decisions on defending FOIA requests. The Department of Justice's new \"sound legal basis\" standard for defending agency actions under the FOIA requires agencies to ensure their use of exemptions is legally and factually sound. This differs from the previous \"foreseeable harm\" standard, which encouraged document release even if withholding was legally permissible. The 2001 memo emphasized the need to protect agency deliberations and consider various interests before making disclosure determinations under FOIA. The October 2001 memo instructed agencies to utilize FOIA exemptions to protect critical infrastructure information and agency information that could enable harm. The October 2001 memorandum instructed agencies to broadly interpret FOIA exemption 2 to withhold documents that could allow circumvention of agency rules, policies, or statutes. It emphasized the need to protect critical infrastructure information and sensitive homeland security information in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The memo referenced guidance from 1989 on the sensitivity of vulnerability assessments and the importance of exempting such information from disclosure under FOIA. The unclassified homeland security information includes records related to agency operations, public infrastructure, internal databases, vulnerability assessments, and information from private firms. Security clearances may be required for access to some sensitive information. The National Archives aims to train state and local officials in handling classified and sensitive homeland security information, including obtaining Top Secret security clearances when necessary. The National Archives aims to train state and local officials in handling classified and sensitive homeland security information, including obtaining Top Secret security clearances when necessary. The House oversight committee on FOIA questioned the Attorney General's memorandum on information withholding under FOIA, rejecting the standard of withholding information based on a \"sound legal basis.\" Agencies were directed to withhold documents only when necessary. The Homeland Security Act, P.L. 107-296, requires research by the Department of Homeland Security to be unclassified to the greatest extent possible. However, the President stated that the executive branch can protect information that could harm national security. Additionally, the Act prohibits the disclosure of critical infrastructure information under FOIA. The Homeland Security Act, P.L. 107-296, prohibits the disclosure of critical infrastructure information under FOIA. Private companies can voluntarily submit this information, with criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure. The Department of Defense also implemented similar prohibitions, and the Department of Homeland Security published rules to protect critical infrastructure information. The Department of Homeland Security established the \"Protected Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program\" in accordance with P.L. 107-296, extending rules to other agencies. Information submitted will be withheld from public disclosure under FOIA, with initial sharing limited to DHS analysts. Submitters must certify that the information is not subject to disclosure under other department rules. The Department of Homeland Security established the \"Protected Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program\" under P.L. 107-296 to safeguard sensitive homeland security information related to terrorist threats and response. This information is shared with federal, state, and local agencies to enhance security measures. The Department of Homeland Security established the \"Protected Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program\" under P.L. 107-296 to safeguard sensitive homeland security information related to terrorist threats and response. In response to a terrorist act, procedures for sharing sensitive but unclassified information with state and local personnel may include entering into nondisclosure agreements. The President assigned the responsibility for providing procedural guidance to federal agencies to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS is tasked with developing guidance for identifying and sharing sensitive unclassified homeland security information, with no guidance issued yet. DHS is drafting a report on the implementation of section 892 of P.L. 107-296, as required by Section 893 of the law. Some agencies have started responding to the issue of sensitive but unclassified information, with some inserting restrictions into contracts for unclassified research. This has led to questions about the definition of the term and some universities refusing federal contract funds with such clauses. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has defined sensitive information that will be protected from public disclosure, including details that could aid in planning an assault on a facility or breach key barriers at nuclear facilities. Several federal agencies have developed guidance to protect such information from public release. The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued Regulation 3440-002 on \"Control and Protection of 'Sensitive Security Information'\" in 2003, applying to facilities, critical infrastructure, and cyber-based systems. Information categorized as \"sensitive\" is only accessible to those with a \"need-to-know,\" with procedures in place to protect it. DHS's Transportation Security Administration has also defined types of information as \"sensitive.\" The TSA has defined sensitive security information (SSI) to be protected from disclosure and exempted from FOIA. There are reports of TSA seeking to remove unclassified congressional testimony regarding security problems at an airport, citing SSI. Some federal agencies have withdrawn information categorized as SBU from their websites to prevent access by the public. The Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 is used by environmental advocates to obtain information. Various agencies, including the Department of Energy, EPA, Defense Department, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have reportedly removed documents from their websites. State governments have also removed data, such as hospital security plans and information on energy stockpiles. The Secretary of Defense highlighted vulnerabilities in over 1,500 instances of insufficiently reviewed or unprotected data on DOD websites. Critics argue that removing information could hinder accuracy, as deleted data is now being sold to researchers through commercial vendors. Some researchers fear that deleted information, including USGS topographic map data, may become unavailable due to tighter security measures. This could lead to a commercialization of information similar to what happened with Landsat data in the 1980s. Initial assessments of agency FOIA procedures show that the new policies have not had a major impact on agency activities. Some agencies did not comply with significant activities required by the Cardmemo, which had more impact than the Ashcroft memo on FOIA disclosures. A GAO assessment in 2003 found that the Ashcroft memo had limited impact, with 48% of FOIA officers not noticing a change in discretionary disclosures. However, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights reported serious effects, such as the DOD's refusal to release an unclassified conference report on lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks. The unclassified conference report on lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks may not be released due to concerns about the expansion of secrecy beyond formal classification procedures. Critics are worried that the provision relating to critical infrastructure information could hinder the disclosure of corporate activities that pose risks to the public. The ACLU expressed concerns that the law could prevent the disclosure of potential health risks and corporate wrongdoing, while supporters argue that withholding information is necessary for homeland security. Some believe that access to sensitive infrastructure information should be restricted to those with a need to know, with discussions on regulating the publication of sensitive scientific research. The National Academy of Sciences voluntarily removed certain information from a public report due to sensitivity concerns. The National Academy of Sciences voluntarily removed sensitive information on U.S. cropland vulnerabilities from a public report and placed it in a separate appendix. Access to this information is restricted to select individuals involved in homeland security and plant health, with applicants required to justify their need for the report. The Academy cited FOIA exemption 2 to justify this procedure. The National Academy of Sciences removed sensitive information on U.S. cropland vulnerabilities from a public report and restricted access to select individuals involved in homeland security and plant health. They cited FOIA exemption 2 to justify this procedure. The DoD's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate took months to review a study on non-lethal weapons, with conflicting opinions on its use to suppress criticism. The National Academies issued a statement balancing security and openness in disseminating scientific information, emphasizing the need for restrictions to safeguard strategic secrets while promoting openness to enhance the nation's understanding of potential threats. The National Academies emphasized the importance of not classifying scientific research, avoiding restrictions on nonclassified research reporting, and refraining from using vague categories like \"sensitive but unclassified.\" Unclear criteria can hinder scientific creativity and weaken national security. They proposed \"action points\" for government and professional societies to safeguard scientific information from potential terrorists. In 2003, a workshop was held in collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies to address these issues. Administration officials suggested that scientists should voluntarily establish a policy. The Administration officials suggested that scientists should voluntarily craft a policy to protect sensitive information and assist the government in identifying and censoring sensitive findings, especially in the biological sciences. The CSIS and the Academies established a \"Roundtable on Scientific Communication and National Security\" to develop a publications policy. Some scientists, like Dr. Ronald Atlas, proposed a discussion within the scientific community to balance secrecy in science and scientific publication, similar to the 1975 Asilomar conference. Some suggest establishing a committee to evaluate sensitive research methodology for publication. Dr. Fauci proposed a committee to determine appropriate publication of biomedical research, similar to the Asilomar Conference. The Asilomar Conference addressed restrictions on sensitive research, while the International Council for Science will review threats to scientific freedom. The American Library Association and American Association of University urged for public access to government information to be maintained. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the American Physical Society (APS) oppose restrictions on scientific information exchange post-September 11. Some scientific groups advise caution in releasing information that could aid potential terrorists. The American Association of University Professors and the American Physical Society oppose restrictions on scientific information exchange post-September 11. Scientific groups advise caution in releasing information that could aid potential terrorists, including the \"methodology\" sections of scientific papers. Publication review committees evaluate article sensitivity, with editorial panels reviewing manuscripts on \"select agents.\" In February 2003, 32 journal editors and scientists issued a statement on considering security issues when reviewing research papers. The Fink report in 2003 called for self-regulation by scientists to address security concerns in research. It recommended the use of biosafety committees and the creation of a National Science Advisory Board for Biodefense. The AAUP also advised caution in academic freedom and national security issues. The Fink report in 2003 recommended self-regulation by scientists to address security concerns in research, urging caution in academic freedom and national security issues. Congress also showed interest in the topic following the publication of a controversial scientific paper on the synthesis of an infectious polio virus. Congressman Weldon introduced H.Res. 514 expressing concern about a controversial scientific paper funded by DARPA, calling for tighter controls on certain scientific research to prevent information that could be used by terrorists from being widely available. The resolution was not reported from the committee. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, agencies were instructed to withhold sensitive information under FOIA, balancing access with the need to protect national security and critical infrastructure. This has raised policy issues regarding the use of FOIA exemptions and the exchange of scientific information. Some argue that the ambiguous terms \"sensitive\" and \"SBU\" in FOIA exemptions raise policy issues about identifying and safeguarding information. Expanded interpretation of exemptions 2 and 4 divides opinions on increased security versus public access. Procedures in P.L. 107-296 aim to guide agencies in sharing sensitive homeland security information, sparking debate on proposed guidelines. There is ongoing debate over the proposed guidelines for categorizing sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. Some argue for a broader interpretation to protect more information, while others believe the category is too vague and leads to unnecessary withholding of information. A report from 1994 estimated that up to 75% of government-held information could be considered SBU, recommending better protection and labeling of such information. The debate continues over guidelines for protecting sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. Recommendations include better protection and labeling of crucial non-classified information related to U.S. security, such as air traffic control, social security, banking systems, and power grids. The Moynihan commission report highlighted the use of different mandates to justify protecting unclassified information. The Moynihan commission report identified issues with the protection of unclassified information, highlighting problems with inconsistent categorization and lack of oversight. This has led to confusion and the mistaken treatment of unclassified information as classified. The report concluded that more information is being protected than necessary. The report criticized the overzealous labeling of information as SBU and suggested improving government computer-information systems to prevent unauthorized access. A CSIS commission in 2002 found the DOE's definition of SBU to be too broad and unusable, lacking a common understanding of control and sensitivity levels. Sensitive unclassified information at the Department of Energy is causing problems due to a lack of clear standards for protection. This leads to difficulties in measuring laboratory performance and hinders the scientific enterprise. The Department treats this information as if it were classified, impacting background checks for foreign visitors and review of presentations involving sensitive unclassified information. The CSIS commission recommended that the Department of Energy avoid using the label \"SBU\" and instead have three classes of information: classified, unclassified but subject to administrative controls, and unclassified, publicly releasable. They also suggested using the category of information designated official use only (OUO) for information that requires administrative control. During the 107th Congress, there was interest in reviewing statutes, policies, and procedures governing national security classification of intelligence information. The Department of Energy administers OUO, which has guidelines established in law. Unclassified information could be reviewed for applicability under OUO statutes, while existing statutes for sensitive unclassified information like UCNI could remain distinct as long as clear control guidelines are provided. Congress should consider the need for real-time sharing of sensitive information and review proposals for a new approach to classification processes. The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with other key officials, should report to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees on protecting against the misuse of classification for agency self-interest. Some critics caution against broadening information exemptions under FOIA, questioning the legality of new restrictions not aligned with existing laws. Concerns raised about national security directives on \"sensitive but unclassified\" information conflicting with statutory law. Critics warn that the term \"sensitive but unclassified\" could pose a significant risk in terms of secrecy. Some critics caution that \"sensitive but unclassified\" information may pose a significant risk in terms of secrecy, as it lacks defined parameters and appeal channels. They advocate for the development of administrative mechanisms to challenge decisions withholding information. Critics also argue that limiting the flow of scientific information, whether public or private, could hinder scientific progress, innovation, and counterterrorism efforts. Despite differing views, the goal remains to prevent potential terrorists from accessing information that could threaten the United States. Some suggest closer cooperation between the scientific and intelligence community to safeguard scientific information from potential terrorists. Policy options include establishing uniform definitions, an appeals process for sensitive information, and potentially classifying more research information as sensitive. The goal is to prevent terrorists from accessing threatening information. The White House Office of Homeland Security drafted a definition for Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI) after the release of the Card memorandum in March 2002. There was an initiative to issue a Presidential Directive on unclassified but Homeland Security-sensitive information, but it was never publicly released. The White House Office of Homeland Security drafted a definition for Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI) after the release of the Card memorandum in March 2002. Several agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, utilized this information to define SHSI. The Office of Homeland Security requested guidance from the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget to withhold information from unauthorized individuals while allowing access to law enforcement and emergency response personnel. Stakeholder groups, including academics and scientists, were consulted for their input on developing this guidance. During a meeting in late August 2002, academic and scientific officials discussed the March 2002 memos and argued that basic and applied research should not be subject to SHSI guidelines. They advocated following existing rules for handling sensitive information, such as CDC guidance for select agents. Academic officials left the meeting convinced that the memo only applied to government-owned information, not university research funded by federal grants. During a House Science Committee meeting in October 2002, White House OSTP Director John Marburger testified about balancing openness and security in homeland security information. He stated that SBU information related to homeland security may be withheld from public disclosure only when it warrants protection under FOIA exceptions. The relationship between FOIA and homeland security information policies was discussed at a conference held by the Department of Justice in June 2004. The Department of Justice held a meeting in June 2004 for FOIA officers, discussing the lack of policy guidance on sensitive homeland security information. Despite previous meetings and attempts to draft policy, no guidance was issued before July 2003. The OMB/OSTP guidance was expected to instruct federal agencies on identifying and safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information, as required by P.L. 107-296. The Secretary of DHS was tasked with these functions by Executive Order 13311, and guidelines were being developed by the DHS Office of General Counsel. The Office of General Counsel is developing guidelines mandated by P.L. 107-296 for federal agencies. The definition of sensitive information is expected to extend beyond SHSI to include scientific and technical data. There is speculation that the delay in issuing guidance is due to disagreements about public comments. The Office of General Counsel is developing guidelines for federal agencies on sensitive information, including scientific and technical data. There is speculation that the delay in issuing guidance is due to disagreements about public comments on regulations and penalties for violating nondisclosure agreements. The Department of Homeland Security's approach to public comment on SHSI guidance is unclear. The Department of Homeland Security has been given responsibility to draft regulations for identifying and safeguarding sensitive but unclassified homeland security information. Public groups have urged for public input on procedures for sharing this information. The Card and Ashcroft memos, along with section 892 of P.L. 107-296, have allowed agencies to restrict access to certain information for homeland security reasons. The Department of Homeland Security is tasked with drafting regulations to protect sensitive but unclassified homeland security information. Agencies have discretion to withhold information they deem sensitive, leading to ambiguity in definitions and balancing tests for access. Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information includes concepts defined as sensitive in the Computer Security Act 1987 and NIST criteria for information protection. Agencies must consider protecting critical systems and assets from security breaches and potential use as weapons of mass destruction when making discretionary disclosures of SBU homeland security-related information. When applying exemption 2, agencies should consider the needs for an informed citizenry, safeguarding national security, enhancing law enforcement effectiveness, protecting sensitive business information, and preserving personal privacy. Criteria for sensitive but unclassified SHSI likely reference information related to terrorist threats and prevention. Additionally, the open exchange of scientific and technical information should be considered. Some critics of the White House March 2002 memo have emphasized the need for developing guiding principles to balance information needs with security concerns. Steven Aftergood and Henry Kelly suggest that the administration should establish clear principles and an appeals procedure for handling sensitive information, with questions such as whether the information is already publicly available or could be used by terrorists. Documents containing detailed information on how anthrax spores can be milled and coated to maximize dissemination pose a national security threat and should be kept confidential. However, not all documents with the word \"anthrax\" are sensitive, and some may be beneficial for medical research and emergency planning. Public knowledge should be considered based on public concern and controversy, with solutions often arising after public awareness of environmental hazards, defective products, and risky corporate practices. The potential implications of forthcoming DHS concepts for private scientific publications policy will be examined by various constituencies and scientific groups. There is a possibility of classifying more research information, which may increase the amount of scientific research information that is classified. Congress may monitor the guidance that DHS develops to assist agencies in identifying sensitive homeland security information and SBU. During 2001 and 2002, federal agencies like Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency were granted original classification authority under Executive Order 12958. This new authority allowed them to classify certain federal scientific research information for reasons of national security, particularly in the areas of counterterrorism research. The new Executive Order 13292, issued in 2003, allows for the classification of scientific, technological, and economic information related to national security, including defense against transnational terrorism. This amendment highlights the potential classification of national security-related information in these areas. The amended order on classification of scientific, technological, and economic information related to national security, including defense against transnational terrorism, may widen the scope of classified information. The Department of Defense plans to reissue guidelines on pre-publication review of extramural research it funds, prompting concerns from university groups about potential restrictions on publishing and employing foreign-born researchers. The amended order on classification of scientific information may widen the scope of classified information, leading to concerns about restrictions on federally funded research and employment of foreign-born researchers. Agencies are developing guidelines for screening foreign-born scientists, which universities may object to. The balance between science and security in agency guidelines remains a topic of interest, especially with recent changes to the definition of classified information. The potential impacts of new controls on federally funded research include questions about classification levels, safeguarding research information, and differences from controls on proprietary research. These controls may affect the conduct of academic research for the federal government and raise concerns about restrictions on research. The potential impacts of new controls on federally funded research include questions about classification levels, safeguarding research information, and differences from controls on proprietary research. Most academic institutions are eager to receive financial support from industry, while research agencies may modify their policies on publication of federally funded research results. The expanded definition of scientific and technological information subject to classification in Executive Order 13292 raises concerns about agencies classifying information that would have otherwise been categorized as SBU. An appeals process for designating information as SBU is also a continuing issue, with suggestions for an appeals panel outside of the originating agency to enhance credibility. The efficacy of an appeals process has been demonstrated by the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Another suggested approach is to allow the Information Security Oversight Office to receive appeals and review disputes regarding the release of documents. This would keep oversight of the information within the executive branch. Some agencies are considering implementing \"tiered\" access to sensitive information, requiring pre-screening and approval for access. EPA mandates researchers to be sponsored by a senior official, register in advance, and keep sensitive information secure. Access to certain agency information is restricted to designated individuals in hard copy at EPA offices and libraries. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final rule in 2003 limiting release of critical energy infrastructure information selectively based on need to know. The U.S. Geological Survey implemented four levels of control for information products based on sensitivity. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final rule in 2003 limiting release of critical energy infrastructure information selectively based on need to know. The current directive advises to continue distribution of a widely available product, while restricting distribution of new features to updates for one year. Product restrictions may be imposed by another agency for public safety or national security reasons. Issues regarding selective access, information control panels, and private sector-government relationships in safeguarding information in scientific publications may be raised in the legislative context. The development and history of atomic energy restricted data controls were detailed in a 1989 document by Arvin S. Quist, a classification officer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established Restricted Data (RD) to control dissemination of atomic energy information, requiring security clearance for access. RD encompassed data on atomic weapons, fissionable material, and power production. Positive action is not needed to classify information as RD. The concept of \"born classified\" applies to Restricted Data (RD), which is automatically classified from its origination under the Atomic Energy Act. The government can only declassify RD, not classify it, and the Department of Energy determines if information falls under the RD category. National Security Information requires a positive determination by an original classifier to be designated as such. The Atomic Energy Act defines Restricted Data (RD) as classified information, even though it is not explicitly labeled as such. RD can be generated by individuals but cannot be communicated to unauthorized persons. Congress amended the Act in 1951 to allow certain atomic energy information to be shared with other countries for weapons development. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allowed for wider dissemination of atomic energy information for commercial purposes, following President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace initiative. The Act emphasized the control of information to ensure common defense and security. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expanded the dissemination of atomic energy information for industrial progress, public understanding, and technical advancement. This allowed for the declassification of much atomic energy information previously restricted under the 1946 Act. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 changed the declassification criteria from \"adversely affecting\" to \"undue risk,\" allowing for more information to be declassified. Prior to this act, private individuals could not access Restricted Data (RD) for commercial purposes, but this changed in 1956. In 1956, the AEC established an Access Permit Program allowing access to Restricted Data (RD) for commercial purposes, under which permitted individuals could use RD for civil uses of atomic energy in their business. Sensitive But Unclassified Information (SBU) includes protected information that could cause harm if disclosed. The Access Permit Program established by the AEC in 1956 allowed individuals to use Restricted Data (RD) for commercial purposes. Sensitive But Unclassified Information (SBU) includes information that could result in harm if disclosed, and regulations regarding SBU material have been updated to supersede previous regulations. U.S. citizen direct-hire supervisory employees are responsible for access, dissemination, and release of SBU material to protect it from unintended public disclosure. SBU information, not marked but with distribution restrictions, must be transmitted securely to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Custodians should assess if certain information requires higher protection levels. SBU information should be securely transmitted via secure fax, phone, or encrypted means. It can also be sent through postal service, APO, or registered pouch discreetly. During non-duty hours, SBU information must be locked up. Destruction of SBU documents should be done through shredding, burning, or other approved methods. Unauthorized disclosure may lead to penalties and disciplinary actions as per regulations. Sensitive But Unclassified Information (SBU) related to homeland security must be protected from inappropriate disclosure. Departments and agencies should carefully consider the need to safeguard such information on a case-by-case basis, balancing it with the benefits of exchanging scientific and technical information. Agencies must process FOIA requests for records containing sensitive homeland security information in accordance with the Attorney General's FOIA Memorandum. Exemption 2 of the FOIA provides protection for critical infrastructure information, while Exemption 4 may apply to information voluntarily submitted by the private sector. Federal departments and agencies should consult with the Office of Information and Privacy for any FOIA-related homeland security issues, and with other relevant offices for matters concerning the classification or security of information related to weapons of mass destruction or nuclear/radiological weapons."
