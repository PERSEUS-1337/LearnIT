    "content": "The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on four major principles: family reunification, skilled immigrants admission, refugee protection, and diversity in admissions by country of origin. These principles are enshrined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) since 1952. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings, and the Immigration Act of 1990 significantly revised statutory provisions. Legal aliens are classified as immigrants (or legal permanent residents) and nonimmigrants, such as tourists and foreign students. Nonimmigrants, like tourists and foreign students, are admitted for a specific purpose and a temporary period. They must leave when their visas expire, but some may adjust to LPR status. Immigrants face stricter admission criteria but fewer restrictions once admitted, including the ability to work, change jobs, and apply for citizenship after five years. Petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by sponsors. The USCIS in the DHS handles the process of adjusting status for prospective immigrants in the United States. If the immigrant is already in the US, USCIS manages the process, while if they are abroad, the petition is sent to the DOS. The Consular Affairs officer or USCIS adjudicator must ensure the immigrant is eligible for LPR status. Many LPRs adjust status within the US instead of receiving visas. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows for adjustment of status for Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) within the United States instead of obtaining visas abroad. Each year, countries are subject to per-country limits for immigrant admissions, with priority given based on family relationships, skills, and diversity. The annual worldwide level for LPRs is 675,000, with certain categories allowed to exceed limits. The annual worldwide level for Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) is 675,000, with certain categories allowed to exceed limits. This includes family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, and diversity immigrants. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, refugees, and asylees adjusting status are exempt from numerical limits. The annual worldwide level for Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) is 675,000, with certain categories allowed to exceed limits. Family-sponsored preference visas cannot fall below 226,000. Unused visa numbers can roll down to the next preference category. Employers petition the U.S. Department of Labor for employment-based immigrants in the second and third preference categories. Employers petition the U.S. Department of Labor for employment-based immigrants in the second and third preference categories. Prospective immigrants must demonstrate qualifications for the job and preference category. Labor certification is issued if a shortage exists, otherwise extensive recruitment efforts are required. A fifth preference category for foreign investors was added in the Immigration Act of 1990, requiring a minimum $1 million investment and employment of at least 10 U.S. workers. Less capital is needed for the immigrant investor pilot program. The Immigration Act of 1990 added a fifth preference category for foreign investors, requiring a minimum investment and employment of U.S. workers. The investor pilot program invests in financially troubled enterprises in targeted regions. The per-country levels are set at 7% of the worldwide level, with exceptions for certain family-sponsored immigrants. The per-country level is a barrier against monopolization, not an entitlement. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 allowed per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants to be exceeded for oversubscribed countries, as long as visas are available within the worldwide limit. The per-country ceiling varies annually based on previous year's admissions and unused visas. There are various categories of legal permanent immigration beyond family-sponsored and employment-based preferences, including Diversity Visa Lottery winners and aliens granted LPR status in removal proceedings. Immigration to the United States is influenced by various push and pull factors, such as civil wars, economic deprivation, strong employment conditions, and family reunification. Factors like the Great Depression and World War II also impacted immigration trends. Aliens may be granted LPR status in deportation proceedings due to exceptional hardship. The annual number of LPRs admitted or adjusted in the United States has gradually increased since World War II, but has not reached early 20th-century peaks. Immigration growth after 1980 is partly due to increased admissions under the preference system and legalization of aliens. The Immigration Act of 1990 raised the ceiling on employment-based preference immigration. The number of refugees admitted increased significantly after the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980. Many LPRs are adjusting status within the United States instead of receiving visas abroad. The number of LPRs arriving from abroad has remained steady, while adjustments to LPR status in the US have fluctuated over the past decade. The increase in LPRs over the past decade is mainly due to adjustments processed in the United States. In FY2010, USCIS adjusted 566,576 aliens to LPR status, with most employment-based immigrants and immediate relatives of U.S. citizens adjusting status within the U.S. Only a small percentage of other family-preference immigrants adjusted status in the U.S. Historically, a few countries have dominated immigrant flows to the U.S., with trends varying over time. The data shows that immigration patterns at the end of the 20th century were not dominated by a few countries as they were earlier in the century. Per-country ceilings established in 1965 had an impact, with immigrants from seven to nine countries making up about half of all LPRs by the last two decades of the 20th century. Mexico has been a top sending country throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, along with other countries like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and the Philippines. In FY2010, 1,042,625 foreign nationals became LPRs in the United States, with 66.3% entering based on family ties. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens were the largest group, followed by family preference immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, and refugees/asylees. Mexico led all countries with 139,120 immigrants. In FY2010, Mexico led with 139,120 foreign nationals becoming LPRs, followed by China and India. These top countries exceeded per-country ceilings due to special exceptions. The top 10 immigrant-sending countries accounted for over half of all LPRs in FY2009, while the top 50 countries contributed 86% of all LPRs. Detailed data on the top 50 immigrant-sending countries is provided in Appendix A. According to the INA, family-sponsored and employment-based preference visas are issued in order of petition filing. Visas are prorated when demand exceeds per-country limits, with Mexico and the Philippines currently oversubscribed. Backlogs exist for relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs, with siblings of citizens waiting over 11 years for a visa. The current backlog for family-sponsored visas is significant, with siblings of U.S. citizens facing over 11 years of waiting time. Priority dates for visa processing are based on the filing date of the petition, with some cases dating back to 2004. The Philippines has the longest waiting times, with some petitions from almost 24 years ago now being considered. Few countries and categories are oversubscribed in the employment-based preferences after certain limits were eased. In recent years, \"accounting problems\" have arisen between USCIS and Consular Affairs regarding processing of LPR adjustments of status and visas. USCIS provides data for Consular Affairs to determine employment-based visa priority dates. Heavy demand for employment-based visas is expected to exceed annual limits. The visa waiting times eased in FY2006 and early FY2007, but visa retrogression occurred dramatically in July 2007. The State Department retrogressed visa priority dates for employment-based preferences, citing a sudden backlog reduction effort by USCIS. Effective July 2, 2007, no further authorizations were issued for employment-based preference cases. As of February 2012, visa priority dates for employment-based preference cases vary worldwide. Priority workers and advanced degree visa categories are current, while professional and skilled workers have a priority date of February 22, 2006, with longer waits for workers from India, Mexico, and the Philippines. Unskilled workers with approved petitions from February 22, 2006, are now receiving visas. Significant backlogs exist due to the high volume of eligible immigrants filing petitions. In June, July, and August 2007, over 3 million immigration and naturalization petitions were filed with USCIS, overwhelming the agency. USCIS acknowledged the backlog and began securing I-130 petitions in a \"lockbox\" in October 2007. The spike in petitions added to existing processing backlogs dating back to 2003, resulting in reduced LPR numbers in FY2003. Only 705,827 people became LPRs in FY2003, with 64,421 LPR visas rolling over to FY2004 employment-based categories. In FY2004, USCIS reduced the number of immigrant petitions pending by 24% but still had 4.1 million petitions pending. By the end of FY2005, there were over 3.1 million immigration petitions pending. USCIS has changed its definition of backlog, making current backlog data unavailable. Processing times for various LPR petitions are provided for each USCIS Regional Service Center. U.S. citizens petitioning for relatives face wait times of at least a year, and in some areas, over two years for processing. The U.S. immigration system has a backlog of millions of petitions pending, causing long wait times for citizens and LPRs petitioning for relatives. Aliens with LPR petitions pending are unable to visit the U.S. as they are presumed to be coming to live permanently. Reform options for the immigration system are debated, highlighting the consensus that it is broken. Efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system have failed in the past, leading to debates on balancing the needs of employers, families, and stakeholders. The Congress is at the center of the debate on altering immigration policies, whether through comprehensive reform or incremental changes. The economic crisis intensifies the debate, potentially limiting options for policy reforms. Proponents of family-based migration argue for reducing backlogs in family-based immigration, as citizens and LPRs often wait years for their relatives' petitions to be processed. They suggest treating the immediate relatives of LPRs like immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, removing numerical limits and country ceilings. This would address the five-year wait currently faced by spouses and minor children of LPRs before they can join. The economic recession that began in 2007 has ended, but high unemployment rates persist. This complicates efforts to reform immigration law, particularly in relation to family-based immigration. Some propose shifting family-based allocations towards first and second preferences by eliminating categories for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens. The economic recession has led to high unemployment rates, complicating efforts to reform immigration law. There are debates on increasing employment-based immigration to support economic growth, with some arguing for the need for skilled workers regardless of their country of origin. Opponents question the necessity of increasing employment-based LPRs, citing no evidence of labor shortages. Some argue against increasing employment-based LPRs, citing no evidence of labor shortages and potential negative effects on U.S. workers. The option of lifting per-country caps on LPRs is gaining popularity, with the belief that it would attract more high-skilled immigrants without increasing total admissions. Advocates for immigration reform argue against per-country ceilings for employment-based preference categories, stating that employability should not be tied to country of birth. They believe that family reunification should take precedence over per-country limits to address backlogs faced by prospective family-based LPRs from certain countries. They assert that per-country ceilings are arbitrary and discriminatory, and should be raised to enable families from all countries to reunite. Advocates for immigration reform argue against per-country ceilings for employment-based preference categories, stating that family reunification should take precedence over arbitrary limits to address backlogs. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 ended the country-of-origin quota system, making U.S. immigration policy more equitable. The issue of whether gay and lesbian citizens should be able to sponsor their foreign partners for LPR status is gaining attention. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) defines marriage as between one man and one woman, excluding same-sex marriage for federal enactments. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) also limits the definition of spouse, wife, or husband to opposite-sex partners, excluding marriages not physically present or consummated. The INA defines marriage as between one man and one woman, excluding same-sex marriages unless consummated. The Ninth Circuit ruled that for immigration purposes, a marriage must be valid under state law and the INA, with the term \"spouse\" not expanded without congressional directive. The regulations provide guidance on determining a bona fide marriage for immigration purposes, requiring clear evidence that it was not entered into to evade immigration laws. Documentation includes joint ownership of property, a common residence lease, and commingling of financial resources. The American Bar Association advocates for recognizing same-sex permanent partnerships in immigration law, stating it is cruel and unnecessary to exclude them. Opponents of recognizing same-sex partnerships in immigration law cite concerns about potential fraud and argue against providing exceptions. There is growing interest in replacing the current preference system with a point system, similar to those used in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand, which assign credits based on attributes like education, work experience, language proficiency, and age range. Proponents believe that merit-based approaches are more effective. Proponents of point systems argue that they are based on the nation's economic needs and would be more acceptable to the public. Opponents believe individual employers are better at judging labor market needs and warn that a high volume of immigrants would overwhelm a point system. The Independent Task Force proposed a Standing Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets to make recommendations for adjusting levels of labor market immigration to the President and Congress. Former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall recommended the creation of an independent commission to measure labor shortages and recommend future numbers and characteristics of employment-based immigration. The Independent Task Force proposed a Standing Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets to recommend adjustments to labor market immigration levels. The commission would develop measures of labor shortages and adjust foreign labor flows to employers' needs while protecting labor standards. Critics argue that the commission may take selection processes away from individual employers and lead to a pool of talented immigrants. The point system option and employer selection process may impact the pool of talented LPRs. The future flow of LPRs is influenced by adjustments for guest workers and temporary foreign workers. Controversial provisions on legal status adjustments also affect legal permanent admissions. Guest worker and legalization proposals are intertwined with the debate on legal permanent admissions. The debate on legal permanent admissions revolves around concerns about potential disadvantages to those in visa backlogs and the possibility of increased petitions from family members of legalized individuals. Legislation reforming permanent immigration in the 108th Congress faced challenges due to the complexity of existing provisions. Legislation reforming permanent immigration in the 108th Congress faced challenges due to the complexity of existing provisions. Senators Chuck Hagel and Thomas Daschle introduced legislation (S. 2010) that aimed to revise permanent immigration categories and numerical limits, potentially increasing legal permanent admissions. The Immigration Reform Act of 2004 (S. 2010) proposed changes such as no longer deducting immediate relatives from family-sponsored numerical limits and treating spouses and minor children of LPRs the same as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Several bills in the House aimed to offer targeted revisions to permanent immigration. Representative Robert Andrews introduced H.R. 539 to exempt spouses of LPRs from family preference limits. Representative Richard Gephardt included a provision in H.R. 3271 to treat spouses of LPRs outside numerical limits. Representative Jerrold Nadler's H.R. 832 aimed to add \"permanent partners\" as LPRs through family-based immigration categories. Legislation introduced in the 108th and 109th Congress aimed to reduce legal permanent immigration, with bills like the \"Mass Immigration Reduction Act\" zeroing out certain immigrant categories. Additionally, legislation in the 109th Congress recaptured visa numbers for nurses. The FY2005 supplemental appropriation amended the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 to recapture unused employment-based immigrant visas for immigrants approved based on schedule A, making 50,000 visas available for nurses. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary approved language to recapture up to 90,000 employment-based visas not issued in prior years, with an additional $500 fee for these visas. The Senate passed S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005, with provisions to recapture unused employment-based visas. However, these provisions were not included in the House-passed Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 4241). The conference report on S. 1932 did not include the Senate provisions for recapturing visas. The House agreed to the conference report on December 19, and the Senate amended the legislation on December 21. President Bush's Immigration Reform Proposal in the 109th Congress included an increase in permanent legal immigration as a key component. He aimed to raise the annual limit of legal immigrants and emphasized the importance of citizenship through work, patience, and assimilation. President Bush's immigration reform proposal in the 109th Congress included promoting increases in employment-based categories of permanent immigration. The proposal, featured in the 2004 State of the Union address, sparked a debate, with focus on the temporary worker component and concerns about amnesty for unauthorized aliens. President Bush reiterated that immigration reform was a top priority, stating it was a big issue in his second term agenda. President Bush emphasized the importance of immigration reform in his second term agenda, calling it a \"bureaucratic nightmare\" that needed to be addressed. The Securing America's Borders Act proposed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist aimed to increase legal immigration and restructure visa allocation, potentially adding 226,000 more family-based admissions annually. The bills proposed to increase family-based admissions by 226,000 annually and employment-based LPRs from 140,000 to 290,000. They would have recaptured visa numbers from FY2001 through FY2005 and raised the per-country limit on LPR visas. The proposed bill aimed to increase family-based and employment-based visa numbers, easing wait times for oversubscribed countries like China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. It would have reallocated visas, increased limits for immediate relatives of LPRs, and shifted visa allocations to unskilled workers. The Senate debated on Comprehensive Immigration Reform (S. 2611) introduced by Senators Hagel and Martinez, aiming to increase legal permanent immigration and restructure family-sponsored and employment-based visas. The Senate passed S. 2611, which aimed to increase legal permanent immigration and restructure family-sponsored and employment-based visas. Title V of S. 2611 proposed changes to family-based legal immigration, including eliminating deductions for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the family-sponsored numerical limit and increasing numerical limits for immediate relatives of LPRs. This could have potentially added 226,000 more family-based admissions annually. The Senate passed S. 2611 to increase legal permanent immigration and restructure family-sponsored and employment-based visas. S. 2611 aimed to allocate 480,000 family preferences and increase employment-based LPRs to 450,000 annually. Derivative family members of employment-based LPRs would no longer count towards the numerical ceiling. S. 2611 would reallocate employment-based visas to priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, and skilled shortage workers. S. 2611 aimed to increase legal permanent immigration by reallocating employment-based visas to priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, and skilled shortage workers. The bill proposed various percentages of visas for different categories of workers, with special exemptions for certain individuals. Additionally, the Senate passed an amendment to place an overall limit of 650,000 on employment-based LPRs and their accompanying family annually FY2007-FY2016. S. 2611 aimed to increase legal permanent immigration by reallocating employment-based visas to priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, and skilled shortage workers. The bill proposed exemptions for certain individuals, including widows, orphans, and those with specified risk factors. It also sought to increase overall levels of immigration by reclaiming unused family and employment-based visas. Additionally, the bill would have expanded guest worker and temporary foreign worker visas, with opportunities for these workers to adjust to LPR status. S. 2611 included provisions to exempt certain LPRs from numerical limits based on employment in occupations with insufficient U.S. workers. It also aimed to raise the per-country limit on LPR visas from 7% to 10% of the total preference allocation. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act proposed increasing the per-country limit on LPR visas to ease wait times for oversubscribed countries like China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. It also aimed to eliminate exceptions to per-country ceilings for certain family-based and employment-based LPRs. Title VI of H.R. 2330 proposed significant revisions to the permanent legal admissions sections of the INA, including removing immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the annual cap on family-based visas, lowering income requirements for sponsoring family members, recapturing unused LPR visas, increasing the annual limit on employment-based visas, and raising the per-country limit on LPR visas. The Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1438) proposed changes to the allocation of employment-based visas, including reducing visas for highly skilled individuals, increasing visas for unskilled workers, eliminating diversity visas, and recapturing unused visas for future use. The Immigration Accountability Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Chuck Hagel, aimed to provide earned adjustment of status for certain unauthorized aliens and expand legal immigration. It included provisions such as no longer deducting immediate relatives from family-sponsored numerical limits, treating spouses and minor children of LPRs the same as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, and reallocating family preference numbers. The Hagel immigration reform proposal aimed to revise temporary worker programs, border security, and employment verification. The Enforcement First Immigration Reform Act of 2005 focused on increasing employment-based admissions and decreasing family-based admissions, including eliminating certain preference categories. H.R. 3938 aimed to restrict legal immigration from Mexico by placing a moratorium on family-preference and employment-based admissions. H.R. 3700 proposed reducing worldwide employment-based immigrants and limiting visas to individuals with extraordinary abilities or advanced degrees. In the 110th Congress, Representative J. Gresham Barrett introduced H.R. 1912, which included a significant scaling back of permanent immigration. Representative Jerrold Nadler introduced H.R. 3006 to add \"permanent partners\" as a category for LPRs in family-based immigration. In the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, S. 1348, which was similar to S. 2611 from the previous Congress. A bipartisan compromise proposal for immigration reform was announced in May 2007, but the Senate did not pass cloture on the legislation. In the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, S. 1348, similar to S. 2611 from the previous Congress. Senators Kennedy and Specter introduced S. 1639, a bipartisan immigration reform proposal, which stalled in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when the cloture vote failed. S. 1639 would have revised legal permanent admissions and narrowed family-based immigration eligibility criteria. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 proposed changes to family-sponsored preference categories, including eliminating categories for adult children of U.S. citizens and LPRs. It aimed to reduce the worldwide level for family preferences to 127,000 and set a ceiling of 440,000 annually. Immediate relatives exempt from limits would only include spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. Parents of adult U.S. citizens would no longer be considered immediate relatives, with a cap of 40,000 annually. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 proposed changes to family-sponsored preference categories, including eliminating categories for adult children of U.S. citizens and LPRs. It aimed to reduce the worldwide level for family preferences to 127,000 and set a ceiling of 440,000 annually. Immediate relatives exempt from limits would only include spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. Parents of adult U.S. citizens would no longer be considered immediate relatives, with a cap of 40,000 annually. In terms of employment-based immigration, the first three preference categories would have been eliminated and replaced with a point system based on employment, education, English and civics, and family relationships. Certain eligible unauthorized aliens could adjust to LPR status through a point system after working in the U.S. on a Z visa. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 proposed changes to family-sponsored preference categories and employment-based immigration. It included a merit-based point system with factors like recent agricultural work experience, U.S. employment experience, home ownership, and medical insurance. The worldwide ceiling levels for the merit-based point system would have varied over the first six fiscal years post-enactment, with allocations for exceptional Y visa holders and reduction of employment-based backlog. The proposal aimed to reduce the employment-based backlog by setting aside visas for those with priority dates of May 1, 2005. The SKIL Act of 2007 would have expanded employment-based LPRs by exempting certain aliens from numerical limits. The SKIL Act of 2007 aimed to reduce the employment-based backlog by setting aside visas for certain individuals, including those with priority dates of May 1, 2005. Additionally, the STRIVE Act proposed changes to immigration laws, such as not counting derivative family members of employment-based LPRs towards the numerical ceiling. H.R. 1645, identical to S. 2611 of the 109th Congress, aimed to reallocate family-sponsored immigrants, increasing family-based admissions by at least 226,000 annually. The STRIVE Act would have increased employment-based LPRs from 140,000 to 290,000 and no longer counted derivative family members towards the numerical ceiling. The Save America Comprehensive Immigration Act proposed to double family-sponsored LPRs and diversity visas annually. The Nuclear Family Priority Act aimed to reallocate employment-based visas to different categories. The Nuclear Family Priority Act aimed to limit family-sponsored LPRs to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs, eliminating existing preference categories for adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens."
