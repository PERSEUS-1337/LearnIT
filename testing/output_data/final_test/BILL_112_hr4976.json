If the parcel meets the criteria, it can be recommended for conveyance. The Director or Regional Forester will provide a written explanation to the landowner if their request for conveyance of National Forest System or public lands is rejected, specifying the reasons for the rejection and how the parcel fails to meet the eligibility criteria.
