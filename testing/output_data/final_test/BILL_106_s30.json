Increase in Carryback Years for Farming Losses: Section 172(b) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow eligible taxpayers with farming losses to carry back losses for 10 years instead of 2 years for taxable years between 1997 and 2000. Definitions and rules related to farming losses are also updated in Section 172 of the Code. The new subsection (i) defines farming losses as the lesser of the taxpayer's net operating loss for the year or the loss from qualified farming businesses, limited to $200,000. The limitation on farming losses is set at $200,000 and applies to all persons treated as one employer under specific sections. For pass-thru entities like partnerships or trusts, the limitation is applied at both the entity and owner level. The limitation is reduced by any farming loss determined for a corporation where the taxpayer is an owner. The term 'eligible taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer deriving over 50% of gross income from qualified farming businesses in the 3-year period prior to the current taxable year. A 'qualified farming business' is defined as a farming trade or business as per section 2032A. The tax provision specifies that an eligible taxpayer must materially participate in the farming business and not exceed $7,000,000 in sales in a taxable year. Owners from the same family are considered as a single owner for this purpose. The tax provision defines \"20 percent owner\" and \"50 percent owner\" for farming businesses. A farming loss for a taxable year is treated as a separate net operating loss for that year. The tax provision allows taxpayers with a 10-year carryback option to elect to disregard certain rules when determining the carryback period for farming losses. This election must be made by the due date for filing the tax return and is irrevocable for that taxable year."
