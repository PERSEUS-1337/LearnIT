    "content": "Congress has a 20-day period to adopt a joint resolution expressing disapproval of the recommendations made by the Commission in the final report. If a joint resolution is passed, the President cannot suspend any regulation based on the report's recommendations. The joint resolution must be introduced within the 20-day period and explicitly state Congress's disapproval of the Gulf Deregulation Commission's recommendations. The joint resolution disapproving the recommendations of the Gulf Deregulation Commission must be introduced within a 20-day period. If the committee fails to report the resolution within this timeframe, it will be discharged. Under section 5(b), a committee will be discharged from further consideration of a resolution after a certain period, and the resolution will be placed on the House calendar. On or after the third day of the committee reporting or being discharged, any Member can move to proceed with the resolution's consideration. The motion to proceed with the resolution's consideration is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. All points of order against the resolution are waived, and the motion is not subject to amendment or certain motions. Debate on the resolution and all related motions is limited, and certain motions are not allowed, such as a motion to reconsider the vote. If a motion to proceed to consideration is agreed to, the respective House will immediately proceed without interruption. Debate on the resolution and related motions is limited to 2 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed. A motion to limit debate is permitted. Final passage of the resolution occurs after the debate and a quorum call if requested. Appeals from decisions of the Chair regarding the rules of the Senate or House of Representatives for a resolution described in subsection (b) shall be decided without debate. If one House receives a resolution from the other House, it will not be referred to a committee and cannot be considered in the receiving House. Upon receiving a resolution from the other House, it cannot be considered in the receiving House except for final passage. The procedure in the receiving House remains the same, but the vote on final passage will be on the resolution from the other House. Once the resolution from the other House is disposed of, the original resolution in the receiving House cannot be considered. This section is enacted by Congress. The section is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House, applicable only to the procedure for resolutions. It recognizes the constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures. SEC. 8. REINSTATEMENT OF REGULATIONS.\n\nA regulation suspended under section 6 can be reinstated by the department or agency head if the benefits outweigh the costs, subject to the President's direction. The reinstatement process must follow specific administrative procedures and relevant laws."
