    "content": "The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, with the definition of \"reasonable\" depending on the search's nature and governmental purpose. The 2009 Supreme Court case, Safford Unified School District #1 v. Redding, involved a strip search of a 13-year-old student, Savana Redding, who was implicated in possessing prohibited items at school. Savana Redding denied ownership of contraband found in her day planner at school, including pills, knives, lighters, and a cigarette. Despite being accused of distributing pills to other students, she claimed ignorance and allowed a search of her book bag by school authorities. The school authorities searched Savana Redding's bag and clothes for pills, leading to a violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment requires warrants based on probable cause for searches, but exceptions exist for cases of \"special needs\" where government interests outweigh privacy. The Supreme Court has established a balancing test for warrantless searches, allowing for searches without probable cause in certain situations. In cases of \"special needs,\" the government has the power to search with a \"compelling\" reason, giving less protection to individuals with a \"diminished expectation of privacy.\" The Supreme Court has applied a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard for searches in school settings, allowing for searches that are reasonably related to the objectives and not excessively intrusive based on the student's age, sex, and the nature of the infraction. The courts use three factors to determine reasonable suspicion for a school search: the degree of implied misconduct, specificity of information, and reliability of the source. The required knowledge component for probable cause in law enforcement searches is a 'fair probability' of finding evidence, while for school searches, it is a moderate chance. The Court found the school's search of Redding's bag and clothing constitutional based on reasonable suspicion of pill distribution. However, the search became unreasonable when it extended to her undergarments. The Court ruled that the school's search of Redding's bag and clothing was constitutional based on reasonable suspicion of pill distribution. However, the search of her undergarments was deemed unreasonable, as it exposed her breasts and pelvic area, causing fear and humiliation. The pills found were common pain relievers, with no indication of wrongdoing.

However, searching her undergarments was deemed unreasonable, exposing her breasts and pelvic area, causing fear and humiliation. The pills found were common pain relievers, with no evidence of wrongdoing. The Safford Court emphasized limits on searches in schools, stating that constitutional boundaries must be respected based on the specific case details."
