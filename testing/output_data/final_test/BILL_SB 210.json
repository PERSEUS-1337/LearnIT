    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 56326.5 of the Education Code mandates the joint selection of language developmental milestones by the department's Deaf and Hard of Hearing unit and the California School for the Deaf. These milestones will be used to create a resource for parents to track deaf and hard-of-hearing children's language development towards English literacy. The Education Code requires language developmental milestones to be created for deaf and hard-of-hearing children aged birth to five, using ASL and English. The milestones should cover typical development by age, be parent-friendly, and align with existing guidelines and standards. The Education Code mandates the creation of language developmental milestones for deaf and hard-of-hearing children aged birth to five, using ASL and English. These milestones should align with existing guidelines and standards and be parent-friendly. Additionally, the department will select tools for educators to assess language and literacy development in deaf and hard-of-hearing children, tracking their progress towards English literacy. Parents can bring observations to IFSP or IEP meetings. The tools selected for assessing deaf and hard-of-hearing children's development should align with existing guidelines, be appropriate for this population, and may be used to track progress and modify IFSP or IEP plans. Advisory committee recommendations may also be considered. The department will distribute parent resources for deaf and hard-of-hearing children and educator tools for local educational agencies to use in developing IFSP and IEP plans. Training will be provided to help children prepare for kindergarten in ASL and English. If a deaf or hard-of-hearing child struggles with language skills, their IFSP or IEP team must explain why and recommend strategies to help them succeed in English literacy. The department will provide language developmental milestones to an advisory committee for possible inclusion in a parent resource. The committee will recommend milestones for selection, and the department will inform them of the chosen milestones by June 30, 2017. The Superintendent will establish an advisory committee to select language developmental milestones for children who are deaf or hard of hearing, with input from experts. The committee will consist of 13 volunteers, majority being deaf or hard of hearing, within the field of education for the deaf and hard of hearing. The advisory committee will include parents, teachers, and experts in language outcomes for deaf and hard-of-hearing children using ASL and English. The advisory committee will consist of advocates for teaching ASL and English, specialists in early intervention for deaf children, a teacher specializing in ASL and English assessment, and a speech pathologist focusing on spoken English. The advisory committee may advise on the content and administration of assessments for children with disabilities, including deaf and hard-of-hearing children's language and literacy development. They may also make recommendations for future research to improve progress measurement in this area. The department must annually produce a report on language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children aged birth to five years, compared to their peers. The report will be based on existing data from the state performance plan and will be available on the department's website. All activities must comply with federal laws on education for children with disabilities and pupil information privacy. The term \"language developmental milestones\" refers to development milestones aligned with state instruments for assessing children from birth to five years. This section applies only to children in that age range and is subject to funding in the annual Budget Act. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
