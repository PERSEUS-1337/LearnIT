    "content": "The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by Congress in 1972 to provide unbiased information on the effects of technological applications for legislative assessment. It operated for over two decades, producing numerous assessments and papers. In 1995, Congress eliminated funding for OTA, leading to its closure in 1996. The closure of OTA in 1996 did not repeal the statute authorizing its establishment and functions. Efforts have been made to reestablish OTA or similar functions elsewhere. The report details OTA's history, structure, funding, and options for its revival. Groundbreaking emerging technologies in various fields are expected to have significant economic and social impacts, affecting how people work, travel, learn, and engage with others. Efforts have been made to reestablish OTA or similar functions since its closure in 1996. Congress has provided guidance to the Government Accountability Office on technology assessment from 2002 to 2019. The federal government looks to experts for insights on new technologies and their implications for public policy. This includes funding R&D, creating infrastructure policies, and implementing regulations to ensure safety and protection. The federal government relies on experts for guidance on new technologies and their impact on public policy. This involves funding research, establishing infrastructure policies, and enforcing regulations for safety and protection. Additionally, policies focus on promoting technology development, investment, trade, intellectual property protection, and education and training programs to support innovation and address workforce displacement. Science and technology activities are influenced by tradeoffs from various policy objectives, including intellectual property protection, market expansion, national security, and geopolitical goals. The U.S. government has a history of seeking guidance on scientific and technical issues from knowledgeable individuals, both informally and formally through Presidents and congressional leaders. The U.S. government seeks guidance on scientific and technical issues from various organizations and societies, including the American Philosophical Society, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Smithsonian Institution, and National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences investigates and reports on science or art subjects for the government without compensation. It is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Medicine, and National Research Council. These entities are nonprofit and nongovernmental. Throughout the 20th century, Congresses and Presidents established executive authorities for these organizations. Throughout the 20th century, Congresses and Presidents established executive branch organizations to provide scientific insight and advice to the President, inform Congress and federal departments, and agencies. Key advisory and coordinating organizations included NACA, SAC, PSAC, ISETAP, PCST, and PCAST. The NSB, overseeing the National Science Foundation, was established by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950. The National Science Board (NSB) was established by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 with a key mandate to provide reports to the President and Congress on science, engineering, and education policy matters. Prior to the establishment of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), various science and technology advisory organizations were under the President's authority, prompting lawmakers to express the need for Congress to have its own agency. In 1963, lawmakers expressed the need for Congress to have its own agency, OTA, to provide detailed science and engineering analyses tailored to legislative needs. Representative George Miller emphasized the importance of independent judgment and evaluation of decisions. In 1963, Senator Edward L. Bartlett introduced a bill to establish a congressional Office of Science and Technology due to the lack of resources and facilities in Congress compared to the executive branch. He highlighted the need for independent scientific advice for lawmakers to legislate on technological matters effectively. Senator Bartlett testified in 1963 on the need for Congress to make decisions on scientific and technical resources, emphasizing the importance of an informed legislature. In 1970, Representative Daddario also highlighted the need for attention to technological matters in establishing the OTA. Emilio Daddario emphasized the importance of Congress having its own independent source of technological information to ensure its role as an equal branch in the federal structure. Representative Chuck Mosher also highlighted the need for a science and technology advisory solely for Members of Congress to counter the expertise of executive agencies. The Congress requires a stronger source of professional advice and information independent of executive agencies to effectively challenge and question their proposals and expert testimony. This will ensure Congress can fulfill its role as an equal branch in the federal structure. The creation of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was seen as a way for Congress to assert its authority in response to Richard Nixon's presidency. Some questioned the need for OTA, suggesting that existing agencies like the Congressional Research Service (CRS) or General Accounting Office (GAO) could fulfill its functions at a lower cost. Congress debated the value of establishing OTA in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Congress enacted the Technology Assessment Act of 1972, establishing the Office of Technology Assessment to provide early indications of the impacts of technology applications for Congress. Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to provide unbiased information on the impacts of technological applications, recognizing the need for informed decision-making on national issues. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by Congress to provide unbiased information on the impacts of technological applications for legislative assessment. OTA's structure, functions, duties, and powers are outlined in its organic statute codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7471-481. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the establishment of an Office of Technology Assessment, composed of a Director and a Technology Assessment Board (TAB). The TAB formulates policies for OTA, identifies impacts of technology, alternative methods, and programs, and presents findings to legislative authorities. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the Office of Technology Assessment to present completed analyses to legislative authorities, identify areas needing further research, and undertake additional activities as directed. OTA is empowered to utilize external resources, form task forces, enter into contracts, and make payments related to technology assessment. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the Office of Technology Assessment to utilize voluntary personnel, acquire necessary property, and secure information from executive departments for its functions. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the Technology Assessment Board (TAB) to set policies for the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) and appoints 13 members, including Senators, House Members, and the OTA Director. The TAB can also subpoena individuals with a majority vote. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the TAB to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and make expenditures as needed. The chair and vice chair of the TAB alternate between the House and Senate each Congress. No TAB was established after the 104th Congress. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the TAB to appoint the OTA Director for up to six years, with the authority to remove the Director before the term ends. The Director can appoint a Deputy Director and both are restricted from engaging in other business or holding office in organizations OTA contracts with. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 authorizes the OTA Director and Deputy Director's pay levels and their appointment authority. OTA can conduct technology assessments upon request from specific congressional committees, the TAB, or the Director in consultation with the TAB. The act also establishes a Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC) to review and make recommendations on OTA activities. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 establishes the Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC) to review and make recommendations on OTA activities. The TAAC is composed of 12 members, including 10 public members appointed by the TAB, the Comptroller General, and the Director of the Congressional Research Service. Public members serve four-year terms and receive compensation for their duties. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 establishes the Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC) with 12 members, including public members appointed by the TAB, the Comptroller General, and the Director of the Congressional Research Service. TAAC members may be reimbursed for travel and expenses, with terms staggered and limited to two appointments. The Librarian of Congress can provide services and assistance to OTA through CRS, with the option of reimbursement. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 establishes the Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC) with 12 members, including public members appointed by the TAB, the Comptroller General, and the Director of the Congressional Research Service. TAAC members may be reimbursed for travel and expenses. The Librarian of Congress can provide services and assistance to OTA through CRS, with the option of reimbursement. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office is directed to provide financial and administrative services to OTA, including budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, personnel, and procurement. OTA is to maintain a liaison with the National Science Foundation for technology assessment purposes. The Technology Assessment Act of 1972 establishes the Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC) with 12 members appointed by the TAB, Comptroller General, and Director of the Congressional Research Service. OTA assessments must be shared with Congress, and information produced by OTA can be publicly released unless it violates national security statutes. OTA's contractors and other parties must maintain detailed records for audits as prescribed by OTA. OTA's funding from FY1974 to FY1996 grew steadily, with appropriations mainly from regular and supplemental acts. Unused funds were reappropriated, and funding peaked at $21.3 million in FY1995. Congressional oversight included audits and examinations of OTA's books and records. OTA's budget increased steadily from FY1974 to FY1995, reaching a peak of $35.1 million in constant FY2019 dollars in FY1992. However, funding was not continued beyond February 1996, and OTA received $3.6 million to close its operations. Staffing levels fluctuated over the years, with a peak of 151 in FY1977 and remaining between 123 and 143 from FY1978 to FY1991. In FY1992, OTA's staffing increased to 193 and rose to 210 in FY1993. However, staffing fell to 197 in FY1994 and continued to decline until the agency's funding ended in FY1996. Congress imposed annual caps on OTA's staff employees, starting at 130 in FY1978 and increasing to 143 by FY1985, maintained through FY1995. OTA also utilized contractors in addition to full-time and temporary staff. In FY1992, OTA's staffing increased to 193 and rose to 210 in FY1993, utilizing contractors to supplement staff knowledge. Contractors were critical for delivering authoritative products on emerging scientific and technological fields. OTA was designed to serve Congress' unique needs by producing reports tuned to their language and context. OTA's principal products, technology assessments, were designed to inform congressional deliberations about science and technology issues without recommending specific policy actions. Supporters, critics, and analysts have offered various views on OTA's work, with some finding it professional, authoritative, and helpful to Congress. Representative Morris Udall testified in a 1979 hearing about the clear usefulness of OTA in the legislative process. Some critics raised concerns about OTA's effectiveness and relevance, leading to discussions on its uniqueness, timeliness, and objectivity. Supporters argued that OTA served a vital and irreplaceable role for Congress, relying on external experts for assessments. Some critics questioned the need for the Office of Technology Assessment, suggesting that its mission could be fulfilled by other organizations like GAO, CRS, or the National Academies. Senator Jim Sasser expressed doubts about OTA's necessity during a 1979 hearing. The need for the Office of Technology Assessment has been questioned due to concerns about duplication of studies by other congressional agencies and executive branch organizations. Representative Ron Packard highlighted serious duplication in the legislative branch, leading to the elimination of funding for OTA in 1995. In 2006, Carnegie Mellon University professor Jon M. Peha argued that while other nonfederal organizations produce high-quality work similar to OTA, their analyses differ in characteristics and motivations. The National Academies are also considered a valuable resource. The National Academies and other nonfederal organizations produce valuable work, but their analyses may not always align with Congress's needs. Congress established OTA to provide unbiased assessments of options for lawmakers to make informed decisions. Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to help anticipate and understand the consequences of technological applications in public policy. OTA provided information, analysis, and options to inform congressional decision-making through various mechanisms beyond formal assessments, such as memoranda, testimony, briefings, and workshops. Representative Rush Holt praised OTA's reports for their timeliness and relevance, noting that many are still useful today. Some critics argued that the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was too slow in producing reports, with important decisions often made before the reports were released. Despite some intellectual value in late reports, the process was criticized for being out of sync with the faster pace of legislative decision-making. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was criticized for producing late reports that did not help Congress due to their slow pace. Reports could take 18 months or more to publish, leading to concerns about their quality and utility in the legislative process. Senator Jim Sasser also criticized OTA studies as mediocre and not effectively used in decision-making. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was criticized for producing late reports that did not help Congress due to their slow pace. Reports could take 18 months or more to publish, leading to concerns about their quality and utility in the legislative process. Senator Jim Sasser also criticized OTA studies as mediocre and not effectively used in decision-making. In 1984, the Heritage Foundation praised OTA's independence and quality, stating that it performs an important function for Congress by providing independent analyses. Some believe objectivity is essential for technology assessment to support congressional decision-making. Representative Mark Takano and Representative Sean Casten praised OTA for providing unbiased technical assessments. However, a report by Richard Sclove suggested that OTA's work may have presented a misleading sense of objectivity. The OTA's work may have implied a misleading sense of objectivity in technology assessment, obscuring the value judgments involved. Concerns about objectivity were also linked to single-party control of Congress during OTA's existence, highlighting the need for bipartisan oversight to address bias perceptions. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about bias in OTA, emphasizing the importance of bipartisan oversight to ensure objectivity and responsiveness to both minority and majority parties. Critics suggested that OTA's objectivity may have been influenced by the perspectives of the Technology Assessment Board (TAB), limiting its impact. In the 1980s, concerns were raised about OTA's objectivity being influenced by the perspectives of the TAB members, hindering its ability to achieve true objectivity. Critics, including author Donald Lambro and the Heritage Foundation, criticized OTA's work as partisan, duplicative, shoddy, and lacking in objectivity. Despite quality control procedures, questions remained about OTA's balance and objectivity. The Heritage Foundation criticized OTA's assessment of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) for intentional political bias and lack of objectivity. Concerns were raised about OTA's procedures and biases, warranting a congressional review. The Heritage Foundation criticized OTA's assessment of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) for political bias. Some OTA staffers opposed the SDI, leading to controversy and accusations of lack of objectivity in OTA's work. Senator Jesse Helms asserted that OTA had lost its objectivity and was focused on discrediting President Reagan's SDI. The OTA, criticized for bias by The Heritage Foundation, has been accused of lacking objectivity in its work on the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Despite disagreements, Representative Rush Holt defended OTA's assessment of SDI, while a 2004 article suggested that Republican opposition to OTA stemmed from a belief in its biased approach to providing scientific rationale for liberal policy ideas. The Georgetown Law's Institute for Technology Law and Policy report highlighted \"the perception of partisanship\" as a weakness of the OTA. Early oversight by Congress raised concerns about OTA's costs and contract overruns, which OTA attributed to modifications in contract scope and the use of outside talent for assessments. The OTA process for technology assessment faced debate over public input. Some argued that OTA lacked an effective mechanism for public comments, while others praised its participatory nature. Former OTA staff recognized efforts for public participation but acknowledged shortcomings at times. The OTA assessment process aimed for balanced participation from various groups, but it was criticized for being time-consuming and not fully inclusive. The TAAC was created for nongovernmental input, but its role was unclear. Other criticisms included inconsistency in addressing ethical and social implications of technologies. The defunding of OTA raised concerns about the lack of consideration for ethical and social implications of technologies and the need for informed laypeople views. Members of Congress discussed potential alternatives to OTA's functions. The defunding of OTA led to discussions about transferring its functions to other agencies like CRS and GAO, or utilizing external organizations for technology assessments. The Senate Committee on Appropriations disagreed with transferring OTA functions to CRS, citing differences between the two agencies. The House of Representatives adopted an amendment transferring the functions of the Office of Technology Assessment to the Congressional Research Service, which the Committee disagrees with. Senator Daniel Inouye argued that OTA's unique role in providing technical information to Congress should not be overlooked. The Office of Technology Assessment provides Congress with essential technical information that other support agencies cannot offer due to their distinct roles. The U.S. General Accounting Office, Congressional Research Service, and Congressional Budget Office each have their own functions and may not have the expertise in new technologies like the OTA. The Office of Technology Assessment provides specialized technical information to Congress, which other support agencies like the U.S. General Accounting Office, Congressional Research Service, and Congressional Budget Office may not have expertise in. Representative Ron Packard described the elimination of OTA as \"legislative rightsizing\" and suggested that other congressional agencies could fulfill OTA's role. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) is being considered for elimination and its functions absorbed by other agencies like CRS, GAO, and National Academy of Sciences. Representative Henry Hyde supports this move, stating that OTA has outgrown its usefulness and its mission has expanded beyond science. Privatization or contracting out the services are also suggested as alternatives. Henry Hyde supported an amendment to transfer funds and analysts from the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), cutting 50 jobs and reducing the budget by 32%. Despite the amendment not passing, Congress sought help from other organizations like the National Academies for scientific and technical information previously provided by OTA. Congress initially turned to the National Academies for technology assessment information after defunding the OTA, but later shifted to relying on the GAO for these capabilities. The GAO has been working on enhancing its technology assessment abilities since the early 2000s, with guidance from Congress through reports accompanying annual Legislative Branch Appropriations bills. In 2000, the GAO established the Center for Technology and Engineering to further support these efforts. In the early 2000s, the GAO established the Center for Technology and Engineering to enhance its technology assessment abilities. Congress directed GAO to conduct a technology assessment pilot project with a budget of up to $500,000. The assessment focused on biometric technologies for U.S. border control, following requests from Senators and support from House Members. The GAO assessed biometric technologies through regular audit processes and meetings with external experts, resulting in a report on using biometrics for border security. Despite a Senate appropriation for GAO studies, funds were not provided for a specific study in the legislative branch appropriations act. The GAO conducted a technology assessment on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure protection in 2004. The Senate Committee recommended $1 million for technology assessments, emphasizing the need for a technology assessment capability in the Legislative Branch. In 2004, a bill was introduced in the Senate (S. 2556, 108th Congress) to establish a technology assessment capability within GAO, authorizing the Comptroller General to conduct studies and establish procedures for assessments. The bill also proposed a five-member technology assessment advisory panel and allocated $2 million annually for assessments. The bill introduced in the Senate and House aimed to establish a technology assessment capability within GAO. GAO requested $545,000 for new positions and contract support for technology assessments. The House Appropriations Committee encouraged GAO to conduct additional technology assessment studies. An amendment to add $30 million for a Center for Science and Technology Assessment was rejected by the House. The House rejected the assessment. The Senate Committee limited future technology assessments to those supported by both houses of Congress and addressing national issues. The House Committee recommended $2.5 million for GAO for technology assessments in FY2008. The Committee believes Congress needs effective means to secure unbiased information on scientific and technical developments for legislative assessment. The Senate committee recommended $750,000 and four FTE employees for a technology assessment function in the GAO, citing budget constraints for not establishing a separate entity. The focus is on producing quality, objective, and balanced reports. The Committee directed GAO to focus on producing quality, objective, and balanced reports for technology assessments. Congress allocated $2.5 million for GAO in FY2008 and emphasized the importance of unbiased information on scientific and technical developments. For FY2009, funding for GAO's technology assessment was continued, with a reminder to work closely with Congress. In FY2010, the House Committee recommended maintaining funding at the previous level. No specific direction was given for technology assessment in FY2011-2014. In 2015, the Senate Committee commended GAO for its advice but noted limitations due to budget constraints. The Senate Committee recommended increasing GAO funding for technology assessment to enhance capabilities and submit a strategic plan. The plan would address challenges, improve responsiveness to congressional needs, and identify additional resources needed. The committee praised GAO for expanding its assessment analysis through a new strategic plan in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2016. They also encouraged focusing hiring efforts on increasing technology expertise. The committee praised GAO for its technology assessment work and encouraged increasing scientific and technical capacity. GAO has produced highly technical reports on technology assessments and other scientific issues for Congress since 2002. They have also created best practice guides for government use in areas like project scheduling and technology readiness assessment. GAO's Center for Science, Technology, and Engineering (CSTE) provides technical expertise in areas such as cybersecurity, nuclear issues, and technical systems acquisitions. The e-Security laboratory and Cost Engineering Sciences groups conduct security evaluations and operations research analyses. GAO supports Congress through testimony, legislative review, and report recommendations. GAO's Center for Science, Technology, and Engineering (CSTE) provides technical expertise in areas such as cybersecurity, nuclear issues, and technical systems acquisitions. The organization uses rigorous methods in its technical reports, engaging external experts and conducting cost-benefit analysis, risk analysis, technology maturity assessment, and scenario-based trend identification. The Comptroller General is praised for building scientific and technical capacity within GAO to meet the growing demand for technical work. GAO is encouraged to maintain communication with Congress to ensure lawmakers are aware of their services. No specific direction was given by Congress in FY2018 appropriations report language regarding technology assessment. In FY2018, Congress directed GAO to expand its technology assessment capacity by reorganizing its S&T function and creating a more prominent office for this purpose. GAO was tasked with providing a plan and timetable within 180 days to enhance its capabilities in scientific and technological assessments. The Center for Science, Technology, and Engineering (CSTE) within GAO has been supporting Congress since 2002 with objective and timely assessments of emerging science and technologies. The conferees seek to expand technology assessment capacity within the Legislative Branch by reorganizing GAO's technology and science function to create a new prominent office. GAO is directed to provide a detailed plan and timeline for this new office in consultation with internal and external stakeholders. GAO is directed to expand technology assessment capacity by reorganizing its technology and science function to create a new office. The plan should include a revised organizational structure, cost estimates, and analysis on scope of work, staff size, shared efficiencies, and engagement with Congress. GAO announced plans to double its science and technology workforce and establish a new STAA team for technology assessments and federal program audits. The GAO is expanding its technology assessment capacity by creating a new office, the GAO STAA, to focus on auditing federal science and technology programs, utilizing best practices in engineering sciences, and exploring new advanced analytic capabilities. The plan includes increasing STAA staff from 49 to 70 by the end of FY2019, with potential growth to 100-140 staff members based on congressional requests for technology assessments. The GAO established the STAA office to provide technology assessments and technical assistance to Congress, evaluate S&T programs, and offer best practices in engineering sciences. GAO published 16 technology assessment reports from 2002 to April 2020. Congress directed CRS to contract with the National. In response to technology policy challenges, Congress directed CRS to contract with NAPA to produce a report on resources available to Members of Congress for science and technology policy. The study should assess the need for a separate entity to provide nonpartisan advice on these issues and determine if it duplicates existing services. NAPA published its report in October 2019. In October 2019, NAPA published a report on resources available to Members of Congress for science and technology policy. The study assessed the need for a separate entity to provide nonpartisan advice on these issues and determine if it duplicates existing services. The report highlighted the increasing need for congressional expertise on science and technology-related issues. The NAPA report identified a growing need for congressional expertise in science and technology policy. It found that Members of Congress lack professional backgrounds in S&T and rely on staff and legislative support agencies for support. The number of staff available for S&T policy work has decreased, leading to a reliance on expert advisors for understanding complex issues. The NAPA report highlighted the reliance of Members of Congress on expert advisors and legislative support agencies like CRS and GAO for understanding technical policy issues. It also noted a decrease in committee staff and hearings, impacting the ability to build subject matter expertise in S&T policy matters. Congressional offices are overwhelmed by constituent communication due to digital growth. The NAPA report highlighted the challenges faced by Congressional offices in managing the increasing volume of constituent communications. This trend, combined with fixed budgets, has resulted in fewer staff available for policy work. NAPA suggested three options to address these gaps: enhancing existing entities like GAO and CRS, creating a new agency, or implementing changes to current models. Option 3 from the NAPA report recommends enhancing existing entities like GAO and CRS, and creating an S&T advisory office led by a Congressional S&T Advisor to strengthen Congress's capacity in utilizing science and technology policy information. GAO should develop its Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team to address supply gaps, while CRS should enhance its quick-turnaround services. The NAPA report recommends enhancing existing entities like GAO and CRS, and creating an Office of the Congressional S&T Advisor (OCSTA) to strengthen Congress's capacity in utilizing science and technology policy information. OCSTA would focus on building absorptive capacity, supporting recruitment of S&T advisors, and conducting horizon scanning to identify future S&T issues. Congress should also establish a Coordinating Council to limit duplication and coordinate resources for the benefit of Congress. NAPA recommends enhancing existing entities like GAO and CRS, and creating an Office of the Congressional S&T Advisor (OCSTA) to strengthen Congress's capacity in utilizing science and technology policy information. Horizon scanning is emphasized to identify future S&T issues, serving as an early warning system. NAPA suggests that GAO's horizon scanning efforts can be expanded to further support Congress in this area. The need for reestablishing the Office of Technology Assessment was not evaluated by NAPA. NAPA believes Congress intended technology assessment to be a mission of GAO. Panel member Michael McCord stated that the lack of consensus on reestablishing OTA for over two decades influenced the panel's perspective. While NAPA did not recommend reinstating OTA, McCord noted that it wouldn't be a terrible idea if Congress chose to do so. The viability of reestablishing the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) has been a topic of discussion. Various organizations, including the R Street Institute, have proposed bringing back OTA to provide valuable S&T advice to Congress. Concerns such as cost, political implications, and perceived biases have been raised as potential obstacles to OTA's reinstatement. The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard's Kennedy School published a report in September 2019, recommending the revival of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to improve Congress's science and technology expertise. The report highlights the need for additional government intervention and expertise to address gaps in meeting Congress's needs. The Belfer Center report identified gaps hindering Congress's ability to create effective S&T legislation, suggesting the need to improve Congress's absorptive capacity. It proposed four actions to address these gaps. The Belfer Center report proposed four actions to improve Congress's ability to create effective S&T legislation, including creating a legislative support body, hiring additional S&T talent, increasing funding for committees, and producing information in useful formats. The report highlighted a widening gap between responsive lawmaking in Congress and advancements in science and technology, calling for improved absorptive capacity. The report suggests establishing a Congressional Futures Office to enhance Congress's S&T capacity through open-ended product-service design and global networks of expertise. It praises GAO's outreach and transparency in technology assessments but questions its ability to cover OTA's work effectively. The Lincoln Network and Demand Progress report criticized the lack of details in NAPA's recommendation for an Office of the Congressional S&T Advisor (OCSTA), questioning its functions and effectiveness in horizon scanning. They also recommended further analysis on reviving and modernizing OTA, evaluating political considerations, and building congressional S&T capacity. The report highlighted concerns about the Congressional Research Service (CRS) being risk-averse and politicized, leading to a loss of talent and undermining analytical capabilities. Recommendations were made for additional analysis of CRS institutional challenges before investing in it further. Members of Congress have made efforts to restore funding for the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) or a similar technology assessment function since 1995. Options for Congress to reestablish a technology assessment function include reviving the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) with or without changes to its statute, assigning new technology assessment authority to an existing legislative branch agency, or outsourcing assessments to organizations like the National Academies. Alternatively, Congress could rely on existing sources for scientific and technological analysis. Options for Congress to reestablish a technology assessment function include reviving the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) with or without changes to its statute, assigning new technology assessment authority to an existing legislative branch agency, or outsourcing assessments to organizations like the National Academies. Congress may need to provide explicit guidance on reestablishing OTA, as its statutory authorities still exist despite being defunded in the past. Members of Congress have made various efforts since 1995 to revive OTA through legislative actions. In the 116th Congress, the House approved $6 million for the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2020, but the funds were not included in the final appropriations act. The defunded OTA's statutory authorities remain in law, allowing Congress to potentially reestablish OTA by providing funding for its operations. To reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), Congress would need to provide funds for its operations and reaffirm its intent for OTA to operate according to previous statutes. This would involve appointing members to the Technology Assessment Board (TAB), hiring an OTA Director, analysts, and support staff, securing office space and equipment, and obtaining necessary services. This approach offers simplicity through a straightforward appropriation and a clear statement of Congress' intent. Reestablishing the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) would require an appropriation and Congress' intent. Advantages include a quicker operational start, while disadvantages involve potential criticism for not addressing past critiques and fiscal concerns. Reestablishing OTA would require tens of millions of dollars in annual appropriations for office space, equipment, management, operational costs, and analysts. Funding could be gradually increased to enhance analytical capabilities, similar to the reestablishment of ACUS in 2009 with an initial appropriation of $1.5 million. Congress could allocate additional budget authority to support OTA's reestablishment. Congress could reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) by allocating additional budget authority or reallocating funding from other agencies. This would require funding for office space, equipment, and analysts, with potential statutory changes to address past criticisms and ensure timely delivery of information and technology assessments relevant to legislation. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) provides authoritative and high-quality technology assessments for legislation. Congress may consider redefining technology assessment and ensuring objectivity in topic selection and assessment conduct. The need to clarify the definition of technology assessment in the context of OTA's work has been discussed, along with criticisms related to structural issues such as narrow focus and lack of bipartisan input. Congress may consider structural changes for broader input and bipartisan approval of decisions. Congress may wish to consider the positions, appointment processes, and powers of the Director and Deputy Director of OTA to ensure they are appropriate for accomplishing the agency's mission. OTA utilized contractors with specialized expertise for technology assessments on various topics, making it cost prohibitive to maintain permanent staff with deep expertise in each area. Congress could provide additional guidance on the composition of OTA's staff, the use of contractors, and approaches to managing the agency's operations. The current statute establishes the TAB and TAAC for OTA policies and external expertise. Congress may consider alternative approaches for managing technology assessments and public input mechanisms. The Wilson Center's report suggested that a reestablished U.S. technology assessment agency should employ participatory technology assessment (pTA) to enable broader public input. pTA allows laypeople to develop informed judgments on complex topics, deepening social and ethical analysis of technology. The current statute authorizes various officials and organizations to initiate technology assessments, including committee chairs, the TAB, and the Director. Congress may consider expanding or reducing this list, or authorizing the OTA Director to initiate assessments without additional approval. Administrative provisions are also included in the statute. The current statute authorizes various officials and organizations to initiate technology assessments. Congress may review administrative authorities for possible modifications. One disadvantage is the potential inability to achieve consensus on OTA statute revisions, reducing the likelihood of agency reestablishment. The defunding of OTA led to the anticipation that other government agencies might expand their capabilities to meet Congress's technology assessment needs. Options for establishing technology assessment functions within GAO and CRS were discussed, with GAO already developing a capability in FY2002. This approach would leverage existing capabilities within the legislative branch. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been producing technology assessments since 2002 and recently established a new STAA team. One advantage is GAO's reputation for high-quality analytical work, but a potential disadvantage is that technology assessment is only one of several functions of GAO. Critics have noted that GAO lacks a larger permanent staff of subject experts and independence to compete for resources effectively. The analysis highlighted weaknesses in GAO's technology assessment program, suggesting that GAO lacks expertise and policy options compared to OTA. It recommended reforms in GAO's consultancy services. On the other hand, the Congressional Research Service provides comprehensive research and analysis on legislative issues with a staff of 600, including experts in science, engineering, and technology policy. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) provides consultancy on science, engineering, and technology policy to Congress. Their analytical work is short-term and tailored to specific requests, unlike the longer technology assessments conducted by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). CRS's statutory mission is to provide information and research to Congress. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) serves Congress and not the public. After the defunding of OTA, some Members of Congress expected CRS to take on OTA's work. In 1999, CRS reorganized to include science and technology analysts in various units. However, some believe this change reduced CRS's ability to replace OTA. The closure of OTA led to a reorganization of CRS, but it was unrealistic to expect CRS to fully replace OTA. Some believed the reorganization improved CRS's ability to provide comprehensive analysis to Congress, including technology assessments. Advantages of using CRS for technology assessments include its reputation for authoritative, objective, and nonpartisan analysis, as well as its experts in science and technology policy. Disadvantages include CRS's lack of experience in conducting in-depth technology assessments. CRS lacks experience and expertise in conducting in-depth technology assessments like OTA. Acquiring such capabilities would require significant changes in work culture, resources, and staff. The National Academies have a long history of providing high-quality expertise on science, engineering, and health matters to Congress and the nation. The National Academies provide expertise in science, engineering, and health for Congress and the nation. They have seven major program areas and members are elected based on achievements in their fields. Experts volunteer to address society's challenges by serving on study committees. The defunding of the OTA led to speculation that other organizations like the National Academies could take on technology assessments. Representative Jack Kingston mentioned the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council as potential alternatives for technology studies. According to author Peter Blair, the National Academies saw a temporary increase in congressional requests for reports after the closure of OTA, but demand returned to normal levels shortly after. The number of congressionally mandated reports doubled in the 105th Congress but then dropped back to the historical average by the 107th Congress. The reason for this decrease in requests is unclear. The National Academies faced a decrease in demand for science and technology information and advice due to various factors such as relevance, timeliness, and fiscal constraints. The study process is structured and includes defining the study, committee selection, meetings, information gathering, and report review. Some criticize the National Academies for not being able to respond to congressional needs in a timely manner. In 2006, Peter Blair testified at a House Science Committee hearing on scientific advice for Congress. He highlighted timeliness and cost as factors affecting the National Academies' usefulness to decision-makers. Blair mentioned that NRC studies can take 18 months or longer due to various processes and coordination efforts. Congressional studies must be defined and funded before they can begin, which can take six to nine months. The National Academies' study process can take six to nine months to initiate under negotiated contracts with federal agency sponsors. Delays also occur due to the time needed to enact relevant legislation for Congress-mandated studies. The cost of studies is perceived as high, partly because separate contracts are negotiated for each study. The process is not perfectly suited to serve all government needs and is currently less equipped to assess broader policy implications beyond technical analysis. Blair suggested establishing a sub-unit of the National Academies for technology assessments, utilizing their credibility and expertise to inform policymakers on science and technology matters. The National Academies, a private nonprofit corporation, provides technology assessments to Congress but faces concerns about cost, timeliness, and ability to advise on non-scientific implications. Some suggest a need for an organization like the OTA, while others believe Congress already has access to necessary scientific advice. Congress has access to a wide array of entities for scientific and technical analysis, including federal agencies, GAO, CRS, advisory committees, National Academies, academic researchers, industry associations, and more. The information provided varies in terms of authoritativeness, objectivity, independence, timeliness, and cost. Relying on existing agencies offers advantages in terms of infrastructure, people, and processes. The key advantage of relying on existing agencies for scientific and technical analysis is the infrastructure, people, and processes already in place, reducing time and logistical complexities. However, some believe that information provided by these entities may lack authoritativeness, objectivity, or independence. The creation of OTA in 1972 was driven by the need for Congress to have its own independent source of expertise. Some organizations provide science and technology information to Congress for decision-making on national policy. There is a debate in Congress about the need to establish an OTA-like organization to meet unique information needs. Some in Congress debate the need for a new organization to provide science and technology information and analysis services, while others disagree. Concerns about duplication of capabilities have been raised, with a consensus on the need to prevent duplicative organizations and functions to minimize costs. Congress may need to further the process to avoid duplication and meet its information and analysis needs. Congress may need to identify science and technology analysis needs, assess current federally funded organizations addressing these needs, determine areas of overlap or duplication, and decide if new organizations are necessary or if existing ones can meet the requirements effectively. The historical overview of the definition of technology assessment includes discussions from the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading to the establishment of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1972. Representative Emilio Q. Daddario played a key role in identifying technology assessment as a major activity in 1965. In 1967, Representative Daddario introduced H.R. 6698 to establish a Technology Assessment Board for identifying the potentials of research and technology, assessing their impact, and informing the public of their potential risks. Technology Assessment is described as policy research providing balanced appraisals to policymakers, aiming to ask the right questions and obtain timely answers. Technology Assessment is a method of analysis that evaluates the impact of technological programs, uncovering desirable, undesirable, and uncertain consequences. It aims to inform policymakers with balanced appraisals to foster economic growth and societal benefits, while also considering potential harmful side effects of innovations. Technology Assessment evaluates the impact of technological programs, identifying desirable, undesirable, and uncertain consequences to inform policymakers for balanced appraisals. It considers the need for experimentation and pilot projects to determine necessary regulations before technology can diffuse through society. Assessment of risks is crucial alongside benefits, especially when uncertain consequences and severity of impact are unknown, warranting further research. Technology Assessment for the Congress focuses on applications in the United States but also considers international aspects as man-made forces expand globally. Establishing cause and effect relationships is essential for assessing technology's impact. The function of technology assessment is to identify short-term and long-range impacts and trends, focusing on consequences that can be predicted with a useful degree of probability. Assessing technology involves establishing cause and effect relationships from the action or project source to the locale of consequences, including direct and indirect effects. Predicting changes in values, attitudes, or motivations is challenging as they are usually long-term and fall beyond the primary focus of assessment. Technology Assessment is a form of policy research that provides decision makers with a list of future courses of action backed by systematic analysis of consequences. It is not technological forecasting or program planning, but rather a balanced analysis of potential benefits and risks of each policy alternative. Assessment incorporates prediction and planning to expose potential program consequences, serving as an aid to judgment. Its utility lies in offering a framework for measurement and appraisal based on present human values and political motivations. Technology Assessment is crucial for decision-making and policymaking groups. Assessment studies are prepared by the scientific community and the Science Policy Research Division. President Richard Nixon established the National Goals Research Staff in 1969 to provide expert analysis for the policymaking process. The National Goals Research Staff, established by President Nixon in 1969, consists of a small, highly technical staff specializing in data collection, correlation, and forecasting social trends. This staff plays a crucial role in assessing the long-term consequences of present social trends and projecting future developments to inform decision-making processes. The National Goals Research Staff, established by President Nixon in 1969, focuses on measuring future impacts of actions, estimating attainable goals, developing social indicators, and integrating research findings. They were tasked with producing a report on national goals for the U.S. Bicentennial, resulting in the release of the report Towards Balanced Growth: Quantity with Quality in July 1970. The organization's report, Towards Balanced Growth: Quantity with Quality, discusses technology assessment, advocating for systematic evaluation of social costs and benefits of new and existing technology. Key questions include restrictions on technology use due to side effects, regulatory mechanisms, and the impact on economic growth and technological establishments. Technology assessment involves systematic planning to analyze options and costs, considering economic, environmental, and social factors. The establishment of the Office of Technology Assessment was influenced by reports from the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Public Administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The National Academy of Sciences emphasized the importance of considering the consequences of technological advancements in the context of public policy. The concept of technology assessment involves exploring and evaluating the consequences of technological developments with a focus on improving the quality of these efforts. It varies in meaning for different individuals based on their interests and perspectives, with some emphasizing the evaluation of technical changes for environmental preservation and enhancement. Technology assessment involves evaluating technical changes for their impact on environmental goals and resources, monitoring social change, and guiding technological development with foresight and planning. Technology assessment involves projecting the growth and impacts of specific technologies, identifying uses of technologies from federally supported research, and transferring technology to solve social problems. It is also a component of planning-programming-budgeting for better program and policy evaluation. The National Academy of Engineering's report emphasizes the need for precise definitions of program objectives related to national goals, unbiased criteria for assessing program performance, and the potential benefits of technology assessment for legislators. The report highlights the utility of technology assessment methodologies and the importance of task forces in analyzing the impacts of technology on society. It suggests that task forces can propose national strategies for regulating technology, aiding legislators in making informed decisions. The National Academy of Public Administration's report emphasizes the need for a broader perspective in technology assessments, beyond just technical and economic effects. It calls for evaluating the impacts of new technologies, including those supported or regulated by the Federal Government. Most current assessments are deemed incomplete and superficial, focusing only on narrow first-order consequences within the assessing agency's scope of interest. The House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development requested a report on technology assessment from the Legislative Reference Service in 1971. The report emphasized the need to study the consequences of technological systems to improve the management of society and minimize unintended consequences. Assessment includes forecasting, retroactive evaluation, and current monitoring. Technology assessment involves measurements of non-economic values and tangible quantifications, aiming to foresee and prevent catastrophic consequences of new technologies before they become entrenched in society. It is a systematic and rational response to the challenges posed by rapidly changing technology in our industrialized and urbanized society. Technology assessment is a systematic and rational response to the challenges posed by rapidly changing technology, aiming to foresee and prevent catastrophic consequences of new technologies before they become entrenched in society. It involves early warning signals, visions of opportunity, and protecting man from technological creativity. OTA was established in 1972 by Congress to allocate scientific resources, set technological priorities, and control emerging technologies for maximizing public benefits and minimizing risks. The importance of anticipating and understanding the consequences of technological applications for informing public policy is emphasized. Congress is urged to gather unbiased information on the effects of technology and use it in legislative decision-making. In 1973, the Congressional Research Service prepared a glossary on science policy in response to a request from the House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development. The Committee on Science and Astronautics published a glossary defining technology assessment as a process to provide comprehensive information on the consequences of technology use for effective social management. The Office of Technology Assessment aimed to provide early indication of technology benefits and adverse impacts. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) aims to identify impacts of technology, ascertain cause and effect relationships, and present analysis to legislative bodies. In 1975, the American Bar Association's Section of Science and Technology discussed \"Technology Assessment\u00e2\u0080\u0094Legal and Policy Implications\" at their annual meeting. Technology assessment involves identifying secondary effects of technological developments on social, political, economic, and environmental values. May highlighted that most assessments are problem-initiated rather than technology-initiated, emphasizing the importance of lawyers as problem solvers in this process. Assessments aim to influence executive decisions in corporations. Technology assessments aim to influence executive decisions in corporations and legislative decisionmakers, with very little focus on influencing judicial decision-making. Concerns have been raised about technology assessments potentially stifling innovation and technological commercialization. Alan Porter highlighted the ambiguity of the term \"technology assessment\" and the need to track its usage. The late 1960s saw the emergence of technology assessment in the USA, sparking debates on its role in policy analysis and societal management of technology. Critics feared it would hinder free enterprise, labeling it as 'technology arrestment.' Some argued that market forces should guide technology instead of formal assessment processes. The late 1960s saw the emergence of technology assessment in the USA, sparking debates on its role in policy analysis and societal management of technology. Critics argued that technology assessment was conceptually impossible and that market forces should guide and control technology instead. The late 1960s saw the emergence of technology assessment in the USA, sparking debates on its role in policy analysis and societal management of technology. Critics argued that technology assessment was conceptually impossible and that market forces should guide and control technology instead. Even with good foresight, determining the effects of technology is complex and impossible due to the interconnected nature of the world and human societies. Social institutions, particularly the market, have historically guided technology development in socially desirable ways without the need for official assessment bodies. The late 1960s marked the beginning of technology assessment in the USA, sparking debates on its role in policy analysis and societal management of technology. Critics argued that market forces should guide technology instead of official assessment bodies. In 2019, reports and proposals highlighted the need for a bolstered technology assessment capability in Congress due to factors like rapid technological change, globalization of R&D, and the role of science and technology in the economy and national security. The rapid pace of technological change has important implications for congressional policy decisions, including development, application, and addressing potential adverse effects. Public and private investments in R&D are fueling the growth of various technologies such as magnetic data storage, DNA sequencing, and data transmission. The number of transistors on a microchip has been growing exponentially since 2001. Since 1971, rapid growth in data can be traced back to the invention of the integrated circuit. Figure B-2 shows a similar trend in the number of human genome base pairs sequenced per dollar. Countries and companies are aggressively pursuing R&D for innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and national security. Total global expenditures on research and development have increased rapidly since OTA was defunded in 2017, reaching $1.9 trillion. Expenditures on research and development (GERD) have grown rapidly, reaching $1.9 trillion in 2017, more than 3.9 times its level in 1996. Global R&D investments have increased over 150% in real purchasing power between 1996 and 2017, leading to the development of new technologies and products. These advancements have the potential to disrupt markets, industries, and economic power balances. Utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have also increased over the years. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has seen rapid growth in patent issuance, reaching its 10 millionth patent in 2018. However, not all experts agree that technological change is accelerating, citing slower adoption rates for new technologies like IoT devices. Globalization of Research and Development has seen a shift in R&D investments, with the United States' share decreasing while countries like China have significantly increased their investments. China's R&D funding grew by over 3,000% between 1996 and 2016, making it the world's second largest funder of R&D. In comparison, the U.S. saw a 158% growth in R&D during the same period. The adoption and deployment of new technologies by nations worldwide may impact the United States economically, socially, and militarily. This could create new markets for American products but also limit U.S. control over military technologies and reduce its influence in setting ethical standards. The U.S. may also risk losing its technology leadership and economic strength. Science and technology play a crucial role in the strength of the U.S. economy, contributing to economic growth, job creation, and national security. Advances in S&T have led to improvements in manufacturing technologies, energy extraction, and alternative energy sources like solar and wind. Additionally, S&T have been instrumental in enhancing military strength and national security through the development of weapons systems. The role of science and technology in U.S. national security and military strength is crucial, with advancements in weapons systems from World War II to the Cold War and beyond. Future defense capabilities are expected to rely on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and hypersonics. Technology innovation has become increasingly multidisciplinary, with promising fields at the intersection of various technologies. The intersection of various powerful technologies, such as artificial intelligence and autonomy, high-speed computing, big data, biotechnology, sensors, and the internet, can lead to new technologies with societal implications. Science and technology also contribute to public policy in areas like biomedical R&D for new drugs and treatments. Advances in science and technology across various fields can have wide-ranging implications for federal programs and public policy objectives. This includes contributions to human longevity, healthiness, and quality of life, as well as meeting food and nutrition needs, improving transportation safety and environmental impacts, reducing energy costs and environmental impacts, and enhancing weather and climate understanding to minimize loss of lives and property damage. Advances in science and technology can have significant impacts on federal programs and public policy objectives, such as improving human health, transportation safety, and economic growth. These advancements can also pose complex societal, ethical, and legal challenges for legislators to address. The House passed the Modernization Resolution (H.Res. 756) on March 10, 2020, providing $6.0 million in initial funding to reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment. The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2020 (H.R. 2779) aims to address rapid technological developments like cryptocurrencies, autonomous vehicles, gene editing, and artificial intelligence. The re-opened OTA will help Congress understand and address these issues. The re-opened Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) will provide accurate information on technological developments and policy options. Legislation has been introduced to rename OTA as the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. The Congressional Office of Technology (OTA) will be amended to provide information expeditiously and effectively to Congress, including completed analyses and preliminary findings. The office will also offer briefings, technical assistance on science and technology legislation, and maintain a forward-looking approach to technology impacts. The Congressional Office of Technology (OTA) will be amended to provide information quickly and effectively to Congress, including completed analyses and policy options. The office may initiate assessment activities at the request of any Member of Congress and coordinate with CRS and GAO to avoid duplication. The Congressional Office of Technology (OTA) will be amended to coordinate with CRS and GAO, avoid duplication, change appointment authority, hold annual meetings for Members of Congress, and provide annual reports. H.R. 4426 and S. 2509 were referred to committees for further action. In September 2018, H.Rept. 115-929 directed CRS and GAO to provide science and technology policy support to Congress. Congress also directed CRS to assess the need for a separate entity to provide nonpartisan advice on science and technology issues. In H.Rept. 115-929, Congress expressed interest in GAO expanding its technology assessment capacity by reorganizing its technology and science function. Congress directed GAO to provide a plan for creating a new office to enhance scientific and technological assessments. Representative Mark Takano introduced an amendment to provide $2.5 million to reinstitute OTA in the 115th Congress. The amendment to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) with $2.5 million was not agreed to. Representative Bill Foster introduced a resolution to reestablish OTA, emphasizing the need for nonpartisan technical advice to Congress. The resolution to restore funding for the Office of Technology Assessment, which provides nonpartisan technical advice to Congress, was referred to the House Committee on Administration. Previous efforts in Congress to reestablish OTA through legislation or expressing support have not resulted in further action. The House Committee on Administration considered a resolution to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment, providing nonpartisan technical advice to Congress. The resolution was not approved by the House in a vote of 179-223. Representative Bill Foster introduced the resolution in the 114th Congress with 14 cosponsors. Previous efforts to restore funding for OTA have not progressed further. In the 113th Congress, Representative Rush Holt introduced an amendment to reinstitute the Office of Technology Assessment with $2.5 million in funding, but it was not agreed to. Similar efforts in the 112th Congress also failed. Senator Chuck Hagel introduced S. 1602 in the 110th Congress for energy reform. Senator Chuck Hagel introduced the Clean, Reliable, Efficient, and Secure Energy Act of 2007, which included provisions to rename the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 as the Office of Technology Assessment Reestablishment Act of 2007 and allocate $25 million per year for OTA from FY2008 through FY2013. In a separate effort, Representative Rush Holt introduced H.R. 125 in the 108th Congress to reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment with $20 million per year for FY2004 through FY2009, but no further action was taken on either bill. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 2148 was introduced to reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment with $20 million per year for FY2002 through FY2007. No further action was taken on the bill. The curr_chunk discusses various technology assessments related to different fields such as drug development, irrigated agriculture, critical infrastructure protection, artificial intelligence, chemical innovation, medical devices, and the Internet of Things. The curr_chunk provides a list of technology assessments conducted by GAO on topics such as freshwater scarcity, water use in the energy sector, nuclear reactors, neutron detectors, climate engineering, explosives detection, and wildland fire protection. The GAO conducted technology assessments on topics like freshwater scarcity, water use in the energy sector, nuclear reactors, neutron detectors, climate engineering, explosives detection, and wildland fire protection."
