    "content": "The Act titled \"Eightmile Wild and Scenic River Act\" designates the Eightmile River in Connecticut as a Wild and Scenic River. Congress finds that the Eightmile River in Connecticut, designated as a Wild and Scenic River, contains outstanding resource values such as cultural landscapes, water quality, unique species, and watershed ecosystems. The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee determined that the river's outstanding resource values depend on the integrity of its watershed. They took a watershed approach in studying and recommending management options for the river segments and the entire watershed. The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee prepared the Eightmile River Management Plan to protect the river's values and manage its resources. They recommended including the river in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Residents of adjacent towns were involved in the process. The residents of towns near the Eightmile River, including Salem, East Haddam, and Lyme, Connecticut, endorsed the Eightmile River Watershed Management Plan and sought designation of the river as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The General Assembly of Connecticut also passed Public Act 05-18 to support the Management Plan and seek the river's designation. The Eightmile River in Connecticut is designated as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Management Plan was prepared by the Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee with assistance from the National Park Service. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Eightmile River in Connecticut is designated as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Secretary of the Interior will administer approximately 25.3 miles of the river, divided into three scenic segments. The Eightmile River in Connecticut is part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Secretary of the Interior will manage various segments of the river, including Beaver Brook and Falls Brook, as scenic rivers. Management will be in accordance with a Management Plan and any amendments deemed consistent with the section. The Secretary will coordinate management responsibilities with the Eightmile River Coordinating Committee and may enter into cooperative agreements with the State of Connecticut and local towns for the Eightmile River. The Eightmile River shall not be part of the National Park System and is not subject to its laws. Zoning ordinances for the river are to be consistent with the Management Plan and may include assistance from the United States. Zoning ordinances of Salem, East Haddam, and Lyme, Connecticut, as of December 8, 2005, satisfy standards under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Secretary can acquire land for managing the Eightmile River through donation or with owner consent, following the Management Plan criteria. The Management Plan recognizes the tributaries of the Eightmile River watershed as integral to its protection and enhancement. The covered tributaries include Beaver Brook, Big Brook, Burnhams Brook, Cedar Pond Brook, Cranberry Meadow Brook, Early Brook, Falls Brook, Fraser Brook, Harris Brook, Hedge Brook Lake, and Hayward Brook. The Eightmile River watershed management plan includes various tributaries such as Harris Brook, Hedge Brook Lake, Malt House Brook, Muddy Brook, Ransom Brook, Rattlesnake Ledge Brook, Shingle Mill Brook, Strongs Brook, Tisdale Brook, Witch Meadow Brook, and other perennial streams.
