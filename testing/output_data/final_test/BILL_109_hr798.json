    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to methamphetamine. The Congress finds that methamphetamine use and production are increasing rapidly in the United States, leading to environmental issues in areas where methamphetamine labs have been shut down. There is a lack of standardized measures for determining successful remediation of former methamphetamine labs, with initial cleanup efforts focusing on removing hazardous substances. Residences where methamphetamine was manufactured often have significant contamination levels. Methamphetamine labs lack cleanup knowledge and standards, with limited data on contaminants. States struggle with guidelines for closing labs. SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES. The Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the EPA, in consultation with NIST, will establish voluntary guidelines for remediating former methamphetamine labs within a year of this Act. Considerations include federal, state, and local laws, types, and locations of labs. The Assistant Administrator will establish voluntary guidelines for remediating former methamphetamine labs in consultation with NIST. The guidelines will assist State and local governments in implementing legislation and policies based on research findings. The guidelines will be periodically updated to incorporate new knowledge. The research program will be established to provide guidelines for remediating former methamphetamine labs in consultation with NIST, assisting State and local governments in implementing legislation and policies based on research findings. The guidelines will be periodically updated to incorporate new knowledge. The Assistant Administrator will establish a research program to support the development and revision of voluntary guidelines for methamphetamine laboratory cleanup. The research will identify chemicals of concern, assess exposure levels, address biological effects, evaluate cleanup techniques, and prioritize research efforts in consultation with States and interested parties. SEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CONFERENCE. The Assistant Administrator is required to convene a conference every three years with State agencies and stakeholders involved in research on former methamphetamine laboratories. The conference serves as a platform to share guidelines and research findings, as well as to discuss the problems and needs of States and localities. A report summarizing the conference proceedings must be submitted to Congress within three months after each conference. The Assistant Administrator convenes a conference every three years with State agencies and stakeholders involved in research on former methamphetamine laboratories. A report summarizing the conference proceedings, recommendations, and concerns raised by non-Federal participants will be submitted to Congress and made widely available to the public. SEC. 6. RESIDUAL EFFECTS STUDY. The Assistant Administrator will arrange a study with the National Academy of Sciences to research the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories, focusing on impacts on residents and first responders. A report on how the study results will be used must be submitted to Congress within 3 months of completion. The Assistant Administrator will use the study results to carry out activities described in sections 3 and 4. SEC. 7. METHAMPHETAMINE DETECTION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Director of National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with the Assistant Administrator, shall support a research program to develop new methamphetamine detection technologies, with emphasis on field test kits and site detection, and appropriate standard reference materials and validation procedures for methamphetamine detection testing. SEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to add to or limit the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $3,000,000 authorized for Environmental Protection Agency and $1,500,000 for National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 2006-2009."
