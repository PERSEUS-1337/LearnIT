This report outlines high-threat chemical agents, their availability, treatment, detection, and policy approaches to mitigate the threat. While the probability of terrorist use of chemical agents is low, the potential consequences are high. There is debate on terrorist interest in chemical acquisition, but the US remains vulnerable to chemical attacks. Current policy focuses on reducing overall chemical vulnerability without specific agent targeting. Coordination between military and civilian chemical agent detection is lacking. High-threat chemical agents pose exceptional danger to humans, with varying detection capabilities and treatment options. Limited practical experience in treating chemical casualties exists, especially among civilian healthcare providers. National efforts to reduce vulnerability to terrorist chemical agent use are ongoing, but it is unclear if specific high-threat agents are adequately addressed. Coordination between civilian toxic industrial chemical kits and military chemical weapons detectors is lacking. Different chemical weapons cause various symptoms and injuries, making treatment challenging until the specific chemical is identified. Protective equipment must match the type of chemical encountered, such as nerve, blister, choking, or blood agents. Military planners categorize these chemicals based on the effects they have on exposed individuals. Nerve agents are manmade compounds that affect the nervous system and are primarily used as chemical weapons by militaries. They belong to a group of chemicals called organophosphates and were first developed in Germany in the 1930s. These agents are mainly liquids and have high toxicity and purity. The G-series and V-series nerve agents, including Sarin and VX, were developed for military use. Nerve agents were not used in World War I or II but were reportedly used by Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Commercially available equipment could potentially be used by terrorist groups to synthesize these agents. Nerve agents like VX are extremely toxic and difficult to manufacture, requiring specialized equipment. They can enter the body through the lungs or skin, causing muscle overstimulation, nausea, weakness, convulsions, and even death. VX is the most deadly, while Tabun is the least deadly among nerve agents. Nerve agents can cause muscle control issues, nervous system irregularities, and potentially death if not treated promptly. Atropine and pralidoxime chloride are antidotes used to counteract nerve agent effects, with diazepam (Valium) also used to reduce convulsions. Treatment effectiveness depends on the specific nerve agent and the timing of administration. Blister agents, also known as vesicants, cause painful blistering of the skin, requiring full body protection. Mustard agents are the most common blister agents, oily liquids with a faint odor of mustard or onion. Militarily, blister agents reduce combat effectiveness by necessitating bulky protective gear. Blister agents, like mustard agents, range in color from pale yellow to dark brown and have a faint odor of mustard, onion, or garlic. They were first developed in the late 1800s and were used in World War I, causing the greatest number of chemical casualties. Many countries have stockpiled blister agents, and the United States is currently destroying its stockpile. Production of blister agents is considered less complicated than nerve agents, requiring toxic chemicals and specialized equipment. Blister agents can enter the body through the lungs or by contact with the skin or eyes, causing burns and delayed symptoms. Exposure results in reddening of the skin, pain, swelling, blisters, and lesions. Damage occurs quickly, and even low concentrations can cause harm. Exposure to blister agents can lead to skin swelling, blisters, and lesions. Systemic symptoms like malaise, vomiting, and fever may also occur. Large amounts of liquid mustard agent can be fatal. Eyes are sensitive to blister agents, causing pain, corneal damage, and scarring. Inhaling blister agents can damage the lungs, ranging from mild bronchitis to lung blistering. Permanent lung damage may result from high concentrations or repeated exposures. Choking agents, such as chlorine and phosgene, can cause difficulty in breathing and permanent lung damage. These gases have distinct odors and may color the air. Special precautions are needed to prevent opportunistic infections after exposure to mustard agent. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary for severe lung damage. Choking agents, like chlorine and phosgene, are gases with strong odors that can color the air. They are used for both civilian and military purposes, with known production methods that require specialized equipment. These agents were extensively used in World War I, causing inhalation injuries with mild skin effects. Exposure to low concentrations can lead to chest discomfort and respiratory irritation. Exposure to choking agents can cause chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and lung swelling leading to respiratory failure. Symptoms may not appear until physical exertion exacerbates lung damage. Treatment involves rest, oxygen therapy, and corticosteroids for fluid accumulation in the lungs. Hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts are blood agents that interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level. Hydrogen cyanide, a volatile gas with an almond smell, was used in chemical warfare and as the active agent in Zyklon B, the gas used in German concentration camps during World War II. Hydrogen cyanide is used as an active agent in chemical warfare and industrial applications. Blood agents like hydrogen cyanide impair cellular oxygen use, especially affecting the central nervous system, leading to symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea, and potentially convulsions and death. Blood agents like hydrogen cyanide can cause convulsions, coma, gasping for breath, and cardiac failure. Treatment involves specific antidotes to remove cyanide from the body. Prompt treatment can lead to recovery from otherwise-fatal doses. Protection against chemical agents is mainly achieved through physical means to limit exposure. Protections against chemical agents include gas masks and protective clothing to limit exposure to the eyes, lungs, and skin. Gas mask filters with activated charcoal are effective against inhaled chemicals but may not fully protect against skin contact agents like VX or mustard gas. Gas mask filters have a limited lifetime based on the amount of activated charcoal remaining. Protective garments are necessary for chemical weapons that cause effects upon skin contact. Protective garments, such as hazardous materials suits made of rubber with activated charcoal, provide full protection against most chemical exposures. Medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons is limited, with no vaccines available. Pre-exposure use of pyridostigmine bromide can offer some protection against the nerve agent Soman. Pre-exposure use of pyridostigmine bromide can provide protection against nerve agent Soman by preventing permanent binding of nerve agents in the nervous system. It is recommended only in high imminent threat situations due to noticeable side effects. Additionally, a chemical-resistant skin cream called SERPACWA has been developed to protect against chemical weapons that cause harm through skin contact. Decontamination methods involve washing the eyes and skin with water to remove chemicals from victims. Decontamination, essential for protection against chemical exposure, involves washing eyes and skin with water and bleach solution. It prevents secondary exposure and contamination of treatment facilities. Treatment follows decontamination, with specific antidotes or symptomatic treatment. Chemical weapons detection is a concern for military planners. The concern for military planners is the detection of chemical agents, which requires specialized equipment. The Department of Defense utilizes various technologies for detection, including personal sensors and field-adapted laboratory methods. Research is ongoing for the development of a portable instrument that can quickly detect all chemical agents. Detection serves purposes such as providing warning of a chemical attack and identifying the chemicals involved. Detection of chemical agents is crucial for military planners. Various technologies like personal sensors and field-adapted laboratory methods are used for detection. Techniques like detection paper, tickets, and tubes are employed to detect chemical agents in the environment. Detection serves to provide warning of a chemical attack and identify the chemicals involved. Various techniques like detection paper, tickets, and tubes are used to draw air samples through the tube, which discolors in the presence of an agent. Handheld detectors like the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) can detect mustard agents and nerve agents. Automatic sampling devices like the Automatic Chemical Agent Detector/Alarm (ACADA) provide constant atmospheric sampling using ion mobility spectroscopy. These devices are commercially available for hazardous material response. The President has requested FY2004 funding for the Department of Homeland Security for research on standards for first responder detection equipment. The National Institute of Justice has provided guidelines to assess various types of detectors for first responders. The Metropolitan Medical Response System supplements first responders with additional chemical detection, treatment, and decontamination equipment in ninety-seven metropolitan areas. The public health system can help detect chemical terrorism events through the sudden arrival of casualties in local hospitals, improving information sharing and monitoring for symptoms. The Laboratory Response Network links diagnostic laboratories for identifying chemical agents and disease outbreaks. Chemical agents can be difficult for terrorist groups to use as weapons of mass destruction due to the large amounts required. However, they can be effective as weapons of terror in enclosed spaces. Aum Shinrikyo used Sarin in a 1995 Tokyo subway attack, killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. The Aum Shinrikyo cult carried out attacks using G-series nerve agents, causing fatalities and injuries. Blister agents, though less lethal, can cause mass terror and injury. Choking agents are no longer effective due to protective gear. The industrial availability of choking agents like chlorine poses a potential threat for acquisition and use in large volumes. Blood agents face similar challenges in being used as weapons of mass destruction due to quick dispersal. Terrorist groups are increasingly interested in blood agents like sodium cyanide, possibly due to criminal use. Ramzi Yousef planned to use sodium cyanide in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Aum Shinrikyo also attempted an attack with sodium cyanide in Tokyo. In 2002, Italian police arrested four Moroccan men with potassium ferrocyanide, suspected of planning to poison the water supply. The al Qaeda group has plans for chemical weapons, including hydrogen cyanide, as stated by Osama bin Laden. Ahmed Ressam, involved in a plot to bomb Los Angeles airport, received training in hydrogen cyanide use in Afghanistan. Ahmed Ressam, involved in a plot to bomb Los Angeles airport, received training in the use of hydrogen cyanide in Afghanistan at an al Qaeda training camp. The training included production methods, effectiveness demonstrations on dogs, and introducing the agent into building ventilation systems. Treaties and multinational agreements aim to control the international proliferation of chemical weapons by increasing technical barriers and restricting precursor chemicals. The Chemical Weapons Convention and other multilateral controls regulate the export of precursor chemicals used in developing chemical weapons. The US implements export controls through regulations like Export Administration Regulations and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Additional monitoring mechanisms include voluntary governmental programs and industrial best practices. The Department of Treasury's \"Operation Shield America\" program involves Customs agents visiting U.S. firms to educate them on export controls and report any suspicious customer inquiries. Industries like chemical and pharmaceutical are implementing best practices to prevent misuse of dual-use equipment, with increased security measures in place. The American Chemistry Council requires members to follow its Responsible Care Security Code, which includes prioritizing facilities, assessing security procedures, addressing risks, and conducting audits. The extent of security preparedness at chemical facilities is unknown, and voluntary efforts only reach a fraction of facilities. Federal agencies involved in research on chemical weapons countermeasures include the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. Research areas include biomedical research and increasing detector sensitivity. The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate will fund research and development activities against chemical terrorism, with a budget request of $65 million for Chemical/High Explosives Countermeasures and $25 million for a Standards Program. This includes developing better technologies for chemical detection, forensics, and defense systems. Defensive research into chemical weapons also focuses on enhancing medical treatments for victims and understanding chemical weapon action mechanisms. Research on chemical weapons is conducted by various agencies including the Department of Defense and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The focus is on improving detector sensitivity through programs in different government departments. The Department of Defense is working on developing the next generation of chemical agent detectors. Research on chemical weapons includes the development and testing of sensitive detection systems like the Joint Chemical Agent Detector and the portable ChemLab system. Computer programs are used to model chemical releases for determining contamination extent and evacuation needs. Federal response teams are available for deployment in case of chemical terrorism incidents. The DOD's Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) is a rapid response team equipped with decontamination and treatment facilities for chemical or biological terror attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also has a Hazardous Materials Response Unit to analyze and identify chemicals in crimes involving chemical weapons. The U.S. Army Technical Escort Unit conducts chemical detection, decontamination, and remediation of chemical devices worldwide. They provide support during national emergencies and are now located within the Department of Homeland Security. The National Guard also supports Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams to determine the nature of threats. Civil Support Teams were established to assist in determining the nature and extent of attacks or incidents, able to deploy within four hours of an alert. Policymakers may need to address the danger of terrorist acquisition of high-threat chemical agents, including availability, detectors, first responder capabilities, treatments, and funding allocation. Availability of chemical agents varies, with some easily accessible for purchase from suppliers due to legitimate civilian uses. Dual-use chemical agents, with legitimate civilian uses, are available for purchase or theft in large quantities due to little oversight. Regulatory mechanisms to increase barriers to illicit acquisition, such as mandatory verification for domestic purchases, could reduce the threat but may burden manufacturers and distributors with increased costs. However, increasing acquisition barriers would not address the threat of theft or intentional damage during transport, posing a risk for terror attacks. Some advocate for stricter regulations on the transport and storage of chemical agents to prevent theft or terror attacks. Suggestions include limiting transport to less populated areas, reducing stockpiles, and increasing security measures. Questions arise regarding acceptable thresholds for stored or transported chemicals, with proposals potentially leading to significant economic costs. The size of allowed transfer or storage of chemicals may have significant economic costs, with additional security measures increasing expenses. Legislation in the 108th Congress aims to address these issues. Chemical weapons in the United States are tightly controlled in military facilities, but some precursor chemicals can be purchased domestically with increased verification. Manufacturing methods for chemical weapons are varied. Legislation in the 108th Congress aims to address issues related to manufacturing chemical weapons. Policymakers may need to increase research efforts in developing reliable chemical agent detectors to assist hazardous materials first responders. The current generation of Chemical Agent Monitors is not capable of detecting chemical weapons at acceptable exposure levels, complicating safety assessments. Developing sensitive detectors poses the risk of incorrectly identifying harmless chemicals as chemical agents. Chemical weapon detectors in civilian society are being questioned for their effectiveness. Currently used on a case-by-case basis, they aim to assess hazardous releases and contamination levels. Real-time detection systems have been installed in public transit in Washington, DC to prevent potential chemical attacks. A prototype system for detecting potential chemical attacks in public transit in Washington, DC may be expanded to provide greater coverage or installed in other transit systems. The effectiveness and testing of the current prototype system are not publicly available. The Environmental Protection Agency has a nationwide system for monitoring air quality. A prototype system for detecting biological agents has been added to selected detectors to identify covert biological weapon release. A similar system for detecting covert chemical weapon release may be of interest to policymakers. The system needs to be sensitive, provide timely data, and cover a significant outdoor area. Samples are taken back to a laboratory and tested for biological material, which is effective due to the multi-day incubation period for infection. Chemical weapons cause immediate effects, requiring a detector system to respond immediately in a \"detect-to-warn\" system. The development and maintenance of a chemical detection system may be costly, with challenges in detecting small releases and determining monitor locations. Standardizing first responder equipment is a topic of interest for Congress. Some first responder teams feel prepared for potential chemical attacks, while others lack necessary equipment. The National Institute of Justice has provided criteria for assessing chemical equipment, but some responders feel the federal government lacks oversight. Advocates argue for community choice in equipment selection based on varying needs. The Department of Homeland Security's Standards Program will develop criteria for first responder detection equipment. The adequacy of current first responder equipment, guidance from the federal government to state and local authorities, and the need for oversight or legislation to equip first responders are key topics. State public health laboratories lack funding and planning for testing environmental samples, hindering their ability to respond effectively. The Chemical Terrorism Project has recommendations to improve public health laboratories' response capabilities. The federal government may need to ensure validated testing methods for diagnostic laboratories and provide support for testing equipment in state laboratories to enhance their response to chemical terrorism. Limited private sector research on medications against chemical weapons highlights the need for federal sponsorship to accelerate advancements in this area. The government should commit to purchasing fixed quantities of successful new treatments to boost private-sector funding for research. Some argue that investing in unproven treatments may not yield the best results, while others suggest improving the public health system instead. The use of federal response teams to enhance local capabilities has received mixed responses, with concerns about redundancy and the structure of regional teams. The structure of establishing regional response teams has been questioned due to potential delays in response time. Some suggest having parallel civilian and military teams for quicker assistance. Various reports address issues such as weapons of mass destruction, terrorist motivations, first responder initiatives, food safety, and emergency management funding. The curr_chunk provides information on various reports related to emergency management funding, chemical plant security, export administration act reauthorization, chemical weapons convention, and proliferation control regimes."
