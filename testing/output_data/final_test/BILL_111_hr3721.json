    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 was intended to eliminate age-based workplace discrimination, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 recognized the difficulty in detecting discrimination, and laws are interpreted consistently with judicial interpretations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), has narrowed the scope of protection intended by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, eliminating protection for many individuals Congress intended to protect. The Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. has significantly narrowed the protections of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Victims of age discrimination may find it difficult to prove their claims without Congressional action. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that the standard for proving unlawful disparate treatment is consistent with other anti-discrimination laws. The standard of proof for age discrimination claims has been significantly narrowed by the Supreme Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. Congressional action may be necessary to help victims prove their claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Section 4 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 is amended to include a provision stating that a plaintiff can establish an unlawful employment practice by showing that age discrimination was a motivating factor, even if other factors were involved. If a defendant proves they would have taken the same action regardless of age discrimination, the court will consider this in the case. The court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees directly related to a claim under paragraph (1), but cannot award damages or require specific actions. Plaintiffs can use any admissible evidence to demonstrate a violation and can rely on various methods of proof, including the McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green framework. The plaintiff can seek relief under various laws prohibiting discrimination or retaliation, including the Act, Federal employment discrimination laws, whistleblower laws, and constitutional provisions. This does not apply to claims under laws with explicit provisions. In any proceeding for a claim described in paragraph (5), the plaintiff is not required to plead the existence of this subsection. The term 'demonstrates' in this subsection means meeting the burdens of production and persuasion. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. This Act applies to claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act pending on or after June 17, 2009."
