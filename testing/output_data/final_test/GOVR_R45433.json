    "content": "Domestic food assistance programs, including SNAP, child nutrition programs, and WIC, make up a significant portion of the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act. Discretionary and mandatory spending are treated differently in the federal budget process, with discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts and mandatory spending controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. Appropriations acts provide funding to match the parameters required by the mandatory programs' authorizing laws, typically reauthorized in farm bills and child nutrition legislation. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act includes domestic food assistance programs like SNAP, child nutrition programs, and WIC. Funding for these programs is largely mandatory and varies with program participation. The enacted FY2018 appropriation for domestic food assistance is nearly $105 billion, a decrease from FY2017. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act includes funding for domestic food assistance programs like SNAP, child nutrition programs, and WIC. The enacted FY2018 appropriation for domestic food assistance is nearly $105 billion, a decrease of approximately $3.2 billion from FY2017, mainly due to declining participation in SNAP. Over 95% of the FY2018 appropriations are for mandatory spending. Table 1 compares funding levels for domestic food assistance programs in FY2018 to prior years and includes additional funding, rescissions, and policy changes. The President's FY2018 budget request includes forecasts for programs like SNAP and child nutrition programs to assist in determining funding levels. The FY2018 budget request included eight legislative proposals for SNAP, aiming to restrict eligibility and change benefit calculation. It also suggested states share SNAP costs and retailers pay a fee to accept benefits, with estimated spending reductions over the budget window. None of these policies were enacted in the FY2018 appropriation. The FY2018 appropriation did not provide funding for the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, which had received consistent discretionary funding in the past. The Under Secretary's office received approximately $0.8 million in funding, similar to the previous year. The appropriation also requires coordination of FNS research efforts with USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area, including a research and evaluation plan submitted to Congress. Additionally, the appropriation prohibits state EBT contractors from charging fees for switching USDA benefit transactions. The provision prohibits state EBT contractors from charging switching fees for USDA benefit transactions, reducing costs for retailers and entities routing transactions. Appropriations under the Food and Nutrition Act support SNAP, nutrition assistance block grants, and food commodities expenses. The enacted appropriation provides approximately $74.0 billion for programs under the Food and Nutrition Act, which is $3.2 billion less than FY2017 appropriations due to a forecasted reduction in SNAP participation. It also includes $3 billion for the SNAP contingency reserve fund and nearly $290 million for TEFAP commodities, which is less funding than the previous year. The FY2018 appropriation for SNAP programs decreased by $26.5 million compared to FY2017. SNAP-authorized retailers must adhere to inventory requirements, as outlined in the 2014 farm bill. The final rule for the farm bill changes includes defining staple foods, clarifying limitations on hot food sales, and increasing stocking units. Section 728 of the enacted appropriation mandates USDA to expand the definition of \"variety\" and maintain previous stocking requirements. USDA-FNS has implemented increased stocking units while awaiting regulatory amendments. Child nutrition account appropriations fund programs like NSLP, SBP, CACFP, and SFSP. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provides approximately $24.3 billion for child nutrition programs, including support for programs like NSLP, SBP, CACFP, and SFSP. This reflects a $1.5 billion increase from FY2017, with funding from various sources such as state-federal reviews, education initiatives, and technical assistance. The enacted FY2018 appropriation includes a transfer of over $8.9 billion from the Section 32 account for child nutrition discretionary grants. This funding includes $30 million for School Meals Equipment Grants and $28 million for Summer EBT Demonstration Projects, a $5 million increase from FY2017. Child nutrition programs and WIC were up for reauthorization in 2016, but it was not completed. The FY2018 appropriation extended funding for various programs, including mandatory funding for an Information Clearinghouse and food safety audits. It also allocated $5 million for Farm to School Grants and $2 million for School Personnel Training. The FY2018 appropriation included $2 million for School Personnel Training, focusing on school food service meal preparation and workforce development. Additionally, a policy provision was enacted to prevent processed poultry from China from being included in various school meal programs. The appropriated funds must not be used in a way that violates federal statutes and regulations prohibiting discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. This includes rules against physically segregating these children, identifying them with special tokens, making them work for food, or providing different types of food. Additionally, for the 2018-2019 school year, changes were made to federal policy on the pricing of paid meals. The policy required schools to annually review revenue from paid lunches and determine if prices needed to be increased to prevent federal funding for F/RP meals from subsidizing full-price meals. For the 2018-2019 school year, only schools with a negative balance in their food service account as of January 31, 2018, were subject to potential price increases. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provides $6.175 billion for WIC, $175 million less than FY2017, and rescinds available carryover funds from past years. The enacted FY2018 appropriation for WIC is $175 million less than FY2017, with set-asides for breastfeeding peer counselors, infrastructure, and a contingency fund. $800 million in prior-year WIC funds were rescinded, with the agreement fully funding estimated WIC participation in fiscal year 2018. The Commodity Assistance Program budget account for fiscal year 2018 supports various programs including CSFP, TEFAP, WIC FMNP, and Pacific Island assistance. The enacted appropriation is over $322 million, with increases for CSFP and TEFAP administrative costs. The law allows conversion of TEFAP mandatory commodity funding for administrative costs. WIC FMNP funding remains at FY2017 levels despite the President's budget request for no funding. The enacted appropriation for the Commodity Assistance Program budget account for fiscal year 2018 is over $322 million, with increases for CSFP and TEFAP administrative costs. The President's budget requested no funding for WIC FMNP, but funding remains at FY2017 levels. The budget account for federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs received nearly $154 million, a decrease of approximately $17 million from FY2017. The law sets aside $2 million for fellowship programs administered by the Congressional Hunger Center. In FY2018, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) for selected elementary schools received higher funding due to the absence of delays in appropriations laws. The program is financed with permanent, mandatory funding from outside the child nutrition account. Funding for FFVP in FY2018 is higher than previous years due to no delays in appropriations laws. The Food Service Management Institute receives $5 million annually, and the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets nearly $21 million per year outside the regular appropriations process."
