    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"California Trail Interpretive Center Act\" and includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that the nineteenth century westward movement over the California National Historic Trail was a significant event in the development of the western United States, involving over 300,000 settlers and preventing colonization by Russia and the British Empire. Additional recognition and interpretation of this movement is deemed appropriate.
