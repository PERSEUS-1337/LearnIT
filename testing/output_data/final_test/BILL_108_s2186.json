Combination loans allow small businesses to combine a guaranteed loan with a non-guaranteed loan from a lender not backed by government entities. Combination loans for small businesses can be made by different lenders, including those in the Preferred Lenders Program. The nonguaranteed loan can have a senior lien, while the guaranteed loan can have a subordinated lien. A loan guarantee must be approved within 120 days of obtaining a nonguaranteed loan for the same small business concern. The lender must pay a one-time fee of 0.5 percent of the nonguaranteed loan amount if it has a senior credit position to the guaranteed portion. This fee is in addition to other lender fees and cannot be charged to the borrower. Loan size limits apply, especially for loans processed under the Preferred Lenders Program. The maximum amount for a nonguaranteed loan under the Preferred Lenders Program is $1,000,000 or a combination of $2,000,000 with a guaranteed loan. If the loan is processed and approved by Administration staff, the nonguaranteed loan amount cannot exceed $2,000,000 or a combination of $2,000,000 with a guaranteed loan. The Small Business Act is amended to allow for a gross loan amount of a guaranteed loan by the Administration and an additional nonguaranteed loan of $2,000,000. Proceeds from fees collected will offset the cost of guaranteeing loans. Lenders participating in the program may retain certain fees, with exceptions. The Small Business Act allows for loans up to $2,000,000, with fees collected used to offset loan guarantee costs. Lenders can retain up to 25% of fees collected temporarily until September 30, 2004. (c) Temporary Modification of Annual Lender Fee.--Section 7(a)(23) of the Small Business Act is amended to increase the fee from 0.25 percent to 0.35 percent. Proceeds from this fee will be used to offset the Administration's loan guarantee costs. Additionally, loan restrictions are lifted to prioritize processing of previously rejected applications due to program shutdown. The program shutdown or restrictions imposed by policy notices 5000-902, 0000-1707, or 0000-1709 may result in loans being cancelled, returned, or not considered. Small businesses or lenders can resubmit applications, with priority given to those submitted before January 8, 2004. Efforts will be made to approve all eligible loans that were affected by the shutdown or restrictions. The program shutdown or restrictions may result in loans being cancelled or returned. Priority will be given to processing eligible loans for small businesses that previously received financing under section 7(a)(14) of the Small Business Act. Applications can be resubmitted, and efforts will be made to approve all eligible loans affected by the shutdown or restrictions. Proof of application for Small Business Administration loans before January 8, 2004, can be submitted by mail, fax, or electronic means. Proceeds from fees under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act will be used to fund loan guarantees. The Small Business Administration must notify key congressional committees at least 15 days before making significant changes to the loan program authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act.

SEC. 5. RESUBMISSION OF DISASTER LOAN APPLICATIONS FOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES. During the 30-day period after the enactment of this Act, small businesses in specific New York counties may resubmit loan applications if they were originally submitted before January 1, 2003, in response to a disaster declaration and the business was unable to operate. The applicant may qualify for a loan if their facility was unable to operate for 20 or more consecutive days due to government orders related to a disaster declaration. The loan can be approved without meeting certain requirements if the applicant has a debt coverage ratio of at least 1.15 for the last taxable year. The Administrator will not consider any tax lien or obligation other than a judgment lien when calculating the debt coverage ratio. Loans must be at least 80% of documented losses. Loans under this section will not affect other loan limits in the Small Business Act."
