    "content": "In late May and early June 2008, severe storms caused flooding in midwestern states along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, raising concerns about flood risks and the nation's flood policies. Despite improvements in emergency response and mitigation programs, flood risk continues to rise due to increased investments in flood-prone areas. Riverine and coastal flooding pose serious threats to the population and economy, with hurricanes and storms being the main causes in eastern states and the Gulf Coast. Coastal counties, home to half of the country's population and jobs, are particularly vulnerable. Increasing flood hazards are putting existing developments at risk, with new development occurring in flood-prone areas. National flood damages have nearly doubled in the past decade, with total disaster assistance increasing significantly. Congress and federal agencies have taken steps to address flood challenges, but climate, population, and investment trends continue to increase the threat and vulnerability. Since 1993, Congress has shifted federal programs to support a wider range of activities for hazard mitigation in response to increasing flood threats. This includes nonstructural measures like moving flood-prone structures and developing evacuation plans. Traditional structural approaches such as levees and floodwalls still dominate national flood damage reduction efforts. Congress has also enacted legislation to address flood issues since 2005. The report highlights the need for a comprehensive flood policy and management strategy in response to recent flood events. It emphasizes the necessity of local government action, regulation of floodplain use, changes to federal programs, and increased investment in flood damage reduction. Implementing improved floodplain management may face opposition from those benefiting from the current system and those against land use regulation. Congressional action beyond incremental policy changes is likely required. The report discusses recent flood events, the federal role in flood policy, limitations of levees and dams, lessons from the 2008 Midwest flood, and the evolution of U.S. flood policy. It raises questions about changing roles and responsibilities between federal, state, and local governments, increasing federal leadership on floodplain management, and enhancing coordination of federal flood-related actions since Hurricane Katrina. Congress has conducted hearings on these issues. Since Hurricane Katrina, Congress has focused on federal flood programs and policies, with recent legislation aimed at improving levee planning and safety. Limited comprehensive changes have been made, with most legislation addressing individual programs or agencies. Two recent developments include the National Committee on Levee Safety's draft recommendations for a national levee safety program and a report on the Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan study. The report discusses the costs and benefits of increasing flood damage reduction along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Responsibilities for managing flood risk in the US are shared between local, state, and federal governments. Local governments make land use decisions affecting floodplains, while state and federal governments also influence flood risk management. Levees are built by local and state entities to prevent flooding, with the federal government also involved in construction. The federal government partners with local sponsors to construct levees and dams to prevent flooding. They also support hazard mitigation, offer flood insurance, and provide emergency response and disaster aid. Federal flood programs include construction investments, hazard mitigation assistance, insurance, and disaster preparedness. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the principal agency involved in levee construction and repair. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior, are involved in flood-related activities. FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers require levee inspection and certification for participation in flood programs. Crop insurance is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Discussions on insurance and disaster assistance are covered in other CRS reports. The CRS reports cover various topics related to disaster assistance, flood insurance requirements, FEMA funding for flood map modernization, hurricanes, crop insurance, and agricultural disaster assistance. Hazard mitigation and flood risk management are also discussed in some reports. FEMA, USDA, and other federal agencies are involved in flood-related activities, including levee inspection and certification for participation in flood programs. The CRS reports discuss issues raised by the 2008 Midwest flood, including the belief that government will provide economic assistance despite lack of insurance. Flooding can be caused by hurricanes, severe weather, and rapid snowmelt, impacting agricultural markets. Floods are important for healthy riverine, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems. Flooding can have devastating effects on human life and the economy, as seen in events like Hurricane Katrina. Levees and dams play a crucial role in managing flood risk, but inadequate maintenance and urban drainage can lead to failures. With over 100,000 miles of levees in the nation, only a fraction receive regular inspections, posing a significant risk. Land use choices, such as tile drains in agricultural areas and impervious surfaces in urban developments, can exacerbate flooding by increasing runoff and flood crests. Land use choices can impact flood levels, leading to more frequent overtopping of levees. The Corps now refers to levee projects as \"flood damage reduction\" measures, acknowledging their limitations. Levees are designed to provide protection up to a certain level, but can fail when faced with a flood exceeding that design. Dams are also designed to spill floodwaters when their capacity is exceeded. The Midwest levees and dams largely functioned as designed during floods in 1993 and 2008, reducing river crests and preventing widespread damage. However, the debate continues about the potential negative impact of levees on floodplains. In contrast, floodwalls in New Orleans failed during Hurricane Katrina, leading to catastrophic damage. The failure of floodwalls in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina led to catastrophic damage. Residual risk remains even after flood damage reduction structures are built, as levees and dams can still be overwhelmed by severe floods. Overconfidence in structural flood protection increases the nation's risk in terms of lives lost, economic disruption, and property damage. Flood risk always remains due to the inability of infrastructure to protect against all flooding. Flooding is crucial for understanding flood risk and prioritizing risk reduction investments. Decision-makers must choose protection levels for urban areas, infrastructure, and rural areas, balancing limited funds across various projects. Intense precipitation in 2008 caused severe flooding in the Midwest, surpassing 100-year and 500-year flood levels in eastern Iowa. Levees were overtopped, leading to localized but extreme damage. Record flood levels were exceeded in eastern Iowa, overtopping levees and flooding previously assumed safe areas. The Cedar, Des Moines, and Iowa Rivers were most affected, setting record river stages at 47 gage stations. Levees in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids were breached, with new record crests surpassing 1993 levels. Floodwaters from tributaries entered the Mississippi River, setting records at various locations in Illinois and Iowa. The 1993 flood disaster was caused by a stationary weather pattern, resulting in extensive flooding across multiple states in the Midwest. The flood lasted for four months, affecting the mainstems of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as other rivers in the region. Approximately 600 river forecast points were above flood stage simultaneously. In contrast, the 2008 flooding was shorter and concentrated in specific areas along the Mississippi River tributaries. The 1993 flood along Mississippi River tributaries and nearby segments differed from the 2008 flood in extent, magnitude, and duration. It caused 48 deaths, $30.2 billion in damages, and affected 150 rivers and tributaries, inundating 15 million acres of farmland. Most economic losses were agricultural, mainly due to wet fields and a short growing season. The 1993 flood caused significant economic losses due to wet fields and a short growing season. Many mainstem levees withstood the floodwaters, preventing additional flooding and damages. Transportation impacts were severe, with barge traffic on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers stopped for nearly 2 months and bridges out or inaccessible in various areas. The 2008 flood in Missouri caused major transportation disruptions, including closures of highways and airports. Infrastructure like sewage and water treatment plants were damaged. The flood resulted in $15.0 billion in damages and 24 deaths. Unlike the 1993 flood, the damage in 2008 was mainly from inundation along rivers, not in upland areas. While hundreds of levees were breached in 1993, only dozens were breached in 2008. In 2008, levees breached on the Mississippi mainstem were primarily lower agricultural levees. While some overtopped, they held back floodwaters until they exceeded the expected protection level. Overtopped levees in agricultural areas provided 5- to 25-year protection, but those protecting larger communities like Cedar Rapids resulted in concentrated damage. The 2008 damage estimates were half of 1993 flood damages, with regional damages at $15 billion compared to $30 billion in 1993, failing to capture the challenges of recovery in severely affected communities. The social and economic consequences of severe flood damage in 2008 were extreme, with major impacts on agriculture. Anticipated crop losses led to record high prices for corn and soybeans, but ideal growing conditions later resulted in substantial crop recovery and lower market prices. Recovery in severely damaged communities often takes years. The Midwest experienced substantial crop recovery and lower market prices after floodwaters caused disruptions. Some communities are now less at risk of floods due to buyouts, relocation, and floodproofing of vulnerable properties. Flood risk reduction efforts since 1993 paid off in 2008, but the aggregate flood risk in the Mississippi River basin appears to be increasing. The 1993 flood prompted Congress to enact policy changes, increasing federal disaster assistance for acquiring, relocating, or elevating flood-prone properties. FEMA conducted extensive buyouts, moving over 300 homes and demolishing nearly 12,000 properties. The acquired lands were converted to flood-friendly uses like parks and wildlife habitat. State and federal agencies also acquired over 250,000 acres of flood-prone land, mainly farmland. Significant redevelopment and new development has occurred in Midwest floodplains since 1993, with an increase in population and commercial/industrial development. New development in floodplains must now meet floodplain development regulations to be more flood resilient. The risk of flooding in Midwest communities has changed since 1993, with a decrease in risk from the 100-year flood but an increase in risk from more intense floods. Development in the 500-year floodplain has substantially increased risk. Limited river gauging information has hindered emergency flood response activities. The National Weather Service and others faced challenges in developing accurate river stage forecasts due to discrepancies in reported data and data gaps caused by floodwaters sweeping away river gauges. A Rainfall-River Forecast Summit highlighted the need for better coordination, communication, and collaboration to improve forecast reliability and lead time for emergency response preparations. During the 2008 flood, 41 levees overtopped, with only six constructed by the Corps. Another 19 were built by local entities meeting participation requirements for the Corps' program, while 16 were not eligible for federal assistance. Repairing levees post-2008 floods showed improvements since 1993, but ongoing issues remain. The 2008 floods highlighted improvements since 1993 in repairing levees, but ongoing issues persist. Choices about repairing damaged levees and federal assistance availability can complicate reducing flood risk. Coordination for levee repair in 2008 showed improvement over 1993, with the Corps leading a regional Interagency Levee Task Force. This task force, based on a 1997 guidance memo, offers opportunities for alternative flood risk management methods. The 2008 Midwest Interagency Levee Task Force was established to improve flood and floodplain management policy after the 1993 floods. It aims to implement a collaborative regional approach for long-term restoration of damaged floodplain management systems, considering both rebuilding levees and long-term mitigation and recovery. Since 2005, interest in increasing levee protection has grown due to identified deficiencies in inspection programs. The RIP program focuses on repairing levees, not increasing protection. To enhance protection, a separate Corps flood damage reduction study is needed. The levee has been identified as deficient since 2005, and if not addressed, it may not be eligible for federal repair assistance in case of flood damage. Local entities are responsible for making necessary improvements for certification. NFIP policy changes have led to higher risk designations in some areas, requiring stricter requirements. The dams and levees in the Upper Mississippi River System were constructed separately, without a basin flood damage reduction plan. The existing facilities in the Upper Mississippi River System have varying structural integrity and provide different levels of flood risk reduction. Changes in land use and flood management practices in upstream areas can affect flood risk downstream. Responsibilities for flood programs in the basin are distributed among local, state, and federal entities, with no broad planning authority guiding water resource management. The Upper Mississippi basin's water resource management has been guided by the termination of the UMRBC in 1981. The UMRBC prepared a master plan for the river system, but its termination complicated implementation. The UMRBA, founded in 1981, serves as a policy research and coordination forum for basin states, with no federal government involvement. The Mississippi River Commission has authority for river improvements from the delta. The River Commission oversees river improvements from the Mississippi River's delta to the headwaters, providing engineering direction and policy advice. While it lacks funded authority for upper Mississippi River projects, there has been some interest in flood damage reduction following the 1993 flooding. Numerous reports have recommended changes to flood management, with the most notable being the July 1994 report, Sharing the. In July 1994, the Galloway report outlined recommendations for floodplain management in the Midwest, particularly for the Upper Mississippi River. Legislation introduced in August 1994 aimed to implement these recommendations, including the development of comprehensive river basin management plans and federal-state coordinating committees for the region. The Galloway report in 1994 recommended floodplain management for the Upper Mississippi River. Legislation proposed federal-state committees for basin plans, but it was not enacted. The Water Resources Development Act of 1999 authorized the Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan to address water resource issues in the region. The Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan (UMRCP) focused on the mainstem Mississippi River and Illinois River floodplain, excluding the Missouri River and smaller tributaries. The final report was submitted to Congress in June 2008, with no recommendation for additional authority at that time. The Comprehensive Plan is not recommended at this time based on the evaluation of alternative plans. The Corps' preferred alternative would provide 500-year protection at a cost of $4.42 billion. The Assistant Secretary of the Army did not recommend proceeding with implementation, suggesting intermediate steps instead. The Mississippi River Commission supported implementing the preferred alternative for flood protection of critical transportation infrastructure. Congress must decide how to proceed with differing recommendations from various stakeholders. The UMRCP final report analyzed by various stakeholders and the Army highlighted the need for nonstructural measures to manage flood hazards. Recommendations from the Galloway report, such as enacting a national Floodplain Management Act, have not been fully implemented despite Congress taking actions post-1993 flood. The curr_chunk discusses establishing a national model for floodplain management, reactivating the Water Resources Council, reestablishing a river basin commission, issuing a new Executive Order for floodplain management, limiting public grant assistance to non-participating communities, providing loans for infrastructure upgrades, and reducing vulnerability to damages from the standard project flood. These actions align with recommendations from the Galloway report. The Galloway report recommends increasing the waiting period for flood insurance policies and calls for a reorientation in national flood policy to address economic, social, and environmental welfare tradeoffs of floodplain development. Despite recommendations, a fundamental reorientation has not occurred, but incremental changes have been made to improve flood programs at all levels of government. Despite incremental improvements in flood programs at all levels of government, the nation's flood risk is increasing due to factors like development in floodplains and coastal areas, a growing population, and lack of full implementation and enforcement of flood damage reduction measures. Some federal actions indirectly reduce flood risk, such as supporting conservation efforts on agricultural lands and wetlands protection. The federal government's approach to flood management has been reactive and fragmented, with limited regional-scale planning and evaluations. Previous institutional arrangements for coordinated federal flood efforts have diminished over the years. The federal government's approach to flood management has been reactive and fragmented, with limited regional-scale planning and evaluations. In the late 1990s, institutions that supported local capacity building stopped convening, leading to decreased federal support. Flood policy remains disjointed, focusing on separate flood damage reduction investments, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and federal disaster aid. Current arrangements inadvertently discourage efforts to reduce flood risks, contrary to recommendations for a more coordinated approach to reduce flooding costs and improve public safety. Congress established the NFIP in 1968 to manage flood damage costs and provide an alternative to disaster assistance. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to manage flood damage costs and provide insurance to property owners in flood-prone areas. Homeowners in 100-year flood-prone areas are required to buy flood insurance if using a federally backed mortgage. The NFIP provides insurance to over 5 million homeowners, renters, and business owners in participating communities. The 1994 National Flood Insurance Reform Act aimed to improve compliance with NFIP regulations after the 1993 flood revealed many homeowners did not have flood insurance. The 1994 legislation aimed to improve compliance with NFIP's mandatory flood insurance requirement and pressure lenders to ensure at-risk owners in flood zones purchase insurance. It created the Increased Cost of Compliance program to assist owners of damaged properties, the Flood Mitigation Assistance program funded by a surcharge on flood insurance policies, and emphasized floodplain mapping. Additionally, it codified the Community Rating System into the NFIP to reduce communities' flood insurance premiums. After the 1993 floods, FEMA was authorized to use federal disaster assistance to cover 75% of costs for acquiring, relocating, or elevating homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Efforts have been made to improve the NFIP, increase participation, manage repetitive loss properties, and reorganize federal emergency response post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Concerns persist about the growing risks of floods due to more people and investments in flood-prone areas. Katrina's impact on New Orleans raised concerns about the NFIP subsidization and financial foundation. GAO studies have reviewed NFIP aspects with some recommendations implemented. An independent review group evaluated the NFIP in 2006, suggesting changes not enacted. FEMA's flood mapping program under NFIP helps establish zoning, building standards, and supports emergency planning. In January 2009, the National Research Council released a report calling for investments to improve the accuracy of NFIP flood maps. Current maps have uncertainties and do not reflect current floodplain conditions. Despite previous investments, only 21% of the continental U.S. population has flood maps meeting FEMA's data quality standards. FEMA and partners collected new flood data from 2003 to 2008, costing over $1 billion. Future flood maps need updating to reflect changes in flood threats and land use. NFIP maps do not consider future conditions like sea level rise. Flood damage in the US is due to climate and societal factors. Society can reduce flood risk with changes in responses to weather and climate extremes. The challenge of increasing losses due to weather and climate extremes is exacerbated by development in flood and hurricane prone areas. Coastal storms pose greater flood risks than river flooding, leading to more development in high-risk areas. NFIP claims show coastal storms as the top contributors to damage, emphasizing the need for better risk management strategies. The 2008 Midwest flood ranks twelfth in NFIP events, with Hurricane Katrina highlighting the vulnerability of coastal developments to storm surge and flooding. Coastal states face increasing NFIP outlays and disaster losses, with severe storms causing historical damage to communities and infrastructure. The federal government's role in coastal hurricane storm protection has grown since the mid-1960s, with structures and beach renourishment efforts aimed at reducing flooding. Congress has enacted laws to protect coastal resources and reduce flood risk, including the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982. These laws aim to improve federal actions supporting coastal resource protection and prohibit federal spending on additional development in designated coastal barriers. Despite these efforts, coastal populations are increasing, leading to more NFIP claims and federal disaster aid to coastal states. Significant coastal flood risk remains despite federal laws to protect coastal resources. Congressional debate has increased on managing flood and infrastructure risks, determining acceptable risk levels, and cost-sharing for risk reduction. Challenges include protecting urban populations, safeguarding economic infrastructure, investing in natural buffers, and ensuring equity for low-income and minority groups. Congress faces the challenge of incentivizing flood risk reduction without infringing on property rights or local decision-making. Tackling flood risk requires adjustments in flood insurance program, disaster aid policies, and structural/nonstructural measures. Congress has addressed federal flood programs since Hurricane Katrina, focusing on individual programs rather than comprehensive policy reorientation. Legislative efforts include bills like Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act, but comprehensive reform has not been enacted. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 enacted provisions related to Corps flood projects and programs, but other federal program changes have been minimal. Section 2032 calls for a report on flood risk and program effectiveness, but its preparation is delayed due to lack of appropriations. Section 2031 requires feasibility studies to assess flood damage reduction projects' risks and benefits. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 includes provisions for Corps flood projects, with Section 2031 requiring feasibility studies to assess risks and benefits. It also calls for updating water resources planning guidance to reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 includes provisions for Corps flood projects, with Section 2031 requiring feasibility studies to assess risks and benefits. It also calls for updating water resources planning guidance to reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment. The planning update and implementation of this policy statement may alter flood damage reduction and other water resources planning by federal agencies. Hurricane Katrina highlighted issues with levee and floodwall reliability, with floodwall failures contributing to half of the flood damages in New Orleans. Section 9004 of WRDA 2007 mandated the Corps to establish a national levee database and inspect federally owned and constructed levees. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 mandated the Corps to inspect federally owned and constructed levees, as well as establish a national levee database. Additionally, it created a National Committee on Levee Safety to recommend a national levee safety program to Congress. Nonfederal levees built by private individuals or entities are not regulated by a federal program. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 mandated the Corps to inspect federally owned and constructed levees, as well as establish a national levee database. This provision aligns with agency planning guidance and influences federal and local levee investments. Recommendations by the National Committee on Levee Safety may impact flood risk management efforts. Various tools can be combined to lower risk, but some risk will always remain. Implementing changes post-disaster can improve programs, but a comprehensive strategy for floodplain management would require significant changes at all levels of government. The 1986 Unified National Program for Floodplain Management proposed a four-part strategy for balanced floodplain management, aiming to realign government programs to reduce flood risk. Implementing these tools would shift long-term costs from the federal government to local communities and individuals. The 2008 Midwest flood and Hurricane Ike highlighted the need for improved strategies to address future riverine floods and coastal storms. Hurricane Ike's impact on coastal communities and the challenges of recovery are discussed. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires states and communities to have mitigation plans for disaster assistance eligibility. However, these plans often do not lead to actual mitigation actions in community comprehensive plans. There is a lack of catastrophic recovery planning in high-risk communities like Galveston, which could help in vetting preliminary needs and priorities for rebuilding before a disaster occurs. The challenges of extensive recovery efforts can be seen in New Orleans post-2005 and Midwest communities post-2008 disasters. The challenges of extensive recovery efforts post-disasters like the 2008 Midwest flood, Hurricane Ike, and Hurricane Katrina highlight the need to balance community and economic disruption with building resilience. Despite changes in flood policies after the 1993 Midwest flood, issues persist with encouraging floodplain development. Federal, state, and local tensions continue regarding floodplain development and use. Federal legislation enacted since 1993 has improved individual programs and agencies related to flood risk, but overall national flood policies and programs remain largely unchanged. Local-state-federal tensions over roles and responsibilities continue to hinder resolution of water resource issues, slowing recovery in disaster-affected communities. Flood damage reduction projects are still implemented piecemeal, with water and land use decisions rarely coordinated. Congress shapes federal agencies' flood-related actions through authorization, appropriations, and oversight. Tables provide a list of congressional direction to the Corps on flood damage reduction missions and oversight activities. Congressional hearings and GAO reports from 1993 to 2008 highlight the role of oversight in guiding federal flood policies. The Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan (UMRCP) was authorized by WRDA 1999 to assist Congress in improving government performance and accountability. The final report, dated June 2008, was transmitted to Congress in January 2009. The UMRCP was a preliminary study, not at the level of a feasibility study, and the final report did not recommend additional authority for implementation. The UMRCP final report identified a preferred alternative, known as Plan H, for 500-year flood protection along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. This plan would also include ecosystem restoration benefits and protection for urban and agricultural areas. The preferred plan, Plan H, for 500-year flood protection along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers includes 500-year levees for urban areas and towns, and buyouts for agricultural areas where more cost-effective. The total initial cost for Plan H would be $4.42 billion, with $3.97 billion for flood damage reduction construction and $460 million for ecosystem restoration. Opportunities for ecosystem restoration actions would be available if buyouts of districts are implemented. None of the alternatives studied would meet the current economic test for federal participation due to national benefits not exceeding costs. The UMRCP alternatives analyzed had costs ranging from $3 billion to $9 billion with benefit-cost ratios between 0.03 to 0.07 for national economic development benefits. A national benefit-cost ratio greater than 1.0 is typically used for Corps projects, excluding ecosystem restoration projects, to gauge economic attractiveness. Congress is faced with deciding on differing recommendations, with the Assistant Secretary of the Army stating that specific plan implementation based on reconnaissance level detail is premature. The Assistant Secretary recommended intermediate steps for the UMRCP, including expanding to include Mississippi River tributaries, conducting cost-shared studies for flood damage infrastructure, and studying flood protection for critical transportation infrastructure. The Mississippi River Commission supported implementing the preferred alternative, Plan M, at a cost of $6.88 billion for 500-year protection. Governor of Illinois and Governor of Missouri wrote letters of support for Plan M. Plan M, costing $6.88 billion, would provide 500-year flood protection without agricultural district buyouts and with increased floodwaters below St. Louis. It offers fewer ecosystem restoration opportunities compared to Plan H. The authorized flood study did not fully integrate navigation, flood, and ecosystem management as recommended in the 1994 Galloway report. The Corps studied navigation and ecosystem restoration separately from the flood plan due to the large study area. The Corps conducted a watershed analysis on the Mississippi and Illinois River floodplain, covering 4,000 square miles, excluding the Missouri River and smaller tributaries. The level of detail in the flood plan was compared to a reconnaissance study, lacking the necessary detail for congressional decision-making. The analysis included benefits like increased development opportunities behind levees, but nonstructural alternatives and enhanced floodplains were not given equal consideration. The final report of the UMRCP will be scrutinized for its lack of consideration for future changes in land use, population, and climate in the hydrology and hydraulics analysis. The report also excludes areas severely affected in 2008. Debate may arise on whether Plan H's proposal to raise agricultural levees contrasts with the vision of the future floodplain described in the Galloway report. In highly protected communities, flood-prone areas would be transformed into river-focused parks and recreation areas as residents move to safer, higher ground. New construction in safe areas would be required to be elevated, while those at risk in low-lying areas would be relocated over time. Industries would protect their facilities from floods, and critical infrastructure would be elevated to avoid flood damage. In highly protected communities, flood-prone areas would be transformed into river-focused parks and recreation areas as residents move to safer, higher ground. New construction in safe areas would be required to be elevated, while industries would protect their facilities from floods. Critical infrastructure, such as power plants, major highways, and bridges, would be elevated or protected against flood damage. Homes, businesses, and agricultural activities behind lower levees would be insured against flooding. The potential impact of higher mainstem levees on flood risk and floodplain development is a topic of debate. The 2008 flood along Mississippi River tributaries and differing visions for the future of floodplains in the upper Mississippi River basin are central to discussions on reducing flood risk in the Midwest and the UMRCP. The economic analysis for the UMRCP final report shows regional benefits of $27.1 billion for Plan H, with Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri receiving the majority. Plan H could open up 215,775 acres for development, raising concerns about residual flood risk. The UMRCP final report raises concerns about the flood risk reduction benefits of Plan H being offset by residual risk from development behind levees. Limited Federal interest in plan implementation is noted, requiring regional or national oversight for successful operation. Agreement among Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri is necessary for plan acceptance, with potential facilitation by the Corps. The UMRBC final report suggests that states could implement one of the studied alternatives without significant federal leadership or funding, with potential facilitation by the Corps."
