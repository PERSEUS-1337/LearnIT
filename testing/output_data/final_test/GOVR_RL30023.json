    "content": "Pensions for civilian federal employees are provided through two programs, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). Both programs involve contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) to pay pension benefits to retirees and their dependents. FERS benefits are fully funded by employee and employer contributions, while CSRS benefits require supplemental payments from the federal government. The federal government makes supplemental payments into the civil service trust fund for CSRS pensions. Prior to 1984, federal employees did not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 mandated coverage for civilian federal employees hired after January 1, 1984. Congress developed FERS with Social Security as the cornerstone to avoid duplication of benefits and high employee contributions. The FERS, developed with Social Security as the cornerstone, consists of three elements: Social Security, FERS basic retirement annuity, FERS supplement, and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Most federal employees hired after January 1, 1984, are enrolled in the FERS. Retirement plans can be defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans, with DB plans offering a benefit based on salary and years of service, while DC plans, like a 401(k), function as a savings account with contributions from the employer and/or employee. In defined contribution (DC) plans, both the employer and employee contribute to an account invested in assets like stocks and bonds. The employee receives the balance at retirement, which includes contributions, interest, dividends, and gains/losses. The employer bears the financial risk in a defined benefit (DB) plan, promising retirement benefits, while the employee bears the risk in a DC plan. In defined contribution (DC) plans, the employer pre-funds retirement benefits by investing in a trust fund. If the fund's assets are worth less than the accrued benefits, the employer must make up the deficit. In a DC plan, employees bear market, investment, and longevity risks. Private-sector employers are not required to provide retirement plans for their employees, but those that do must comply with ERISA, which sets standards for reporting, disclosure, employee participation, plan funding, and fiduciary standards. Pre-funding of DB pensions is required to protect employees' retirement benefits. Pre-funding of DB pensions through pension trusts and the PBGC protects employees' pension benefits in case of a company going out of business. The PBGC pays pension benefits within set limits and is funded by premiums from employers with defined benefit pensions. Accrual accounting principles are followed by recognizing future pension liabilities as they accrue. When an employer fails to set aside enough money each year to pay retirement benefits accrued by workers, it creates an \"unfunded liability.\" ERISA requires additional contributions until plan assets equal liabilities. CSRS, established in 1920, was not pre-funded, while FERS, established in 1986, required pre-funding of pension benefits. When Congress established FERS in 1986, it required full pre-funding of pension benefits through employer and employee contributions and Treasury bond interest. This promotes efficient resource allocation in federal agency budgets. Unlike private-sector pension funds, the CSRDF is not a store of wealth for the government and is limited to investing in U.S. Treasury bonds. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) invests in U.S. Treasury bonds, representing budget authority for fund disbursement. Redeeming these bonds requires the Treasury to raise cash through taxes or borrowing. Higher returns on private-sector securities could offset future annuity costs, but investing in them would initially increase federal expenditures. The trust fund's income sources include employee and agency contributions. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) receives contributions from employees and agencies. Agency contributions are income to the trust fund but not to the federal government. Most outlays from the trust fund are benefit payments to annuitants. If the CSRDF were to purchase private-sector assets instead of U.S. Treasury bonds, it would require an outlay from the trust fund. This would impact the federal budget deficit if employee contributions were used for this purpose. Purchasing private-sector assets with funds from the Treasury could reduce the budget deficit in the long run by shifting outlays from the future to the present. If the rate of return on private-sector securities is higher than on Treasury bonds, it could generate extra investment income for the trust fund, reducing the need for future tax revenue to pay pension benefits. However, this policy change raises concerns about federal ownership of private-sector assets and could lead to increased volatility in the trust fund's asset value. Employees covered by CSRS and FERS accrue benefits based on years of service, highest three consecutive years of salary, and benefit accrual rate. CSRS employees earn 1.5-2.0% of pay for each year of service, while FERS employees earn 1.0-1.1% of pay. A CSRS employee with 30 years of service earns 56.25% of their highest three consecutive years of pay, while a FERS employee with 30 years earns 30-33%. The CSRDF is funded by federal agencies deferring budget authority to pay pensions to retired workers. Employees contribute mandatory percentages of their pay to the fund, with CSRS employees contributing 7.0% and FERS employees contributing 0.8% before 2013. The fund is credited with special-issue bonds by the Treasury, which can be redeemed to pay pensions to retirees and survivors. Employees under FERS contribute to the CSRDF and Social Security trust fund. Contributions vary based on hire date, with different percentages for those hired before and after 2013. Agency contributions differ between CSRS and FERS, with OPM estimating the cost of CSRS annuities to be 36.6% of employee pay. The Treasury annually contributes to the CSRDF to fund CSRS benefits, with employee and agency contributions totaling 14.0% of pay. The Treasury made a $34.16 billion payment for CSRS in FY2018, but an unfunded liability of $813.1 billion remains. FERS costs are estimated at 16.8% of pay for employees hired before 2013, 17.3% for those hired in 2013, and 17.5% for those hired after 2013. The cost for FERS employees hired before 2013 is 16.0% of payroll, while those hired in 2013 contribute 14.2%. Employees hired after 2013 have a normal cost of 17.5%, with 4.4% contributed by employees and 13.1% by agencies. The increased employee contributions help reduce the CSRS unfunded liability. FERS benefits are fully funded by employer and employee contributions, with the exception of employees hired after December 31, 2013. Employee and agency contributions for these employees exceed the full cost of the benefit until the CSRS unfunded liability is eliminated. The CSRDF is used to pay retirement and disability benefits to federal employees, funded by contributions from employees and agencies, interest earnings, and budget authority. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) is funded by employee and agency contributions, interest earnings, and budget authority. It operates similarly to the Social Security trust fund, investing 100% of its assets in special-issue U.S. Treasury bonds. When needed, the trust fund redeems the bonds to pay retirement benefits to civil service annuitants. Intragovernmental transfers have no impact on the government's annual budget deficit or surplus. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) is funded by employee and agency contributions, interest earnings, and budget authority. It operates similarly to the Social Security trust fund, investing in special-issue U.S. Treasury bonds. The trust fund's balances are ultimately paid for by taxpayers and are not assets of the Government that can be drawn down in the future. When trust fund holdings are redeemed for benefit payments, the Department of the Treasury finances the expenditure using current receipts or borrowing from the public. Trust fund balances do not increase the Government's ability to pay benefits, as they are assets of the program. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) holds a balance of $915.3 billion as of FY2019. Obligations in FY2018 totaled $86.2 billion, mainly for annuity payments. Administrative expenses were $149 million, representing 0.17% of total obligations. An additional $2 million was transferred to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Contributions come from employee deposits and intragovernmental transfers. In FY2018, cash contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) totaled $4.5 billion, with the largest payments coming from federal agencies, the Postal Service, interest payments, and a payment from the Treasury's general fund. Additionally, there was a $38 million payment due to offsets from the re-employment of annuitants. The CSRDF receives Treasury bonds as budget authority and redeems them for annuity payments. Table 2 outlines the fund's income, expenditures, and year-end balance through FY2090. The estimated income to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) is projected to increase from $103.5 billion in FY2017 to $151.0 billion in FY2025 and $759.9 billion in FY2090. Total expenses are expected to rise more slowly, reaching $85.8 billion in FY2018, $104.9 billion in FY2025, and $506.6 billion in FY2090. The assets held by the CSRDF are projected to increase steadily from $947.8 billion in FY2018 to $1.2 trillion in FY2025 and $10.6 trillion in FY2090. The unfunded liability of the CSRDF peaked in FY2017 at $968.1 billion and is projected to steadily decline until it is eliminated by FY2085. Expenditures from the CSRDF in FY2018 totaled $85.8 billion, equivalent to about 40% of the federal government's payroll expenses for employees. By FY2090, CSRDF expenditures are projected to decline relative to government wage and salary expenses. The expenditures of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) are estimated to be around 32% of the government's wage and salary payments by FY2090. Future retirees will receive smaller pension benefits under FERS, leading to a decline in CSRDF outlays after FY2020. Federal expenditures for civil service pensions as a percentage of GDP are expected to remain steady for the next 10 years before declining substantially from FY2020 to FY2090. The annual expenditures of the CSRDF are projected to decrease from 0.47% to 0.13% of GDP by FY2090 due to the shift from CSRS to FERS, resulting in smaller annuities. This transition is mandated by law, leading to a decline in outlays per annuitant relative to GDP. In FY2019, the CSRDF total receipts are estimated at $104.4 billion, with obligations around $88.4 billion. Cash receipts primarily come from federal employee contributions and payments from the District of Columbia. These cash receipts reduce the government's budget deficit, while benefit payments to retirees and survivors are cash outlays of the federal government. The CSRDF receives intragovernmental transfers totaling $124.8 billion in FY2018, which do not impact the U.S. government's budget deficit. Budget authority allows federal agencies to spend money from the Treasury, which collects taxes and disburses cash to the public. There have been suggestions to remove the CSRDF from the budget. The CSRDF has been suggested to be taken \"off budget,\" similar to Social Security benefits, to exclude its income and expenditures from the government's annual budget surplus or deficit calculations. Off-budget accounts are shown separately in budget documents, but still impact the U.S. economy regardless of being on or off-budget. The CSRDF, if taken off-budget, would impact the budget deficit or surplus by changing how revenue and outlays are accounted for. Employee contributions would not be counted as revenue, intragovernmental transfers would be recorded as outlays, and annuitant payments would not appear in the federal budget. If the CSRDF had been off-budget in FY2018, it would have increased the government's reported budget deficit by about $17.6 billion. Financial analysts and economists focus on unified budget totals to evaluate the federal budget's impact on financial markets and the economy. Taking any account off-budget distorts the government's fiscal condition. If the CSRDF were taken off-budget, it could lead to confusion about the real budget deficit or surplus, similar to the situation with Social Security. Actuaries use \"normal cost\" to estimate annual pension funding needs. The normal cost for pension benefits is expressed as a percentage of payroll and can be static or dynamic. Static normal cost is based on current employee pay with no future raises, while dynamic normal cost includes future benefits accruals. FERS retirement annuities must be pre-funded according to dynamic normal cost, with OPM estimating this cost annually for new employees entering the federal workforce. OPM estimates various factors for new employees entering the federal workforce to determine the normal cost of FERS benefits. The current normal cost of FERS ranges from 16.8% to 17.5% of payroll, with federal agencies contributing an amount equal to 16.0% of payroll for FERS employees hired before 2013. The normal cost of FERS benefits for employees hired before 2013 is 16.0% of payroll. For FERS employees hired in 2013, the cost is 14.2% of payroll, while for those hired after 2013, the cost is 17.5% with employee and agency contributions totaling 13.1%. CSRS is funded at 29.3% of payroll and is controversial due to not being funded according to its dynamic normal cost. The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was established in 1920 with a trust fund for benefits, but operated on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. Initially, only employees made contributions, with agency contributions mandated in the 1950s. The fund met obligations from employee contributions until 1956 when agencies were required to contribute under P.L. 84-854. The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) operated on a pay-as-you-go basis initially, with employee contributions. In the 1950s, agencies were mandated to contribute, and in 1969, Congress enacted P.L. 91-93 to establish a formal accounting system for future pension obligations. Congress enacted P.L. 91-93 in 1969 to set the employee contribution to CSRS at 7.0% of pay, with an equal amount required from federal agencies. This total contribution of 14.0% of payroll covers pension liabilities using static assumptions. Contributions have remained the same since 1969, with three annual payments from the U.S. Treasury to amortize any increase in pension liability. The Treasury assumed responsibility for pension liabilities not covered by employee and agency contributions in the CSRS, including costs from pay raises and interest on accrued liabilities. These additional expenses are paid from the general fund. The costs of retiree COLAs and future CSRS benefits not covered by employee contributions will be paid from the general fund of the Treasury. This will create an unfunded liability for FERS, which will be paid off through new amortization payments. The CSRS account is projected to be depleted in 2022, resulting in transfers from the FERS account to create supplemental liabilities. These liabilities must be amortized through 30-year payments by the Treasury. Actuarial estimates show that the unfunded liability of CSRS does not threaten the solvency of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The OPM annual report states that total assets of the CSRDF are expected to grow under existing funding provisions. The current method of funding the CSRS has been a source of debate due to unfunded liabilities accumulating each year. Some argue that these costs should be accounted for in each agency's budget as they accrue, similar to the FERS. Additionally, supplemental payments to the trust fund come from general revenues rather than agency budgets. The current method of funding the CSRS has been a source of debate as it understates the full costs of employment, leading to inefficient resource allocation in the federal government. Critics argue that agencies should fully fund the current and future costs of the CSRS through increased contributions to avoid making labor costs appear lower than they really are. This could be achieved through increased appropriations or additional budget authority. The current debate surrounds the funding of the CSRS, with suggestions to fully fund it by requiring agencies to increase contributions without additional appropriations. This pre-funding method would reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting agency outlays, offsetting future payments to CSRS annuitants. The debate revolves around fully pre-funding future payments to CSRS annuitants, which would require federal agencies to cut spending elsewhere in their budgets. Paying the full normal cost through employee and agency contributions would prevent additional unfunded liabilities but not reduce the previously accumulated liability. Some suggest starting amortization payments sooner to avoid reduced pension benefits or increased employee contributions in the future. Proposals to pre-fund CSRS like FERS have raised questions about additional budget authority for federal agencies or higher contributions from current budgets. Pre-funding CSRS retirement annuities could improve accounting of personnel costs, but with CSRS closed to new enrollment since 1984 and the declining percentage of federal employees enrolled, the budgetary treatment of government contributions is becoming less urgent. Investing the CSRDF in U.S. Treasury bonds may not truly pre-fund CSRS and FERS annuities. Some suggest diversifying trust fund assets into private-sector stocks and bonds for higher returns, despite increased risk. However, this raises concerns about budget scoring and federal trust funds owning private-sector assets."
