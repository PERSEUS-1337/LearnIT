    "content": "The Act aims to repeal the 4.3-cent increase in transportation motor fuels excise tax rates from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which was allocated to the general fund of the Treasury. The Act repeals the 4.3-cent increase in fuel tax rates from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, reducing each applicable tax rate by 4.3 cents per gallon for a specified period. The Act reduces fuel tax rates by 4.3 cents per gallon for a specified period, including exemptions for certain fuels like diesel, gasoline for noncommercial aviation, and compressed natural gas. The amendment reduces fuel tax rates by 4.3 cents per gallon for a specific period, coordinating with highway trust fund deposits. The effective date is upon enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax repeal date, if tax has been imposed on any liquid under section 4081 or 4091 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and on that date the liquid is held by a dealer for sale without being used, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. Claims for credit or refund must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 6 months after the tax repeal date. On the tax repeal date, a dealer can request a refund or credit from the taxpayer for any liquid held, provided the taxpayer repays or agrees to repay the amount claimed. No credit or refund is allowed for liquid in retail stocks. Definitions of \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are as per section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"dealer\" includes a producer, and the \"tax repeal date\" means the 7th day after the enactment of this Act. Rules similar to section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code apply for this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax of 4.3 cents per gallon is imposed on liquids held on January 1, 1997, on which tax was previously imposed. Liability for Tax: Persons holding such liquids are liable for the tax, to be paid by June 30, 1997. Definitions: A liquid is considered \"held by a person\" if title has passed to that person. The tax imposed on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel does not apply if held for exempt uses or in a vehicle tank. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. The tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel does not apply if held in a vehicle tank. No tax is imposed on certain amounts of fuel held by individuals on January 1, 1997, as long as specific gallon limits are not exceeded. For tax purposes, fuel exempt from taxation is not included in calculations. Controlled groups are treated as one entity, following specific guidelines. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those for controlled groups apply to nonincorporated persons under common control. All provisions of law applicable to taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel also apply to floor stock taxes imposed under subsection (a). The floor stock taxes imposed under subsection (a) are subject to the same regulations as taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel. SEC. 5. Benefits of tax repeal should be passed on to consumers. SEC. 5. Benefits of tax repeal should be passed on to consumers. It is the sense of Congress that consumers should immediately receive the benefit of the repeal of the 4.3-cent increase in transportation motor fuels excise tax rates. Producers and dealers must take necessary actions to reduce fuel prices accordingly, including providing immediate credits to customer accounts for tax refunds. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on this matter. The Comptroller General of the United States will study the repeal of the 4.3-cent fuel tax increase to determine if the benefits have been passed on to consumers. A report on the study's results is due by January 31, 1997 to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. SEC. 6. Authorization of appropriations for expenses of administration of the Department of Energy. Amends Section 660 of the Department of Energy Organization Act to authorize appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Department of Energy for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. SEC. 7. Spectrum auctions. The Federal Communications Commission must make additional spectrum available for auction by March 31, 1998, for licenses spanning at least 12.5 megahertz individually and 35 megahertz in total, below 3 gigahertz, and not assigned as of the enactment of the Act. The Federal Communications Commission must make more spectrum available for auction by March 31, 1998, for licenses of at least 12.5 megahertz individually and 35 megahertz in total, below 3 gigahertz, and not previously assigned. The Commission will establish criteria for reassigning frequency bands for competitive bidding. The Federal Communications Commission aims to efficiently use spectrum, consider costs to incumbent licensees, address public safety radio service needs, comply with international agreements on spectrum allocations, and account for costs to satellite service providers from multiple global auctions. Additionally, paragraph (11) of section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 is repealed, granting permanent auction authority. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 21, 1996.
