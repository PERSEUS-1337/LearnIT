    "content": "The EPA's SPCC regulations require facilities to prevent, prepare, and respond to oil discharges. Recent interest from Congress has focused on the regulations' impact on farms storing oil. Proposed legislation aims to exclude farms below specific oil storage volumes from SPCC regulations. The EPA's SPCC regulations, established under the Clean Water Act, require facilities to prevent oil discharges. Recent congressional interest has targeted the impact of these regulations on farms storing oil, with proposed legislation seeking to exempt small farms from SPCC requirements. President Nixon reorganized the executive branch delegations of various presidential authorities in 1970, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) being delegated authority for regulations addressing oil discharges from nontransportation-related onshore and offshore facilities. EPA has jurisdiction over nontransportation-related onshore and offshore facilities as per a 1994 interagency agreement. The Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over vessels, transportation-related onshore facilities, deepwater ports, and transportation-related facilities located landward of the coast line. The Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities and associated pipelines located seaward of the coast line. States have their own oil spill programs, and EPA issued the first SPCC regulations in 1973. EPA proposed changes to the SPCC regulations after the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 led to changes in the SPCC regulations by EPA in 2002, with compliance deadlines extended for farms. Congress later prohibited EPA from enforcing SPCC provisions at farms for 180 days. Despite these changes, owners must still maintain and implement their SPCC plans according to regulations. Facilities must continue implementing their SPCC plans in accordance with regulations since 1974. EPA requirements apply to nontransportation facilities with oil storage capacities above 1,320 gallons or 42,000 gallons. Approximately 640,000 facilities are subject to SPCC rules, with oil and gas production representing the largest percentage. The SPCC regulations apply to a large number of facilities, with oil and gas production being the largest sector. Farms are also heavily impacted, with approximately 152,000 farms subject to SPCC requirements. Most facilities must prepare and implement SPCC plans, with certain high-risk facilities required to submit Facility Response Plans to EPA. SPCC regulations mandate secondary containment for oil-storage units and require certification by a licensed Professional Engineer, unless conditions for self-certification are met. Approximately 95% of farms subject to SPCC requirements can choose to self-certify their plans if they have a clean spill history and store 10,000 gallons or less in aggregate. Approximately 145,000 farms, representing 95% of those subject to SPCC requirements, can self-certify their plans if their oil storage capacity is 10,000 gallons or less. EPA regional offices found that 55% of inspected facilities were non-compliant with SPCC regulations. Enforcement of the program is handled by EPA regional offices as SPCC authority cannot be delegated to states under the CWA. Some Members of Congress have proposed changes to SPCC regulations. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation to alter the scope and applicability of SPCC regulations for farms, including changing the oil storage threshold that triggers compliance. This approach is similar to modifications made to other environmental laws in the past. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation to exempt farms from SPCC requirements based on oil storage capacity, citing financial burdens of compliance. Critics argue that EPA has already considered costs and benefits in rulemaking processes."
