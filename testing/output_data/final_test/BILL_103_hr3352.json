This program aims to provide transitional assistance to workers affected by NAFTA. The \"NAFTA Worker Security Act of 1993\" establishes the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program under the Trade Act of 1974. A group of workers can be certified as eligible for adjustment assistance if a significant number have become separated or are threatened to be separated, and if sales or production have decreased or imports from Mexico or Canada are competitive. The NAFTA Worker Security Act of 1993 establishes the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program under the Trade Act of 1974. Workers can be eligible for adjustment assistance if there is a significant increase in imports from Mexico or Canada that contributed importantly to their separation or threat of separation. The NAFTA Worker Security Act of 1993 establishes the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program under the Trade Act of 1974.

Upon receipt of a petition, the Governor will notify the Secretary and make a preliminary finding within 10 days.
