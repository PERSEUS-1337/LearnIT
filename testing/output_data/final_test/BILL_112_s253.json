FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the centennial of World War I, from 2014 to 2018, marks a significant period in history. The war saw the United States supporting allies for the first time in defense of liberty, leading to American soldiers fighting abroad. Despite being called \"the war to end all wars\", the US would later commit troops to foreign lands three more times in the 20th century. Over 4,000,000 Americans served in uniform during World War I. During World War I, 2 future presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, served in uniform. 2 million Americans served overseas, including 200,000 naval personnel. The US suffered 375,000 casualties, with 116,516 deaths. The events of 1914-1918 had a profound impact on the world and the US. The centennial of WWI allows Americans to learn and honor the sacrifices of their predecessors through commemorative programs and activities. The United States lacks a national memorial for World War I, unlike other major conflicts of the 20th century. In 1921, Kansas City dedicated a site for a memorial attended by military leaders from various countries. In 1924, the cornerstone of the 217-foot Liberty Memorial Tower was laid in Italy. President Calvin Coolidge delivered the keynote address at the Memorial's dedication ceremony in 1926. The Memorial and surrounding grounds were completed in 1938, with an inscription honoring those who served in World War I. The Liberty Memorial is recognized as a national symbol of World War I by the 106th Congress. The museum at the base of the Memorial is designated as \"America's National World War I Museum\" by the 108th Congress. The District of Columbia War Memorial was authorized in 1924 by the 68th Congress. The DC War Memorial, dedicated in 1931 by President Herbert Hoover, honors the 499 residents of the District of Columbia who died in World War I. It is located on the national Mall in Washington, adjacent to other war memorials. Unlike the others, it is not a national memorial. The Act establishes a commission in Kansas City, Missouri to oversee the centennial observance of World War I and rename the Liberty Memorial and DC War Memorial as the \"National World War I Museum and Memorial\" and the \"District of Columbia and National World War I Memorial\" respectively. The Act defines key terms such as \"America's National World War I Museum,\" \"Commission,\" and \"veterans service organization.\" It also establishes the World War I Centennial Commission. The World War I Centennial Commission is established with 24 members appointed by various leaders and the President to represent the people of the United States, including veterans and members of the Armed Forces.
