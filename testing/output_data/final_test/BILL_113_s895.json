    "content": "The \"Antimicrobial Data Collection Act\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes research programs to study antimicrobial resistance. The Act defines the terms \"Commissioner\" and \"Secretary\". The Secretary will develop research programs to study the relationship between animal drugs containing antimicrobial ingredients in food-producing animals and antimicrobial resistance trends. The purpose is to better determine the relationships between sales data and distribution. The Act requires research on the relationships between sales data, distribution data, and end-usage data of animal drugs with antimicrobial ingredients in food-producing animals. It also aims to study the connection between antimicrobial drug use in animals and antimicrobial resistance trends. The Act mandates research on antimicrobial resistance levels in bacteria associated with food-producing animals. The research program must be developed in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and implemented within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Data from the program will be analyzed to study antimicrobial resistance. The Act mandates research on antimicrobial resistance levels in bacteria associated with food-producing animals, contributing to studying antimicrobial resistance and establishing data collection strategy. SEC. 3. REPORTS TO CONGRESS; DEVELOPMENT OF DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress describing the research design and goals for the research program under section 2(b), including a needs assessment on antimicrobial use in food-producing animals to improve evaluation of FDA programs on antimicrobial resistance. The report must be made publicly available. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing the results of research programs developed under section 2(b) and provide recommendations for an antimicrobial data collection strategy based on feedback from the public. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing the results of research programs developed under section 2(b) and provide recommendations for an antimicrobial data collection strategy based on feedback from the public. The report should include any relevant information obtained in the research pilot program and be made publicly available. SEC. 4. ENHANCED REPORTING AND PUBLICATION OF SALES DATA. Section 512(l)(3)(E) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require the Secretary to publicly release summaries of information reported annually, including dosage form information when possible. The Secretary must segregate reported drug amounts into categories of importance to human medicine and not, and further categorize by container size, strength, dosage form, and marketing status. Cross-tabulations of reported amounts with reporting categories must be included. The Secretary must include categories such as 'Not Independently Reported' and 'Not Independently Reported Export' in the reporting. Every 5 years, a reevaluation of classifications must be done with public input. Data quality, accuracy, and detail in publicly available summaries should be maximized, including information on antimicrobial drug type, exposure level, and target animals. An annual evaluation of FDA policies on antimicrobial drug sales effectiveness and compliance is required. The Food and Drug Administration will provide annual summary reports on antimicrobial drug sales for food-producing animals and antimicrobial resistance. The Secretary will reissue previous summary reports using a new format within 3 years of enactment. SEC. 5. ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC AND ANIMAL HEALTH. The Secretary must publish final guidance on new animal drugs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This does not affect the FDA's obligations to regulate antimicrobial drugs. Additionally, a report by the GAO is required within 3 years. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the FDA's approaches to reduce antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals and assess the effectiveness of data collection on antimicrobial resistance. A report will be submitted to the Senate and the Committee on Health within 1 year of commencing the study. The Senate and House committees will receive a report describing the results of the study on reducing antimicrobial drug use in food-producing animals and data collection on antimicrobial resistance."
