Congress acknowledges the significant costs and duration of military operations in Afghanistan, with President Obama's plan for troop deployment in 2010 aiming for a transition to Afghan authorities by 2011. The total deficit spending for military operations in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2011 amounts to $436 billion. As of March 15, 2011, over 1,500 US Armed Forces members have died in Afghanistan, with over 10,000 wounded. Suicide rates among veterans are rising, with a backlog of 700,000 disability cases at the VA. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan make up 23% of the US deficit from 2003 to 2010. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz estimates the total costs of the wars, including interest payments. The total costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including interest payments and care for wounded soldiers and veterans, are estimated to be between $4 trillion to $6 trillion. President Obama announced the withdrawal of US Armed Forces from Afghanistan starting in July 2011. SEC. 3. Plan with timeframe and completion date and reports with status updates on transition of United States military and security operations in Afghanistan to the government of Afghanistan. The President must provide Congress with a plan for the accelerated transition of US military operations in Afghanistan within 60 days of this Act. Additionally, status reports on the progress of the transition must be submitted every 90 days thereafter. The report must include details on the transition of military operations in Afghanistan, total number of US Armed Forces deployed, withdrawn, and redeployed, financial costs, and the number of US Armed Forces members. The report must include the number of US Armed Forces members killed or wounded in Afghanistan, military personnel who committed suicide, cost of care for veterans, and the financial impact of continuing military operations in Afghanistan. The report required under subsection (b) must include information on variables that could advance the timetable and increase the rate of redeployment of US Armed Forces from Afghanistan. It should also estimate the savings over different time periods if military operations were concluded and forces redeployed within 180 days."
