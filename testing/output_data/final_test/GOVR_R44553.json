    "content": "Following a disaster, homeowners and businesses affected by a major disaster or emergency can access various resources for response, recovery, and rebuilding. These resources include insurance payouts, state and local government assistance, charitable donations, federal assistance from FEMA, SBA Disaster Loan Program, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. FEMA is the primary agency managing disaster response, with assistance based on the extent of damage incurred. The SBA Disaster Loan Program and HUD's CDBG-DR program provide disaster recovery assistance, with CDBG-DR requiring congressional approval for funding. Funds awarded may exceed replacement costs. The Stafford Act requires federal agencies to prevent duplication of benefits in disaster assistance. Recipients of federal aid may be liable if they receive duplicate benefits from other sources. This report focuses on issues related to duplication of benefits in SBA disaster loans and CDBG-DR grants. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers low-interest loans to businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters for property repair or replacement after a disaster. It also assists small agricultural cooperatives with economic recovery. The program aims to prevent duplication of benefits in federal disaster assistance, highlighting key policy considerations and potential conflicts in implementing federal requirements. Legislative policy options are explored to address issues related to duplication of benefits in SBA Disaster Loan and CDBG-DR disaster recovery assistance. The SBA Disaster Loan Program offers low-interest loans for property repair or replacement after a disaster. It includes three categories of loans: Home and Personal Property Disaster Loans, Business Physical Disaster Loans, and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The HUD's CDBG-DR program provides grants to assist recovery efforts following a disaster, with a focus on low- and moderate-income areas. CDBG-DR grant funds can be used by state and local governments for recovery efforts such as housing, economic development, infrastructure, and prevention of further damage in affected areas. Eligible uses include buying damaged properties, providing relocation payments, debris removal, rehabilitation of homes and buildings, constructing public facilities, homeownership activities, and assisting businesses in disaster areas. These grants are meant to supplement SBA and FEMA assistance and are typically approved by Congress. Congress has authorized over $45 billion for disaster recovery efforts through the CDBG-DR program since 2000, using the statutory framework of the regular CDBG program. Supplemental appropriations may include provisos and requirements to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in fund usage. Policies on duplication of benefits in disaster assistance can be confusing due to multiple governing authorities. The authorities and regulations regarding duplication of benefits in the SBA Disaster Loan Program and CDBG-DR can be confusing. The Stafford Act governs federal disaster assistance and requires that individuals or entities do not receive duplicate assistance for losses. This includes establishing procedures to prevent duplication of benefits and holding recipients liable for repayment. The Stafford Act governs federal disaster assistance and requires individuals to repay duplicated benefits from other sources, including insurance and federal programs. FEMA policy aims to prevent duplication of benefits and outlines a delivery sequence hierarchy to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of program assistance. Section 18(a) of the Small Business Act prohibits duplication of benefits in SBA Disaster Loan assistance. Applicants cannot receive a home disaster loan if their property can be repaired or replaced with insurance or other compensation. Amounts received must be deducted from claimed losses or paid to SBA as loan payments. SBA disaster loans must be repaid to SBA as principal payments. Most loans go to individuals and households. The program offers low-interest loans with up to 30-year maturities. CDBG program can be used for disaster recovery under the Stafford Act. HUD can waive CDBG requirements for disaster areas. Congress may provide supplemental funds for disaster recovery. The CDBG program can be used for disaster recovery under the Stafford Act. Congress may provide supplemental funds for disaster recovery, known as CDBG Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) grants. HUD published a Notice clarifying duplication of benefits requirements for CDBG-DR grantees in response to disasters. The Notice clarifies duplication of benefits requirements for CDBG-DR grantees, providing a suggested framework for evaluation. It prohibits using CDBG-DR funds to pay down SBA loans and suggests reevaluating eligibility for additional assistance if the initial SBA loan is insufficient. The Notice clarifies that CDBG-DR should only be used after exhausting SBA eligibility, supplementing rather than replacing SBA assistance. Congressional concerns include confusion over delivery sequence, interpretation of duplication of benefits policy, fairness, fraud, and rebuilding delays. Duplication of benefits can occur due to timing of disaster assistance, with a focus on overlaps between SBA loans and CDBG-DR. Reviewing issues of using both SBA loans and CDBG-DR for disaster recovery efforts is crucial. Despite quality checks and audits, agencies continue to provide duplicative disaster assistance to ineligible individuals and businesses who applied for CDBG-DR funds to rebuild after a disaster. These recipients later face the burden of repaying improper payments, creating financial and emotional strain. Some argue that the cost of assessing and collecting duplications outweighs the money recouped. The assessment and collection process for disaster assistance can be costly and complex, with issues of coordination, timing, and fraud prevention. Multiple authorities and interpretations can lead to duplication of benefits, exacerbated by incongruous guidelines. States have flexibility in determining eligibility for CDBG-DR, which some argue may lead to inefficiencies. The administration of SBA Disaster Loan Program and CDBG-DR assistance is seen as inequitable, with concerns about eligibility and denial of financial assistance. Homeowners who received SBA disaster loans may have been unfairly penalized, as grants do not require repayment. The uniformity requirement in the Stafford Act is outlined in FEMA regulation 44 C.F.R. 206.191. 44 C.F.R. 206.191 provides procedural guidance to prevent duplication of benefits in disaster assistance delivery sequence. Organizations must follow the order of assistance and avoid duplicating aid provided by higher-ranked agencies. Disruptions in the delivery sequence require the responsible agency to rectify any duplication. The delivery sequence for disaster assistance aims to prevent duplication of benefits. FEMA considers CDBG-DR as \"other governmental assistance\" following SBA disaster loans. The execution of the delivery sequence can be complex and decentralized, involving multiple jurisdictions and agencies. The delivery sequence for disaster assistance can be complex and decentralized, involving multiple jurisdictions, agencies, and organizations. Coordination and monitoring of assistance sources can be challenging, especially when communication is lacking. The sequence is not rigid and can be broken in certain cases to ensure timely receipt of essential assistance. For example, SBA disaster loans may be processed more quickly than grants released to the state for distribution to disaster victims. The goal is to provide immediate assistance and recoup it later. In some cases, the federal government may fail to identify duplication of assistance, leading to surprise notifications for recoupment from disaster victims. This can create a burden if all assistance has been used for recovery needs. The sequence can also be disrupted if lower level entities provide assistance after higher level entities deny it, requiring coordination to prevent duplication of benefits. Congress appropriates supplemental CDBG-DR funds for disaster-affected states and communities at its discretion. Funding is not automatic, leading to inconsistencies in assistance provision for different disasters. It is challenging to predict when Congress will allocate disaster-related CDBG funding. The FEMA Regional Administrator determines responsibility for delivering federal assistance, addressing duplication of benefits. If duplication is found, the duplicating agency must follow its own procedures to correct it. FEMA and the Federal Coordinating Officer work with the agency to resolve the duplication issue. The duplication of benefits between the SBA Disaster Loan Program and CDBG-DR is a key issue of congressional concern due to differing interpretations among federal agencies. Audits have found discrepancies in how the policy is implemented and remediated. The SBA recovered $643.8 million of CDBG-DR funds from Iowa, Louisiana, and Mississippi to pay down disaster loans. The SBA also used $281.8 million of duplicate assistance to pay off loan balances, which was deemed inconsistent with FEMA regulations by the SBA OIG. This action prevented other disaster victims from receiving assistance. According to the SBA OIG, duplicate grant assistance meant for disaster victims could have been used to help those with unmet needs instead of paying down existing loans. SBA disagreed, stating they are required to monitor borrowers' situations and recover loans. The SBA OIG revisited the duplication of benefits issue and found that the SBA's controls to prevent duplication of benefits with CDBG-DR were working as intended. HUD, in collaboration with FEMA, developed agreements and roles in accordance with 44 C.F.R. 206.191. Unlike the SBA, HUD took the lead and issued a Federal Register Notice on November 16, 2011. The SBA OIG found no reportable conditions or recommendations. Some argue that HUD's Notice effectively addresses duplication of benefit regulations, while others believe the controls may not hold up in a large-scale disaster. The controls have not been tested in such a scenario since Hurricane Sandy, leading to concerns about their effectiveness. The Federal Register Notice published by HUD on November 16, 2011 provides guidance on identifying duplication of benefits for CDBG-DR funding. Some argue that it introduces another federal interpretation, suggesting alignment of laws and regulations instead of using a framework to address the issue. The Federal Register Notice published by HUD on November 16, 2011 provides guidance on identifying duplication of benefits for CDBG-DR funding, aligning with Stafford Act guidelines and FEMA/SBA regulations. It aims to clarify requirements for CDBG-DR grants, both past and future, to avoid duplication of benefits. Concerns include the timing of delivery sequence, highlighted after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Homeowners affected by a storm in October 2012 were advised to apply for a low-interest disaster loan from the SBA. However, they later found out that they were ineligible for CDBG-DR grant funds under the NYC Build It Back program due to duplication of benefits regulations. This meant that even if a homeowner was approved for an SBA loan but did not accept it, they would still be ineligible for assistance from the NYC Build It Back program. Affected homeowners who rejected SBA loans faced challenges in receiving assistance from NYC Build it Back. HUD updated its policy to allow more flexibility for homeowners who declined SBA loans, enabling them to receive CDBG-DR funds for repairs. The document allows grantees to award CDBG-DR funds to households and businesses that declined SBA assistance, requiring analysis and documentation of reasons for the decline. Prior to this, grantees had to reduce CDBG-DR assistance by the amount of the homeowner's approved SBA disaster loan. FEMA considers CDBG-DR funding as assistance following SBA loans, but the omission of CDBG-DR in FEMA's regulations could lead to confusion and different interpretations. Congress may need to revise 44 C.F.R. 206.191 to specify the location of CDBG-DR within the delivery sequence to avoid confusion. There is debate over whether individuals who qualify for SBA disaster loans should also be eligible for CDBG-DR grants. Some argue that grant assistance should only be for those who cannot recover on their own. Most federal disaster assistance programs are funded annually to ensure quick availability of funds for assistance. For example, SBA's processing time for home disaster loans averaged 18.7 days in a July 2015 study. The SBA's processing time for home disaster loans averaged 18.7 days, while application processing times for business disaster loans averaged 43.3 days. CDBG disaster assistance is funded through supplemental funding, which is only provided by Congress when disaster needs exceed annual appropriations, typically after major incidents like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Congress has historically passed supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance within an average of 38.9 days, with some instances of funding being provided in less than a week after the disaster declaration. CDBG-DR assistance is not immediately available after appropriation, taking about three months for allocation. Funding for CDBG-DR could be expedited by using annual appropriations to create an account with immediate funds. This would help eliminate gaps and confusion in the delivery sequence of disaster assistance. Using annual appropriations to create an account with immediate funds could help expedite CDBG-DR assistance, similar to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. Critics may argue the need to determine the effectiveness of this approach. Creating a permanent CDBG-DR could allow smaller incidents to receive assistance, potentially increasing federal expenditures. States have discretion in awarding CDBG-DR, sometimes denying it to SBA loan recipients who are deemed able to recover without a grant. Some argue that individuals with resources to repay SBA disaster loans should not get grants, shifting burden to taxpayers. SBA loan recipients see denial of CDBG-DR grants as unfair, questioning why they must repay loans while others get grants. Blame is placed on federal government for grant decisions, though states make them. Congress could require uniform distribution of CDBG-DR assistance to all eligible SBA loan recipients or make them ineligible for grants. One potential method to address duplication of assistance is creating a single database to track aid from various sources. This system could alert recipients at risk of receiving duplicate assistance and improve identification of benefit duplication. FEMA coordinates with SBA through a disaster assistance website, which could be enhanced to track duplication more effectively. Critics argue that not all cases of duplication may be identified if individuals and businesses do not self-report. Some individuals and businesses may fail to self-report their assistance, leading to potential cases of duplication, whether intentional or unintentional."
