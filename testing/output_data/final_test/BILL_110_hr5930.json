    "content": "The Act titled \"Charitable Aid to Community Heroes Act of 2008\" allows charitable organizations to collect and distribute deductible contributions for individuals injured or killed while protecting life or property. The Act allows charitable organizations to collect and disperse deductible contributions for individuals injured or killed while protecting life or property. Payments made by eligible organizations to eligible individuals or their family members are treated as related to the organization's exempt purpose under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Act allows charitable organizations to collect and disperse deductible contributions for individuals injured or killed while protecting life or property. An eligible individual is defined as someone injured or killed while on duty as a government employee or member of a qualified volunteer emergency response organization. Fundraising requirements are met if the organization does not solicit contributions for distribution under this subsection. The Act allows charitable organizations to collect and disperse deductible contributions for individuals injured or killed while protecting life or property. Eligibility criteria include accepting contributions only within a 1-year period after the event, having at least 50 donors, and ensuring that over 95% of funds come from unrelated individuals. Administrative requirements mandate that all contributions and earnings are distributed to eligible individuals or their families. The requirements for distributing funds to eligible individuals or their families after a qualifying event include making all distributions within 180 days after the 1-year period, distributing half equally among eligible individuals and the other half according to a specified formula. The distribution of funds to eligible individuals or their families after a qualifying event is as follows: each eligible individual receives 1 share, each spouse receives 1 share, and each qualifying child receives 1/2 share. Family members include spouses and qualifying children of the eligible individual. The distribution of funds to eligible individuals or their families after a qualifying event is based on shares allocated to each individual, including spouses and qualifying children. The term 'qualifying child' is defined by specific criteria related to the relationship, age, and support provided by the eligible individual. In the case of a deceased eligible individual, benefits are determined based on the date of death or injury. The amendment allows references to an eligible individual who died to be treated as references to their estate. Organizations receiving contributions for multiple events must apply the provisions separately for each event. The effective date of the amendment is after the enactment of the Act."
