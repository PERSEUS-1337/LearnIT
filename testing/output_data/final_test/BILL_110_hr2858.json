    "content": "PROHIBITION ON FRANCHISE AGREEMENT RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO RENEWABLE FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE: Title I of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act is amended to include a prohibition on restricting the installation of renewable fuel pumps. In this section, \"renewable fuel\" is defined as fuel containing at least 85% ethanol or a mixture of biodiesel/renewable diesel and diesel fuel with at least 10% biodiesel/renewable diesel. A \"franchise-related document\" includes a franchise under this Act and any other contract or directive from a franchisor regarding fuel sale terms. Prohibitions are outlined regarding franchise agreement restrictions related to renewable fuel infrastructure. The section prohibits franchisors from restricting franchisees or affiliates from installing renewable fuel pumps or tanks on marketing premises, with exceptions for leased premises. Franchisees can convert existing tanks or pumps for renewable fuel use if warranted or certified. The section allows franchisees to advertise and sell renewable fuel on their marketing premises, purchase renewable fuel from sources other than the franchisor, and list renewable fuel availability or prices on service station signs. Franchisees are allowed to sell renewable fuel on their premises, purchase it from sources other than the franchisor, and display renewable fuel availability or prices on signs. Any existing restrictions on franchisees regarding fuel grades are null and void. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act is amended to include enforcement of section 107, along with other conforming amendments to the Act. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act is amended to enforce section 107, which prohibits restrictions on the installation of renewable fuel pumps. Additionally, section 202 is amended to include automotive fuel rating testing and disclosure requirements. The act also addresses replacing corn as an ethanol feedstock. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to provide grants to universities for a 3-year demonstration program replacing corn with sweet sorghum as an ethanol feedstock. The program aims to enhance agronomic efficiency by developing best practices for high sorghum yields with less water and nitrogen, selecting high sugar content plants, and developing cold-tolerant sorghum varieties for two crops per season. The program aims to enhance ethanol processing potential in sweet sorghum by developing technology for centralized production facilities, conducting fermentation analyses, introducing enzymes for biomass conversion, and performing life-cycle analysis. Additionally, it aims to establish a region-specific sweet sorghum production system. The program aims to improve sweet sorghum lines for higher sugar production, optimize sugar fermentation, enhance cold tolerance, and develop agricultural models for ethanol yield prediction. Grants will be awarded to universities with access to sweet sorghum lines and located in states suitable for sweet sorghum growth. $10,000,000 is authorized for this program. SEC. 3. CLOSED LOOP ETHANOL PROJECT LOAN GUARANTEES. Closed loop ethanol is defined as a facility that collects waste from agricultural animals and crops to generate fuel, which is then used to produce ethanol on-site. The amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes provisions for closed loop ethanol projects, reducing fossil fuel usage by at least 90 percent in ethanol production. Loan guarantee program amendments also allow for increased project cost coverage, including closed loop ethanol facilities. The amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows for the use of Federal, State, and locally issued industrial revenue bonds for the construction of facilities, including closed loop ethanol facilities. It also extends the loan guarantee period to not more than 30 years for closed loop ethanol facilities. SEC. 4. Modification of alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit. Increases credit amount to 50% and maximum amount to $50,000. Extension of credit applies to property placed in service before December 31, 2014. Effective date is after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. Refueling property for biodiesel and renewable biodiesel. SEC. 5. Refueling property for biodiesel and renewable biodiesel. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new subparagraph allowing for a tax credit for diesel fuel mixtures containing at least 10% biodiesel or renewable biodiesel. Effective for property placed in service after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. Increase in credit for research on alternative and renewable energy processes. Increase in Credit Amount for Research Relating to Alternative and Renewable Energy Processes under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes substituting higher percentages for expenses related to qualified resources. The amendment increases the credit amount for research on alternative and renewable energy processes by substituting higher percentages for expenses related to qualified resources. The amendment to section 38(c)(4) of the Code increases the credit for research on alternative and renewable energy processes. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2007."
