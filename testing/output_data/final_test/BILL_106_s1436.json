    "content": "The \"Farm Income and Trade Equity Act of 1999\" may be cited as such. It introduces Transitional International Marketing Equity Payments under the Agricultural Market Transition Act. The \"Farm Income and Trade Equity Act of 1999\" allows owners or producers actively engaged in farming to make a one-time election for fiscal years starting in 1999 to receive payments for loan commodities, marketing assistance loans, and forfeit other payments. The payment amount for a crop of a loan commodity is determined by multiplying the payment rate by the acreage base. The payment rate for wheat, feed grains, and oilseeds is determined by the European Union support level minus the loan rate for a marketing assistance loan. The payment rate for a crop in the European Union is calculated based on the intervention price and compensatory payments in US dollars. The intervention price is determined by multiplying the European intervention price in euros per metric ton by the average European-United exchange rate. The compensatory payments for a crop in the European Union are calculated by multiplying the amount of payments in euros per metric ton by the average European-United States exchange rate in dollars per euro, and then dividing by the number of bushels per metric ton for the crop. The payment rate for grain sorghum and oats will be determined by the Secretary in relation to corn, considering the feeding value of the commodity. For cotton and rice, the payment rate for a crop will be established accordingly. The Secretary will establish fair payment rates for upland cotton, extra long staple cotton, and rice in relation to wheat, considering historical price relationships. Adjustments may be made to support owners and producers based on compensatory payments by the European Union. The acreage base for these crops will be 85 percent of the contract acreage. The payment yield for a crop of a loan commodity shall be the farm program payment yield. The total amount of payments made to a person may not exceed $40,000 in any fiscal year. The maximum amount of any gain realized from repaying marketing assistance loans for loan commodities shall be $75,000 in any crop year. The Secretary will promulgate regulations regarding these limitations. The Secretary will promulgate regulations to define the term 'person' and establish rules to prevent multiple payments or loans to related parties under subsection (a). The regulations will ensure a fair and reasonable application of the limitations set forth in this subsection. The Secretary will promulgate regulations to define the term 'person' and establish rules to prevent multiple payments or loans to related parties under subsection (a), consistent with paragraphs (5) through (7) of section 1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985. SEC. 3. NONRECOURSE MARKETING ASSISTANCE LOANS. Amends the Agricultural Market Transition Act to establish an alternative loan rate based on the average price received by producers for the preceding 5 crops, excluding the highest and lowest years. SEC. 4. INCREASED AGRICULTURAL TRADE ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO DIRECT EXPORT SUBSIDIES BY EUROPEAN UNION. Section 301(e) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to allocate $3,850,000,000 for fiscal year 2000. It also addresses the response to direct export subsidies by the European Union, ensuring that funds remain available until expended and establishing minimum funding levels for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. The Commodity Credit Corporation will provide funding for the program and dairy export incentive program based on the amount the European Union spends on direct export subsidies. If there are limitations due to the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement, the Secretary will increase assistance. The Secretary will increase assistance for title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 based on the amount the European Union spends on direct export subsidies. SEC. 5. APPLICATION. This Act and its amendments will apply to the 1999 crop of loan commodities, with exceptions for Agricultural Trade Assistance starting in fiscal year 2000."
