The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to award grants to States for employer-operated child care programs. States must submit an application to receive a grant, with the amount determined based on the State's population. Grant funds are to be used to assist small businesses. The grant awarded under this section provides assistance to small businesses in the State to establish and operate child care programs, including technical assistance, start-up costs, training for providers, scholarships for low-income earners, care for sick or school-aged children, contracts with local resources, and assistance for other activities. The State provides assistance to small businesses to establish child care programs, including care for children with disabilities. To be eligible, businesses must submit an application to the State. Priority is given to forming consortiums to provide child care in areas where it is not readily available. A consortium consists of 2 or more entities. A consortium must consist of 2 or more entities, including businesses, nonprofit agencies, local governments, or other appropriate entities. States cannot provide more than $50,000 in assistance to a single applicant or assist more than 10 entities with grant funds. States must ensure that entities receiving assistance contribute non-Federal funds equal to the costs incurred in carrying out activities under the grant. Private entities receiving assistance under the grant must contribute a certain percentage of costs in the first, second, and third fiscal years. Child care providers must comply with state and local licensing requirements to be eligible for assistance. The provider must comply with State and local licensing requirements and health and safety standards. States are responsible for administering and monitoring grants, requiring annual audits from entities receiving assistance. Misuse of funds may result in repayment if detected. The State must notify the Secretary if a grant recipient misuses assistance, leading to possible repayment. The Secretary will establish an appeals process for repayments. After two years of providing grants, the Secretary will conduct a study on entities' capacity to meet child care needs in communities within a State. The Secretary will prepare a report on the effectiveness of grant programs for child care partnerships at the local level, including information on program users and their income levels. The term \"small business\" is defined as an employer with 2 to 50 employees. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2000 for this section. The grant program for child care partnerships will receive $25,000,000 annually from 1998 to 2000, and will terminate on September 30, 2001. SEC. 102. PROJECTS FOR CHILD CARE BY OLDER INDIVIDUALS.

For the child and dependent care credit, the maximum credit is $5,400 and is phased out for higher income taxpayers based on adjusted gross income thresholds.
