    "content": "The \"Starting Early Starting Right Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that child care is essential for children's development and parents' productivity at work. Child care workers have low wages, barely above the poverty line, leading to high turnover rates. Child care providers have high turnover rates, with only 65 percent remaining in the field from 2005 to 2006. Current reimbursement rates are insufficient to retain qualified providers and ensure high-quality care. Research shows that high-quality child care benefits low-income children by improving school readiness and academic skills. Inadequate funding has reduced access to high-quality child care for low-income children. Only 1 in 7 eligible children receives Federal child care assistance, impacting working poor families who struggle to cover the cost of child care. The Act aims to improve access to high-quality child care for low-income families and working parents, as research shows that child care assistance helps single mothers and former welfare recipients remain employed. AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT ACT OF 1990. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to authorize appropriations of $4,127,181,000 for fiscal year 2010 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. Amendments include requirements for site visits to certify state licensing applicable to child care providers.

Requirements for site visits to certify state licensing for child care providers are included, with one annual announced and one annual unannounced visit to each site. Training requirements for lead teachers are also mandated within 3 years of the Starting Early Starting Right Act. Starting Right Act mandates that lead teachers and family child care providers must have 40 hours of initial training and 24 hours of annual training in health, safety, and child development. The Starting Early Starting Right Act requires states to certify plans for training child care providers within 3 years of enactment, including training for limited-English-proficient providers. The Starting Early Starting Right Act mandates states to certify plans for training child care providers, including limited-English-proficient providers, to offer high-quality child care services. States must demonstrate how they will meet the specific child care needs of low-income and working families, including outreach strategies for hard-to-serve children. The Starting Early Starting Right Act requires states to certify plans for training child care providers to offer high-quality services to various groups, including language learners, children with special needs, and those in rural areas. This includes using contracts with child care centers and organizations to reach underserved communities, pilot projects to increase high-quality child care supply, and demonstrations of effective practices. The Starting Early Starting Right Act mandates specialized training for child care providers to improve services for language learners and children with developmental disabilities through pilot and demonstration projects. The State must demonstrate implementation of practices for continuous care for children from the same provider, including through contracts with child care centers, extending redetermination periods to 1 year, job search eligibility extensions, and timely notification of eligibility ending. The State plan must ensure that payment rates for child care services meet or exceed the 75th percentile of the current market rate, based on a research-based survey. The State plan must address the need for child care for special populations, including low-income and rural areas, infants, toddlers, children with special needs, and care during nonstandard hours. Additionally, efforts to improve the quality of child care services are outlined in the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act outlines activities to improve the quality of child care services. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act requires states to allocate at least 15 percent of funds for activities enhancing child care quality, such as implementing a Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) and providing support for education and training for child care providers. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act mandates states to allocate funds for activities enhancing child care quality, including implementing a Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), providing grants and assistance to child care providers, maintaining a network of resource and referral programs, inspecting and monitoring child care programs, and offering support for education and training initiatives. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act requires states to allocate funds for various activities, including providing grants for training and support to unlicensed child care providers, developing technological resources for low-income families to apply for child care assistance, and extending child care services for eligible children. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act mandates states to allocate funds for improving infant and toddler care quality. States operating a Quality Rating and Improvement System must submit biannual reports to the Secretary with data on licensed child care providers. The State QRIS report must include data on child care providers by type, race, ethnicity, and geographic area, as well as the number of children they are licensed to serve. It should also detail the number and percentages of children receiving child care assistance in each QRIS level. Additionally, any changes in provider numbers and percentages must be noted, along with information on children receiving assistance. The State QRIS report should include data on child care providers by type, race, ethnicity, and geographic area, as well as the number of children they serve. It should also detail the number and percentages of children receiving child care assistance in each QRIS level, including those in low-income communities who have moved up to a higher-quality level. Additionally, the report should provide the average child care reimbursement rate at each level of the State QRIS, listed by provider type, race and ethnicity, and geographic area of the State. A 5-year report is due by December 31, 2014. The State must submit a 5-year report to the Secretary by December 31, 2014, and every 5 years thereafter. The report should include aggregate data on average individual compensation for lead teachers, classroom assistants, family child care providers, and assistants in licensed child care programs, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, credentials, and program type."
