    "content": "The funding of public elementary and secondary schools in the United States involves a combination of local, state, and federal government revenues, with over 90% coming from state and local sources. This report aims to explain the role of federal assistance programs in financing education and how state and local finance policies intersect with federal involvement. It provides an overview of funding mechanisms used by states and local educational agencies. The curr_chunk provides an overview of state and local funding mechanisms for public education, including sources of funding, revenue generation through taxes, state school finance programs, and weighted student funding programs. It also discusses the concept of \"equalization\" in state school finance programs. The curr_chunk discusses high-cost needs in education, LEA programs to finance public schools, and federal education aid programs like Title I-A and Title I-E under ESEA. It emphasizes creating a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students. The funding of public elementary and secondary schools in the United States involves a combination of local, state, and federal government revenues, with a total of $678.4 billion devoted to education in the 2015-16 school year. State governments provided 47.0%, local governments provided 44.8%, and the federal government provided 8.3% of these revenues. The report also reviews recent efforts to collect and report data on expenditures per pupil at public schools within LEAs. The share of public elementary and secondary education revenues provided by state governments has increased over the last few decades, while the share from local governments has decreased. The federal share has varied between 6.0% to 12.7%, peaking during the recession of 2009-2011. There is significant variation among states in terms of funding sources, with Hawaii relying heavily on state funding and the District of Columbia lacking state government support. The District of Columbia provides 90% of revenues from local sources, with Illinois having the lowest state share (24.1%) and the highest local share (67.4%) among the states. Revenues for public education are raised at state and local levels, primarily through property taxes. Property taxes account for 72.0% of local government tax revenues, with sales taxes at 17.4%, income taxes at 6.0%, and motor vehicle taxes at 4.6%. The property tax is based on the assessed value of real and personal property, with variations in property value affecting revenue-raising capacity. Local variations in capacity to raise revenues per pupil for public education are primarily caused by differences in taxable property per pupil and local property tax rates. State revenues for education come from various sources including income and sales taxes, excise taxes, and lotteries. In 2016, 47.8% of state tax revenues were from sales taxes, 42.2% from income taxes, 1.7% from property taxes, and 8.3% from other taxes. State revenues for education come from various sources including income and sales taxes, excise taxes, and lotteries. All states provide a share of total revenues for public education, with varying state shares ranging from 25% to 90%. States began establishing public education finance programs in the early 20th century to address revenue inequality. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics has supported efforts to catalog and categorize state policies for allocating education revenues. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collaborated with other organizations to compile information on state school finance programs, with the most recent publication dating back to 2001. Efforts have been made by individual analysts to update some of this information, such as annual updates by Professor Deborah Verstegen. Responses to surveys on state school finance programs are prepared by different individuals in each state. State responses on school finance programs vary in terminology and focus, categorized into Foundation Programs, Full State Funding Programs, Flat Grants, District Power Equalizing, and Categorical Grants. States often combine elements of these programs in their policies, leading to variations in counts across categories due to timing, policy evolution, and individual interpretation. Foundation Programs, the most common type of state school finance programs, were established in the 1930s and are found in about 80% of states. They include required local tax effort, state equalization aid, and local leeway funds to achieve an annual target funding per pupil for all LEAs. Pupil counts may be weighted based on various characteristics like grade level, special needs, low family income, or English Learner status. Foundation Programs aim to provide a minimum level of funding per pupil, ensuring a base level of funding for all LEAs. The state adjusts funding based on local taxable property wealth, with higher percentages for LEAs with low fiscal capacity and lower percentages for those with high fiscal capacity. Foundation Programs aim to equalize funding by adjusting based on local taxable property wealth, with higher percentages for LEAs with low fiscal capacity and lower percentages for those with high fiscal capacity. In most states, the state specifies a minimum local tax rate, while in others, localities are not required to tax themselves at a certain rate. LEAs may have the option to raise local tax rates beyond the state requirement, known as \"leeway funds,\" but they will not receive state supplementation for the additional funds raised. Foundation Programs aim to equalize funding based on local property wealth, with higher percentages for LEAs with low fiscal capacity. LEAs can raise additional funds beyond the state target level, with Full State Funding only found in Hawaii. Flat Grants, historically important, are now a supplement to Foundation Programs. States like Vermont and New Mexico have limited local funding sources. District Power Equalizing programs provide grants to all LEAs in a state to equalize revenue-raising abilities from taxable property, ensuring a minimum level of funding per unit of local tax rate. State funds are provided if a locality cannot meet the standard funding level due to insufficient taxable property. District Power Equalizing programs provide a minimum guaranteed tax base for public education in the state, focusing on equity for taxpayers while allowing variation in local tax rates. Fewer states rely solely on this program type, but many still incorporate it alongside other funding programs. Categorical Grants are also used to provide funding based on the number of students with specific needs. Grants provide funding for students with specific needs or in particular educational programs. States may treat the funding as general aid or require it to be used for the specific students. The largest federal programs of aid to public education are Categorical Grants, including ESEA Title I, Part A for disadvantaged children. It is challenging to categorize states neatly based on data and terminology. One recent effort categorized states based on their school finance programs, with most states using Foundation Programs. Other categorizations in 2003 and a more recent analysis also showed a similar trend, with some states using Full State Funding or Flat Grants. In the realm of state school finance programs, most states utilize Foundation Programs, with some variations such as Full State Funding, Flat Grants, and District Power Equalizing. A tiered funding system is increasingly common, combining multiple program types. According to the Education Commission of the States, 36 states primarily use a Foundation model, 8 states use a Resource Allocation model, and others employ hybrids or different finance models to ensure some degree of spending equalization and resource allocation in K-12 education. State school finance programs aim to equalize funding for public elementary and secondary education across all local education agencies (LEAs) in the state. While the goal is equal spending per pupil, variations exist based on local willingness to pay, costs of educating high-need pupils, and geographic differences. Programs often account for higher costs associated with educating pupils with disabilities, from low-income families, or in areas with high concentrations of need. State school finance programs aim to equalize funding for public education across all local education agencies (LEAs) in the state. Analysts use terms like \"horizontal equity\" for equal funding for similar pupils in different LEAs and \"vertical equity\" for different funding levels based on pupil needs. If a state provides more funds for high-cost pupils to achieve vertical equity, disparities in spending per pupil may still exist. Regardless of adjustments for pupil distribution, school finance equalization can be approached in two basic ways. State school finance programs aim to equalize funding for public education across all local education agencies (LEAs) in the state. Analysts use terms like \"horizontal equity\" for equal funding for similar pupils in different LEAs and \"vertical equity\" for different funding levels based on pupil needs. Two basic methods of school finance equalization are commonly used: equalizing revenues or expenditures per pupil and equalizing the amount of funds each LEA could raise per unit of local tax rate. Foundation Programs and Categorical Grants provide additional funds for high-need pupil groups, while District Power Equalizing programs focus on equalizing funds raised per unit of local tax rate. Power Equalizing programs aim to equalize funds raised per unit of local tax rate for public education. Court cases in the early 1970s, such as Serrano v. Priest and San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, addressed the issue of resource equalization across local education agencies. The issue of school finance equalization has been primarily addressed in state courts based on state constitutional provisions, rather than federal courts. State school finance programs often establish target funding levels \"per pupil,\" which may be based on total student enrollment or weighted counts considering various factors like special needs, grade levels, educational programs, and geographic considerations. State school finance programs often establish target funding levels \"per pupil,\" which may be based on weighted student counts considering factors like special needs, grade levels, educational programs, and geographic considerations. A recent survey shows that at least 32 states use weighted student counts to determine funding levels, with policies assigning numeric weights to different categories of pupils or specifying target dollar amounts for specific categories. The study analyzed the use of pupil weighting in state school finance programs, with 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico using weights for at least one pupil category. The data included fewer categories of pupil weights compared to a previous study. The study was based on survey data collected during the 2017-2018 school year. The study analyzed state school finance policies during the 2017-2018 school year, excluding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. States often add funding weights for English learners, low-income students, and those with disabilities. Some states use multiple weights for specific disabilities and increase weights for low-income students in high-concentration areas. States without pupil weights in primary funding formulas may provide extra funding for high-need pupils through Categorical Grants. Pupil weights are adjusted for grade levels, geographic areas, and programs, with higher weights for early grades or grades 9-12. Some states prioritize other grade levels like 7-9. Population sparsity weights account for small LEAs or schools, while career and technical education weights recognize additional program costs. Oregon's school finance formula bases allocations on a weighted count of students in each LEA, with additional weights for English learners. The policy of weighted student funding (ADMw) applies additional weights to counts of students with specific needs, such as English learners, students with disabilities, and those in low-income families. The Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University tracks the use of weighted student funding in state school finance programs, reporting that 20 states allocated 33% or more of their state aid funds through this formula from FY2014 to FY2019. The concept of pupil weighting is often used to determine funding levels for LEAs under state school finance programs from FY2014 to FY2019. State funds are combined with locally raised funds to provide resources to individual schools. LEAs may use weighted student funding formulas to allocate funds to schools, but often use other strategies. Traditional intra-LEA budgeting involves centrally managing state and local funds without specific budgets for individual schools. Various resources like facilities, teachers, and equipment are assigned by LEA staff. In the budgeting process for schools, resources like teachers, support staff, and instructional equipment are assigned based on LEA-wide standards. Expenditures per pupil are calculated after resources are allocated to schools, leading to variations in spending due to factors like teacher seniority. Local policies may mask these variations by using average salaries in school accounting. Some LEAs have shifted to using average salaries in school accounting systems instead of specific salaries. These policies are not applied to federal program funds and only a portion of state and local revenues. LEAs continue to centrally administer various activities like school facility construction, operations, employee benefits, and transportation. Several large urban LEAs implement weighted student funding policies for intra-LEA allocations to schools, allocating between 21% and 89% of their funds through this method. Some of these LEAs include Baltimore City, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, and New York City, among others. The Edunomics Lab compiles data on these LEAs, but there is no comprehensive listing of all LEAs currently using weighted student funding. Several large urban LEAs, including Boston, implement weighted student funding policies for school allocations based on various factors like grade level, disabilities, English learners, low-income students, and career programs. This funding method aims to promote equity, empower school staff, encourage innovation, ensure accountability, and provide transparency in funding distribution. Funding policies in LEAs aim to promote equity by linking funding levels to high-need pupils, leading to increased funding in schools with more of these students. Advocates believe transparency is improved when school budgets reflect actual spending. Weighted student funding can enhance school choice and flexibility in resource use. However, this practice is relatively new, and research on its effects is limited. The ESEA includes programs that incorporate elements of equalization and weighted student funding strategies used by states and LEAs. The Title I-A program provides federal aid to LEAs for the education of disadvantaged children, offering supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high concentrations of low-income families. It is the largest ESEA program, accounting for over 60% of all ESEA funds. Title I-E allows the Secretary of Education to provide LEAs with flexibility to consolidate federal funds for a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students. Under ESEA Title I-A, grants to LEAs are allocated using different formulas - Basic Grant, Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and Education Finance Incentive Grant (EFIG). Maximum grants are calculated based on a formula child count and expenditure factor, adjusted for available appropriations and state/LEA provisions. The Title I-A grants formula for child population includes children in low-income families, institutions for neglected/delinquent children, and families receiving TANF payments. Low-income families make up 97% of the formula child count. LEAs must meet minimum criteria to be eligible for grants. The EFIG formula is one of four Title I-A formulas. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants includes an equity factor and weighted student funding component. Grants are based on formula children, state expenditures, effort factor, and equity factor among LEAs. The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants includes an equity factor based on the coefficient of variation (CV) in per pupil expenditures among LEAs in each state. The CV is calculated with extra weight for children from low-income families, maximizing grants for states with a 40% higher expenditure for low-income students. State equity factors typically range from 0.00 to account for different LEA jurisdictions. The equity factor in the EFIG formula for Title I-A grants is determined by the coefficient of variation (CV) in per pupil expenditures among LEAs in each state. State equity factors range from 0.00 to approximately 0.30, with most falling in the 0.10-0.20 range. The lower a state's expenditure disparities among its LEAs, the higher its grant will be under the EFIG formula. Of the $15.9 billion appropriated for Title I-A for FY2019, EFIG received $4.0 billion (25.3% of total). The EFIG formula for Title I-A grants received $4.0 billion (25.3% of total funding) for the 2019-2020 school year. It uses a weighted student funding concept, giving more weight to students from low-income families. This results in higher grants for states with more funds for low-income students. The formula is also used in the Title I-A Targeted Grant formula and in intrastate allocation of funds to LEAs within states. The Targeted Grant formula received $4.0 billion (25.3% of total Title I-A funding) for the 2019-20 school year. It assigns weights based on formula child counts and rates, with higher weights for higher counts or rates. This results in higher grants per formula child for LEAs. The formula uses one set of weights for child counts and another for child rates. In contrast, the EFIG formula uses three sets of weights based on each state's equity factor. The Title I-E authority allows the Secretary to enter into a demonstration agreement with LEAs that are using or agree to implement weighted student funding systems to establish budgets for, and allocate funds to, individual public schools. The Title I-E authority allows LEAs to enter into a local flexibility demonstration agreement with a weighted student funding system that provides more funding to English learners, low-income students, and other disadvantaged students. High-poverty schools must receive increased funding for low-income and EL students compared to the previous year. The weighted student funding system for Title I-E authority requires all school-level actual expenditures to be included in the calculation of federal, state, and local funds allocated to schools based on student numbers and a per-pupil weighted amount formula. A significant portion of funds must be allocated to schools, and the percentage of funds must be sufficient to meet the agreement's purposes and requirements. Eligible federal funds can be consolidated in the system. Eligible federal funds, such as those under ESEA Title I-A, Title II-A, Title III-A, and Title IV-A, can be consolidated in an LEA's weighted student funding system. Once consolidated, these funds are treated the same as state and local funds, with no required uses as long as expenditures are deemed \"reasonable and necessary.\" Non-ESEA funds are not eligible for consolidation. The adoption of weighted student funding by some LEAs has increased interest in collecting and reporting school-level finance data for public schools. Federal efforts to require and support reporting of this information have expanded rapidly in recent years, which could aid in fiscal accountability for programs like ESEA Title I-A and promote transparency in budgeting decisions by LEAs. The ESEA Title I-A program requires services in Title I-A schools to be comparable to non-Title I-A schools within the same LEA, ensuring state and local funds are used equitably. This comparability is measured within the LEA to guarantee Title I-A funds increase services without reducing funding for non-Title I-A schools. Title I-A funds provide a net increase in funding for Title I-A schools compared to non-Title I-A schools. LEAs are prohibited from using staff salary differentials in determining expenditures per pupil from state and local funds. Recent attention has been given to enforcing the comparability requirement and improving school-level expenditure data collection. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 required states to report school-level expenditures for the 2008-2009 school year, including personnel salaries and nonpersonnel expenditures. Guidelines were provided by the Department of Education on the types of expenditures to include in the reports. States and LEAs were asked to report expenditures from state and local funds only, excluding certain programs. The study found that more than 40% of Title I schools had lower personnel expenditures per pupil compared to non-Title I schools at the same grade level. For example, 46% of Title I-A elementary schools had below-average personnel expenditures compared to non-Title I-A schools in the same LEA. Middle and high schools were marginally less likely to have below-average per-pupil personnel expenditures. Overall, 48% of Title I-A schools were not receiving the same level of funding. In elementary and secondary education, 48% of Title I-A schools did not receive the same level of per-pupil state and local personnel expenditures as non-Title I-A schools in the same LEA. This does not violate Title I-A comparability requirements but indicates disparities in funding. The Office for Civil Rights started collecting school-level expenditure data in 2009-2010, including total personnel salaries and teacher salaries. The Office for Civil Rights began collecting school-level expenditure data in 2009-2010, including total personnel salaries and teacher salaries. In spring 2014, the Office of Management and Budget and ED's Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development requested the development of a school-level finance data collection by NCES. This data collection includes personnel salaries for teachers, instructional aides, support services staff, and school administrators, as well as nonpersonnel expenditures. Unlike previous data collections, these data are collected directly from schools and LEAs, not states. NCES conducted a pilot School-Level Finance Survey (SLFS) in the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years with 12 and 17 states participating, respectively. Approximately half of the states were able to report complete personnel and/or nonpersonnel data for at least 95% of their public schools. The SLFS data were found to be consistent with other school finance surveys, and the development of standardized protocols was noted to enhance the efficiency of reporting school-level finance data. The School-Level Finance Survey (SLFS) faces challenges in collecting school-level finance data, but the feasibility of collecting quality data is high. Consistency among states in defining expenditures is a major concern. The SLFS includes 15 unique expenditure items covering personnel and nonpersonnel expenses, excluding employee benefits and centrally provided services. Data for these items were collected with minimal exclusions. The School-Level Finance Survey (SLFS) collects school-level finance data in two ways: with and without additional exclusions for certain expenditures. It was opened to all states on a voluntary basis starting in the 2015-2016 school year. NCES began collecting complete operational expenditure data in the 2017-2018 school year, aiming for complete, accurate, and comparable data across states. The ESSA amended ESEA Title I-A to improve school-level finance reporting requirements. The ESSA amended ESEA Title I-A to require states to include school expenditure data on report cards, including per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds. States are now beginning to report expenditure data in response to this requirement. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) amended ESEA Title I-A to include school expenditure data on report cards, such as per-pupil expenditures of Federal, State, and local funds. States are now starting to report expenditure data in compliance with this requirement. Key acronyms related to education funding include LEA, NCES, OMB, OPEPD, SAIPE, SEA, SLFS, and TANF."
