    "content": "The federal government has a long history of involvement in the Florida Everglades, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructing flood control projects in the 1940s. Various factors, including nonfederal development efforts, have contributed to the ecosystem's shrinkage. Ecosystem restoration activities began in the early 1990s, with federal and state agencies coordinating under an integrated plan in 2000 through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. In 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) as a framework for restoring the Everglades. The plan included 50 major projects to restore water deliveries in south Florida. Nine non-pilot CERP projects have been authorized, with others in the study phase awaiting congressional approval. Observers agree that more time and funding are needed for Everglades restoration, with debates over the pace of progress and allocation of financial support. Congress faces decisions on oversight, funding commitment, and prioritization of Everglades restoration compared to other federal initiatives. Stakeholders view the Everglades as a model for large-scale restoration initiatives. This report focuses on federal funding and challenges in Everglades restoration efforts, including CERP and non-CERP projects. The federal Everglades restoration efforts, including CERP and non-CERP projects, were first authorized in WRDA 2000. CERP focused on increasing water storage and treatment to benefit the ecosystem and users. The original plan included 50 projects estimated to cost $8.2 billion, with funding requirements increasing over time. The Corps estimated completing CERP projects would take over 50 years and cost $16.4 billion. 60% of cost increases from 1999 to 2014 were due to inflation, with the rest attributed to other factors. Project costs are shared 50/50 between the federal government and nonfederal sponsors. WRDA 2000 established cost-sharing ratios and authorized initial projects, with subsequent legislation adding more projects to the CERP framework. The WRDA 2007, WRRDA 2014, and WIIN Act authorized various CERP projects for Everglades restoration. Non-CERP activities, funded separately, also contribute to restoration efforts. Non-CERP activities for Everglades restoration, funded separately from CERP, encompass a wide range of projects undertaken by multiple agencies. Federal funding for these activities is mainly provided through the Department of the Interior and the Corps, concentrated in annual appropriations bills. Unlike CERP, there is no required cost-share split for non-CERP projects. The Administration's budget request typically identifies restoration funding totals for CERP and non-CERP for DOI and the Corps, but appropriations laws do not specify recommended appropriations levels for Everglades restoration activities. Funding for DOI and Corps CERP and non-CERP activities is embedded within project and account-level totals. Everglades restoration funding within the Department of the Interior is allotted to agencies like the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. Funding for Everglades restoration activities within the Department of the Interior (DOI) is allocated to agencies like the National Park Service (NPS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Two main types of funding are often debated: funding for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project for Everglades National Park (Mod Waters). Mod Waters aims to improve water deliveries by removing barriers around the Tamiami Trail and is considered a key project for Everglades restoration, despite being a non-CERP project. The DOI funds various activities in the Everglades, including national park and wildlife refuge management, research, and law implementation. Non-CERP funding supports operations of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. The FY2018 Trump Administration requested $54 million for Everglades restoration, with $8 million for CERP projects and $46 million for non-CERP projects. Corps funding is for planning and construction of CERP projects and other authorized projects. The Corps Everglades restoration projects are funded through the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, with a requested level of $76 million in FY2018. This includes $75 million for CERP activities and $1 million for non-CERP activities. Previous drops in funding have been noted, but the allocation to CERP projects is seen as a key benchmark for Everglades restoration progress. The federal government has provided funding for Everglades restoration since the early 1990s, with a total investment exceeding $5 billion from FY1993 to FY2016. Prior to the enactment of CERP, federal appropriations totaled over $1.2 billion from FY1993 through FY2000. Since the enactment of CERP in WRDA 2000 through FY2015, total federal funding has exceeded $4 billion, with Corps and DOI accounting for approximately $3 billion. CERP projects received around $1.1 billion of this funding. Since the early 1990s, the federal government has invested over $5 billion in Everglades restoration. Funding for CERP projects totaled approximately $1.1 billion, with overall funding from the Corps and DOI exceeding $3 billion. Congress has shown interest in Everglades funding, with appropriations fluctuating between $125 million and $250 million annually. Funding distribution between CERP and non-CERP projects has evolved over time, with recent years seeing a decrease in overall appropriations. Since the early 1990s, the federal government has invested over $5 billion in Everglades restoration, with funding for CERP projects totaling approximately $1.1 billion. Congress has fluctuated appropriations between $125 million and $250 million annually, with recent decreases in funding attributed to various factors such as project completion and transition to new project phases. Many Everglades restoration supporters see federal CERP funding as crucial for indicating the government's commitment. State funding surpasses federal funding, but comparisons are complex due to cost-sharing requirements. Nonfederal funding from Florida has been significant for land acquisition in Everglades restoration. The state of Florida has spent $2 billion on land acquisition for future CERP projects, with nonfederal funding exceeding federal funding. However, only $1.05 billion has been officially credited towards CERP's nonfederal share. There are expectations that additional nonfederal expenditures will be credited in the future. The state of Florida's funding for CERP has decreased in recent years due to various factors, including a decline in state tax revenues and a focus on other Everglades restoration projects. There is uncertainty about whether state funding for CERP will return to previous levels in the future. Previous estimates suggested that around $584 million in state expenditures could be credited towards CERP when \"Generation 2\" projects were authorized by Congress in June 2014. The federal authorizing legislation for Everglades restoration projects may receive increased attention if no new state funding is provided. Congress mandates regular evaluations of Everglades restoration, including independent reviews by the National Academies of Sciences. The most recent report was released in 2016, with a focus on CERP implementation. The Corps and DOI publish reports every five years on CERP implementation, with the most recent in 2015. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force also releases biennial reports on restoration progress. Significant accomplishments have been made on Everglades restoration projects, including pilot projects and construction initiatives. Non-CERP projects are either complete or nearing completion, with ongoing efforts as well. Significant progress has been made on Everglades restoration projects, with improved scientific understanding and baseline information established. While ecosystem benefits are yet to be fully achieved, some positive effects have been observed, such as increased water levels, vegetation response, reduced seepage loss, and improved water quality in certain areas. It is expected that most benefits will be realized several years after project construction, requiring extensive monitoring and adaptive management for maximum impact. Everglades restoration has achieved several milestones, including the purchase of land for CERP projects and completion of early pilot projects influencing larger projects. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed for maximum impact. Several pilot projects authorized under the Water Resources Development Acts of 1999 and 2000, including a successful groundwater seepage barrier, have been completed. Non-CERP projects, such as the Florida Keys Water Quality Improvement Project and the Kissimmee River Project, are also nearing completion and have already shown significant ecosystem benefits. The Generation 1 CERP projects authorized in WRDA 2000 and WRDA 2007, including Melaleuca Eradication, have shown significant ecosystem benefits. As of early 2017, three projects were under construction with some phases completed. The 2016 NRC Biennial Review noted preliminary ecosystem benefits. WRRDA 2014 authorized four Generation 2 CERP projects with total estimated costs of $1.9 billion. Several Everglades restoration projects were in progress as of early FY2017, including the C-43 Reservoir, Broward County WPAs, C-111 Spreader Canal, and Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) was authorized for federal construction and is considered a high-priority project for Everglades restoration. CEPP aims to prioritize restoration projects in the central portion of the Everglades ecosystem. The Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is a high-priority project for Everglades restoration, focusing on the central portion of the ecosystem. The estimated cost of CEPP is $1.9 billion, but it has not yet been requested for construction. Other CERP projects are in the planning phase, and efforts to reduce time and cost of Corps studies for Everglades restoration projects have been implemented. Despite achieving some milestones, outside reviewers have noted challenges with Everglades restoration, including slow project implementation, increasing costs, and new challenges as ecosystem understanding improves. Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the full benefits of restoration. The slow pace of Everglades restoration projects, funding challenges, and competition for resources could hinder project implementation in the future. The slow pace of Everglades restoration projects may be further hindered by funding challenges and competition for resources. Recent studies suggest that more water than initially thought may be needed to restore the ecosystem, while planned water storage projects have been deemed infeasible. Additionally, the potential for saltwater encroachment due to sea-level rise adds uncertainty to previous restoration plans. The potential new water needs for ecosystem health in South Florida and the challenges to Everglades restoration, including water quality issues, historical hydrologic conditions, invasive species, and project completion, have yet to be fully explored. These factors could impact the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Completion of project construction is just one hurdle for Everglades restoration, with operations and monitoring posing additional challenges. While initial benefits may be seen, it will take time for projects to refine their operations and show significant long-term positive effects on the environment and species dependent on the Everglades."
