    "content": "The \"Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 2012\" was enacted to address claims filed by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe regarding funds received and expended under the Nelson Act and other statutes and treaties. On May 17, 1999, a settlement was approved by the Court for claims in Docket No. 19 and 188, with $20,000,000 transferred to the Department of the Interior on June 22, 1999. Congress must authorize the distribution of the judgment funds as per the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribal Executive Committee passed Resolution 146-09 on October 1, 2009, approving a distribution plan. Resolution 146-09 was passed by the Committee to distribute judgment funds awarded to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. The plan requests Congress to distribute the funds as outlined. Definitions include available funds, Bands, judgment funds, and the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, composed of six bands, can be reimbursed by the Secretary of the Interior for funds spent on legal fees and expenses related to specific litigation. The reimbursement includes the amount contributed plus interest earned. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe can be reimbursed by the Secretary for funds spent on legal fees and expenses related to specific litigation. The reimbursement must be certified as unreimbursed, include interest, and be paid from judgment funds before division. Membership rolls must be updated for each Band before funds are divided. After updating membership rolls, the Secretary sets aside $300 per member for each Band and divides the remaining funds equally. Funds are deposited into separate \"Per Capita\" and \"Equal Shares\" accounts for each Band, allowing Bands to withdraw the money as needed. One year after the funds are made available to the Bands, unclaimed $300 payments will be returned to the Secretary for redistribution. The Secretary divides funds equally among Bands and deposits them into Band accounts. If a Band withdraws money, the Secretary is not liable for its expenditure. Funds disbursed under the Act are not for previous obligations and are subject to the Indian Judgment Funds Distribution Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
