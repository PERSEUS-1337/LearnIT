The Congress finds a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster children in the child welfare system, leading to thousands of foster children without permanent homes. Child welfare agencies should eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identification, and marital status to open more homes to foster children. Over 129,000 children in the US foster care system are legally free for adoption, with 51,000 children adopted in 2007 and 25,000 youth aging out of the system. Increasing adoption rates and establishing permanency for foster youth can lead to significant cost savings. In 2007, 25,000 youth aged out of the foster care system, putting them at high risk for poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood. Additionally, gay, lesbian, and bisexual parents were raising 4 percent of all adopted children and fostering for 3 percent of all foster children, with an interest from an additional 2,000,000 individuals in adoption. According to studies, same-sex couples raising adopted children are typically older, more educated, and have more economic resources than other adoptive parents. Children with same-sex parents have similar advantages and expectations for health, social, and psychological development as children with heterosexual parents. However, one-third of child welfare agencies in the US reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants due to conflicts with religious beliefs, state laws, or policies favoring married-heterosexual couples. The practice of prohibiting applicants from becoming foster parents or adopting children solely based on sexual orientation or marital status has reduced the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents overall. This discrimination denies gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried relatives the opportunity to care for their own kin, including grandchildren, from foster care. Over 14,000 children are currently placed with gay, lesbian, and bisexual adoptive and foster parents, highlighting the need for more inclusive policies nationwide. If individuals are discriminated against based on sexual orientation or marital status, foster care costs could increase by $87-130 million annually. Some states allow one member of a same-sex couple to adopt, but not both, denying children equal rights and security. Recognition of joint and second-parent adoption is crucial for children's well-being. The Act aims to decrease wait times for children to find permanent loving families and prevent discrimination in adoption and foster care placements based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status. Professional organizations support qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt, citing research showing sexual orientation does not determine parental success. The Act aims to prevent discrimination in adoption and foster care placements based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status. The Act prohibits entities receiving Federal assistance in adoption or foster care placements from discriminating based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status. This includes not denying opportunities to become adoptive or foster parents, delaying placements, or limiting parental rights based on these factors. The Act prohibits discrimination in adoption and foster care placements based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status. It defines \"placement decision\" as the decision to place a child in a foster or adoptive home. Individuals aggrieved by violations can seek relief in a US district court. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide guidance on compliance within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Entities receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements must comply with the Act within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year from enactment. States can request deadline extensions for statutory law amendments. The Act requires States to comply within a specified timeframe after guidance publication. The Secretary can withhold funds if a State fails to comply. A study will be conducted within 5 years to assess State compliance with the Act. The Act mandates States to eliminate discriminatory policies against adoptive or foster parents based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status. It also requires the removal of barriers that delay or deny child placement based on these factors and the elimination of policies limiting parental rights of adoptive parents. Compliance is necessary within a specified timeframe, with potential fund withholding for non-compliance. The Comptroller General must report to Congress within one year after completing a study on discriminatory policies against adoptive parents based on sexual orientation, gender identification, or marital status."
