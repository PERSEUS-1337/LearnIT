    "content": "Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides financial aid to local educational agencies for the education of disadvantaged children. Accountability provisions have increasingly focused on achievement outcomes since the 1988 reauthorization, with a key concept being \"adequate yearly progress.\" The \"adequate yearly progress (AYP)\" requirements under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act aim to identify schools and LEAs with inadequate performance for targeted support and potential consequences. The report provides an overview of AYP, its provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act, and the implementation by the U.S. Department of Education and states. The ESEA authorization expired in FY2008, prompting potential amendments by the 111th Congress. The School Improvement Act of 1988 expanded requirements for evaluating Title I-A schools and pupils, introducing improvement plans for those not showing progress. However, these provisions were broad and vague compared to current Title I-A outcome accountability measures. States and LEAs had little guidance on determining satisfactory performance. The School Improvement Act of 1988 required schools to demonstrate higher academic achievement in schoolwide programs under Title I-A, with limited guidance on defining performance. The 1994 Improving America's Schools Act (IASA) introduced outcome accountability through the concept of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for Title I-A schools. States had to develop AYP standards to assess school performance, with consequences for those not meeting the standards. Under the IASA of 1994 and the NCLB of 2001, AYP provisions are based on aggregate measures of academic achievement by pupils, linked to state standards and assessments. The focus is on the percentage of pupils scoring at the \"proficient\" level on state assessments, not a national standard. States were given time to adopt and implement these standards and assessments, with transitional performance standards used initially. Performance standards and assessments are used to measure academic achievement under AYP provisions. The ultimate goal may include specific and demanding criteria for pupil achievement levels to continuously increase over time. AYP standards may focus on reading and math achievement or include additional subject areas. AYP standards may include additional indicators like graduation rates and attendance, applied at various levels such as schools or states, and may require disaggregation of pupil groups for assessment. In programs like Title I-A, it is important to consider disadvantaged pupil groups separately to ensure overall pupil achievement is satisfactory. AYP definitions vary but generally fall into three categories, with the No Child Left Behind Act emphasizing one model and allowing for an alternative. Critics have focused on a third model of AYP, authorized through regulations and waivers, for schools or LEAs. The three basic structural forms for AYP of schools or LEAs are the group status, successive group improvement, and individual growth models. The group status model has a fixed \"annual measurable objective\" (AMO) for all pupil groups, schools, and LEAs statewide. The successive group improvement model focuses on the rate of change in achievement from one year to the next among groups of pupils. The individual growth model in education focuses on tracking the past or projected rate of change in achievement among the same pupils over time. It compares current performance to past performance or projects future performance based on past changes. Results are aggregated by demographic group, school, or other relevant characteristics. Growth models give credit for meeting steps towards proficiency that a status model does not typically provide. The individual growth model in education focuses on tracking the rate of change in achievement among pupils over time, giving credit for meeting steps towards proficiency that a status model does not typically provide. The group status model establishes threshold levels or AMOs for pupils to reach proficiency on state assessments, with a goal of 100% proficiency over a multi-year period. The AMOs in this model are the same for all pupil groups, focusing on current year performance for each grade level at which assessments are administered. The secondary model under NCLB emphasizes improvement from the previous year for each demographic group. The secondary model under NCLB focuses on improvement from the previous year for each demographic group, comparing the performance of pupils in the same grade level with relevant demographic characteristics. The performance of pupils in the same grade level with relevant demographic characteristics may be combined into a cohort for comparison to expected growth standards. Growth models for AYP requirements under NCLB are different from value-added models that incorporate statistical controls. Value-added models use statistical controls to estimate the impact of teachers, schools, or LEAs on pupil achievement and measure pupil growth against predicted growth. The Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) is a specific form of growth model that focuses on estimating the effects of schools, districts, teachers, or programs on pupil achievement. Assessment Participation Rate: Schools must ensure a minimum percentage of pupils participate in assessments to meet AYP standards. Exclusion of Certain Pupils: States may exclude certain groups of pupils when determining AYP requirements. Special provisions may allow exclusion of pupils who attended a school for less than a year in AYP standards. There are also special provisions for LEP pupils or those with significant cognitive disabilities. Statistical manipulation of data, such as averaging test scores over multiple years or using confidence intervals, may be authorized or prohibited in AYP calculations. The implementation of AYP standards under the IASA required states to develop and implement curriculum content standards, pupil performance standards, and assessments linked to these for at least three grade levels in math and reading. This led to varying transitional assessments and pupil performance standards until the enactment of NCLB in 2002. The IASA required states to develop transitional assessments linked to curriculum standards for math and reading. Final AYP standards were to be based on states' final assessments. The ultimate goal was for all pupils to meet proficient and advanced levels of achievement, but most states did not specify a timeline for reaching this goal. AYP standards applied to schools and LEAs, but not to states overall. The IASA required states to develop transitional assessments linked to curriculum standards for math and reading. AYP standards were to be applied to schools and LEAs, with states having the option to apply them only to Title I-A schools and LEAs. Assessments were to include all relevant pupils, with accommodations for LEP students and those with disabilities. State assessments were required to provide disaggregated test results by demographic groups by 2000-2001, but AYP standards did not require such disaggregation. The 1994 statute required state AYP standards to consider all pupils, particularly economically disadvantaged and LEP pupils, without specifying separate AYP definitions for each group. The IASA's provisions for state AYP standards were broad and ambiguous, breaking new conceptual ground but lacking specificity on statistical techniques or structural models. States were mandated to adopt transitional AYP standards based on assessment results but not required to implement final standards immediately. States were not required to adopt \"final\" AYP standards until the 2000-2001 school year. Most consequences, such as reconstituting school staff, were not implemented until the IASA was replaced by NCLB. A compilation by CPRE showed that state AYP definitions in 1999-2000 varied widely and were sometimes complex, with most focusing on achievement test scores and some considering additional factors like dropout rates. State AYP standards were often based on a minimum percentage of proficient students on state tests, relative to statewide averages or previous performance. Some states used factors like initial achievement levels and statewide trends to determine if schools were failing to make expected growth. These standards rarely included a ladder of progress towards a specific goal by a set date. State AYP standards varied across states, with some focusing on specific pupil demographic groups like low-achieving pupils or African American, Hispanic, White, or Economically Disadvantaged students. New Mexico compared school scores to predicted scores based on pupil demographics. A few states, like Texas, had specific focuses on multiple pupil groups. Iowa and New Hampshire had more individualized AYP standards and determinations. States like Iowa and New Hampshire had individualized AYP standards and determinations, with significant variation in the impact on Title I-A schools. In 2002, just before NCLB implementation, ED released data on schools failing to meet AYP standards. In 2001-2002, 8,652 schools were identified as needing improvement nationwide, with varying numbers in different states. The NCLB provisions regarding AYP were seen as an evolution from the 1994 IASA requirements, which were criticized for being insufficiently specific and not focusing on specific disadvantaged pupil groups. Under NCLB, Title I-A requirements for state-developed standards of AYP were expanded to include additional academic indicators like graduation rates. AYP calculations must be disaggregated to focus on specific disadvantaged pupil groups and continuous improvement is required. The NCLB provisions were seen as an improvement from the previous IASA requirements for not focusing on specific disadvantaged pupil groups. Under NCLB, AYP calculations must be disaggregated for specific disadvantaged pupil groups, including economically disadvantaged, LEP, disabilities, and major racial/ethnic groups, as well as all pupils. Test scores for a pupil may be considered multiple times based on their group memberships. There are constraints on considering these groups in AYP calculations, such as when their numbers are too small. The selection of the minimum number of pupils in a group for AYP determinations varies by state, impacting the identification of schools failing to make AYP. States define the major racial and ethnic groups for AYP calculations, and pupils who have not attended the same school for a full year are not considered in school AYP but are included in LEA and state AYP. Under NCLB, AYP standards must be applied to all public schools, LEAs, and states overall if they choose to receive Title I-A grants. Consequences for not meeting AYP standards apply to schools and LEAs in Title I-A. State AYP standards must show progress towards all pupils reaching proficiency by 2013-2014, with Annual Measurable Objectives increasing incrementally over time. The NCLB requires AYP standards to be met by all public schools, LEAs, and states receiving Title I-A grants. AYP standards must show progress towards all pupils reaching proficiency by 2013-2014, with Annual Measurable Objectives increasing incrementally over time. To meet AYP standards, at least 95% of all pupils and each demographic group must participate in assessments. The primary model for AYP under NCLB is a group status model with threshold levels of performance set as AMOs. The NCLB requires schools to meet AYP standards by having threshold levels of performance set as AMOs based on the percentage of proficient or higher scoring pupils in reading and math. These standards must be met by all schools and LEAs for all pupil subgroups to make AYP, regardless of their starting point or previous performance. The uniform bar applies to all pupil subgroups large enough to be considered in AYP determinations, with separate achievement levels for reading and math, and possibly for different grade levels. The \"uniform bar\" sets minimum achievement levels for schools to make AYP, based on the lowest-achieving subgroup or quintile statewide. It must be raised every three years and applies consistent expectations to all pupil groups. The secondary model, \"safe harbor,\" provides a successive group status for AYP under NCLB. The \"safe harbor\" provision is an alternative model under NCLB for schools to still make AYP if they meet certain conditions, such as a 10% decrease in non-proficient pupils and progress on another academic indicator. The NCLB/ESEA statute allows for three models of AYP: \"status,\" \"improvement,\" and \"growth.\" States began determining AYP based on NCLB provisions in the 2002-2003 school year. Individual growth model is not explicitly authorized but has been allowed through waivers and revised regulations. The deadline for states to submit their AYP standards based on NCLB provisions was January 31, 2003, and all states met this deadline. On June 10, 2003, ED announced that accountability plans had been approved for all states, with some plans requiring additional actions. Key aspects of state AYP plans that received special attention included the pace of proficiency level improvements, criteria for identifying schools needing improvement, and the timeframe for improvement. The Secretary of Education announced a growth model pilot program in November 2005, allowing up to 10 states to use growth models for AYP determinations. In December 2007, the cap on states participating in the growth model was lifted. The Secretary lifted the cap on states for the growth model pilot program, with regulations incorporating expanded policies. States must meet specific criteria, including reaching proficiency for all pupils by 2013-2014, reducing achievement gaps, setting goals based on performance standards, and tracking individual student progress. States must also have annual assessments for grades 3-8. The growth model pilot program requires states to have annual assessments for grades 3-8 approved by the Department of Education, in place for at least one year prior to implementation. The peer review guidance emphasizes that growth targets should not consider factors like race, socioeconomic status, or school AYP status. States must establish growth targets based on achievement standards and have a longitudinal pupil data system to track individual student progress. The Department of Education's policies for the growth model pilot program are restrictive, requiring models to align with the goal of all students reaching proficiency by 2013-2014. States must have approved annual assessments for grades 3-8 and one high school year, individualized performance expectations, and a statewide database for student tracking. Models must focus on individual student performance, not demographic groups, although results must be aggregated for NCLB-designated groups. North Carolina and Tennessee were approved to use growth models. Two states, North Carolina and Tennessee, were approved to use growth models for AYP determinations based on 2005-2006 assessments. Thirteen additional states have also been approved for the pilot program. Alaska's growth model includes trajectory towards proficiency within specific timeframes for grades 4-9 and grade 10. Grade 3 students are measured based on status only. In Arizona, the growth model for AYP will apply to pupils in grades 4-8 only. Pupils with disabilities taking alternate assessments will be included in the growth model. AYP in Arkansas will be calculated using both statutory provisions and the state's growth model. A school will meet AYP standards if it qualifies using either method. In Colorado, the growth model for AYP will be applicable to pupils in grades 4-10, excluding those with disabilities taking alternate assessments. Pupils must show growth towards proficiency by the end of 8th grade or grade 10 to be considered proficient. AYP will be calculated annually using both statutory provisions and the state's growth model. In Delaware and Florida, AYP standards are determined using a growth model that tracks individual pupil performance annually. Points are awarded based on changes in performance levels, with the goal for all pupils to achieve proficiency by 2013-2014. Florida's model calculates AYP separately for each pupil subgroup in each school or LEA. Florida's growth model for AYP standards tracks individual pupil performance annually, with proficient pupils including those currently scoring at a proficient level or on a path toward proficiency within three years. The Iowa model categorizes test score ranges below proficient into Hi Marginal, Lo Marginal, and Weak, with students moving up a level deemed to have met Adequate Yearly Growth (AYG). In Michigan, students must reach proficiency within specific time frames based on their initial performance levels. By 2014, all students are expected to achieve proficiency or higher, as the growth model will no longer be used. Proficiency is determined by achievement test scores at a proficient or advanced level, or within two standard errors of measurement of the proficiency cut point. The growth model in Michigan categorizes students as proficient, provisionally proficient, or on trajectory toward proficiency based on their test scores. Students on trajectory toward proficiency show improvement that would lead to proficiency within three years. This model does not apply to high school students. In Minnesota, AYP determinations will be made using both statutory models and a growth model. The growth model includes a \"value table\" for giving partial credit based on achievement growth. Results will be converted to a scale to determine if AMOs have been met. All grade levels and students with disabilities taking alternate assessments will be included in the calculations. In Missouri, students' current scores are considered. In Missouri, students scoring below proficient level will be evaluated for proficiency within four years or by 8th grade. Confidence intervals are not applied to growth model calculations. AYP determinations for grades 9-12 will use current status and safe harbor models. Students with disabilities will be included in the growth model, using trajectories from regular or alternate assessments. North Carolina adds a projection component to the group status model. Ohio's policy includes a projection component in the group status model for non-proficient pupils in grades 3 through 8. If students are on track to proficiency within four years, they are moved to the proficient group. This approach is similar to models used in North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Florida. If any pupil group fails to meet AYP after standard models are applied, a determination is made based on the proportion of students on track to meet proficiency by a target grade. Target grades are determined based on the highest grade offered by the school or four grades beyond the current grade. Pennsylvania and Tennessee have policies in place for determining proficiency levels of students. Pennsylvania uses a growth model to project proficiency levels within one to three years, while Tennessee offers two options for meeting AYP standards. If students are projected to be below proficient, they will not be considered proficient. In Tennessee and Texas, projection models are used to determine student proficiency levels. The projection model predicts if students will achieve proficiency in the future based on past performance. High schools in Tennessee are exempt from this model. Texas adds a projection component to the current group status model, where non-proficient students projected to reach proficiency by certain grades are included in the proficient group. Projections are based on current year scores and mean scores in reading or math for the school attended. The growth model for student proficiency levels is applied to pupils taking state assessments, including those with cognitive disabilities. Most approved models aim to increase the number of proficient students by including those projected to reach proficiency within a few years. States like North Carolina, Arkansas, Florida, Alaska, Arizona, Missouri, Michigan, and Texas combine currently proficient students with non-proficient students on track to proficiency. The growth model for student proficiency levels is applied to state assessments, including students with cognitive disabilities. Some states combine currently proficient students with those projected to reach proficiency soon. Different states have varying approaches to awarding credit for movement among achievement categories. A 2009 evaluation report by ED focuses on North Carolina and Tennessee's minimal impact on AYP determinations using growth models. Tennessee achieved AYP using the growth model, which differed from methods authorized in the ESEA. New regulations published in 2008 addressed Title I-A assessment, AYP, and accountability policies. These regulations clarified existing policies and required states to provide detailed rationale for group size and confidence interval selection in their AYP policies. The regulations published in 2008 require states to explain how their policies provide reliable information for AYP determinations while minimizing exclusion of designated pupil groups. States must report on the number of excluded pupils and submit Accountability Workbooks for peer review. The National Technical Advisory Council advises the Secretary on technical aspects of state standards and assessments. The Secretary of Education announced that a new round of peer reviews for state Accountability Workbooks would not be conducted. Regulations allow for multiple formats of assessments under Title I-A, but not the inclusion of \"multiple measures\" beyond standards-based assessments in reading, math, and science. States must include results from the most recent National Assessment of. The Secretary of Education announced changes in policies regarding state Accountability Workbooks and assessments under Title I-A. States are required to include NAEP assessment results in their performance report cards. Policies for states to request waivers for using growth models of AYP are now codified. Graduation rate policies for high schools have been revised, including disaggregation by pupil group. States must determine adequate improvement rates for AYP purposes. Under the October 2008 regulations, states must adopt a uniform method for calculating graduation rates, endorsed by the National Governors Association. The graduation rate is defined as the number of students who graduate from high school in four years divided by the number of students in the cohort for the students' class, adjusted for student transfers among schools. States may propose using a supplementary extended-year graduation rate in addition to the four-year rate. The NCLB requires states to use a supplementary extended-year graduation rate for certain students, like those with disabilities, who may need more than four years to graduate. States must set a goal for graduation rates and have annual targets approved by the ED. Notably, changes in the AYP policy address pupils with disabilities, with regulations clarifying the application of standards and assessments to these students. The regulations clarify the use of alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards for pupils with significant cognitive disabilities. States and LEAs can adopt these assessments for a limited percentage of students with disabilities, with a maximum of 1.0% at the state and LEA level. SEAs can request exceptions to exceed the 1.0% cap statewide, and may grant exceptions to LEAs. In 2003-2005, some states received waivers to exceed the 1.0% cap on alternate assessments for students with disabilities. A new ED policy in 2007 focused on pupils with disabilities with higher academic abilities. The 2007 ED policy focused on pupils with disabilities who have higher academic abilities, allowing states to assess them using alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards. Schools in eligible states could include a certain percentage of these pupils in their proficient group to meet AYP requirements. The 2007 ED policy allows schools and LEAs to count proficient scores for pupils with disabilities on modified achievement standards assessments, with a 2.0% cap at the LEA and state levels. These regulations affect a group of pupils with disabilities who are unlikely to achieve grade level proficiency within the current school year. States can develop modified academic achievement standards and alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities. The modified standards must align with grade-level content but may have reduced breadth or depth. There is no direct limit on the number of pupils taking alternate assessments, but proficient scores on these assessments can only count for up to 2.0% of all pupils tested at the state or LEA level for AYP determinations. The 2.0% cap for proficient scores on alternate assessments for pupils with disabilities does not apply to individual schools but at the state or LEA level. States cannot exceed the 2.0% cap if they have not reached the 1.0% limit for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Proficient scores on alternate assessments cannot exceed 3.0% of all pupils tested at the state or LEA level. States are no longer allowed to request a waiver for the 1.0% cap for pupils with significant cognitive disabilities. The regulations in 2007 include provisions for AYP determinations, such as using the highest score for pupils who take tests multiple times and including former pupils with disabilities' scores in the disability subgroup for up to two years. There are now five groups of pupils with disabilities with respect to achievement standards and assessments. On March 29, 2004, ED announced schools could meet the 95% participation requirement by averaging rates over the last two or three years. Schools can exclude pupils with a \"significant medical emergency\" from participation rate calculations and allow make-up tests for missed primary assessment dates. The Education Department announced new policies regarding LEP pupils, stating that those who have been in U.S. schools for less than 10 months must participate in English and math tests, with optional participation in reading tests and AYP calculations. This aims to address schools failing to make AYP based on assessment participation rates alone. The Education Department's new policies make test participation for LEP pupils optional in AYP calculations. Formerly LEP pupils can be excluded from AYP counts after two years of English proficiency, potentially boosting average test scores. The Education Department's new policies provide flexibility in AYP determinations for targeted assistance schools under Title I-A, allowing schools to focus on individual pupils with low academic achievement. Most Title I-A programs are in targeted assistance schools, but schoolwide programs are growing. This policy letter allows schools and LEAs to consider only Title I-A assisted pupils for AYP determinations. The Education Department's new policy allows targeted assistance schools under Title I-A to focus on individual pupils with low academic achievement for AYP determinations. This flexibility may result in pupil demographic groups being below the minimum size for consideration. Interest in waiving some NCLB assessments was expressed after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Education Department's new policy offers flexibility for schools affected by natural disasters to postpone accountability requirements without specific waivers. This includes delaying school improvement designations and consequences for schools failing to meet AYP standards in disaster areas. Waivers may also be considered for heavily affected schools enrolling large numbers of students. The Education Department's new policy allows for flexibility in accountability requirements for schools affected by natural disasters, including postponing school improvement designations and consequences for failing to meet AYP standards. Waivers could be considered for schools enrolling large numbers of evacuee pupils, with a separate subgroup established for displaced students in AYP determinations based on assessments from the 2005-2006 school year. States have proposed revisions to their accountability plans since 2003. Proposed changes in state accountability plans since 2003 have aimed at increasing flexibility, potentially reducing the number of schools failing to make AYP. Concerns have been raised about transparency and consistency in the approval of these changes by ED officials, leading to debates over whether the accountability requirements are being made more reasonable or weakened. Proposed changes in state accountability plans since 2003 aim to increase flexibility and potentially reduce the number of schools failing to make AYP. Concerns have been raised about transparency and consistency in the approval of these changes by ED officials, leading to debates over whether the accountability requirements are being made more reasonable or weakened. Major aspects of the proposed changes include revisions in federal regulations and policy guidance for assessing students with disabilities and limited identification for improvement to schools and LEAs that fail to meet AYP for consecutive years. Alternative methods for determining AYP for schools with low enrollment and the use of confidence intervals are also being considered. Proposed changes in state accountability plans since 2003 aim to increase flexibility and potentially reduce the number of schools failing to make AYP. Changes include using confidence intervals in AYP determinations, adjusting minimum group sizes, and altering graduation rate targets for high schools. Some requested changes, like identifying schools for improvement only after consecutive AYP failures, have not been approved by ED. Recent state AYP data reports focus on schools failing AYP versus those identified for improvement due to AYP failures. The percentage of public schools failing to make adequate yearly progress varied widely among states for the 2007-2008 school year, ranging from 7% to 80%. Nationwide, 35% of public schools failed to make AYP, an increase from previous years. The 2009 ED report on Title I implementation found that 35% of schools failing to make AYP did so due to achievement in reading or math for the \"all pupils\" group. Additionally, 24% failed based on one subgroup, and 20% failed based on two or more subgroups. The remaining 21% failed due to test participation rates, \"other academic indicator,\" or other combinations of AYP criteria. In 2005-2006, the percentage of schools failing to meet AYP varied among different student groups: 2% for Asian pupils, 3% for White pupils, 18% for low-income families, 20% for Hispanic pupils, 25% for African-American pupils, 30% for LEP pupils, and 43% for pupils with disabilities. In 2007-2008, 41% of middle schools, 34% of high schools, and 19% of elementary schools failed to make AYP. In 2008-2009, 12,599 schools were identified for improvement, constituting approximately 13% of all public schools. The percentage of schools failing to meet AYP varied widely among states, reflecting a high degree of state variation. This variation is based on differences in achievement levels, rigor of state performance standards, and state-determined standards for demographic groups. Larger minimum sizes for demographic groups reduce the likelihood of disadvantaged groups being considered for AYP determinations. Approximately 35% of LEAs failed to meet AYP standards for the 2007-2008 school year. States like Alabama and Wisconsin had only 1% of LEAs failing, while South Carolina and Hawaii had 100% failure rates. The challenge lies in developing and implementing challenging performance measures for schools, LEAs, and states. The AYP provisions of NCLB aim to establish challenging performance measures for schools, LEAs, and states, while also allowing flexibility to accommodate various conditions. Critics are concerned about the complexity and criticism generated by these provisions. The NCLB's AYP provisions aim to set challenging performance measures for schools, LEAs, and states. Critics worry that dispersing resources among many schools may render efforts ineffective. The report discusses specific aspects of NCLB's AYP provisions that have sparked debate, including ultimate goals, confidence intervals, population diversity effects, and more. The report focuses on issues in implementing NCLB provisions on AYP, including the incorporation of an ultimate goal for all pupils to reach proficiency within 12 years. This requirement drives states to set annual increases in expected achievement levels, unlike previous legislation. Setting an ultimate goal for all pupils to reach proficiency within a specified period may face criticism for being unrealistic. However, proponents argue that clear, challenging goals can be met if schools are provided with attainable targets and clear expectations, unlike the vague and undemanding goals of the pre-NCLB era. The performance goals under NCLB were often vague, undemanding, and poorly communicated, with few consequences for failure. Setting deadlines for all pupils to achieve proficiency created incentives for states to lower performance standards. Many states have a minority of pupils achieving proficiency in reading and math. Many states are struggling to meet the 100% proficiency goal for all pupils under NCLB's AYP provisions. Some states have started lowering proficiency standards by redefining \"basic\" or \"partially proficient\" as \"proficient\" levels. Colorado, for example, considers students at both \"proficient\" and \"partially proficient\" levels as \"proficient\" in its accountability plan approved by ED. Some states are redefining \"basic\" or \"partially proficient\" levels as \"proficient\" to meet NCLB's AYP provisions. Colorado and Louisiana have raised their proficiency standards, arguing that their basic levels are already high compared to other states. This approach may spark ongoing debate within the education community. Some states are adjusting their AYP standards by \"backloading\" requirements for rapid improvements in performance towards the end of the 12-year period. This is done to meet NCLB's ultimate AYP goal, as it is unlikely for many states or schools with diverse student populations to achieve it without lowering standards or using statistical techniques to narrow the range of pupil groups considered. Some states are \"backloading\" requirements for rapid improvements in performance towards the end of the 12-year period to meet NCLB's ultimate AYP goal. This involves incremental increases in performance levels, with some states postponing required increases until NCLB provisions are reconsidered by Congress. Many states are using statistical techniques to improve the validity and reliability of AYP determinations. Many states are using statistical techniques to enhance the validity and reliability of AYP determinations, such as averaging test scores over two- or three-year periods and using confidence intervals. This can unintentionally reduce the number of schools or LEAs identified as failing to meet AYP standards. Confidence intervals are used in some states to determine minimum group size and assess whether achievement scores are statistically significant. They provide a window around a threshold test score level to evaluate pupils' actual level of achievement. The size of the window for determining achievement levels varies based on the number of pupils tested and desired level of confidence. Test results are considered estimates of true achievement levels, similar to margin of error in opinion polls, with a confidence level typically set at 95%. The probability level for test scores is typically set at 95%, but can range from 90% to 99%. It ensures that the true achievement level for a group of pupils falls within the confidence interval above and below the average score. The size of the window depends on the pupil group size and desired level of probability. For example, if a school's threshold percentage for proficient reading is 40%, without confidence intervals, it would fail to meet AYP if average scores are below 40%. When determining if a school meets AYP, using confidence intervals helps establish a range of scores around the threshold percentage. This range varies based on pupil group size and desired probability level (95% or 99%). A school fails to make AYP if the average score falls below the lowest score in the range. Confidence intervals improve the validity of AYP determinations by accounting for score variations within pupil groups. The use of confidence intervals in determining AYP helps account for score variations within pupil groups, reducing the likelihood of schools being identified as failing to make AYP. For small pupil groups and high accuracy levels, confidence intervals may be relatively large. This technique may result in schools meeting AYP standards even if average achievement levels are below 100% proficiency. NCLB also considers the minimum size of pupil groups for AYP calculations. The minimum size (n) for pupil groups in AYP calculations varies among states, ranging from as few as five to as many as 200 pupils. Some states rely on confidence intervals to establish reliability of test results instead of setting a specific level for \"n.\" Some states set higher minimum group sizes for pupils with disabilities or LEP pupils in AYP determinations to reduce the likelihood of schools failing to meet AYP standards. If a pupil group falls below the minimum size at the school level, it is still considered at the LEA level. Scores are often reported for pupil groups not separately considered in AYP calculations. The NCLB requirement for disaggregation of pupil achievement results in AYP standards raises issues such as the establishment of minimum group sizes and the varying levels set for different pupil groups by states. This can lead to certain disadvantaged groups not being considered in AYP calculations. The NCLB requirement for disaggregation of pupil achievement results in AYP standards raises concerns about defining pupil groups like LEP pupils and major racial/ethnic groups at state discretion. There are worries about identifying LEP pupils narrowly and bringing them to proficient levels if they no longer need special language services. Some states include LEP pupils for a period after they no longer need services to address this issue. The ED has issued policy guidance for states to include LEP pupils in AYP calculations for up to two years after mainstreaming. States have discretion in defining \"major racial and ethnic groups,\" leading to varied definitions across states. The narrow interpretation of pupil groups in some states may reduce attention on excluded groups and simplify AYP thresholds for schools. However, the relationship between pupil diversity and meeting AYP standards poses challenges, as diverse populations may face more thresholds to meet. This unintended consequence of NCLB legislation complicates the ability of schools and LEAs serving diverse populations to achieve AYP standards. The unintended consequence of NCLB legislation analyzed by Kane and Staiger found that subgroup targets unfairly penalize schools with large minority populations. Despite the intention to improve achievement among minority students, there is no evidence that subgroup targets lead to improved test scores. The percentage of schools failing to make AYP increases with the number of subgroups, ranging from 7% to 43-51%. The NCLB legislation's subgroup targets penalize schools with large minority populations, with failure rates ranging from 7% to 43-51% based on the number of subgroups. Without specific requirements for achievement gains by major pupil groups, attention may not be given to disadvantaged pupils who need improvement the most under the Title I-A program. Previous AYP standards focused on overall pupil performance, potentially allowing schools to show overall improvement without significant gains for disadvantaged pupils. Under the NCLB legislation, schools with large minority populations face penalties for not meeting subgroup targets, with failure rates varying based on the number of subgroups. Concerns have been raised about disadvantaged pupils not receiving adequate attention under the Title I-A program. A possible alternative to current policy suggests counting each student once in AYP calculations, with equal fractions for each demographic category. In 2007-2008, 35% of public schools nationwide failed to meet AYP standards. Approximately 35% of public schools nationwide failed to make AYP in 2007-2008, with around 13% identified as needing improvement for not meeting AYP standards for two or more consecutive years. The Education Department officials stress the importance of addressing underperforming schools, offering flexibility in consequences for those that fail to meet AYP. Many schools reported as failing to meet AYP did so for only one year, while NCLB mandates action for improvement. Some analysts argue that a high percentage of public schools failing to meet AYP standards reflects widespread weaknesses in the system, especially for disadvantaged student groups. They see this as a positive sign of the rigor in NCLB's requirements, motivating schools to improve. However, others are concerned about the accuracy and effectiveness of an accountability system where so many schools are identified as failing. Some analysts argue that a high percentage of public schools failing to meet AYP standards reflects widespread weaknesses in the system, especially for disadvantaged student groups. Concerns have been raised about the strain on resources to provide necessary assistance and consequences for schools not meeting AYP. The proportion of schools failing to meet AYP standards varies widely among states, leading to doubts about the effectiveness of the accountability system. The percentage of public schools failing to meet AYP standards varies widely among states, ranging from 7% to 80%. State variations are influenced by differences in achievement levels, technical factors in state AYP provisions, and the rigor of state pupil performance standards and assessments. The variation in state pupil performance standards and assessments can be illustrated by comparing NAEP scores with state assessments. Achieve, Inc. conducted a comparison based on 8th-grade reading and math assessments in 2003, showing that the percentage of proficient students on state assessments was generally higher than on NAEP tests. The comparison between state pupil performance standards and NAEP tests showed that in some states, the percentage of proficient students on state assessments was lower than on NAEP, indicating a more rigorous state standard. The relationship between the two varied widely, with some states having only marginally higher proficiency levels on state assessments, while others had more than twice as many students at the proficient level on state assessments compared to NAEP. Statistics compared state proficiency standards in reading and math at 4th and 8th grade levels to NAEP scales for the 2004-2005 school year. State standards were generally lower than NAEP, with some states setting proficiency levels even below NAEP's basic level. There were concerns that states might lower their standards to meet NCLB goals. The NCLB goal of all pupils reaching proficient levels by 2013-2014 would increase proficiency percentages and reduce schools failing AYP standards in affected states. Despite more consistent AYP definitions, significant variations remain in factors like group size and confidence intervals, with differences in state standards and assessments still present. The challenge of meeting state standards and assessments remains, with factors influencing schools failing to make AYP including rigor in standards, group size in determinations, confidence intervals, diversity in population, communication about test participation, and educational quality. Low participation rates in assessments have led to many schools failing to meet AYP. The high rate of assessment participation required for schools to meet AYP standards is a focus of debate. While the current participation rate is 95%, some argue it may not need to be that high. Attendance rates in schools serving disadvantaged pupils are lower, and schools can administer assessments on make-up days. Increased interest in growth models for determining AYP under NCLB due to difficulty in meeting 95% test participation requirement. Proponents see growth models as fairer and more accurate than status or improvement models, as they consider varying achievement levels of pupil groups. Different schools and pupils have varying starting points in achievement levels, recognizing progress made at all levels. Growth models attribute pupil achievement to their current school, measuring the effect of schools on specific pupils over years. They focus on the effectiveness of schools and teachers with pupils taught for multiple years. Growth models in education focus on measuring the impact of schools and teachers on student achievement over multiple years, adjusting for non-school influences and reducing errors due to student mobility. Proponents argue that status models of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) hold schools accountable for factors beyond their control and do not adequately emphasize pupil achievement gains. Status models may create incentives for schools to focus on students just below proficient levels. The current status model of AYP focuses on bringing pupils above a proficient level of achievement, without giving credit for achievement increases beyond proficient. Growth models of AYP set lower expectations for some pupil groups and schools, allowing disadvantaged schools to remain at low levels of achievement for extended periods. The growth models of AYP may not directly address the accountability purposes of NCLB as clearly as status or improvement models. Pupil mobility among schools and LEAs is significant and has implications for all AYP models, but these implications do not necessarily favor a specific model. Growth models attempt to track pupils through longitudinal data systems, but they may attribute the achievement of highly mobile pupils among various schools. The presence of highly mobile pupils in determining AYP under status and improvement models may seem unfair to school staff, but NCLB limits their impact by excluding pupils who have attended a school for less than one year. Growth models of AYP are more demanding in terms of data requirements and analytical capacity, requiring states to have pupil data systems with specific features. The availability of information on state data systems is insufficient to determine how many states could implement growth models for student assessment. Resources and data systems needed for growth models may be lacking in some states, but an ED program is helping states develop longitudinal data systems with an initial appropriation of $24.8 million for FY2005. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) received appropriations for FY2005, FY2006, FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, with additional funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Longitudinal data systems for education are a priority for state participation in funding programs like the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and the \"Race to the Top\" grant competition. 41 states have received awards through this program, providing aid to state educational agencies (SEAs) for developing statewide data systems. The program aims to help SEAs develop statewide data systems to manage student data efficiently. States with limited data capabilities will receive priority. The program assists SEAs in meeting NCLB requirements and conducting value-added research. Emphasis is placed on data sharing while ensuring data security and privacy. Non-NCLB growth models focus on different types of growth targets, such as data-driven or policy-driven targets. Models approved under ED's growth model pilot meet the ultimate goal requirement, but some only require proficiency by 2013-2014."
