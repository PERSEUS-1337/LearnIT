Prosecutions under this act can be brought in the district where the official proceeding was intended to be affected or where the alleged offense occurred. The United States Sentencing Commission will amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to enhance the guideline range for Obstruction of Justice, including increasing levels for specific actions such as threatening individuals, accepting bribes, destroying documents on a computer, and causing substantial interference with the administration of justice."
