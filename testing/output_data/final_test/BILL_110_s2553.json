    "content": "The \"Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008\" is the short title of this Act. It provides economic stimulus for small business concerns. For fiscal year 2008, the Administrator will collect reduced fees for loans made to small businesses under the Small Business Act. The fees will be .25 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan's deferred participation share and a guarantee fee for each guaranteed loan. The Administrator will collect reduced fees for small business loans based on the loan amount: 1% for loans up to $150,000, 2.5% for loans between $150,000 and $700,000, and 3% for loans over $700,000. No fee will be collected in place of the usual fee under section 7(a)(18)(A)(iv) of the Small Business Act. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, appropriations include $150,000,000 for loan subsidies and modifications for small businesses, $2,000,000 for direct loans under the Microloan Program, and $10,000,000 for marketing expenses. The Administration's account for marketing, management, and technical assistance under the Small Business Act by intermediaries making microloans under the Microloan Program is designated as an emergency requirement. Loans and financings made or approved by the Administration in fiscal year 2008 will be treated as separate programs for budgetary purposes under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The Small Business Administration and Administrator are defined in this section. The term \"small business concern\" has the same meaning as in the Small Business Act. SEC. 3. INCREASED EXPENSING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. Amends section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code to increase expensing limits for taxable years beginning in 2008. SEC. 4. CARRYBACK OF CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES ALLOWED FOR 5 YEARS; TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF 90 PERCENT AMT LIMIT. Allows carryback of net operating losses for 5 years and temporarily suspends the 90 percent AMT limit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a 5-year carryback of certain losses and temporarily suspend the 90 percent limit on certain NOL carrybacks for taxable years ending after December 31, 2006. For taxable years ending in 2007 or 2008, elections under sections 172(b)(3) and 172(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 can be revoked or made before November 1, 2008, respectively."
