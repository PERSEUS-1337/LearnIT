    "content": "President Clinton signed H.R. 4112, the FY1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, into law on October 21, 1998, with a $2.350 billion budget, a 2.7% increase from the previous year. An omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations bill was also signed, providing $223.7 million for legislative branch activities, including Year-2000 conversion expenses, enhanced security, and Capitol Visitor Center construction. The House passed H.R. 4112 with a $1.8 billion budget, a 1.68% increase from the previous year. The Senate later passed its version with a $1.6 billion budget, a 3.5% increase. Conferees approved a final bill on October 18, and the House Appropriations Committee issued the conference report on October 22. In October, the House and Senate approved an FY1998 supplemental appropriations bill providing funds for Capitol security and dome repairs. The legislative branch appropriations bill has been divided into two titles since the late 1970s. Title I of the Legislative Branch Appropriation Act includes budgets for the Budget Office, Architect of the Capitol, Congressional Research Service, and Government Printing Office. Title II covers activities like the Botanic Garden, Library of Congress, Government Printing Office, and General Accounting Office. In FY1998, Title I had 70% of the total appropriation, while Title II had 30%. The Legislative Branch Appropriation Act includes various budget authorities, such as permanent, trust fund, and other budget authorities. Trust funds are not considered budget authority and are not included in the annual legislative branch bill. Non-legislative entities within the legislative branch are also shown in the Budget. The FY1999 Budget for legislative activities funded in the legislative branch appropriations bill was initially proposed at $2.263 billion by President Clinton, but was later amended to $2.467 billion by individual legislative branch agencies, representing a 9.7% increase over the previous year's appropriation. The proposed FY1999 budget for the legislative branch included an additional 122 FTE staff positions, with a 0.5% increase in the number of FTEs. The Senate passed a bill with $1.6 billion in funding, a 3.5% increase over the previous year's appropriation. The FY1999 budget for the legislative branch saw a $53.7 million increase over the FY1998 budget, totaling $1.59 billion. Additional funds were allocated for employee cost-of-living adjustments. The Senate also approved amendments including increased funding for Capitol Police and creating a separate subaccount for the Committee on Appropriations. The Senate passed amendments to the FY1999 budget for the legislative branch, including provisions for salaries, officers, and employees, establishing a Trade Deficit Review Commission, and requiring officials to submit lists of activities for FY2000. Cloture was invoked on H.R. 4112, with an amendment to make Congressional Research Service reports available online ruled out of order. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 2137 on June 5. On June 25, the House passed H.R. 4112, providing $1.8 billion, a 1.68% increase from FY1998. The bill included staff reductions, staff buy-outs, and a 6.7% decrease from the FY1999 budget request. The House passed H.R. 4112, providing $1.8 billion, a 1.68% increase from FY1998. It included staff reductions, buy-outs, and was $555.3 million below the 302(b) allocation. Amendments included funding for House waste recycling programs and an energy conservation plan. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 4112 on June 23. Three amendments were adopted in the full committee markup on June 18 without requiring new funds. These included language emphasizing the impartiality of the Congressional Budget Office, authorizing monthly transportation subsidies for employees, and encouraging artwork in the Capitol to better represent women's contributions. In the Conference Committee on September 18, 1998, a $2.350 million budget was agreed upon, a 2.7% increase over FY1998. Notable agreements included a 12.2% funding increase for the U.S. Capitol Police. The FY1999 budget increased to $83.1 million, including funds for 1,251 FTEs, pay parity, and program changes for the General Accounting Office. Conferees allocated funds for IT work related to the Year 2000 computing crisis and directed the comptroller general to oversee the use of additional funds for program contract support. The FY1998 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 3579, provided funds for perimeter security and repairs on the Capitol dome. It also included gratuities for widows and heirs of deceased House Members, bringing the total appropriation for FY1998 legislative branch activities to $2.288 billion. Additionally, the FY1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill was signed into law, addressing IT work related to the Year 2000 computing crisis and program contract support oversight. The omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 105-277) allocated $223.7 million for legislative branch activities, including $16.9 million for Year-2000 IT conversion expenses. It also provided $106.8 million for security enhancements and $100 million for a Capitol Visitor Center. Key issues included ensuring Congress's computers were Year-2000 compliant and U.S. Capitol Police pay. Key issues for Congress include making computers Year-2000 compliant, determining U.S. Capitol Police pay, increasing funding for security enhancements, appropriating funds for Capitol improvements, technology development, and funding levels for congressional support agencies. During consideration of the FY1999 budget in the House and Senate Subcommittees on Legislative Branch Appropriations, Chairman Walsh and Chairman Bennett highlighted the need for budget reductions and responsible spending by the legislative branch. Chairman Walsh emphasized careful scrutiny of agency funding requests, while Chairman Bennett noted that cuts in requests were likely to ensure fiscal responsibility. Chairman Bennett emphasized the top priority of ensuring Congress and its support agencies reprogram their computers for Year-2000 compliance. Capitol Hill security was also listed as a priority. Funding options for legislative agencies included maintaining a flat budget, a modest increase, or a budget decrease. Both House and Senate bills for FY1999 contained modest increases, with the Senate bill providing a 3.4% increase (1.2% when adjusted for inflation) and the House bill providing a 1.68% increase. The FY1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill provides for a 2.7% increase over FY1998, with a +0.5% increase when adjusted for inflation. The legislative branch budget is 0.15% of the total federal budget. A \"flat\" budget denies additional funding requests but can be challenging due to ongoing maintenance needs and technology updates. Both House and Senate bills allowed for modest increases in FY1999, similar to FY1998. The FY1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill provides for a 2.7% increase over FY1998, with a +0.5% increase when adjusted for inflation. The increase is smaller when accounting for inflation, or +0.5%. Conferees on the FY1998 bill compromised with the Senate version that provided for a 3.5% increase and the House version that provided for a 0.6% reduction. The FY1999 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill initially appeared to have a 1.68% increase over FY1998, but when adjusted for inflation, it was actually a reduction of 0.52%. The House bill contained a slight increase from $1.775 billion to $1.805 billion, but when adjusted for inflation, it decreased from $1.814 billion to $1.805 billion. The FY1999 conference version saw a small increase from $2.288 billion to $2.350 billion, which was only a 0.5% increase when adjusted for inflation. Congress has approved budget decreases in recent years, with the FY1996 bill showing an 8.2% decrease from the FY1995 budget. The FY1997 budget saw a 0.87% increase from $2.184 billion to $2.203 billion, but when adjusted for inflation, it was a 1.4% decrease. The FY1998 budget had a 2.1% increase to $2.249 billion, but after inflation, it was a 0.1% decrease. Congress worked towards computer reprogramming for the Year 2000 to avoid data errors. The conferees allocated additional funding for GAO program changes, including appropriations for 50 FTEs, with a focus on supporting information technology work related to the Year 2000 computing crisis. Congress also provided an emergency supplemental of $16.9 million for Year-2000 compliance efforts in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277). The FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277) allocated funds for various legislative branch entities, including $5.5 million for the Senate, $6.4 million for the House of Representatives, and $5 million for GAO. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that it would cost $2.3 billion for necessary adjustments, as stated by Representative Steve Horn. Representative Steve Horn believes the estimated $2.3 billion for Year-2000 adjustments is underestimated, as it may not include all labor costs for computer programmers. The House of Representatives alone is estimated to spend between $1.2 million and $3.6 million on Year-2000 compliance. Chairman Robert Bennett emphasized the importance of addressing the Year-2000 issue in the Senate Subcommittee on Legislative Branch Appropriations. Chairman Bennett, along with others in the Senate, has discussed the ramifications of the Year-2000 problem and possible solutions in multiple hearings. He emphasized the need for the legislative branch to be as aggressive with its compliance program as the executive branch. A special congressional committee, chaired by Senator Bennett, has been created to oversee Year-2000 conversion efforts in the executive and judicial branches. The committee will hold hearings on federal agencies' progress in achieving Year-2000 compliance, with a budget of $575,000 through February 29, 2000. The Senate and House have established task forces to address the Year-2000 problem, with a focus on legislative tracking systems and computer reprogramming. Both chambers are developing information systems to manage legislative data files, with the House Clerk overseeing the House's legislative information system. The House and Senate legislative information systems are overseen by the House Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate, respectively. They exchange information and report to their respective oversight committees. The Congressional Research Service, with support from the Library of Congress, is developing a data retrieval system for both houses. The systems aim to reduce duplication by consolidating legislative data. The House is developing a document management system to reduce dependency on the Government Printing Office for document preparation and distribution. The system aims to automate document preparation and improve document management within the House. The House is developing a document management system (DMS) to automate document preparation and distribution, aiming to save approximately $1 million annually in administrative and printing costs. The system is designed to improve document management within the House and reduce dependency on the Government Printing Office. The FY1998 legislative branch appropriations bill directed the Congressional Research Service and the Library of Congress to improve functionality and productivity in legislative information retrieval. The FY1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of the Senate to develop a legislative information system for the Senate, funded by unspent FY1995 monies. The system allows for creating, tracking, editing, sharing, and transmitting documents. The FY1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act provided additional funding for the development of the Senate financial management system. The act authorized a transfer of $5 million to the \"Contingent Expenses of the Senate\" account, with funds available until September 30, 2000. The Senate Committee on Appropriations must approve the transfer. The FY1999 Senate report also directed the development of a legislative retrieval system for the Senate. Anticipated expenses for increased Internet usage in Congress are expected due to the rise in constituent communications. Despite the costs of technology advancement, some savings have been achieved through the replacement of an IBM mainframe and installation of a more reliable storage system. H.R. 4112 provides $109.1 million for House committee funding in FY1999, with a resolution authorizing $178.3 million for House committees (except Appropriations Committee) being defeated on the floor. An interim funding authorization was agreed upon through May 2, 1997. The House agreed to an interim funding authorization through May 2, 1997, to prevent the expiration of existing funding. The resolution authorized funds for the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight for the entire 105th Congress, with a budget of $20 million. A new committee funding resolution was ordered reported, authorizing $177.8 million for committees (except Government Reform and Oversight and Appropriations) for the 105th Congress. This resolution was approved by the House on May 1, 1997, with a vote of 262-157. The House agreed to a new resolution on May 1, 1997, authorizing $18.3 million for FY1998 and $19.4 million for FY1999 in H.R. 4112. The Senate also approved $66.8 million for Senate committee operations in FY1999, with additional funds allocated for a special investigation related to the 1996 elections. The Joint Committee on Printing will be terminated by December 31, 1998, with its responsibilities transferred to other committees. $352,000 was allocated for the committee until its termination, with $150,000 available for the Committee on House Oversight if its responsibilities are transferred by law. The Senate provided $150,000 in additional funds to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for assuming responsibilities of the joint committee. This funding is part of the FY1999 budget for Senate committee expenses. The Architect of the Capitol requested $20 million for a security plan for the Capitol complex, which was approved by Congress in an FY1998 supplemental appropriations bill. The Capitol Square Perimeter Security Plan was funded with $20 million from H.R. 3579, signed into law on May 1, 1998. $4 million was allocated to the Capitol Police Board for security measures. The appropriation was based on recommendations from a task force on perimeter security for the U.S. Capitol Police Board. The Capitol Police Board requested funds for security system design and installation as part of the perimeter plan for Capitol Square. Approval for funds for perimeter security of Senate office buildings and Capitol Square is required from various committees. The perimeter security plan for the Capitol Building and grounds was approved by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration in 1997. The Rules Committee approved a plan for perimeter security near Senate office buildings. The House Oversight Committee would approve plans for House office buildings, while the House Appropriations Committee would determine funds needed. A 12.2% funding increase for the U.S. Capitol Police was agreed upon, including adjustments for pay parity and longevity schedule. An additional $106.8 million for security was included in the FY1999 emergency supplemental. The FY1999 emergency supplemental (P.L. 105-277) provided $106.8 million for security enhancements for the Capitol Police Board, with the Senate version allocating $80.6 million, reflecting an 8.8% increase over FY1998. Conferees agreed on a funding level for 1,251 FTEs, with the House proposing 1,247 FTEs. The number of authorized FTE positions is currently 1,247. The Senate adopted an amendment increasing the appropriation for Capitol Police expenses by $220,000. Congress approved $100 million for the Capitol Visitor Center's planning and construction, with private funds supplementing the project. The estimated cost of the center is $125 million, aimed at providing security and convenience for visitors and Capitol personnel. The appropriation for the Capitol Visitor Center's planning and construction was approved after nearly a decade of discussions. Planning began in 1991, with hearings held in 1997 and 1998 regarding the center's security and funding. The House and Senate consider separate budget requests for the Architect of the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) requested $221.9 million in Title I funding for Congress, including $87.5 million for 228 projects in a 5-year capital improvement program. This request included funds for projects by congressional agencies like the Capitol police and Library of Congress, with major expenses for perimeter security and repairs to the Capitol dome. In April 1998, funds were approved for the Capitol dome repairs and perimeter security project in H.R. 3579 as part of an FY1998 supplemental appropriations bill. The Senate approved $142.6 million for the AOC, a decrease from the FY1998 appropriation. Senate report language required a master design project plan for the Capitol Police before providing funds for design projects. $475,000 was allocated for this purpose. The AOC received $475,000 for a master plan including security needs of the Capitol complex. An additional $1 million was allocated for security designs by the U.S. Capitol Police, and $750,000 for physical security installations. The AOC must report expenses to the Senate committees. The House bill recommended $121.4 million, a decrease from the AOC's request of $166.1 million. The total would have been $175.1 million including Senate Office Buildings appropriations. The House report recognized limited funds for maintenance backlog and directed the AOC to use energy savings to defray costs. The House inspector general was directed to audit fire-protection systems. Conferees agreed to $184.2 million and directed the AOC to develop an energy savings plan for maintenance funding. Additional funds were allocated for the Capitol Power Plant and the AOC for Congressional purposes. The conferees accepted House language appropriating $1 million to the AOC for the Congressional Cemetery, with a grant of $1 million to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Congress also provided $100 million for a Capitol visitor center. The Congressional Budget Office budget for FY1999 was set at $25.7 million, a 3.5% increase from the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) budget for FY1999 was set at $25.7 million, a 3.5% increase from the previous year. Conferees agreed to post CBO papers and publications on the Internet, provide information to Congress on revenue estimates, and address computer needs. The General Accounting Office (GAO) budget for FY1999 was set at $354.3 million, a 4.4% increase from FY1998. The Senate bill proposed $363.3 million, a 7.0% increase from FY1998, while the House bill proposed $354.2 million, a 4.3% increase. Additional funding was included for GAO program changes, with appropriations for 50 FTEs. The conferees inserted language in the budget bill directing that one-third of the funding increase be used for IT work related to the Year 2000 computing crisis. They also allocated additional funds for program contract support and required accountability from the comptroller general. The Senate bill included funding for 3,300 FTEs, while the House bill recommended funds for 3,225 FTEs and suggested the use of consultants to provide flexibility and avoid a full-time staff increase. Additional funds were provided to GAO in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental bill. The FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act allocated $5 million for Year-2000 compliance in the legislative branch, with transfers subject to approval. The Library of Congress budget is included in the legislative appropriations bill, with funds for the Congressional Research Service and Library of Congress activities. The Congressional Research Service received $67.1 million for FY1999, a 3.2% increase from the previous year. The House bill proposed a 3.2% increase to $66.7 million for FY1999, while the Senate bill proposed a 5.1% increase to $67.9 million. Conferees agreed to allocate $296.5 million for Library of Congress operations, with specific directives on staff levels and spending. The House bill funded 4,076 full-time equivalent positions for all Library positions.

The conferees allocated $2 million for digitizing materials from the LOC collections related to \"Meeting the Frontiers - Russia and Alaska,\" and designated $250,000 for commemorating the Lewis and Clark expedition in 2003. They directed the LOC to address security issues and develop a plan for physical security coordination by January 15, 1999, consulting with the Architect of the Capitol and Capitol police. The Senate report encouraged consultation with Capitol police on external security issues. Funding for Library buildings and grounds under the Architect of the Capitol was also addressed. The Architect of the Capitol was directed to obtain the Capitol Police Board's approval for budget requests regarding the Library of Congress's security. Additional funds were allocated for security enhancements in the Capitol complex and Library of Congress in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The Government Printing Office budget was also addressed. The Government Printing Office (GPO) budget for FY1999 was funded in both Title I and Title II. The House figure for congressional printing and binding was $74.5 million, a decrease from the FY1998 level of $81.7 million. The Senate bill allocated $75.5 million for the same purpose. Conferees agreed on the House version, which included savings from technology upgrades and a reduced FTE level. Conferees agreed to an administrative provision in the House version authorizing up to $11 million to be transferred from the GPO revolving fund in its FY1998 budget authority. They also directed a study on cost-effective printing programs for the House and Senate. Funding for GPO in Title II of the bill is $29.3 million, with additional funding from the GPO revolving fund. Conferees agreed to language in Title II directing GPO to complete assessments and plan for their implementation. Title II directs GPO to complete assessments, plan for implementation, and take action to make the agency Year-2000 compliant during FY1999. Interpretation of budget trends is influenced by factors such as selection of current or constant dollars, budget authority in annual appropriations bills, and comparison of fiscal years. Current-dollar data reflect actual budget authority each year, while constant-dollar data convert actual budget authority into equivalent 1998 dollars. For example, in FY1968, Congress appropriated $41,793,000 for the Senate, excluding permanent budget authority. The Senate budget in FY1968 was $41,793,000, which is equivalent to $196,955,517 in 1998 dollars. Over 30 years, the budget increased by 1003.0% in current dollars and 134.1% in constant dollars, adjusting for inflation. Different fiscal years show varying budget growth rates: FY1968-FY1998, +83.0%; FY1972-FY1998, +8.7%; and FY1978-FY1998, -12.3%. The 1970s saw significant budget changes due to the Legislative Reorganization Act, increasing budgets and staffs of congressional committees and support agencies. Between FY1971 and FY1978, the legislative budget authority increased by 64.5% adjusted for inflation. The 1970s saw the implementation of the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, leading to the creation of the House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office. Funding for House and Senate computer capabilities also began during this time. However, the growth in the legislative budget stabilized by FY1978 and remained fairly level since then. From FY1978 to FY1998, the total legislative budget decreased by 12.3% when adjusted for inflation, with a 6.0% decrease in budget authority for direct congressional operations in Title I. Title I decreased by 6.0% from FY1978 to FY1998. Funding fluctuated over the years, with increases in FY1991, FY1992, and FY1995, but decreases in FY1993, FY1994, FY1996, and FY1997. The total legislative budget authority decreased by 9.4% between FY1994 and FY1998. The Legislative Branch Appropriations for FY1999 were detailed in H.R.4112 and H.R. 4328, with funding sources provided by Rep. James Walsh and the House Appropriations Committee. The appropriations included supplemental funds for various purposes, such as payments to widows and heirs of deceased Members and the Capitol dome restoration project.

The Senate does not consider budget authority for internal House operations. The House of Representatives' internal operations, Secretary of the Senate's office operations, and Sergeant at Arms' activities are funded under \"Salaries, Officers, and Employees.\" Emergency supplementals of $5.5 million were allocated for the Year-2000 computer conversion for the Sergeant at Arms in FY1999. Source information for the appropriations is provided by Rep. James Walsh and the House Appropriations Committee. The House Appropriations Committee allocated an FY1998 supplemental appropriation for two House accounts: Payments to Widows and Heirs of Deceased Members of Congress and Salaries and Expenses. The appropriations bill consolidated various headings and subheadings under Salaries and Expenses, representing a new appropriation heading introduced in the FY1996 bill.
