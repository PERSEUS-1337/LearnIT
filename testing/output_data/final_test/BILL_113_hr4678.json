The Federal Financial Statement Transparency Act of 2014 establishes the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board with 10 members appointed by various government officials and from the financial, accounting, and auditing communities. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board is established with members appointed from the financial, accounting, and auditing communities, excluding Federal employees. Members serve at the discretion of the appointing agency head, with non-federal members serving a term of up to 5 years, renewable for another 5 years upon approval of an appointment panel. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board appoints an initial appointment panel consisting of up to 6 individuals, including members appointed by the Comptroller General, Director, Secretary, and representatives from the Financial Accounting Foundation and the certified public accountant profession. The public accountant profession advocates before legislative and regulatory entities, develops standards for audits, provides tools and training, and enforces compliance with technical and ethical standards for certified public accountants. The appointment panel appoints members for these duties. The appointment panel appoints members to serve on the Board, dissolve upon completion of duties, select a chair for the Board and subsequent appointment panel, and convene a new panel before the term of current Board members expires. SEC. 4. DUTIES; CONCEPTS AND STANDARDS. The Board of FASAB develops Federal financial accounting concepts and standards, considering the budgetary needs of executive agencies and users of Federal financial information. They are restricted from setting or proposing budget concepts, standards, or principles. Concepts and standards developed must receive a favorable vote by at least 2/3 of the Board members and be submitted for review by the Director, Comptroller General, OMB, and GAO. The Director and the Comptroller General must submit the concept or standard to the Secretary within 90 days. If either disapproves, they must reject and submit it to the Board for reconsideration within 90 days. The Director or Comptroller General must report the rejection to the Board within 5 days. The Director or Comptroller General must report rejected concepts or standards to Congress and the organization within 5 days. The Board will publish the rejected concept or standard in the Federal Register. If the Secretary decides not to adopt a concept or standard, they must submit it for reconsideration. The Secretary must describe any rejected concept or standard, along with the basis for rejection, in the annual report submitted to Congress. An exception is made for immaterial deviations. The Comptroller General will conduct an audit and report any material deviations from accounting principles found in the annual report. The Secretary must explain any deviation from accounting principles in the annual report to the Comptroller General within 30 days of notification. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a fund for FASAB operations without fiscal year limitation. The Board will determine the annual cost of its duties, funded by fees on security sales. These funds can be used by the Board without further appropriation. The effective date for Sections 3 and 4 of this Act is when funds from the fund described in Section 5 are transferred to the Board."
