    "content": "The terms \"issue advocacy\" and \"express advocacy\" were coined by the Supreme Court and are crucial in determining if political advertisements are subject to regulation under the Federal Election Campaign Act. \"Express advocacy\" ads are regulated, while \"issue advocacy\" ads can be funded with unregulated \"soft money.\" The distinction was established in the landmark 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court found that provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act were vague and overbroad, leading to concerns about regulating constitutionally protected issue-based speech. The government's regulatory power under FECA was limited to funds spent on communications containing express words of election advocacy. The Buckley Court distinguished between communications advocating election defeat of a candidate and issue advocacy, protecting the latter as First Amendment speech. Only \"express advocacy\" speech could be regulated, with specific terms like \"vote for\" or \"elect\" determining if a communication falls under this category. The Supreme Court ruling in Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL) continued to differentiate between issue advocacy and express advocacy. The Court emphasized that communication must include specific terms like \"vote for\" or \"defeat\" to constitute express advocacy and be subject to the Federal Election Campaign Act prohibition on corporate treasury funds for election expenditures. The Court ruled that communication must include specific terms like \"vote for\" or \"defeat\" to constitute express advocacy, as defined by the Federal Election Commission regulations. The Court ruled that communication must include specific terms like \"vote for\" or \"defeat\" to constitute express advocacy, as defined by the Federal Election Commission regulations. This includes campaign slogans, posters, bumper stickers, and advertisements that clearly urge the election or defeat of a candidate. The prevailing view of U.S. appellate courts is that Supreme Court precedent mandates communication to contain express words advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for constitutional regulation. The Ninth Circuit in 1987 found that speech can be considered express advocacy without specific words, presenting a three-part test for determining issue advocacy. The Ninth Circuit established a three-part test for determining issue advocacy, stating that speech must present a clear plea for action to be considered 'advocacy'. The test exempts speech from constituting \"express advocacy\" when reasonable minds could disagree on its intended action. Maine Right to Life Committee v. Federal Election Commission invalidated the \"reasonable person\" standard in regulations related to advocacy. In MRLC, the court emphasized the importance of following regulations consistent with the Furgatch decision and the Supreme Court's stance on political speech. The court highlighted that the First Amendment forbids the regulation of political speech under indeterminate standards, emphasizing that express words advocating for or against a candidate are the constitutional minimum. In Vermont Right to Life v. Sorrell, the Second Circuit interpreted Buckley to require express advocacy for regulating communication related to election candidates. The Supreme Court's standard of express advocacy aims to balance privacy and First Amendment rights in disclosure requirements. The Eleventh Circuit upheld similar regulations in Florida Right to Life v. Lamar. The Eleventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling in Florida Right to Life v. Lamar, striking down a Florida statute for unconstitutionally regulating issue advocacy through an overbroad definition of \"political committee.\" The statute required disclosure of groups supporting or opposing candidates, issues, or parties, and was found to be unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment. The \"Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001\" passed the Senate, incorporating language on issue and express advocacy, creating a new term in federal election law, \"electioneering communication.\" The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 introduced the term \"electioneering communication\" for ads referring to federal candidates close to elections, requiring disclosure of donors and prohibiting certain funding sources. Certain tax-exempt corporations are exempt unless the communication is targeted to residents of the candidate's state. S. 27 and H.R. 2356 introduce the term \"electioneering communication\" to regulate political ads related to federal candidates close to elections, regardless of express advocacy, with specific timing restrictions. The proposed legislation, H.R. 2356, aims to regulate political ads related to federal candidates close to elections by requiring disclosure of disbursements over $10,000 and identifying donors of $1,000 or more. It prohibits financing with union or certain corporate funds and exempts tax-exempt corporations from making electioneering communications with funds solely donated by individuals, unless the communication is targeted to a specific audience. H.R. 2356 aims to regulate political ads related to federal candidates close to elections by requiring disclosure of disbursements over $10,000 and identifying donors of $1,000 or more. It exempts certain communications from the definition of \"electioneering communication\" and provides an alternative definition based on FEC v. Furgatch. The Supreme Court has distinguished between express advocacy and issue advocacy communications. The federal circuit courts follow the Supreme Court precedent that communication must contain explicit words advocating for or against a specific candidate to be constitutionally regulated. If a communication does not meet this standard, it is considered issue advocacy, regardless of its impact on candidate favorability."
