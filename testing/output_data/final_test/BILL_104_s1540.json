    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996\" and grants authority for determining patent terms. The \"Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996\" amends Section 154(b) of title 35, United States Code, regarding the determination of patent term adjustments. The term of a patent can be adjusted to account for delays in issuance due to specific reasons outlined in the amendment. The \"Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996\" amends Section 154(b) of title 35, United States Code to allow for adjustments to a patent term. The Commissioner will establish regulations for determining delays, including unusual administrative delays. The total adjustment period for a patent term cannot exceed 10 years. The \"Full Patent Term Preservation Act of 1996\" allows for adjustments to a patent term due to delays determined by the Commissioner. The period of adjustment granted shall not exceed the actual number of days the patent issuance was delayed. The term of a patent may be reduced if the applicant did not act with due diligence during the application processing or examination. Regulations will be prescribed by the Commissioner to establish these circumstances. The regulations establish circumstances for a failure to act diligently in processing an application. A patent's term cannot be adjusted beyond a disclaimed expiration date. The Commissioner determines and notifies the patent term adjustment period, with procedures for application and notification. The Commissioner grants patent term adjustments, and dissatisfied applicants can seek judicial review in the United States Court of Federal Claims within 60 days. Section 156(a) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to include any patent term adjustments granted under section 154(b). In paragraph (2), a provision is added before the semicolon regarding exceptions under section 154(b) for patent term adjustments. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE: The amendments made by section 2 will be effective on the date of enactment of this Act and will apply to applications filed on or after June 8, 1995."
