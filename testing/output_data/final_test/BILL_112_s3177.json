    "content": "The \"Stopping Ongoing Lender Delays Act\" or the \"SOLD Act\" amends the Truth in Lending Act to include a new section requiring responses for mortgagor requests for refinancing. The \"SOLD Act\" mandates that servicers must provide a written response to mortgagors within 30 days of receiving a written request for a residential mortgage loan, as outlined in subsection (b). This requirement applies regardless of any existing contracts or laws. The \"SOLD Act\" requires servicers to respond in writing within 30 days to mortgagors' requests for residential mortgage loan decisions. Servicers can extend the decision date once for up to 30 additional days if needed. This provision does not apply to certain existing mortgages. The \"SOLD Act\" mandates that servicers must respond within 30 days to mortgagors' requests for residential mortgage loan decisions, with a possible 30-day extension. Mortgagors can submit a written offer for a short sale along with required information, and aggrieved individuals have the option to take civil actions. An aggrieved individual can bring a civil action in court for violations of the \"SOLD Act,\" seeking equitable relief and a monetary award of $1,000 per violation. The Act defines a residential mortgage loan as a consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling. The term 'servicer' in section 129A includes a person who services a residential mortgage loan. A 'short sale' refers to selling a property for less than the remaining mortgage amount, requiring authorization from the loan holder or servicer. The term 'servicer' in section 129A includes a person who services a residential mortgage loan or acts on behalf of the loan holder."
