    "title": "AB 2078",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 166 of the Penal Code is amended to address contempts of court, including disorderly behavior, breaches of peace, and disturbances that interrupt court proceedings. The amended Section 166 of the Penal Code addresses various forms of contempt of court, including willful disobedience of court orders, resistance to lawful orders, refusal to testify, false reporting of court proceedings, presenting false information to the court, and disobeying injunctions related to criminal street gangs. A person guilty of contempt of court by contacting a victim in violation of the law may face imprisonment, a fine, or both. Each contact is considered a separate violation, and previous incarceration is not a defense. A willful and knowing violation of certain protective orders or stay-away court orders can result in contempt of court, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment, a fine, or both. The orders include those issued under various sections of the law related to elder or dependent adult abuse. Each violation is considered separate, and previous incarceration is not a defense. A violation of certain protective orders can lead to imprisonment in a county jail for at least 48 hours. This applies to orders related to elder or dependent adult abuse, exclusion from a dwelling, or injunctions against specified behavior. A second conviction for violating certain protective orders within seven years of a prior conviction involving violence can result in imprisonment in a county jail or state prison. The prosecuting agency of each county is responsible for enforcing these orders. Possessing a firearm while prohibited by a protective order is punishable under Section 29825. A person under a protective order can be exempt from prosecution for firearm possession under certain conditions. Probation for violating the order may include payments to a shelter or restitution to the victim for counseling expenses. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, make payments to a battered women's shelter, or provide restitution as part of probation. Community property cannot be used to pay for restitution to an injured spouse until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted. A person violating an order may be punished for offenses under Section 136.1 or 646.9. Contempt finding does not prevent prosecution for these offenses. Credit for punishment imposed for violation of the order can be applied to any sentence for offenses under Section 136.1 or 646.9. Conviction or acquittal for these offenses bars subsequent punishment for contempt related to the same act. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
