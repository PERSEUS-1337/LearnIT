FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DIABETES PREVENTION UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. The prevalence and cost of diabetes are significant concerns for State Medicaid programs. By 2021, Medicaid is expected to cover 13,000,000 people with diabetes and 9,000,000 with pre-diabetes, costing States an estimated $83 billion. The National Diabetes Prevention Program has been proven to reduce diabetes onset by 58% in at-risk adults through a cost-effective, community-based intervention. The Senate recognizes the program as an opportunity for States to reduce diabetes incidence in their Medicaid programs."
