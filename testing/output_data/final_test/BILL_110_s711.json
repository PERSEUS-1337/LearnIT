    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Universal Service for the 21st Century Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of universal service in providing access to high-quality telecommunications and information services nationwide. It acknowledges the shift towards advanced networks to support modern communication needs and highlights the need to restructure universal service support to be more equitable among carriers. The current universal service fund system has limitations in carrier support, leading to inequities, incentives to avoid contributions, and a threat to long-term sustainability. Contributors are paying more of their revenue into the fund, emphasizing the need for an equitable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral funding mechanism to ensure affordable communication services for all. The Universal Service Fund contribution requirements are outlined in Section 3. The Federal Communications Commission is amending the Communications Act of 1934 to support universal service within states, allowing them to adopt rules to preserve and advance it. Additionally, a proceeding will be initiated to establish a permanent mechanism to enhance universal service. The Federal Communications Commission is amending the Communications Act of 1934 to support universal service by establishing a permanent mechanism to promote public interest and financial stability. The mechanism may include collection methodologies like total telecommunications revenues and connections to ensure competitive neutrality among providers and include all communications services capable of supporting 2-way voice communications. The Federal Communications Commission is amending the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a permanent mechanism for universal service support. This mechanism considers the impact on low volume users, assesses high volume users proportionately, and ensures carriers do not contribute multiple times for the same transaction. Excluded providers capable of supporting 2-way voice communications may be required to contribute under an alternative methodology to preserve financial stability. The Commission must complete the proceeding and issue a final rule within 6 months of the Act's enactment to avoid jeopardizing universal service sustainability. SEC. 4. INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION. The Federal Communications Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to establish rates for inter-carrier compensation payments, including for intrastate telecommunications traffic. The Commission must ensure full cost recovery for interstate and intrastate telecommunications services and examine traffic identifiers. The Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction over inter-carrier compensation rates, ensuring cost recovery for telecommunications services and examining traffic identifiers. The Commission aims to provide sufficient support for local exchange carriers and allows carriers to negotiate their own compensation agreements without preclusion. The Commission must complete the pending Intercarrier Compensation proceeding within 6 months of enactment. The final rule must be completed within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF BROADBAND ACCOUNT WITHIN UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND. Part I of title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 254A, for a BROADBAND FOR UNSERVED AREAS ACCOUNT. Within the universal service fund, a separate account called the 'Broadband for Unserved Areas Account' is established to provide financial assistance for deploying broadband services to unserved areas in the US. The Commission will establish guidelines to determine unserved areas and eligibility criteria for providers and projects to receive support from the account. The 'Broadband for Unserved Areas Account' within the universal service fund will have guidelines for awarding assistance based on merit and competitiveness, application procedures, fiscal controls, and equitable distribution of funds among states. The Commission will conduct a study on unserved areas and provide annual reports within six months of the Universal Service for the 21st Century Act enactment. The Commission will conduct a study annually to determine unserved areas for broadband services, with a focus on areas where satellite services have low subscribership. A report will be submitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives. The Commission may delegate funding distribution to States under guidelines and approval. Annual funding limit is $500,000,000 with specific use requirements. The Broadband for Unserved Areas Account supports universal service under section 254 by providing assistance to facilities-based providers of broadband communications service in unserved areas. Section 214(e) does not apply to this account, and section 254 is applied by disregarding certain subsections. In this section, the Broadband for Unserved Areas Account is exempt from Section 410. The term 'broadband' is defined by the Commission according to specific requirements. The Commission is required to revise its definition of broadband within 30 days of the Universal Service for the 21st Century Act, to have a data rate greater than 200 kilobits per second and consistent with public broadband services available at the time of enactment. The definition must be reviewed annually. The term 'broadband communications service' is defined as a high-speed capability for voice, data, graphics, and video communications using any technology. The FCC must finalize a rule to implement section 254A of the Communications Act within 6 months of this Act's enactment."
