    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail Designation Act of 2004\". Congress finds that at the end of the last Ice Age, cataclysmic floods occurred in the northwest region of the United States, leaving dramatic features on the landscape. Geological features of exceptional value to illustrate this phenomenon are present on various types of land in the region. In 2001, a study team endorsed the establishment of an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail was designated to recognize the national significance of the cataclysmic floods at the end of the last Ice Age in the northwest region of the United States. Its purpose is to enable the public to view, experience, and learn about the features and story of the floods through collaborative efforts of public and private entities in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail recognizes cataclysmic floods from the last Ice Age in the northwest US. It allows public viewing and learning about the floods through collaborative efforts in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Designation of the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail aims to promote public appreciation and understanding of the significant natural and cultural features of the Ice Age floods. The trail follows a route from Missoula, Montana, through Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, primarily using public roads and highways. The Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail spans from Missoula, Montana, through Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, ending at the Pacific Ocean. The Secretary has the authority to revise the map by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. Maps related to the trail are available for public inspection at National Park Service offices. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary, through the Director of the National Park Service, administers the Trail as per the Act. A trail management office may be established for coordination. Land acquisition of up to 25 acres is allowed for administrative purposes in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Private land can only be acquired by donation. The Secretary may acquire non-Federal public land through donation or exchange, with consultation with local government. Interpretive facilities can be built in partnership with other entities. An interagency technical committee will advise on trail management. The interagency technical committee advises on technical planning for trail development, including representatives from various agencies and the Ice Age Floods Institute. The Secretary must prepare a management plan within 3 years of funding availability, consulting with stakeholders. The Secretary must prepare a plan in consultation with State, local, and tribal governments, the Ice Age Floods Institute, private property owners, and other interested parties. The plan will confirm and potentially expand on the inventory of flood features, improving accuracy, descriptions, and interpretive potential. The plan will review and modify the Trail map, describe strategies for coordinated development, and identify partnering opportunities for interpretive facilities and educational programs about the floods. Cooperative management will facilitate interpretation, education, resource stewardship, visitor facility development, and scientific efforts. The Secretary may enter into cooperative management agreements with states for the Trail's development and operation. The Trail is considered a unit of the National Park System. Cooperative agreements with public or private entities can be made to carry out the Act without affecting private property rights. The Trail designation allows public access to private property without creating liability for property owners. Authorization of appropriations for the administration of the Trail is limited to $500,000 per fiscal year."
