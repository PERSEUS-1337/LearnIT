    "content": "A data breach is unauthorized access to sensitive personal information, compromising data integrity. California enacted the first data breach notification law in 2002. Since then, over 2,676 breaches have been disclosed by various organizations. Notable breaches include ChoicePoint in 2005, involving 163,000 individuals' data, and a breach in 2006 affecting 26.5 million people. In 2006, 26.5 million veterans' personal data was breached. In 2007, TJX Companies reported 46.2 million compromised credit and debit cards. In 2008, Hannaford revealed 4 million compromised card numbers. In 2009, Heartland Payment Systems had 130 million breached records. Also in 2009, Health Net had a breach affecting half a million Connecticut residents and 1.5 million patients nationally. In 2011, Stanford Hospital had a breach of data for 20,000 emergency room patients. Data breaches can occur due to various reasons such as computer hacking, malware, payment card fraud, employee insider breach, physical loss of records, and inadvertent exposure of data. These breaches can be costly, time-consuming, and damaging to a company's reputation. Despite the high costs associated with data breaches, U.S. companies are hesitant to purchase cyber liability insurance. Data breaches involving sensitive personal information can lead to identity theft and financial crimes, costing companies millions of dollars. Concerns about identity theft are widespread due to continued media reports of data security breaches. Cloud computing presents data security challenges, as seen in the 2011 Epsilon, Sony, and Amazon breaches. Epsilon's database hack compromised customer names and email addresses for companies outsourcing marketing communications. Epsilon announced a data breach affecting 2% of its clients, including companies like Citibank and Target. Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity service also experienced a data breach in April 2011. Amazon Web Services' cloud computing platform, Amazon EC2, faced a partial failure in its northern Virginia data center, impacting customers like Foursquare and HootSuite. Amazon EC2 experienced a significant failure impacting applications like Foursquare, Formspring, HootSuite, and Reddit. The failure spread across multiple availability zones, resulting in the permanent loss of some customer data. Litigation and enforcement actions are increasing due to security breaches, with lawsuits against retailers, credit card issuers, payment processors, and banks. The FTC and state attorneys general are taking action for violations of consumer protection laws related to data security breaches. Consumers are suing entities for negligence in protecting personal information, leading to new data security obligations for those handling personal information. The emergence of data breach notification laws imposing obligations on entities that own, possess, or license personal information is a recent phenomenon. California was the first to enact such a law in 2002, followed by federal and state bills modeled after it. Many states require notification based on harm rather than just unauthorized acquisition. For example, Alaska law allows for no disclosure if harm is unlikely after investigation and notification to the attorney general. As of January 2012, 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information. States have introduced legislation to expand laws, set additional requirements, and change penalties for breaches. Some states are considering holding retailers liable for costs from data breaches. Massachusetts has comprehensive security breach and data destruction laws. Texas's amended breach notification law will make breach notification obligations exist in all states, as entities doing business in Texas will be required to notify residents of states without their own breach notification laws. This will create a comprehensive set of security regulations at the state level, modeled after federal data security laws. Variations in state breach notification laws make it challenging to standardize. State security breach notification laws are criticized for their lack of uniformity, creating compliance challenges for businesses engaged in interstate commerce. The connection between security breaches and consumer harm like identity theft is unclear, and American consumers lack a general right to information privacy. Attempts to seek damages through class action lawsuits after a breach notice have had limited success. State security breach notification laws aim to provide stronger protection for personal information. These laws typically include elements such as defining who must comply, outlining what constitutes a breach, specifying harm triggers for notice, setting requirements for notification, establishing exemptions, addressing preemption and federal law relationships. Businesses often offer credit monitoring services voluntarily after breaches, as class action lawsuits seeking damages have had limited success in clarifying consumer rights. State security breach notification laws vary in coverage, including businesses, state agencies, for profits, non-profits, and information brokers. Definitions for \"personal information\" are included, but there is no uniform definition for \"personally identifiable information.\" The term \"personal information\" varies in state security breach notification laws, including details like SSN, driver's license number, account numbers, and health information. \"Sensitive personally identifiable information\" is a subset of PII, including education, financial, medical, and employment history. The breach of security involves unauthorized acquisition of personal information, compromising its security. Some states require a risk assessment to determine if notice is necessary, with laws specifying who must provide notice. Notification requirements for data breaches vary by state, including who needs to be notified, when, how, and what information should be included. Safe harbor provisions exist for entities compliant with certain regulations like GLBA and HIPAA. Encrypted information is exempt from notification in many states. Thirteen states, DC, and Puerto Rico allow individuals to sue businesses for damages due to security breaches. Penalties for failure to notify customers vary, including civil penalties up to $50,000 per resident not notified. The legal framework for protecting personally identifiable information includes penalties for breaches, such as fines not exceeding $10,000 per breach, daily penalties up to $50,000 for each 30-day period, and $2,500 per violation. Different laws govern data security, and compliance depends on the entity collecting the information. Federal regulations require certain sectors to protect sensitive personal information, with laws enacted in credit, financial services, health care, government, securities, and Internet sectors. Federal laws like FISMA and security breach notification laws apply to federal agencies and departments. Federal departments and agencies are required to provide breach notification, with the Department of Veterans Affairs having a statutory obligation to do so. Private sector entities must adhere to laws like HIPAA and GLBA to maintain security safeguards and notify of breaches. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair practices in commerce. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) set security requirements for organizations handling bank cards. Critics argue that current laws focus too much on industry-specific uses of information rather than protecting individuals' privacy. Some advocate for a national standard to harmonize legal obligations for entities maintaining personal information. Others suggest a higher duty of care for governments handling sensitive personal information in the U.S. public sector. The curr_chunk discusses information security and data breach notification requirements in the U.S. public sector, including laws like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. It also mentions implementing regulations such as the FTC Safeguards Rule and Information Security Interagency Guidance. Additionally, it includes an overview of the Office of Management and Budget's \"Breach Notification Policy\" for federal agencies. The Office of Management and Budget issued guidance in May 2007 for federal agencies on safeguarding personally identifiable information. Agencies must implement a breach notification policy by August 22, 2007, covering electronic systems and paper documents. The policy should include incident reporting, handling, external breach notification, and define responsibilities for individuals accessing the information. This guidance emphasizes existing laws like the Privacy Act and FISMA. Agencies must adhere to existing laws and regulations to protect personally identifiable information. New privacy and security requirements are introduced, including reviewing and minimizing the collection of Social Security numbers. Security measures such as data encryption, two-factor authentication, and data logging are mandated for all federal information systems. Agencies must report incidents involving personally identifiable information promptly and establish response teams to address breaches. Factors for external breach notification are outlined, with encrypted information potentially exempt from notification requirements. Each agency must establish a response team to assess and address breaches promptly. Notification of breaches should be provided without delay, with exceptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Agencies are also required to develop a policy outlining rules of behavior and consequences for failure to comply. Supervisors may face disciplinary action for not taking appropriate steps to prevent breaches. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires the development of a health information system with standards for electronic transmission. Consequences for breaching security controls include reprimand, suspension, or removal according to agency policy and law. HIPAA requires national standards for electronic exchange of health information, code sets, privacy protection, security safeguards, unique health identifiers, and electronic signature procedures. Covered entities must comply with these standards, with penalties for non-compliance ranging from $100 to $25,000 per violation. The civil money penalty for HIPAA violations ranges from $100 to $25,000 per violation, with a maximum of $50,000 per violation and up to $1,500,000 for all violations of the same requirement in a calendar year. Criminal penalties are also established for knowingly using health identifiers or disclosing health information, with fines up to $100,000 and/or imprisonment up to five years for offenses committed under false pretenses. The HIPAA Privacy Rule imposes penalties for violations, including fines up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 10 years for offenses involving intent to sell or misuse health information. The rule applies to health plans, clearinghouses, and providers transmitting electronic transactions. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities. Covered entities must have agreements with business associates who handle PHI. The Office of Civil Rights enforces the Privacy Rule, which allows for certain uses and disclosures of PHI without patient authorization. Exceptions include public health and law enforcement purposes. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires covered entities to protect the privacy of protected health information and maintain safeguards. It also mandates the adoption of a national security standard for individually identifiable health information, with the issuance of the HIPAA Security Rule in 2003. This rule applies to electronic protected health information (EPHI) and requires entities to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI. The HIPAA Security Rule mandates covered entities to protect electronic protected health information (EPHI) from threats and unauthorized uses. Covered entities must have agreements with business associates handling EPHI and are not liable for violations unless they knew about the misconduct and failed to act. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enforce the Security Rule, considering factors like cost and organization size when implementing security measures. The Security Rule requires covered entities to meet standards for protecting electronic health information, considering factors like cost, size, complexity, and potential risks. The HITECH Act introduced additional privacy requirements, including provisions for electronic health records. The HITECH Act extended HIPAA provisions to business associates, imposed new limits on PHI use, increased penalties for violations, required data breach notifications, and created additional individual rights. The HITECH Act requires business associates to comply with PHI use and disclosure terms in their agreements. Business associates can be held liable for Privacy Rule violations by covered entities if they are aware of unlawful conduct. Business associates are subject to the same penalties as covered entities for improper PHI use or disclosure. The HITECH Act extends HIPAA Security Rule provisions to business associates, subjecting them to civil and criminal penalties for violations. Business associates must comply with new security requirements and render protected health information unreadable to unauthorized individuals. The HITECH Act requires protected health information to be rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through encryption or destruction. This guidance helps covered entities determine if a breach has occurred and if breach notification obligations apply. The HITECH Act mandates breach notification requirements for covered entities, business associates, and vendors of personal health records (PHRs) in case of unauthorized access to unsecured protected health information. A breach is defined as compromising the security or privacy of such information, except in cases where the unauthorized person cannot retain the information. Vendors of PHRs are entities offering or maintaining personal health records. The HITECH Act mandates breach notification requirements for covered entities, business associates, and vendors of personal health records (PHRs) in case of unauthorized access to unsecured protected health information. In August 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an interim final breach notification regulation, addressing notification procedures and administrative requirements. The FTC was also directed to issue breach notification regulations for web-based businesses handling electronic health information breaches. The HITECH Act requires covered entities to notify individuals of breaches involving their unsecured PHI. Notification methods, content, and enforcement are outlined in the rule. The scope of notification depends on the number of affected individuals, with written notice sufficient for breaches involving less than 500 individuals. Larger breaches may require notification through media outlets, with the Secretary of HHS also being notified. The HITECH Act requires covered entities to notify individuals of breaches involving their unsecured PHI. Notification methods, content, and enforcement are outlined in the rule. The Secretary of HHS must be notified for breaches involving less than 500 people, with notification required within 60 days of discovery. Delayed notification is allowed for law enforcement purposes. The HITECH Act mandates breach notification for covered entities, including details of the breach, types of information involved, steps for individuals, investigation efforts, and contact information. The Act also requires an annual report to Congress on breach incidents. Additionally, PHR vendors and service providers must notify individuals of breaches involving their unsecured PHI. The HITECH Act mandates breach notification for covered entities, including details of the breach, types of information involved, steps for individuals, investigation efforts, and contact information. PHR vendors, service providers, and servicers are required to notify the FTC of breaches involving individuals' PHR identifiable health information. A breach of security is defined as the unauthorized acquisition of an individual's PHR identifiable health information, which includes information that can reasonably identify the individual. Violations of notification requirements are considered unfair and deceptive trade practices. Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to provide privacy notices, safeguard customer information, and protect against unauthorized access. Financial institutions are defined as businesses engaged in financial activities like banking, lending, and insurance. Violations of these requirements are considered unfair and deceptive trade practices. Financial institutions must adhere to privacy regulations under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which include providing notices to customers about privacy practices and allowing them to opt out of disclosing nonpublic personal information to third parties. Exceptions exist for disclosures to perform services on behalf of the institution. Regulations by federal banking regulators govern the treatment of consumer information by financial institutions. The Safeguards Rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to have an information security plan for disclosing nonpublic personal information to third parties. This rule applies to all businesses providing financial products or services, including check-cashing businesses, mortgage brokers, and credit reporting agencies. The Safeguards Rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act mandates financial institutions to have an information security plan with administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure customer information security and confidentiality. The rule also requires protection against threats, unauthorized access, and harm to customers. Enforcement actions have been taken by the commission for non-compliance. Section 501(b) of GLBA mandates banking agencies to establish standards for safeguarding customer information. The Interagency Guidance issued by federal banking regulators requires financial institutions to protect customer information from threats, unauthorized access, and harm. This includes assessing risks, implementing security measures, and ensuring the integrity of customer information systems. The security guidelines for financial institutions require the management and control of risks through a program, staff training, regular testing of controls, and measures for disposing of customer information. Service providers must also implement measures to protect customer information. Financial institutions must monitor, evaluate, and adjust their information security programs and report annually to their board. The financial institution is required to report annually to its board on its information security program, compliance with security guidelines, risk assessment, management decisions, service provider arrangements, testing results, security breaches, and management's responses. The security guidelines recommend a risk-based response program for unauthorized access to customer information, with disclosure of data breaches if misuse of customer information is possible. The institution's response program for unauthorized access to sensitive customer information should include assessing the incident, notifying regulators and law enforcement, containing the incident, and notifying customers when necessary. The security guidelines require financial institutions to protect customers' information, conduct investigations into unauthorized access, and notify affected customers promptly. Notification should not be delayed due to embarrassment or inconvenience, and should be done as soon as misuse is determined or suspected. The institution may delay notification if law enforcement requests it to not interfere with an investigation. Customers should be notified promptly once the investigation allows. If specific customers' information is known to be accessed, only those customers should be notified. If a group of files is accessed without specific customer identification, all customers in the group should be notified. The guidelines also specify the information to be included in the notification to customers."
