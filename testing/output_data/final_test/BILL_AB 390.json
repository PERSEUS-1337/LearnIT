    "title": "AB 390",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 296 of the Penal Code is amended to require certain individuals to provide biometric samples for law enforcement identification analysis, including those convicted of felony offenses and adults arrested for specified felony offenses related to sex crimes. The amended Penal Code requires certain individuals, including those convicted of felony offenses and adults arrested for specified felony offenses related to sex crimes, to provide biometric samples for law enforcement identification analysis. Additionally, any adult person arrested or charged with any felony offense, as well as individuals required to register under specific sections due to felony or misdemeanor offenses, are also subject to the new requirements. Individuals convicted of or pleading guilty to specific misdemeanor offenses, including violations related to theft, drugs, and health and safety, are subject to new biometric sample requirements for law enforcement identification analysis. The term \"felony\" in this context also includes attempted offenses. The chapter requires submission of specimens, samples, and print impressions for all qualifying persons, regardless of sentence imposed, including death or life without parole. The term \"felony\" includes attempted offenses. The chapter mandates the submission of specimens, samples, and print impressions for qualified persons, including those in mental hospitals or treatment facilities. This includes mentally disordered sex offenders and individuals with severe mental disorders. The chapter mandates the submission of specimens, samples, and print impressions for sexually violent predators as defined in the Welfare and Institutions Code. The provisions apply regardless of court advisement or plea status. If specimens, samples, and print impressions have not been taken from a person during court proceedings, the prosecuting attorney must request the court to order their collection as required by law. Failure to notify the court does not excuse the person from providing the necessary specimens and samples. Prior to final disposition or sentencing, the court must verify that specimens, samples, and print impressions have been obtained and included in the abstract of judgment. Failure to do so does not invalidate an arrest, plea, conviction, or disposition. The court must order the person to comply with DNA and Forensic Identification requirements. Section 299 of the Penal Code states that a person's DNA profile will be removed from the data bank if they have no qualifying offense and there is no legal basis for retaining it. The person can request to have their DNA specimen and sample destroyed if they meet the criteria. If no accusatory pleading is filed within the allowed period or if charges are dismissed, the DNA profile will be removed from the state's DNA Database. The profile will also be removed if the underlying conviction is reversed, the person is found innocent, or the defendant is acquitted of the offense. The person requesting expungement must send a copy of the request to the trial court, DNA Laboratory, and prosecuting attorney. The court can grant or deny the request, with denial being non-appealable. The Department of Justice will destroy the DNA profile upon receipt of a court order verifying the necessary showing at a noticed hearing. To request expungement, the individual must provide a written request, a court order reversing the conviction, or a letter from the district attorney confirming dismissal of charges. Proof of notice to the prosecuting attorney and Department of Justice is also required. Upon court order, the Department of Justice must destroy any collected specimens or DNA profiles unless the person is subject to certain provisions due to past offenses. The Department of Justice is not required to destroy analytical data obtained from a blood specimen, saliva, or buccal swab sample if it would compromise evidence related to another person. Any identification or arrest based on a database match is not invalidated by a failure to expunge records. The Department of Justice DNA Laboratory is not required to expunge DNA profile information if the duty to register under certain sections is terminated. A judge cannot exempt a person from providing specimens, samples, or print impressions required by law for certain offenses. Reimbursement for costs mandated by this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
