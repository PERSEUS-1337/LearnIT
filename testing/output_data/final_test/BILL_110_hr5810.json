Congress finds that the U.S. has the highest teenage pregnancy rate among industrialized countries, with significant negative impacts on education, health, and poverty levels for both teenage mothers and their children. Innovative initiatives are needed to address this issue. Research shows that various programs have successfully reduced teenage pregnancy rates by engaging students in community service, promoting youth development, providing preventive health services, offering sex and HIV/AIDS education, and more. These initiatives aim to give every young person a better hope for the future. The Social Security Act is amended to include a mentor-mentee teen pregnancy reduction grant program under section 511. Sec. 511 of the Social Security Act establishes a grant program for school-based mentoring programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy among at-risk teenage girls. Grants are awarded competitively to local educational agencies or community-based organizations, with priority given to programs in states that have not received an allotment under section 510. Grant funds can only be used for recruiting, training, and supporting mentors in a school-based setting. The grant program aims to prevent teen pregnancy by supporting school-based mentoring programs through recruiting, training, and supporting mentors, hiring coordinators, providing professional development, outreach materials, and activities for mentees including workshops, classes, and after-school activities on family life, sex education, abstinence, contraception, condom use, HIV, and sexually transmitted diseases. The grant program supports school-based mentoring programs that provide education on family life, sex education, abstinence, contraception, HIV, and STDs. It also includes preparation for exams, college entrance assistance, financial literacy education, tutoring, sports, health and nutrition education, and arts education.
