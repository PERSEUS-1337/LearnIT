    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Children From Identity Theft Act\" and aims to reduce identity fraud. The purpose of this section is to reduce synthetic identity fraud, especially affecting vulnerable populations, by validating fraud protection data through a database maintained by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. The section outlines the required information for individuals, defines a permitted entity, and emphasizes the efficiency of utilizing existing databases for fraud protection. The Commissioner will modify existing databases or develop new ones to meet the requirements of the section, including comparing fraud protection data to confirm validity. The database must also be scalable to accommodate future needs. The database must be scalable to handle verification requests from permitted entities with reasonable uptime and availability. It should allow for real-time electronic responses and batch requests within 24 hours. Funding for upgrades and maintenance should come from users in a manner consistent with section 1106(b). Before providing fraud protection data, the Commissioner must ensure the permitted entity is certified and compliant with privacy laws. The entity must confirm its status, compliance with regulations, and commitment to data security requirements. The permitted entity must retain records to demonstrate compliance with certification and privacy laws for at least 2 years. Consumer consent is required for submitting requests to the database, specifically for credit transactions or circumstances outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires electronic consent for permitted entities to use individual's information. Electronic consent must include the individual's electronic signature. No law can prevent the use of electronic consent for verification purposes. The Commissioner may conduct audits and monitoring for compliance and enforcement. The Commissioner may conduct audits and monitoring to ensure proper use of the database by permitted entities, deter fraud and misuse, and terminate services for entities that prevent audits. The Commissioner conducts audits to ensure database compliance and may forward violations to relevant agencies for evaluation.
