    "content": "The Landmine Moratorium Extension Act of 1993 may be cited as such. Key findings are included in the Act. The Congress finds that antipersonnel landmines have been used indiscriminately, causing harm to noncombatant civilians worldwide. Millions of landmines have been scattered in numerous countries, making areas uninhabitable and posing a threat to civilian populations. Advanced technologies are being used to manufacture sophisticated mines which can be scattered remotely at a high rate. These mines were discovered in Iraqi arsenals after the Persian Gulf War. Over three hundred types of antipersonnel landmines have been manufactured by at least forty-four countries, including the United States. The United States is not a major exporter of landmines, with only ten licenses approved for commercial export in the past ten years. The United States exported antipersonnel landmines worth $980,000 and sold 109,129 landmines under the Foreign Military Sales program. The US signed but has not ratified the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on Certain Conventional Weapons, including the Landmine Protocol. The US believes the Convention is a positive step to minimize civilian casualties in armed conflicts. The United States supported practical provisions in the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on Certain Conventional Weapons to protect noncombatants. However, compliance procedures were omitted from the final draft, weakening the effectiveness of the Landmine Protocol. Since the Landmine Protocol came into force in 1983, civilian casualties from antipersonnel landmines have increased. The US moratorium on landmine sales in 1992 led to calls for a five-year moratorium by the European Parliament and France's cessation of sales. A UN conference may be requested in 1993 to review and potentially amend the Protocol. The Government of France has requested a review conference on the Landmine Protocol to the United Nations Secretary General. The United States is urged to extend the moratorium on sales, transfers, and exports of antipersonnel landmines for an additional three years to set an example for other countries in negotiations. This extension would allow time to consider the results of the UN review conference expected to be held in late 1994 or early 1995. The United States policy aims to prohibit the sale, transfer, and use of antipersonnel landmines through international agreements. Congress suggests ratifying the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and participating in a UN conference to review the Landmine Protocol. Additionally, there is a moratorium on transferring antipersonnel landmines abroad. SEC. 4. MORATORIUM ON TRANSFERS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES ABROAD. No sale, financing, transfer, or export license for antipersonnel landmines under the Arms Export Control Act for three years. No assistance for antipersonnel landmines under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 5. DEFINITION.\n\nThe term \"antipersonnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by person's presence, devices meant to kill unexpectedly, and manually-emplaced munitions actuated remotely or by time lapse."
