    "title": "SB 1458",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 205.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Veterans' principal residence owned by the veteran or spouse is exempt from taxation up to $100,000 if the veteran is blind, lost limbs, or totally disabled due to military service. The exemption increases to $150,000 for eligible veterans with household income below $40,000. A \"veteran\" is defined as someone who has served in the military and been discharged under honorable conditions, or who has died as a result of a service-connected injury or disease while on active duty. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs determines eligibility for federal veterans' health and medical benefits. For a veteran disabled and confined to a hospital or care facility, their property is considered their principal residence if it would be under normal circumstances, as long as it is not rented out. Family members living in the residence are not considered third parties. Property owned by the unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran, who was blind, lost limbs, or was totally disabled, is exempt from taxation up to $100,000 if the veteran qualified for the exemption during their lifetime or died from a service-connected disease. The exemption for an eligible unmarried surviving spouse is increased to $150,000 if their household income is below $40,000, as adjusted for the relevant assessment year. Starting from the 1994-95 fiscal year, property owned by the unmarried surviving spouse of a veteran is exempt from taxation up to $100,000, with an increase to $150,000 if their household income is below $40,000. Starting from the 2012-13 fiscal year, property owned by the unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran, who is confined to a hospital or care facility, is considered their principal residence if not rented out. This includes property owned jointly or separately with the veteran's spouse. Property owned by the veteran, veteran's spouse, or veteran's unmarried surviving spouse with others is considered their principal residence. The property owned by a corporation can be exempt from property taxes if it constitutes the principal residence of a veteran or their surviving spouse who is a shareholder of the corporation. The exemption must be reflected on the local tax roll and reduce the full value of the corporate property. Any reduction in property taxes for the corporation must also result in a corresponding reduction in charges to the qualifying individual. For the purpose of this section, being blind in both eyes is defined as having very poor vision or a severely restricted visual field, losing the use of a limb refers to amputation or loss of function due to specific conditions, and total disability is determined by a 100 percent disability rating from the VA or military service. An exemption granted to a claimant under this section replaces other real property tax exemptions, and if multiple veterans co-own a property, each is entitled to the exemption based on their interest. Starting from January 1, 2002, the household income limit will be adjusted annually based on the California Consumer Price Index. Similarly, starting from January 1, 2006, exemption amounts will also be adjusted annually based on the same index. The amendments to the Revenue and Taxation Code apply from the 2017-18 fiscal year onwards. Section 4831.1 allows corrections to the roll for disabled veterans' exemption within eight years. Section 5097 is amended to require verification for tax refund claims. Tax refund claims must be verified by the payer or their representative and filed within specific timeframes, unless certain conditions apply. After the county assessment appeals board makes a final determination on the application for reduction in assessment or equalization of an escape assessment of the property, a written notice is mailed to the applicant. If the notice does not advise the applicant to file a claim for refund, or if the board fails to hear evidence and make a final determination within a specified time period, a claim for refund may be filed. After the county assessment appeals board makes a final determination on an application for reduction or equalization of an assessment, a written notice is sent to the applicant. If the notice advises the applicant to file a claim for refund within six months, it must be done after the board's final determination. An application for a reduction in an assessment filed within eight years after payment or within 60 days of notice, if related to disabled veterans' exemption. If the applicant states in the application that it is intended to be a claim for refund, it will suffice. Otherwise, a separate claim for refund can be filed within the specified period. Section 5097.3 allows for refunds of taxes paid before or after delinquency within eight years if the amount paid exceeds the amount due due to corrections related to disabled veterans' exemption. The amendments to this section apply to claims for refund filed on or after January 1, 2015. The act mandates reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies and school districts, does not appropriate funds for property tax revenue losses, and enacts a tax levy immediately."
