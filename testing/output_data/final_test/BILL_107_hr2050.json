The Congress acknowledges the underutilization of research in education policy compared to other sectors, with minimal funding allocated for research on effective educational techniques. The 1997 PCAST report recommended increasing education research investment to 0.5 percent for rigorous evaluation of educational hypotheses. A significant body of research exists on the science of learning, but educational materials and practices are often not aligned with this knowledge. There is a cultural divide between education researchers and practitioners, with a recommendation for more research focused on issues important to practitioners. The current education research effort lacks coordination and is in need of more rigorous evaluation. The 1999 report from the National Research Council recommended a national education research program focused on critical questions, contrasting with the current scattered and uncoordinated research efforts. The National Science Foundation will support research on learning in 4 key areas: brain research, behavioral aspects, STEM learning, and complex educational systems. $29 million, $33 million, and $37 million are authorized for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively. Research on learning centers will be supported by the National Science Foundation in various key areas, including brain research, behavioral aspects, STEM learning, and complex educational systems. Funding amounts of $29 million, $33 million, and $37 million are authorized for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively. The Director of the National Science Foundation, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, will develop specific education research priorities within 120 days of the enactment of this Act. Grants will be provided for the establishment of up to 5 Centers of Research on Learning to integrate multidisciplinary teams of researchers, education practitioners, and policymakers to support the research priorities. The Centers of Research on Learning will focus on specific education research priorities developed by the Director, promoting collaborations among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to conduct and synthesize research in relevant areas. Grants will be awarded through a peer-reviewed competition. The National Science Foundation will allocate funds for research on education priorities, collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, planning future research, disseminating research results, and assessing the impact on student performance. Authorization of appropriations includes $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2004. The National Science Foundation is authorized to allocate funds for the Interagency Education Research Initiative, with $28,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $31,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $33,000,000 for fiscal year 2004."
