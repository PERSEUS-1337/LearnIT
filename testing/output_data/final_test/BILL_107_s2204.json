    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women in Trauma Act of 2002\". Congress finds that women may suffer adverse mental health effects from trauma, often due to sexual or domestic violence. Many women with substance abuse and mental health issues have been victims of abuse. Additionally, a significant number of children are victims of physical and sexual abuse each year. Women with serious mental illnesses are over-represented in samples that have experienced trauma. Studies show that a high percentage of women hospitalized for psychiatric disorders have a history of trauma, which can lead to earlier onset and more severe illness, as well as a greater risk of suicide. Trauma exposure is common among individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues, exacerbating the impact of these conditions. Homeless women with mental illness often have a history of severe physical or sexual abuse, while a significant portion of women in prisons and jails have also been victims of abuse. Women with mental health and substance abuse problems often experience violence and trauma-related issues that are not adequately addressed in treatment practices. There is an urgent need for services that directly target trauma in these women. Further research is necessary to develop trauma-sensitive services and improve access to comprehensive therapeutic interventions to support recovery. Grants are being provided to improve treatment for women with histories of trauma under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will award grants to entities for developing new treatment interventions addressing trauma, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. The Secretary will award grants for the development of new treatment interventions for trauma, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders, ensuring equitable distribution across regions and urban/rural areas. Grants may not exceed 5 years and can be renewed. Application process is required. Each entity seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, describing the activities and demonstrating that testing of treatment interventions will be done through community-based programs. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for treatment grants to public and nonprofit entities for community-based mental health and substance abuse services for women with a history of trauma. The Secretary shall ensure equitable distribution of grants among regions and urban/rural areas, with preference for applicants tied to minority communities and offering culturally appropriate services. Grants awarded under this paragraph may not exceed 5 years and can be renewed. Technical assistance will be provided by the Secretary through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health. The Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will provide technical assistance to grant recipients for implementing community-based care programs for trauma, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders. The grant recipients are required to provide services that address trauma, specifically for women, and may include services for their children. They must involve women in all phases of service delivery, offer gender-specific treatment components, and establish avenues for their involvement. The grant recipients must collaborate with various entities to serve women with trauma histories, conduct outreach to minority communities, and provide educational materials or training. The grant recipients can use funds to provide child care for women accessing services to facilitate their participation. Each entity seeking a grant must submit an application. Each entity seeking a grant under this subsection must submit an application to the Secretary with a description of the activities and a plan for evaluation. $100,000,000 is authorized for this subsection. The subsection authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and necessary sums for subsequent years."
