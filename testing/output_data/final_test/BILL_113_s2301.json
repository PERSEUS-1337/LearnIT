The Act titled the \"Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act of 2014\" highlights the severe harm caused by child pornography, emphasizing that it drives production through child sexual abuse and exploitation. The permanent record of abuse in child pornography exacerbates the harm to victims, who suffer ongoing distress knowing that their abuse is being viewed by others. This ongoing harm is a key reason why child pornography is outlawed. The Act emphasizes the severe harm caused by child pornography, stating that it drives production through child sexual abuse. Congress intends to fully compensate victims for all harms caused by each perpetrator. An aggregate causation standard is adopted to address the unique crime of child pornography. Victims should not be limited in receiving restitution. In child pornography cases, victims should receive restitution for all losses caused by each perpetrator, applying an aggregate causation standard while respecting constitutional limits for defendants. SEC. 3. MANDATORY RESTITUTION. Section 2259 of title 18, United States Code is amended to include a definition of the term 'full amount of the victim's losses' which encompasses various costs incurred by the victim such as medical services, therapy, transportation, housing, lost income, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. The definition of 'full amount of the victim's losses' in the amended Section 2259 of title 18, United States Code includes all losses suffered by the victim, including those from sexual acts related to child pornography production. Additionally, the court is required to determine restitution for victims harmed by specific offenses under certain sections of the code. The court must determine and order restitution for the full amount of the victim's losses caused by one or multiple defendants under specific sections of the law. The court must order restitution for the victim's losses, with specific amounts set depending on the offense committed under various sections of the law. Restitution issued under this section may exceed the victim's losses. Defendants ordered to pay restitution are jointly and severally liable. Defendants who have paid the statutory minimum amount can seek contribution from other defendants. The court may allocate payments among liable parties for contribution claims using equitable factors. No action for contribution can be started more than 5 years after the defendant was ordered to pay restitution. Additionally, defendants can seek contribution from other defendants for aggregated losses. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act of 2014 enactment, detailing the Department of Justice's progress in obtaining restitution for victims of specific offenses."
