    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. \"Provisional registration allows for temporary labeling of agricultural products while corrections are made. This amendment applies to various substances such as soil amendments and fertilizers.\" Section 14601 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require registration of differing labels for specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, soil and plant substances, organic input materials, and soil amendments. Registrations are valid for two years with a fee not exceeding $200 per product, except for organic input materials. The registration fee for organic input material is capped at $500 per product to cover additional review time and resources. Funds generated go to the Organic Input Materials Account. The secretary can lower fees based on board recommendations. Registrations require a current license. The secretary may require proof of labeling statements and claims for specialty fertilizers before registering them. Experimental data from scientists, including those from the University of California, may be used as evidence. Proof must relate to California conditions. The secretary may conduct site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes to verify label nutrient guarantees and compliance with National Organic Program standards. Inspections prioritize high-risk products and manufacturers, with the option to use third-party organizations for inspections. Inspection records from third-party organizations must be shared with the secretary, who may also attend inspections. Notification of inspections by third-party organizations must be given at least 72 hours in advance. The secretary has the authority to cancel or refuse registration of specialty fertilizers, agricultural minerals, soil amendments, organic input materials, or plant substances that are harmful, ineffective, or have false claims. Proceedings for cancellation are conducted according to government regulations. Section 14603 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to require a fee of up to $200 for each product label upon renewal, with a $50 penalty per label if not renewed within one month of expiration. Provisional registration for up to six months may be granted for products undergoing renewal. Section 14681 prohibits the distribution of misbranded fertilizing materials, defining misbranding as false or misleading labeling. The distribution of misbranded fertilizing materials is prohibited under Section 14681, which defines misbranding as false or misleading labeling. This includes labeling that is not in compliance with regulations, distributed under a different name, or does not conform to prescribed definitions for plant nutrients. Regulations consider commonly accepted definitions and official fertilizer terms."
