    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 3351 of the Labor Code is amended to define \"Employee\" as every person in the service of an employer, including aliens, minors, elected and appointed paid public officers, and officers of private corporations while rendering service for pay. (d) Any person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling for incidental duties related to the dwelling, including child care, or personal duties not part of the owner's or occupant's business.\n(e) All incarcerated individuals in state penal institutions engaged in assigned work or work under contract. All working members of a partnership or limited liability company receiving wages are covered, with the option for general partners or managing members to exclude themselves. The definition of \"employee\" excludes certain individuals, such as those employed by family members or performing services for aid from religious organizations. (c) Exclusion for deputy clerks or deputy sheriffs appointed for convenience without compensation from the county or municipal corporation. This exclusion does not prevent recourse against a private employer for work-related injuries.\n(d) Exclusion for individuals volunteering at recreational camps operated by nonprofit organizations, receiving only meals, lodging, or transportation as compensation. (e) A person volunteering as a ski patrolman without compensation other than meals, lodging, or ski facilities.\n(f) An employee of a ski lift operator who is off duty and participating in recreational activities on their own.\n(g) A non-employee participating in sports without compensation other than equipment, uniforms, transportation, meals, or incidental expenses. A person eligible for compensation under specific conditions, including those with limited hours or low wages, and individuals performing voluntary services without monetary compensation. A person officiating at amateur sporting events sponsored by a public agency or nonprofit organization may receive a stipend for incidental expenses, but no other remuneration. (k) A student athlete participating in non-professional sporting events sponsored by a public agency or college, receiving only benefits like equipment, uniforms, and expenses.\n(l) An out-of-state law enforcement officer deputized to work under a California peace officer.\n(m) An officer from Oregon, Nevada, or Arizona State Police acting as a peace officer in California. (n) A person serving as a sports official for intercollegiate or interscholastic events, public agencies, or nonprofit organizations. Includes umpires, referees, judges, scorekeepers, and timekeepers.\n(o) An owner-builder participating in a mutual self-help housing program sponsored by a nonprofit corporation. An officer or board member owning 15% of a corporation's stock can waive rights under this chapter by submitting a written waiver to the insurance carrier, effective upon acceptance and until a written withdrawal is provided. An individual who is a general partner of a partnership or a managing member of a limited liability company can waive rights under this chapter by submitting a written waiver to the insurance carrier, effective upon acceptance and until a written withdrawal is provided. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts would be due to the creation, elimination, or change of penalties for crimes or infractions."
