The term \"Administrator\" in the Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations Refinancing Act refers to the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. \"Capital investment\" is a capitalized cost funded by Federal appropriations for projects or facilities that require repayment through the sale of electric power or services, excluding certain types of investments. The term \"new capital investment\" refers to a capital investment for a project placed in service after September 30, 1995, while \"old capital investment\" refers to a capital investment for a project placed in service before October 1, 1995. The \"repayment date\" is the end of the period within which the Administrator's rates are to assure repayment. The Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for old and new capital investments, based on prevailing market yields. The Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for capital investments based on prevailing market yields, calculated on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States with periods to maturity comparable to the repayment date for the new investment. SEC. 3. NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. Effective October 1, 1995, old capital investments have new principal amounts calculated based on the present value of old payment amounts and a fraction of $100,000,000. The Administrator, with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury, determines new principal amounts and interest rates. For old capital investments, \"old payment amounts\" refer to the annual interest and principal that would have been paid to the United States Treasury from October 1, 1995, if this Act were not enacted. The principal is repaid based on assigned repayment dates, and interest is also paid accordingly. The interest rates assigned to old capital investments before October 1, 1993, were determined by the Administrator or the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields. The interest rates for old capital investments before October 1, 1993, were determined based on prevailing market yields, with periods to maturity comparable to the fiscal year start to repayment date. SEC. 4. The unpaid balance on the new principal amount established for an old capital investment bears interest annually at the Treasury rate until repaid. SEC. 5. The repayment date for the new principal amount is no earlier than the repayment date for the old capital investment. SEC. 6. The Administrator may not prepay more than $100,000,000 of new principal amounts of old capital investments before their repayment dates from October 1, 1995, through September 30, 2000. SEC. 7. Interest rates for new capital investments during construction. Interest on new capital investments during construction is calculated based on construction expenditures and accrued interest, with the one-year rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Administrator is not required to pay the interest during construction. The curr_chunk states that there are obligations of the United States with periods to maturity of approximately one year. SEC. 8 outlines the interest rates for new capital investments, while SEC. 9 amends the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act regarding appropriated amounts. SEC. 9 amends the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Settlement Act by appropriating specific amounts to the Administrator annually without fiscal year limitation, as long as payments are made to the Tribes under the settlement agreement.

Federal Claims; and \"Tribes\" means the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a federally recognized Indian Tribe. SEC. 10. CONTRACT PROVISIONS. In contracts with the Administrator for selling electric power, provisions must be included after September 30, 1995, regarding establishing rates based on old capital investments and interest rates. After September 30, 1995, contracts with the Administrator for selling electric power must include provisions for rates based on old capital investments and interest rates. Payments of principal on old capital investments reduce the outstanding balance, while interest payments are credited against the appropriate account. Apart from necessary charges for repayment and interest, no additional fees can be charged for returning funds to the United States Treasury. The contract provisions required by this Act specify that payments for old capital investments must be made to the United States Treasury as repayment. Amounts provided under section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, are the sole source for payment of judgments or settlements. The provisions do not prevent the Administrator from recovering taxes imposed on electric utilities or affect the Administrator's authority under applicable law. The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act allows for the allocation of costs and benefits, including fish and wildlife costs, to rates or resources, and the design of rates. SEC. 11. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not affect the Administrator's obligation to repay capital investments from net proceeds. It also allows early repayment of capital investments. SEC. 12.

The Administrator will conduct studies to assess the impact of rate increases on customer base, identify alternative power sources, estimate potential customer loss, and determine past and future costs for compliance with the Endangered Species Act. Results will be submitted to Congress within 180 days.
