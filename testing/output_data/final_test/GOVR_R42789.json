    "content": "Softwood lumber, produced from conifer trees, is defined in the 2006 agreement based on four tariff items under the HTSUS, primarily used for residential construction. The demand for softwood lumber is driven by the U.S. housing market, especially new construction and remodeling. The softwood lumber industry faced challenges as the real estate market crashed in 2007, leading to a decline in new home construction starts and the use of softwood lumber in the United States. Sawmill capacity and production also decreased significantly. Despite a modest recovery since 2010, consumption of softwood lumber remains below pre-2000 levels. Lumber prices are largely price-inelastic, meaning small changes in construction demand result in significant price fluctuations. However, the price of lumber does not impact supply or demand. Wood products make up a small portion of construction costs, with framing lumber costing 3% of the median price of a new home in 2014. The price of lumber dropped after the housing market crash in 2009 but has steadily risen since the expiration of the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement. The price of lumber has risen steadily, exceeding $400 MBF in March and April 2017. Adjusted for inflation, lumber prices remain relatively low compared to the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Major stakeholders in the US dispute include timber and lumber producers, as well as lumber consumers. In Canada, stakeholders include Canadian lumber producers and provincial governments. US lumber producers support trade restrictions on Canadian imports, while US lumber consumers oppose restrictions for access to affordable lumber. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) represents the interests of home builders. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) argues that American home buyers bear the cost of trade restrictions on Canadian lumber imports. They believe that unrestricted trade benefits the U.S. economy and that restrictions hinder innovation in U.S. lumber production. NAHB and other partners have formed the American Alliance of Lumber Consumers to advocate for trade on lumber. However, U.S. lumber consumers do not have standing in the dispute under U.S. trade remedy laws. Canada has been the largest foreign supplier of softwood lumber in the U.S. since 1965. The United States has heavily relied on Canadian softwood lumber imports, accounting for 95% since 1965. Canadian imports increased significantly over the years, peaking at more than 35% of the U.S. market in 1995-1996. The main issue in the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute is the allegation of Canadian government subsidies benefiting Canadian lumber producers unfairly in the U.S. The U.S. Lumber Coalition alleges that Canadian subsidies give lumber producers an unfair advantage in the U.S. market, causing harm to U.S. producers. Comparing the competitiveness of U.S. and Canadian lumber producers is challenging due to differences in land ownership, timber supply, pricing, and measurement systems. In Canada, 94% of timberlands are crown lands owned by federal and provincial governments, with provinces owning 90%, federal government 2%, and 6% in private ownership. U.S. timberlands have 42% government ownership (31% federal, 9% state, 2% local) and 58% private ownership. Canadian lumber industry relies on public timber sources, while U.S. industry relies more on private sources. Each Canadian province has its own forestry laws and regulations. Quebec enacted forestry reforms in 2013. Quebec enacted forestry reforms in 2013 to employ the \"exit ramp\" provisions of the 2006 SLA. Provinces require management plans for forested areas prepared by certified foresters and allocate timber harvest through tenure agreements. These agreements may be long-term or short-term, with various management obligations. Provinces also have agreements for selling timber to small or family-operated firms. The United States and Canada have different land management regimes. In the United States, lumber prices are determined through competitive markets and auctions, ensuring fair market values for timber. In contrast, Canada uses leases to allocate timber, charging fees for leases and timber harvests, including a flat annual fee and stumpage fee per unit of volume harvested. In Canada, stumpage fees for timber harvesting are determined administratively and adjusted periodically to reflect market prices. Quebec implemented changes to its pricing system in 2013, with 25% of the annual harvest sold at auction to influence pricing for the remaining 75%. This system may not always align with market prices due to agency personnel setting fees. The U.S. lumber industry argues that Canadian provinces set stumpage fees below market value to make Canadian producers more competitive. Allegations of Canadian lumber production being subsidized by the government stem from claims that Canadian stumpage prices are lower than market prices in the U.S. This could give Canadian firms a cost advantage over U.S. firms, potentially constituting a subsidy. The dispute over stumpage fees between the U.S. and Canada is inconclusive, with conflicting reports on which country has higher fees. The U.S. International Trade Commission and Trade Administration have found differences in fees since 1982, but other analyses show little to no difference. One factor contributing to the contradictions is the different measurement standards used for timber in the two countries. In the U.S., timber is measured in board feet, while in Canada, it is measured in cubic meters. The conversion rate for lumber from logs varies based on log diameter, affecting the resulting price. Forests are diverse with different tree species, sizes, and qualities, impacting stumpage fees. Comparisons between U.S. and Canadian forests consider species mix and tree sizes. In U.S. federal timber sales, competitive bidding is limited to the dominant species, affecting stumpage fees. Differences in management responsibilities, road construction, and labor compensation also impact fees. Comparing timber prices in different areas is challenging due to these factors. The United States and Canada have had a long-standing dispute over softwood lumber trade since the 1930s, leading to trade protection measures in the 1980s. From 2001 to 2006, the US collected $5.3 billion in duties on Canadian lumber, which was resolved with the signing of the Softwood Lumber Agreement in 2006. About $4 billion was returned to importers, with the rest split between the US lumber industry and joint initiatives, ending court claims. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) resolved long-standing disputes between the United States and Canada over softwood lumber trade. It included provisions to dismiss court claims, establish export charges on Canadian lumber, and set up a third-party arbitration system for disputes. The agreement also imposed volume restraints on Canadian producing regions to reduce export charges as lumber prices fell. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) between the United States and Canada expired on October 12, 2015, without formal negotiations for a new agreement. The U.S. lumber industry identified flaws in the arbitration process and favored letting the agreement expire. The Canadian government and producers support free trade but are open to agreements ensuring access to the U.S. market. Trade litigation was prevented until after October 12, 2016, following a one-year cooling-off period. President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau announced discussions to explore options regarding the Softwood Lumber Agreement dispute, with negotiating goals to limit Canadian exports to an agreed U.S. market share. The negotiations between President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau aimed to limit Canadian softwood lumber exports to a specified U.S. market share. The discussions focused on implementing a market restraint mechanism, with Canada proposing an export tax to achieve the goal. However, U.S. producers favored a quota-only system, arguing that an export tax would penalize Canadian exporters without guaranteeing the desired market share. The Canadian proposal also included options for provincial flexibility in achieving market access goals. U.S. producers prefer a quota-only system for Canadian softwood lumber exports. Canada proposed a 32% market share, while U.S. producers initially sought 28% gradually lowered to 22%. Canada also wanted exclusions for private-held timber and the ability for provinces to exit market access restraints. Negotiations between Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in 2017 led to a postponement of final determinations to facilitate talks. The Committee Overseeing Action for Lumber International Trade Investigations petitioned the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to initiate AD/CVD proceedings against Canadian softwood lumber. ITA and ITC made affirmative determinations, leading to final determinations being announced after failed negotiations. The ITA found a subsidy of 3.02% to 24.12% on major companies and a rate of 19.88% for others. U.S. Customs and Border Protection suspended liquidation, requiring cash deposits for potential duties. Retroactive duties may be imposed on some companies. Preliminary dumping determination was made on June 26, 2017. The ITA imposed preliminary dumping duties ranging from 4.59% to 7.72% on specific companies, with an all-other rate of 6.87%. Retroactive dumping duties will apply to companies subject to the all-other rate. Lumber products from certain provinces were exempted. Final AD/CVD determinations on November 2, 2017, resulted in dumping margins of 3.20% to 8.89% for specific firms and 6.58% for all others. Critical circumstances were found for some firms, triggering retroactive duties. On December 7, 2017, ITC determined that practices found by ITA caused \"material injury\" to the U.S. lumber industry. Commerce is expected to issue AD and CVD orders equivalent to the calculated subsidy or dumping margin. Canada has challenged the U.S. trade remedy actions at WTO and NAFTA dispute settlement to determine compatibility with agreements. Canada has initiated NAFTA Chapter 19 actions to review final CVD and AD duties imposed by the U.S. investigating authorities. Panelists are appointed to assess the consistency of these decisions with trade remedy laws within 315 days. Additionally, Canada has requested consultations with the U.S. regarding softwood lumber duties, taking the first step towards a WTO case. Canada has requested consultations with the U.S. regarding softwood lumber duties, leading to a WTO case. The U.S. blocked Canada's first request for DS panels but the second request was granted. Congress may influence the softwood lumber dispute settlement through NAFTA renegotiation. President Trump has vowed to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, subject to Trade Promotion Authority. Congress has the opportunity to influence NAFTA renegotiation by examining issues such as export log restrictions and dispute settlement panels. Members may seek to shape an agreement within the context of NAFTA itself, including the removal of certain provisions. The softwood lumber dispute between the U.S. and Canada may lead to renewed antidumping and countervailing duties. U.S. lumber producers claim they have been injured by Canadian subsidies, such as provincial stumpage fees. This could result in trade remedy litigation, appeals to the World Trade Organization, and exploration of a new export restraint agreement. In Canada, 90% of timberland is owned by provinces and allocated to lumber producers under long-term agreements with stumpage fees. These fees are set administratively and may not reflect market values, leading to criticism that they are kept low for profitable production regardless of market conditions. The Canadian stumpage fees are significantly lower compared to cross-border prices, with adjustments made for differences in timber measurement systems, tree species, sizes, grades, and purchaser requirements. The Canadian share of the U.S. softwood lumber market has grown substantially over the past 60 years, while U.S. lumber production for domestic consumption has increased slowly. Injury to the U.S. lumber industry remains a complex issue. Imports of Canadian lumber into the U.S. have increased significantly over the past decades, reaching over 18 BBF in 1999. However, under the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement, Canadian imports declined to around 28% due to decreased demand in the U.S. housing market. The dispute over lumber imports from Canada may also be influenced by conflicting trade policies and interest-group politics within the U.S. lumber industry. The U.S. lumber industry is more organized and influential than U.S. lumber consumers, who feel the cost impacts of trade protection measures. Environmental laws and policies, as well as cross-border firm integration, complicate the dispute over Canadian lumber imports. The definition of \"softwood lumber\" subject to the Softwood Lumber Agreement was a key issue in the 2006 agreement. Hardwood and softwood species are categorized based on their density, with softwoods belonging to the order Coniferales and hardwoods to the phylum Anthophyta. Softwoods, such as conifers, are typically evergreens with needle-like leaves, while hardwoods, like flowering plants, are often deciduous. Despite some exceptions, softwood lumber refers to lumber produced from conifer species. Lumber is sawn from logs and categorized based on dimensions. Boards are less than 2 inches thick, dimension lumber is 2 to 5 inches thick, and timbers are at least 5 inches thick and wide. Timbers are lumber products at least 5 inches thick and wide, primarily used for residential construction. Softwood lumber is defined in Annex 1A of the SLA using specific tariff items under the HTSUS. Softwood lumber products are defined in Annex 1A of the SLA using specific tariff items under the HTSUS. These items include various types of lumber with specific edge or face treatments, excluding certain products like logs, poles, wood fencing, and fabricated wood products such as windows and doors."
