    "content": "U.S. farmers grow over 250 types of specialty crops, accounting for $53.3 billion in 2006. The USDA does not traditionally subsidize specialty crops like it does bulk commodities, but Congress has authorized programs to support the sector's growth and economic health. The 1996 farm act and the 2002 farm act prohibited specialty crop growers from planting fruit and vegetable crops on program acres. Government programs involving specialty crops extend beyond the USDA to agencies like the Department of Commerce, U.S. International Trade Commission, FDA, EPA, and Department of Labor. These agencies oversee safety, trade, and labor issues related to specialty crops. The Department of Labor administers programs to support growers in harvesting specialty crops and regulate working conditions. Former USDA Secretary Ann Veneman established a Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee to address industry issues and provide suggestions for USDA programs. The Committee includes members from various sectors of the industry and holds open meetings announced by the Agricultural Marketing Service. The USDA's Risk Management Agency, Farm Services Agency, and Agricultural Marketing Service administer programs for specialty crop sector losses. The federal crop insurance program is managed by the Risk Management Agency, with coverage for about 50 specialty crops. Producers can receive catastrophic insurance for free, with options to buy up coverage levels. Producers can purchase additional coverage beyond the catastrophic level with subsidized premiums from the federal government. Revenue insurance is available for certain crops, providing indemnity payments for income lost due to poor production or low market prices. The USDA determines which crops and geographical areas are covered by different types of insurance based on factors like farmer demand and risk levels. Pilot programs are frequently offered for new crops or regions. The USDA's noninsured assistance program (NAP) provides direct payments up to $100,000 per person for producers of commercial crops not covered by federal crop insurance. Specialty crops like mushrooms, flowers, and Christmas trees are eligible for NAP. The program is administered by the Farm Service Agency under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The USDA's noninsured assistance program (NAP) provides direct payments up to $100,000 per person for producers of commercial crops not covered by federal crop insurance, such as Christmas trees. An individual producer is ineligible if gross revenues from the qualifying crop exceed $2 million. NAP is a mandatory program funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. FSA administers low-interest emergency disaster loans to help farmers recover from production or physical losses, including destruction of fruit trees. Eligible growers can borrow up to 100% of actual losses (up to $500,000) at a 3.75% interest rate through the EM loan program. Funding for the program comes from annual appropriations acts, with additional support provided through emergency supplemental appropriations. Market loss payment programs have also been authorized for apple growers, offering income assistance totaling $269 million for the 1999 and 2000 crop years. Potato growers were also eligible for disaster assistance. Specialty crop growers have received assistance through ad hoc crop loss disaster programs since 1989, totaling nearly $55.4 billion for all crops. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 and the Produce Agency Act of 1937 protect producers in the produce industry from unfair practices. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) requires dealers, brokers, and traders in perishable agricultural commodities to obtain a license and follow fair trading practices. Violators risk license suspension or revocation. PACA also established a statutory trust to protect sellers in case of buyer non-payment. Additionally, PACA offers an administrative dispute resolution process and is funded by user fees. AMS administers programs to help the produce industry expand its markets. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes AMS to oversee marketing orders and agreements in the produce industry. These programs aim to expand markets through grading, quality certification, and standardization services. Currently, there are 30 active marketing orders and agreements in place. Currently, there are 30 active marketing orders and agreements covering specified fruit, vegetable, and tree nut crops. These are managed by administrative committees of local growers and handlers, with regulations published in the Federal Register. The activities are financed by assessment fees collected from handlers, and AMS uses funds from annual USDA appropriations acts to ensure legal operation. The USDA oversees research and promotion programs funded by specialty crop industries, with eight programs currently managed by national boards. These programs collect assessments from domestic handlers and importers to support activities like promotion, market research, and new product development. In FY2005, $428 million in assessments was collected. In FY2005, AMS collected $428 million in assessments, with approximately $33 million from fruit and vegetable industries. AMS provides grading services for producers and handlers to ensure fair returns on high-quality produce. Grading is voluntary unless required by a marketing order, export regulations, or federal purchase programs. AMS grading is necessary for imported commodities under marketing orders to meet U.S. standards. In FY2005, AMS graded or supervised the grading of 17 billion pounds of processed fruits and vegetables and 65 billion pounds of fresh produce nationwide. They offer lower-cost alternative programs for fresh produce packers and a voluntary pilot program for food contamination prevention since 1996. The Qualified Through Verification program, similar to HACCP, encourages preventive measures against food contamination in the produce industry. FDA and NACMCF support this approach for food safety. AMS pilot program focuses on public health but is not regulatory. FDA has authority to regulate produce industries for safety and labeling. Since 1979, AMS has been responsible for creating consistent product specifications for federal food procurement. The Food Quality Assurance program aims to streamline food purchasing for various government agencies and clarify bid specifications. AMS also offers marketing services for locally produced farm commodities and conducts research activities. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts research and activities to enhance direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing channel development, and post-harvest technology adoption. The agency also administers the Farmers' Market Promotion program to increase direct producer-to-consumer sales opportunities. Eligible entities can apply for grants to support farmers' markets. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides support for farmers' markets through research and technical assistance. The agency also administers the Federal-State Marketing Improvement program (FSMIP) and the Value-added Producer Grant program. In FY2006, AMS received $1 million in funding, while FSMIP received $1.3 million in appropriations. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000, amended by the 2002 farm act, authorizes a grant program for developing marketing plans and providing working capital for value-added agricultural products. Matching funds are required, and various agricultural entities are eligible to apply. Specialty crop producers have been frequent beneficiaries of the grants. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 established a National Organic Program administered by AMS, supporting producers, processors, and handlers. Producers, processors, and handlers must follow detailed production practices outlined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations to market products as organic. Private and state certification agents accredited by AMS certify organic operations, with products bearing the \"USDA Organic\" seal. The cost of operating the National Organic Program (NOP) is covered by fees charged for accrediting certification agents. Congress has provided funds to help defray certification costs for organic farmers, processors, and handlers. The USDA Organic program requires certification for producers and handlers, with AMS providing cost-share grants to cover up to 75% of certification costs. In 2006, $1 million was available for cost-share grants, and Congress appropriates funds annually for NOP administration. U.S. farmers grew certified organic vegetables, fruit, herbs, and nursery crops on specific acres in 2005, with fresh produce like lettuce, tomatoes, and apples being top-selling organic crops. Retail sales of organic products have been increasing. The USDA Organic program requires certification for producers and handlers, with AMS providing cost-share grants. Retail sales of organic products have been increasing at a rate of 20% annually since the 1990s. AMS collects market information for various agricultural commodities and disseminates it online. Congress passed a supplemental appropriation bill in August 2001 to address low net cash income in the farm sector. Congress passed a supplemental appropriation bill in August 2001 to address low net cash income in the farm sector (P.L. 107-25). A total assistance package of $5.5 billion in CCC funds included $159.4 million specifically for specialty crop producers. Each state received a base amount, with the remaining funds distributed through block grants based on specialty crop production value. The funds supported over 1,400 projects nationwide, with marketing projects being the most utilized. In December 2004, President Bush signed the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-465), authorizing block grants to states for specialty crop sector support activities. The annual appropriation was $44.5 million in fiscal years 2005 through 2009. USDA purchases and donates non-price-supported commodities like fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts for consumption. USDA purchases and donates non-price-supported commodities, including fruit, vegetable, and tree nut products, for domestic nutrition and food assistance programs. This helps nutritionally vulnerable recipients eat a healthy diet and balances supply and demand. USDA also provides assistance through programs like Food Stamp, WIC, farmers' market programs, and cash grants to organizations operating child nutrition programs. The USDA provides cash grants to organizations running child nutrition programs to purchase fruit, vegetable, and tree nut products. They also support projects to bring fresh fruits and vegetables into schools. Three USDA agencies collaborate on these programs, with the Food and Nutrition Service being the primary agency. In FY2001, close to $7 billion from domestic programs supported the consumption of fruits and vegetables by children and low-income individuals and families. The USDA spent $7 billion on supporting fruit and vegetable consumption through various programs, representing 20% of all FNS expenditures. This support included direct purchases of commodities for distribution to individuals and donation to child nutrition programs. The purchases encompassed a wide range of fruit and vegetable products, including juices, fresh, frozen, dried, and canned items. The USDA purchases commodities based on entitlement requirements and bonus buys to stabilize markets. Entitlement purchases are based on recipient preferences, while bonus buys are influenced by market conditions and include fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts not typically on entitlement lists. Most funding for USDA commodity purchases is mandatory, with specific levels dictated by law. Funding for commodity procurement for TEFAP comes from Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, and annual appropriations directives. In FY2001, approximately $250 million in fruit and vegetable products were provided to child nutrition programs. Additionally, donations of fruits and vegetables to various programs were valued at $314 million, $38 million, $28 million, and $17 million. Special rules require at least $50 million worth of fresh fruits and vegetables to be provided annually. The \"DoD Fresh\" program provides $50 million worth of fresh fruits and vegetables annually through a partnership with the Department of Defense. USDA administers food assistance programs like EBT cards for purchasing food. Food stamp benefits can be used for any food item, with $3.3 billion spent on fruits and vegetables in FY2001. The WIC program gives vouchers for specific food items, including fruit juices and carrots. The May 2002 report estimated that $467 million (16% of benefit spending) was used for fruit and vegetable products. Additionally, federal cash assistance to child nutrition providers, such as schools and child care centers, accounted for about $2.3 billion spent on fruit and vegetable products. Farmers' market programs for WIC recipients and seniors also provided $35 million to $40 million annually in vouchers for fresh fruits and vegetables. The 2002 farm act established a fresh fruit and vegetable pilot project with $6 million in funding to provide free produce to schools. The 2004 law expanded the project, making it permanent with $9 million in annual funding. USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service provides U.S. commodities to needy countries, with fruits and vegetables accounting for a small portion of overseas food aid. In the decade from 1992 to 2002, overseas food aid programs included apples, dehydrated potatoes, and dehydrated vegetables. In FY2002, the CCC purchased $510,000 of dehydrated potatoes and $48,000 of dehydrated vegetables for donation to needy countries through the Food for Progress program. The Foreign Agricultural Service administers programs to help agricultural interests create, expand, and maintain foreign markets for U.S. exports, supported by annual allocations of mandatory funds from the CCC. Congress scrutinizes and occasionally acts to increase or restrict funding for export promotion programs. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers export promotion programs with annual appropriations from Congress. FAS provides information on foreign import regulations, trade policies, and partners with organizations to promote exports of agricultural products overseas. The Market Access Program (MAP) allows FAS to collaborate with commodity organizations and agribusinesses to market and promote U.S. agricultural products internationally. The Market Access Program (MAP) was created by Congress in 1978 to promote U.S. agricultural products overseas. The program's funding gradually increased from $100 million in FY2002 to $200 million by FY2006. In FY2006, $50 million was allocated to trade organizations promoting U.S. fruits and vegetables in foreign markets. The USDA shares costs with U.S. trade organizations for overseas marketing. The 2002 farm act authorizes the FMD program with a $34.5 million allocation in FY2006. The program focuses on bulk commodity crops, not fruits, vegetables, or tree nuts. The Quality Samples Program (QSP) supports export sales by providing samples to foreign importers, with a $1.8 million allocation in FY2006. The CCC allocated $1.8 million for the Quality Samples Program (QSP) in FY2006, with $757,000 supporting the distribution of various samples to potential importers. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program, established by the 2002 farm act, received $2 million annually through FY2006 from CCC funds to support exports of cultivated plants and their products. FAS awards TASC funds competitively to eligible organizations for projects addressing trade barriers, such as seminars, study tours, and pre-export clearance programs. The Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorizes annual appropriations of $2 million through FY2009 for projects to improve fruit exports. FAS administers CCC export credit guarantee programs to facilitate foreign governments' purchases of U.S. commodities, guaranteeing payments due from foreign banks to U.S. exporters. This makes importing from the U.S. more attractive to potential purchasers. CCC determines eligible countries, banks, debt levels, and commodities for the program. The Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorizes annual appropriations for projects to improve fruit exports. Various guarantee programs are available for different time frames under SCGP, GSM-102, and GSM-103. U.S. law provides remedies for unfair competition from foreign imports through the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Tariff Act of 1930 allows for levying antidumping duties on imports sold below fair value, with countervailing duties authorized for subsidized imports. U.S. specialty crop producers have petitioned for investigations into dumping, with examples including a successful antidumping petition by the U.S. Apple Association in 2000 and an unsuccessful petition by California grape growers in 2001. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture. Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the USDA agency tasked with safeguarding U.S. agriculture from plant pests and diseases. Until 2002, APHIS managed the Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection program (AQI) at U.S. ports of entry. Following the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, the inspection function and over 2,600 APHIS inspectors were transferred to DHS Border and Transportation Security. The USDA transferred $208 million to DHS in FY2005 ($211 million estimated in FY2006) for AQI inspection activities at U.S. ports of entry. APHIS administers an AQI program inspecting cargo and conveyances from Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the mainland, conducting pest and disease exclusion activities, developing protocols for plant materials in trade, maintaining quarantine facilities, and supporting scientific programs. The APHIS AQI program receives approximately $27 million annually from Congress to support agricultural exports, including specialty crops. The program focuses on detecting and identifying high-risk plant pathogens and conducting pre-export testing at the National Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. Certification of products from disease-free areas is crucial for maintaining export markets for specialty crops. APHIS lab's certification of products from disease-free areas allows reopening of overseas markets for growers and processors of fruit, nursery products, and specialty crops. APHIS conducts a program to protect the U.S. citrus industry from Mediterranean fruit flies, involving interception of pests on incoming cargo and eradication efforts in infested areas. This program includes raising sterile fruit flies in labs and releasing them to combat infestations. APHIS uses sterile fruit flies to combat infestations, gradually decreasing wild population's reproductive success. This technique is also used preventively in California, Florida, and Texas to avoid costly eradication programs. Wide-scale Medfly eradications in the past cost $33 million annually. Congress allocated $60 million in FY2006 for fruit fly control. APHIS's Trade Issues Resolution and Management program supports U.S. agricultural trade and market access. APHIS works internationally to ensure pest-free products for export to the United States, participates in trade agreement negotiations, represents the U.S. in setting SPS standards, and manages a program with a budget of $11.6 million in FY2003. APHIS is responsible for certifying U.S. specialty crop exports to meet other countries' phytosanitary regulations. The Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act requires APHIS to reduce the backlog in export permits and establish a peer review process for scientific risk assessments. APHIS also partners in the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey to detect foreign pests, diseases, and weeds. The CAPS/NAPIS system compiles detailed pest information into maps and electronic databases for early detection. APHIS is increasing pest detection capabilities by hiring specialists, developing a reporting network, and stationing personnel in foreign countries to provide field surveillance and timely warnings for import policy setting. The NAPIS database provides field surveillance and timely warning of changing pest situations, aiding DHS in setting priorities for border inspections. It is a crucial resource for foreign importers of U.S. agricultural products, with over 75 countries accessing the website monthly to ensure the pest-free status of goods. Congress allocated $27 million in FY2006 for the pest detection program, which is mainly operated by APHIS in a consultative role to assist state departments of agriculture in control and eradication programs. In emergency situations, the Secretary can use CCC funds for immediate response when state resources are overwhelmed. In emergency situations, the Secretary can use CCC funds for immediate response when state resources are overwhelmed. In FY2005, $231.2 million was transferred to APHIS for emergency programs for plant and animal pest and disease management, in addition to $343 million in appropriated funds. Specialty crop pest and disease eradication programs in FY2005 included citrus canker ($97.5 million), citrus greening ($600,000), and fruit flies ($19.9 million). $100.7 million was allocated to the Emerging Plant Pest (EPP) program for surveying, reporting, and controlling emerging pest threats. In its annual budget requests, APHIS generally proposes discontinuing CCC funding for pest problems that persist beyond the initial emergency phase and continuing control efforts as a federal-state cooperative effort under EPP. The United States has a nationwide network of public agricultural laboratories and academic institutions supported by annual USDA appropriations. The Department's in-house science agency, ARS, conducts basic and applied research on subjects important to specialty crops and federal nutrition research. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the lead agency for federal nutrition research, funded through federal appropriations, pass-through funds from other agencies, and contributions from trade groups and universities. In FY2006, ARS spent millions on research related to fruit, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) links USDA to state agricultural research components. CSREES administers USDA block grants for state-level research and extension programs, which are crucial for sustaining ongoing projects. Additionally, CSREES oversees competitive research grant programs, with a focus on specialty crop research receiving $70-80 million annually in federal funds. The 2004 Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act prioritizes specialty crop research and establishes a subcommittee to address sector needs. USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) gathers data on local agriculture to produce over 70 reports, including real-time production and market information. NASS also conducts the U.S. Census of Agriculture every five years, providing crucial information for Congress in shaping farm policy laws. NASS's FY2006 appropriation was $140.7 million. The Economic Research Service (ERS) is USDA's economic analysis agency, focusing on agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural development issues. ERS received a $76 million appropriation in FY2006. Specialty crop industry is concerned about finding alternatives to methyl bromide (MeBr), a widely used pesticidal gas. Successful production of strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, and ornamental nursery crops relies on MeBr for pre-planting soil fumigation. Many commodities depend on MeBr for pest control in storage and require certification for export. The specialty crop industry is seeking alternatives to methyl bromide (MeBr) due to its harmful effects on the ozone layer. International and domestic regulations control its production and trade. Research is being conducted to find effective alternatives, with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) leading the efforts and investing $18 million in FY2006. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorized $5 million annually for USDA to prioritize methyl bromide alternative research. FDA ensures food labeling accuracy and safety, covering all food except meat, poultry, and certain egg products. FDA provides guidance on food safety practices and regulations, conducting inspections to monitor compliance. The FDA is authorized to inspect food establishments and vehicles for compliance with regulations. Inspections occur every five years due to limited funding and staffing. The FDA can detain food products during investigations but needs the Justice Department for injunctions or seizures. Mandatory recalls are not within the FDA's authority, relying on firms to voluntarily recall contaminated foods. The FDA reviews and approves food additives to ensure they meet safety standards. The FDA enforces EPA-set standards for pesticides in food and inspects only a small percentage of annual food imports. After 9/11, a law was passed requiring food establishments to register with FDA and provide detailed shipment information. Full implementation of these policies was achieved in 2005. The FDA implemented new policies in 2005 to improve food import inspections by increasing information on shippers and shipment contents. Despite these regulations, the overall percentage of inspections is not expected to change. Food safety is crucial for the specialty crop industry due to the vulnerability of produce to contamination, especially since it is often consumed raw. The FDA reported a significant increase in foodborne illness outbreaks associated with fresh produce from 1998 to 2004, partly attributed to consumer preference for fruits and vegetables. The FDA reported a significant increase in foodborne illness outbreaks related to fresh produce from 1998 to 2004, attributed to consumer preference for pre-cut produce and use in fast-food restaurants. Outbreaks were linked to leafy greens, sprouts, tomatoes, and green onions. FDA issued an action plan in response to the outbreaks, building upon previous initiatives to ensure produce safety. The FDA issued an action plan in 2004 to prevent contamination of sprouted alfalfa seeds and other types of sprouts, as well as to require preventive steps against fresh fruit juice contamination. The plan includes 40 steps for the produce industry to take under FDA guidance, covering operating procedures, regulations, educational outreach, incident response, communication in marketing chains, and promotion of research. FDA, in cooperation with the EPA, determines pesticide use on fruit and vegetable crops and sets chemical residue levels for human health safety. USDA regulations impose the same standards on countries exporting produce to the US, with FDA responsible for inspecting imports for safety. Since 1991, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service has run a residue testing program to collect data on pesticides in fruits and vegetables. The Pesticide Data Program (PDP) collects samples from over 600 sites in 10 states, representing exposure in the U.S. diet. Over 10,000 produce samples were tested in FY2005. Congress has allowed this program since World War I. The H-2A program allows temporary immigration of foreign workers for seasonal agricultural labor when enough U.S. workers are not available. The program is administered by the Department of Labor, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of State. Employers must show a lack of domestic workers and no adverse impact on U.S. workers. Visa determinations are handled by Homeland Security, and foreign offices issue visas. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers programs to benefit domestic agricultural workers, providing job training and employment assistance to increase income and stability. DOL also monitors farm labor contractors and ensures workplace safety. Special provisions exist for the education of farmworkers' children under the No Child Left Behind Act. Special provisions exist for the education of farmworkers' children under the No Child Left Behind Act."
