    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for K-12 education, last reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. Title I-A program, funded at $15.5 billion for FY2017, assists educationally disadvantaged children with supplementary services in schools with high poverty levels. Title I-A grants also come with requirements affecting various aspects of K-12 education. The Title I-A program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act determines grants to local educational agencies based on four funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). The Basic Grant formula, the primary vehicle for Title I-A funds, allocates the largest share of funds and has been in place since FY1966. Other formulas have been added over time to provide additional funds to specific areas. The addition of Grant and EFIG formulas to Title I-A provides extra funds to areas with high numbers or percentages of children from low-income families. Title I-A grants have become more targeted on concentrations of poverty as these formulas have grown. This report discusses key issues in the evolution of the Title I-A formulas, highlighting tensions in fund allocation. It traces the evolution of the formulas in statute and reasons for changes expressed in committee reports and debates. The report discusses the evolution of Title I-A formulas, with historical appropriations data and changes to the funding formulas. Initially, funds were allocated through Basic Grants, but additional formulas were added to target supplemental funding to areas with concentrations of low-income students. Since FY1966, Title I-A funding formulas have evolved to target areas with high concentrations of students from low-income families. The formulas have included population and expenditure factors, with changes over the years impacting state and LEA grant amounts. The focus remains on targeting supplemental funding to areas with higher numbers or percentages of children from low-income families. Congress has periodically adjusted Title I-A funding formulas to target areas with high poverty concentrations, including state minimum grant provisions and hold harmless provisions. These changes aim to ensure that LEAs receive sufficient funding annually, although they may not always align with the goal of targeting funds to areas with high poverty concentrations. The history of the Title I-A program focuses on providing funds to areas with poverty concentrations. Congress had to define poverty, choose data sources, and decide on categories for Title I-A grants, impacting state and LEA funding amounts. Initial ESEA debates included whether to use 1960 Census data or include children from specific families. Congress decided to include both low-income children identified via the 1960 Decennial Census data and children in families receiving AFDC in grant determinations. The eligibility criteria for formula children were later expanded to include neglected, delinquent, and foster children, raising concerns about program costs. Debates over the formula child count structure continued as Congress made changes to poverty thresholds, application of new data, and additional data sources. The debate over measures of poverty and the favoritism of certain areas in Title I-A formulas has persisted despite improvements in data accuracy over time. Changes to the count of AFDC children in the 1970s were made in response to concerns about urban areas being favored or disadvantaged by the formula. The debate over poverty measures and favoritism in Title I-A formulas continues, with a focus on the weighting scales for formula children in LEAs. Two scales are used, one based on formula child rates and the other on formula child counts, with higher weights given to LEAs with higher formula child rates. This system aims to ensure that LEAs with high formula child counts or rates receive appropriate funding. The debate over poverty measures and favoritism in Title I-A formulas continues, with a focus on the weighting scales for formula children in LEAs. The weighting process appears to favor LEAs with higher formula child rates over those with higher numbers of formula children. However, due to the way the weights are applied, LEAs with high numbers of formula children often receive more funding per formula child. Every Title I-A formula includes an expenditure factor based on state average per pupil expenditures. In the mid-1970s, Congress debated the inclusion of an expenditure factor in Title I-A funds to compensate states with higher education and living costs. This sparked a debate between higher spending states and lower spending states over the distribution of funds based on need. Congress eventually set limits on the expenditure factor to balance grant determinations for low-spending states. In 1994, Congress created two additional Title I-A formulas (Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas) to target funds more effectively on LEAs with concentrations of poverty. The EFIG formula included an effort factor and an equity factor, different from the other formulas. The EFIG formula introduced effort and equity factors to determine state grants for public K-12 education. Concerns were raised about disparities in funding among LEAs and the potential disadvantage to southern states. The formula was enacted alongside the Targeted Grant formula in 1994 to address concentration of poverty in LEAs. The EFIG formula was modified in FY2002 to include an expenditure factor, differentiating it from the other formulas. A proposed change during ESSA discussions aimed to switch the expenditure factor from state to national APPE, potentially benefiting lower-spending states. The fifth formula proposed during ESSA discussions aimed to adjust state spending on public K-12 education in Title I-A formulas. It was not included in the bill but highlighted congressional concerns. State minimum grant provisions increase funding for small states by reducing funding for others, while LEA hold harmless provisions ensure stability in grant amounts. The hold harmless provision in Title I-A formulas ensures stability in grant amounts by reducing grants for LEAs that receive more than their hold harmless amount. These provisions help mitigate losses to states and LEAs resulting from changes in the formula factors. For example, the 1974 amendments added a hold harmless provision to Basic Grants to offset potential losses from expenditure factor changes. Additionally, the 1978 amendments included a requirement in Concentration Grants to protect funding for rural districts. The inclusion of state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions in Title I-A formulas may reduce the targeting of funds on LEAs with higher concentrations of poverty. These provisions disrupt the formula provisions meant for targeting funds but provide stability and support for small states and LEAs. They have also been used to gain support for changes to the formulas by mitigating any potential losses. The Title I-A program aims to help poor children in public and private schools by addressing issues related to counting disadvantaged children and targeting funds effectively on areas with concentrations of poverty. There is a debate on whether larger grants should be given to LEAs with a high number or percentage of formula children. The global debate on targeting Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty has evolved over decades with the addition of three formulas to the original Basic Grant formula. The Education Amendments of 1978 introduced Concentration Grants to provide additional funding to areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families. Two more formulas were added in 1994 to further target funds effectively. Title I-A funds were added to the ESEA in 1994, with the addition of the Targeted Grants formula to focus on areas with concentrations of poverty. The Senate proposed replacing the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas with a new formula (EFIG) to better target funding on poverty concentrations. Ultimately, both the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas were included in the ESEA, while the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas were retained. The House Report 89-143 highlighted issues such as draft, employment, and education problems, especially for children in poverty. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 aimed to provide $1.06 billion to improve public school programs in areas with high poverty concentrations. Title I-A funds were allocated to LEAs via the Basic Grant formula, with the addition of the Concentration Grant formula in the 1970s to provide extra funding for areas with high poverty concentrations. In the early 1990s, new formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG) were introduced to target poverty concentrations more effectively by providing more funding per child to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of children from low-income families. The Title I-A funds were allocated through various formulas, including the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. A Special Incentive Grant formula was also used to encourage state and local education spending, last funded in FY1975. Different reauthorizations of the ESEA made substantial changes to these formulas over the years. The Title I-A funds were allocated through various formulas, including the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. Grant amounts are determined by multiplying a \"formula child count\" by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state APPE. Grants are reduced to match available appropriations, with minimum grant and hold harmless provisions. Grants are allocated to LEAs via state educational agencies. The Title I-A funds were allocated through formulas at the county level, then suballocated to LEAs. LEAs distribute funds to schools based on the percentage of eligible students. The ESEA authorized federal aid to education in 1965. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 was a significant federal program that provided funding for K-12 education. Before the ESEA, there were two main federal programs for education: Impact Aid and the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The ESEA was a major step towards ending segregation in federally funded programs. The ESEA of 1965 resolved issues of aid to segregated schools and private school funding by targeting aid to children in poor families, regardless of school type. This compromise allowed for quick passage through Congress, spreading funds to every state and congressional district. The Title I-A program was the central component, aiming to meet the special educational needs of children. The Title I-A program under the ESEA aimed to address the educational needs of children from low-income families by providing funds to LEAs. Grants could be used for projects to help educationally deprived students, including equipment acquisition and school facility construction. LEAs had to evaluate program effectiveness annually and provide additional funding from state and local sources. Title I-A program under the ESEA required LEAs to maintain funding levels for public education, known as \"maintenance of effort\" (MOE), and provide equitable services to students in private schools. Basic Grants were calculated at the county level by HEW, with SEAs reallocating funds to individual LEAs. SEAs could reserve up to 1% of their Basic Grant allocation for administration. LEAs and SEAs could reserve up to 1% of Basic Grant allocation for administration, technical assistance, and evaluation. Grants were distributed to schools in areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families based on the number of formula children and state APPE. Eligibility for grants required at least 100 formula children or formula children to account for more than 3% of children ages 5-17 in the LEA. Grant amounts were calculated when data were unavailable at the LEA level. Grant amounts were calculated using the same formula on a county basis when data were unavailable at the LEA level. Grants to Puerto Rico and the Outlying Areas were provided via a reservation of up to 2% of total Basic Grant appropriations. The ESEA authorized Basic Grants for three years but only specified the allocation formula for FY1966. The formula included children ages 5-17 in families with an annual income below $2,000 based on data from the 1960 Decennial Census plus children in families with income at or above $2,000 from Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The ESEA authorized Special Incentive Grants for FY1967 and FY1968 based on LEAs with increased APPE from nonfederal sources. However, the program was repealed in 1966 before being funded. President Johnson established a task force in 1964 to propose education reform ideas. In 1964, President Johnson established a task force to propose education reform ideas. In November of that year, the task force delivered a report on the nation's educational needs. In January 1965, President Johnson sent Congress a proposal for the ESEA, which was introduced in the House as H.R. 2362 and in the Senate as S. 370. The House Education and Labor Committee made changes to the Title I-A formulas, including adding children in families with annual incomes above $2,000 who received AFDC funds. H.R. 2362 passed both the House and Senate quickly. The Administration justified using the $2,000 poverty threshold in the formula for the ESEA program, as it identified a distinct poverty group, was administratively feasible, and correlated with the funding commitment. Family income was chosen over other factors because it met criteria for broad coverage, uniform application, administrative feasibility, and conversion into numbers of disadvantaged children. The expenditure factor was deemed necessary to compensate states for varying costs of educating children. The expenditure factor in the ESEA program aimed to compensate states with higher education costs and living expenses. Critics argued that the formula favored wealthy states and counties, relied on outdated Census data, and created inequity by only counting children in families receiving AFDC benefits. On October 15, 1965, Congress passed H.R. 9022 to amend the Impact Aid program and the ESEA, providing federal aid for construction of public schools damaged by disasters and grants for children with disabilities. The law made minimal changes to the Title I-A formulas, with an increase in funds reserved for state administration. On October 20, 1966, Congress passed H.R. 13161 to reauthorize the ESEA and extend the Title I-A program for two years. The 1966 amendments to the ESEA modified the Basic Grant program formula to address concerns of favoritism towards wealthier states. This resulted in an expansion of the program, increased costs, and the elimination of the Special Incentive Grants. The repeal of this program freed up $400 million for Basic Grants and added two new grant programs for SEAs. The 1966 amendments to the ESEA expanded the Basic Grant program to include grants for neglected and delinquent children, with changes to the formula for allocation and eligibility criteria. The 1966 amendments to the ESEA expanded the Basic Grant program to include grants for neglected and delinquent children, with changes to the formula for allocation and eligibility criteria. Beginning in FY1968, an LEA's Basic Grant was equal to 50% of the greater of state or national APPE multiplied by the sum of the number of children in families earning below $3,000, the number of children in families that would be earning below $3,000 if they were not receiving AFDC, and the number of children in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes. Additionally, the amendments added authority to provide grants to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for disadvantaged Indian children. The 1966 amendments to the ESEA expanded the Basic Grant program to include grants for neglected and delinquent children, with changes to the formula for allocation and eligibility criteria. President Johnson requested an increase in the Basic Grant poverty threshold to $3,000 and the repeal of Special Incentive Grants. The amendments also added a minimum Title I-A program size requirement of $2,500 for LEA programs. Additionally, the option of using national APPE to determine a state's expenditure factor was included in the House and Senate bills. The House and Senate committees added children in institutions for neglected and delinquent children, as well as foster children, to the formula child counts. Debate focused on the disproportionate benefit to wealthier LEAs under the allocation formula and the need for funds to target LEAs with the greatest need. Updates to the AFDC data and the option to use national APPE for expenditure calculation aimed to address disparities in aid between states. President Johnson signed H.R.7819 into law in 1968 to address disparities in aid between states, increasing program costs but aiming to give every child in America a better chance. The amendments extended the Title I-A program through FY1970 and allowed the use of advanced appropriations. The amendments to the Title I-A program in 1968 extended the program through FY1970, allowed advanced appropriations, and made changes to grant formulas. These changes included the addition of Special Incentive Grants, increased state administration funds, and prioritized funding allocation when appropriations were insufficient. The 1967 amendments to the Title I-A program made few changes to the Basic Grant formula, including delaying the use of a $3,000 poverty threshold. Full funding based on a $2,000 threshold was never achieved, so the $2,000 threshold was used to determine formula child counts. The FY1968 Labor-HEW appropriations bill added state minimum grant provisions to the formula for Title I-A funding. States could not receive less than they did in FY1967 until appropriations reached $1.5 billion. Around half of the states received more funding in FY1968 than in FY1967, especially those with lower state Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE). The 1967 amendments also included provisions for SEA programs in Title I if appropriations were below full funding levels. The ESEA authorized a new Special Incentive Grants program in FY1969 for states with higher education expenditures. Special Incentive Grants were formula grants to states and competitive grants to LEAs based on the state's effort index. Each state could receive a grant based on its effort index exceeding the national average, multiplied by its formula child count, up to a maximum of 15% of the total available grants. SEAs distributed these grants to LEAs with the greatest need for additional Title I-A funds. The ESEA authorized a new Special Incentive Grants program in FY1969 for states with higher education expenditures. Grants were distributed to LEAs with the greatest need for additional Title I-A funds, but the program was not funded until FY1971. Congressional debates surrounded the Title I-A formulas and the addition of the Special Incentive Grant program. The controversy surrounding congressional efforts to address issues with the distribution of Title I-A funds due to insufficient appropriations led to proposed delays in increasing the poverty threshold and the option for LEAs to use the greater of state or national APPE to calculate their expenditure factor. The House committee dropped the delay of the national APPE option, benefiting states with low education spending, which led to the inclusion of the state minimum grant provision in the FY1968 Labor-HEW appropriations bill. The Senate changed the Title I-A formula to address insufficient appropriations. The Title I-A formula was changed by the Senate to ensure each LEA would receive prior year funding if appropriations were insufficient, with remaining funds allocated based on a poverty threshold of $3,000 and the greater of state or national APPE. Funding for Title I state agency programs was prioritized over Title I-A grants to LEAs, and advanced appropriations for ESEA programs were authorized to address delays in funding allocation. A compromise was reached in conference on the Title I-A formula. Another controversy involved a proposed amendment to convert ESEA programs into a block grant program, which did not pass. In 1970, President Nixon signed H.R. 514 into law, extending ESEA programs through FY1973. The 1969 amendments modified the Title I-A Basic Grant program, extended the Special Incentive Grant program, and included Special Grants to Urban and Rural Schools. Title I-A grants were allocated via three formulas: Basic Grants, Special Incentive Grants, and Special Grants. The Commissioner was required to study the program's effectiveness in meeting the needs of the disadvantaged. The 1969 amendments to the ESEA program included a study of the program's effectiveness in meeting the needs of disadvantaged children, a review of the LEA grant allocation formula, and the establishment of the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children. New fiscal requirements were added, including a comparability requirement and a supplement, not supplant requirement. The amendments did not make substantial changes to the Basic Grant formula. The 1969 amendments to the ESEA program did not make substantial changes to the Basic Grant formula, retaining provisions from FY1967 due to funding constraints. Changes included the option to use 1970 Census data for grant amounts and allowing Basic Grants for teacher salary bonuses in schools with disadvantaged students. The 1969 amendments to the ESEA program authorized Special Incentive Grants for schools with high poverty levels, based on an effort index and formula child count. Special Grants for Urban and Rural Schools were also introduced for districts with high concentrations of poverty. Eligibility for these grants required a minimum formula child rate of 20% or at least 5,000 formula children in the district. Title I-A grants were provided to LEAs to support educationally deprived children in preschool and elementary schools serving low-income families. Grants were also available for secondary schools with urgent needs, with funds limited to 15% of Title I appropriations over $1.39 billion. The debate over extending Title I-A grants focused on the duration of the program. The Administration proposed a one-year extension to review the program thoroughly, while the House Education and Labor Committee suggested a five-year extension for stability in long-term planning. The bill was eventually revised to limit program extensions to two years in the House and four years in the Senate. Other amendments, such as raising the poverty threshold and introducing a Special Grant program, were less controversial. The debate over extending Title I-A grants focused on the duration of the program. The House proposed a five-year extension for stability, while the Senate settled on a three-year extension. Concerns were raised about funding inequities and the inadequacy of using 1960 Census data for allocation. Some argued the formula favored wealthier states, while others saw it as the most effective way to distribute funds where educational deprivation exists. The 1974 amendments to the Title I-A program made changes to the formulas to address concerns about funding inequities and to ensure funds were distributed where educational deprivation exists. The amendments extended the program through FY1978 and added a new provision regarding the use of federal funds. The 1974 amendments to the Title I-A program extended the program through FY1978 and added a provision requiring federal funds to be used for the excess costs of activities for educationally deprived children. Changes were made to school eligibility and state reservations, as well as to the Basic Grant, Special Incentive Grant, and Special Grant formulas. The Basic Grant formula was altered to include counts of children in poverty and those receiving AFDC payments above the poverty threshold. The 1974 amendments to the Title I-A program extended the program through FY1978 and added provisions for federal funds to be used for educationally deprived children. Changes were made to school eligibility, state reservations, and grant formulas, including a new formula for Basic Grants based on counts of children in poverty, those receiving AFDC payments above the poverty threshold, and neglected, delinquent, and foster children. The expenditure factor was adjusted to 40% of state APPE with floor and ceiling constraints to prevent large grant amount losses for LEAs. The 1974 amendments to the Title I-A program included a hold harmless provision ensuring each LEA received a grant of at least 85% of the previous year's amount. An additional $15.7 million was allocated annually to assist LEAs with grants below 90% of the previous year. Puerto Rico was treated as a state under Basic Grants, receiving funds through the formula instead of a set aside. The reservation for Basic Grants to Puerto Rico, Outlying Areas, and BIA was reduced from 2% to 1%. Full funding requirements for SEA Title I programs were maintained. The 1974 amendments to Title I programs ensured that allocations for SEA programs could not be reduced below full funding levels. The amendments extended the Special Incentive Grant program and set eligibility criteria for LEAs to receive grants. Congress also revised the formula for Special Grants but specified that the program would end in FY1975. The 1974 amendments to Title I programs changed the maximum grant calculation for LEAs and the authorization level for Special Grants. Congressional consideration of the amendments began in 1973 in the House, with proposals to allocate funds per formula child before using the Basic Grant formula. The committee modified the Basic Grant formula for Title I programs, using updated poverty data and limiting the count of AFDC children to two-thirds. The expenditure factor was also adjusted to address inequities. The committee adopted a new expenditure factor of 40% of state APPE, limited to 80% to 120% of the national APPE, with an 85% hold harmless factor. The House committee's changes were criticized for negatively impacting urban areas. Several proposed modifications to the Title I-A formulas, including limitations on AFDC children, were defeated. The Senate's version of the bill provided greater benefits to areas with high concentrations of AFDC children and revamped the Special Incentive Grant program. The House and Senate made changes to education programs, extending some and terminating others. The Carter Administration requested a one-year extension to study the programs before reauthorization. Congress passed the extension in 1977 with no major changes to the ESEA. In 1978, H.R. 15 was passed to extend and amend elementary and secondary education programs. The 1978 amendments to education programs extended Basic Grants for five years, adjusted allocation formulas to benefit urban areas, introduced Concentration Grants for high-poverty areas, and converted the Special Incentive Grant program to a federal matching grant program. Title I-A grants were allocated through three methods under these amendments. Under the 1978 amendments, Title I-A grants were allocated through Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. The amendments allowed funds to be allocated to schools with high educational deprivation and required ranking of schools by concentration of low-income students if funds were insufficient. Schools could automatically qualify for Title I-A based on their percentage of low-income students. The 1978 amendments to Title I-A grants introduced Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. Schools with at least 25% low-income students were automatically eligible for participation. Changes in the Basic Grant formula included counting children in families above the poverty level in full and allocating funds based on counts of children below 50% of the median income. Schools with a poverty rate of 75% or higher could operate schoolwide programs to upgrade their educational programs. The 1978 amendments to Title I-A grants introduced Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. Concentration Grants provided additional funding to areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families based on specific eligibility criteria. The 1978 amendments to Title I-A grants introduced Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. Concentration Grants provided additional funding to areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families based on specific eligibility criteria. Counties were eligible for a Concentration Grant if the number of formula children exceeded 5,000 or accounted for over 20% of the total school-age population. The grant amount was calculated based on the county's formula child count in excess of the thresholds multiplied by its maximum Basic Grant amount and divided by its formula child count. If appropriations were insufficient, the grants were reduced, with a minimum allocation of 0.25% for each state. The 1978 amendments to Title I-A grants introduced Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. County Concentration Grants were allocated to LEAs based on specific eligibility criteria. LEAs in eligible counties received a share of the county's Concentration Grant based on their number of formula children. Special Incentive Grants were converted to a federal matching program for state compensatory education expenditures, with eligible LEAs receiving $1 in federal funds for every $2 spent by the state. No state could receive a grant greater than 10% of its maximum Basic Grant. The 1978 amendments to Title I-A grants introduced Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Special Incentive Grants. Special Incentive Grants were converted to a federal matching program for state compensatory education expenditures. Funding under the previous Special Incentive Grants program was unpredictable, leading to the initiation of new proposals in the 1978 amendments. The Carter Administration played a key role in enacting these proposals, which aimed to provide more consistent federal incentives for state compensatory education programs. Additionally, Concentration Grants were introduced to provide more intensive remedial efforts in areas with a concentration of poverty. The Senate committee proposed that no state receive a Concentration Grant less than 0.25% of appropriations. The House agreed and extended Title I for five years, restoring AFDC children to a full count. Proponents argued for equity in urban areas, while critics said it would benefit only a few states. The House and Senate committees disagreed on using SIE data for Title I fund allocation. The House viewed SIE data as more accurate than 1970 Census data, while the Senate questioned its statistical accuracy. Eventually, the Senate agreed to a new Basic Grant formula based on SIE data for half of the appropriations above FY1979 levels. President Reagan's proposal to convert education programs into block grants had limited success in Congress, resulting in only one education block grant in the ECIA. The ECIA made changes to or consolidated statutory provisions for all ESEA programs. The ECIA consolidated ESEA programs, with Title I becoming Chapter 1 and the rest as Chapter 2. Changes were made to Title I-A, including simplifying LEA application requirements and modifying MOE requirements. Excess cost requirements were eliminated, and certain costs were excluded when determining compliance with SNS and comparability requirements. The 1983 amendments to the ECIA clarified language, resolved legislative intent questions, and restored flexibility in program administration. It extended requirements, such as SNS to SEAs, mandated program evaluations every two years, and required the NIE to assess compensatory education programs. In 1988, Congress reauthorized the ESEA, making changes to various programs and adding new ones. The Title I-A program was reauthorized as Title I, Chapter I-A, with updates to the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. The focus was mainly on the Concentration Grant formula, which was modified to be more favorable to rural areas. The 1988 amendments to the ESEA reauthorized Title I-A funds under Title I, Chapter 1-A with changes to the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. It also introduced requirements for program improvement plans, parental involvement, a competitive grant program, and increased state administration grants. The amendments removed references to 1970 Census poverty thresholds and allowed for the use of 1980 and 1990 Census data. The 1988 amendments to the ESEA reauthorized Title I-A funds under Title I, Chapter 1-A with changes to the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. The amendments added minimum grant provisions to the Basic Grant formula and required Concentration Grants to receive all Chapter 1-A appropriations between $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion. Grants were ratably reduced if appropriations were insufficient. SEAs continued to suballocate county grants to individual LEAs. The 1988 amendments to the ESEA reauthorized Title I-A funds under Title I, Chapter 1-A with changes to the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. The amendments required Concentration Grants to receive appropriations between $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion, with modifications to eligibility criteria and grant allocation methods. County eligibility thresholds were changed, and minimum grant amounts were added, including an \"absolute\" minimum grant of $250,000. The 1988 amendments to the ESEA reauthorized Title I-A funds with changes to the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. Changes included new eligibility criteria and grant allocation methods, with funds no longer distributed to every LEA in an eligible county. Instead, only LEAs meeting specific thresholds were eligible for a share of the Concentration Grant. States could reserve up to 2% of their grants for LEAs with high numbers of formula children in ineligible counties. During the 1988 amendments to the ESEA, changes were made to the Concentration Grant formula. The House bill favored rural districts by adjusting eligibility thresholds. The Senate bill aimed to target funds to areas with high numbers of educationally disadvantaged students. Half of the funds would be distributed based on the existing formula, while the other half would be allocated based on the Basic Grant formula. The House and Senate bills during the 1988 ESEA amendments debated the allocation of funds to states and LEAs based on the Basic Grant formula and Senate Concentration Grant formula. The House rejected the Senate's formula, favoring rural areas over large urban areas, influenced by Representative Natcher. The inclusion of AFDC children in the Basic Grant formula was a major point of debate. The inclusion of AFDC children in the Basic Grant formula was a major point of debate during the 1988 ESEA amendments. The Senate bill initially proposed removing AFDC children from the formula but they were later included again to prevent abrupt changes for states with high AFDC counts. President Clinton signed the IASA into law on October 20, 1994, which made several changes to the existing Title I-A formulas and introduced two new formulas. The IASA, signed into law in 1994, introduced new formulas for Title I-A funds targeting poverty concentrations. It merged the SEA program for students with disabilities into IDEA and removed full funding requirements. Four formulas were included: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. Targeted Grants and EFIG were to receive appropriations above $6.6 billion starting in FY1996, but were not funded until the No Child Left Behind Act in FY2002. The IASA in 1994 introduced new formulas for Title I-A funds, aiming to raise instructional standards and academic expectations. Changes included requirements for reading and math standards, a competitive grant program for freely associated states, expanded school eligibility for Title I-A programs, a focus on fewer schools for fund allocation, increased planning and professional development requirements, and allowance for Title I-A funds to be used for public school choice programs. The IASA in 1994 introduced new formulas for Title I-A funds, aiming to raise instructional standards and academic expectations. Changes included requirements for reading and math standards, expanded school eligibility for Title I-A programs, and allowing Title I-A funds to be used for public school choice programs. The IASA also made changes to fiscal accountability requirements, including comparability requirements for equal distribution of resources to Title I-A and non-Title I-A schools within districts. Grants were now calculated based on formula child count data for LEAs, with three changes made to the Basic Grant formula. The IASA in 1994 introduced new formulas for Title I-A funds, with changes to Basic Grants and Concentration Grants. Changes included raising the state minimum grant level, adjusting how formula children were counted, and implementing hold harmless provisions for LEAs. The Targeted Grant formula for Title I-A funds introduced in 1996 had a 100% LEA hold harmless provision for FY1996, which decreased to 85% for FY1997-FY1999. The formula counted children with weights based on child count or rate, with higher rates resulting in higher grants per child. Targeted Grants had a higher eligibility threshold (5% formula child rate) compared to Basic Grants (2% formula child rate). Grants were based on each eligible LEA's share of formula child count multiplied by an expenditure factor. The new EFIG formula allocated grants to states based on total school-age population multiplied by an effort factor and an equity factor. The effort factor was based on education spending relative to personal income per capita, benefiting states with higher education spending. The equity factor was determined based on variations in state factors. The equity factor for each state in the Title I-A formulas was determined based on variations in APPE among LEAs, resulting in higher grants for states with less variation and lower grants for states with more variation. State grants were then suballocated to LEAs in proportion to total LEA grants under other Title I-A formulas. The Clinton Administration's proposed changes to increase targeting of Title I-A grants to high poverty areas were not accepted by Congress in H.R. 6. In H.R. 6, the House Committee on Education and Labor made changes to Title I-A funding formulas to target areas with concentrations of poverty more effectively. The bill aimed to reduce drastic funding shifts following each Census. In contrast, S. 1513 from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources replaced existing formulas with the EFIG formula to address the negative impact of high poverty rates on student achievement. The goal was to provide financial assistance to LEAs serving areas with high poverty concentrations. The ESEA aims to provide financial assistance to LEAs in high-poverty areas. The Senate proposed the EFIG formula to allocate grants based on a weighted formula child count multiplied by factors like equity and effort to address disparities in funding and resources among LEAs. The Senate proposal included state hold harmless provisions to prevent sharp decreases in Title I-A funding levels. A compromise on a new formula was not reached, and all four formulas were included in the IASA, with most changes postponed until FY1996. Critics argued that the formulas disproportionately disadvantaged southern states and did not target funds effectively, while proponents believed it was a fair compromise to better target funds to states with the greatest need. The 106th Congress considered proposals to reauthorize the ESEA, leading to the enactment of NCLB in January 2002. NCLB introduced changes to Title I-A funding formulas and accountability requirements, including annual updates to poverty data and new mandates for highly qualified teachers and paraprofessionals. NCLB made changes to Title I-A funding formulas, including expanding school eligibility, allowing LEAs to transfer grants, and altering eligibility for competitive grant programs. It also specified that increases in appropriations for Title I-A had to be allocated under the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. The proportion of funds allocated under these formulas has increased since FY2002. Few changes were made to the Basic Grant formula. The Basic Grant formula under NCLB saw some changes, including a slight increase in Puerto Rico's grant cap and an increase in the state minimum grant amount to 0.35% for funds above FY2001 levels. The Concentration Grant formula was also modified to align with the Basic Grant formula, applying the expenditure factor of 40% of state APPE. Additionally, tiered hold harmless provisions were extended to Concentration Grants. Under NCLB, Concentration Grants had a prior-year hold harmless provision of 85%-95% based on the LEA's formula child rate. Special provisions expanded the hold harmless rules for Concentration Grants, allowing LEAs to receive grants for four additional years if they met eligibility requirements in one year but not the next. The grant amount was determined by the formula child count multiplied by 40% of state APPE, with adjustments for state minimum grant amounts and LEA hold harmless provisions. The state minimum grant amount was increased to 0.35% for funds above the FY2001 level. Under NCLB, changes were made to the allocation formula for Targeted Grants and EFIG, with updates to the weighting of formula child counts and adjustments to state minimum grant amounts. The EFIG formula saw significant changes, including a shift in the population factor and the addition of an expenditure factor based on state APPE. The EFIG formula under NCLB saw changes such as the addition of a state APPE-based expenditure factor, suballocation to LEAs based on a weighted formula child count, application of tiered hold harmless provisions, and minimum grant provisions similar to Targeted Grants. The EFIG formula under NCLB underwent changes including the addition of expenditure, effort, and equity factors, adjusted by a state minimum. Each LEA's share of the state's grant was based on a weighted child count compared to all LEAs, with hold harmless provisions. The Bush Administration proposed NCLB reauthorization with expanded accountability and testing requirements but no changes to Title I-A formulas. Funding for the Targeted Grant formula was requested to focus on areas with poverty concentrations, criticizing the Concentration Grant formula for its \"cliff effect.\" The House passed H.R. 1 on May 23, 2001, eliminating the EFIG formula. The bill made minor changes to the remaining formulas due to hold harmless provisions and lack of funding. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 1 in June 2001, retaining the EFIG formula to equalize funding between rich and poor LEAs. The Senate bill also increased minimum grant amounts and added hold harmless provisions for various grants. The Title I-A formulas were revised in a compromise between the House and Senate provisions, aiming to increase funding to help close the achievement gap for low-income students. Despite the authorization of appropriations expiring in FY2007, the ESEA was not reauthorized until December 10, 2015. Attempts to add a new formula and allocate funds based on poverty levels were removed in conference. The ESSA did increase the set-aside for the Bureau of Indian Education. The ESSA made changes to Title I-A grant allocation process, SNS, MOE, and accountability requirements for states and LEAs to receive funds. It also increased the set-aside for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas. Flexibility was provided in distributing funds to schools, allowing LEAs to allocate funds to more high schools. Appropriations levels for Title I-A since FY1980 are detailed in Figure A-1 and Table A-1. Since FY1980, Title I-A appropriations have generally increased, with the largest percentage increases occurring in the early 1990s and 2000s. Post-FY2001, increases have been divided between Targeted Grants and EFIG, leading to a steady increase in their share of appropriations. This has resulted in a decrease in the share allocated via Basic and Concentration Grant formulas. Timeline of changes to Title I-A formulas and provisions is detailed in various tables in Appendix B.
