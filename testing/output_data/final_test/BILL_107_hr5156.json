ALTERNATE ENERGY-RELATED USES ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.\"\n\nSummarized: Section 1 discusses alternate energy-related uses on the outer continental shelf. The purposes of this section are to protect the economic and land use interests of the Federal Government in managing the outer Continental Shelf for energy-related activities, provide an administrative framework for oversight, ensure safety and environmental protection, and coordinate inter-agency efforts for energy-related activities on the outer Continental Shelf. The amendment to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act aims to authorize alternate uses of existing structures, ensure fair returns for easements, and grant easements for energy and related purposes after consultation with relevant government departments. The amendment allows relevant government departments to grant easements on the outer Continental Shelf for activities supporting oil, gas, mineral exploration, energy production, or use of existing facilities. The Secretary can establish payment forms for easements or right-of-ways, consult with the Secretary of Defense on national security issues, and grant energy-related easements competitively or non-competitively. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant departments and agencies, shall consider factors such as prevention of waste, protection of the environment, national security, and potential return for easements or right-of-ways. Regulations will be prescribed to ensure safety, environmental protection, and conservation of natural resources on the outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary may require a surety bond for easements granted on the outer Continental Shelf to protect US interests. This subsection does not affect the jurisdiction of other Federal or State agencies. It does not apply to areas designated as National Marine Sanctuaries. The heading for section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to address leases, easements, and rights-of-way on the Outer Continental Shelf."
