    "content": "The \"Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017\" requires the compilation and transmission of applications and rescissions of applications to call a convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution to Congress. The Archivist of the United States is required to compile and transmit all applications and rescissions of applications made by States under Article V of the Constitution to Congress and the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and Senate. The Archivist will use records from the National Archive and Records Administration for this compilation. The Archivist of the United States will compile and transmit applications and rescissions made by States under Article V of the Constitution to Congress and the Committees on the Judiciary. The Archivist may use outside resources to obtain official copies of any missing applications or rescissions. The compilation will be transmitted according to a specified schedule. After enactment, applications and rescissions from different time periods must be submitted: 1970 and later after 1 year, 1920 through 1969 after 2 years, and 1870 through 1919 after 3 years. Applications and rescissions must be submitted 4 years after enactment for the time period 1820 through 1869, and 5 years after enactment for applications and rescissions before 1820. The Archivist is required to report to Congress on missing applications or rescissions, catalog them by year and State, and include this information in the material sent to Congress. The transmittal and report are not considered official sources of valid state applications and rescissions under article V of the Constitution. Upon receipt of the compilation, Congress designates applications and rescissions for public availability on a website within 6 months. The committees on the judiciary update the public websites by designating any new applications or rescissions not included in the initial compilation. The Archivist reports to Congress on missing applications or rescissions, cataloging them by year and State, but this information is not considered official sources of valid state applications and rescissions under article V of the Constitution. The committees on the judiciary update public websites by designating new applications or rescissions not in the initial compilation. This includes any information that comes to the attention of the committee. SEC. 4. RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES FOR TRANSMISSION OF APPLICATIONS AND RESCISSIONS. The Congress recommends procedures for State legislatures to submit applications or rescissions under article V of the Constitution for a convention to propose amendments. The secretary of state or designated official should send copies of the resolution to Congress, one to the President of the Senate and one to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Each copy should include specific contents. The resolution or measure should include the exact text with the authenticating signature of the relevant officer of the legislature and the date of adoption. If a State submits an application or rescission that is inconsistent with this section, the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate will confirm its authenticity through a public records search. If unable to confirm, the State official will be notified for verification. The Senate requests a letter from the State official confirming the authenticity of an application or rescission. Noncompliance with the procedures recommended in this section does not give Congress a basis to refuse an application or rescission. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not expand Congress' duties under article V of the Constitution. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. Defines terms like \"transmit to Congress\" and \"application.\" SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the National Historical Publications and Records Commission is set at $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2018 through 2023. Additionally, the Historical Record Grant Program is allocated $3,000,000 for each of the same fiscal years."
