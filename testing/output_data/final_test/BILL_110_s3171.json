    "content": "Tax-exempt financing of energy transportation infrastructure is not subject to private business use tests. Tax-exempt financing of energy transportation infrastructure is exempt from private business use tests, specifically for property used to transmit electricity at 230 or more. Tax-exempt financing applies to property used to transmit electricity at 230 kilovolts or more, part of efforts to improve interstate transmission, located in at least 2 states. Also includes property for renewable energy generation and transmission pipelines for crude oil or diesel fuel from coal or synthetic petroleum products. Any tangible property used for carbon dioxide transmission pipelines can qualify for tax-exempt financing if part of a State or multi-State effort to improve interstate or intrastate development. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to financing for transportation infrastructure for carbon dioxide sequestration. It includes exceptions for private loan financing and reductions in state volume cap for energy transportation infrastructure financing. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the volume cap for energy transportation infrastructure financing by the amount of bonds issued for this purpose. These amendments apply to bonds issued after the enactment of the Act and before December 31, 2015. Limitation on discriminatory taxation of certain pipeline property. Definitions related to property tax assessment are provided in this section, including terms like assessment, assessment jurisdiction, commercial and industrial property, and pipeline property.

The term \"public utility property\" refers to property used for public service and regulated by a governmental agency. Discriminatory acts against interstate commerce, such as assessing pipeline property at a higher value than its true market value, are prohibited. The law prohibits discriminatory acts against interstate commerce, such as assessing pipeline property at a higher value than its true market value and imposing excessive tax rates on it. It also prohibits any other tax that discriminates against pipelines under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to prevent violations of discriminatory acts against interstate commerce related to pipeline property assessments. Relief may be granted if the assessed value of pipeline property exceeds by at least 5 percent the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. The district courts have jurisdiction to prevent discriminatory acts in pipeline property assessments. Relief may be granted if the assessed value of pipeline property exceeds by at least 5 percent the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction. If the ratio of assessed value of other commercial and industrial property to true market value cannot be determined through a sales assessment ratio study, violations may occur. The ad valorem property tax on pipeline property can be subject to a tax rate higher than other taxable properties in the jurisdiction, excluding public utility property. SEC. 3 amends Section 60109(c)(3)(B) of title 49, United States Code, to base natural gas pipeline integrity reassessment intervals on technical data, risk factors, and engineering analysis. The amendment takes effect upon enactment of the Act."
