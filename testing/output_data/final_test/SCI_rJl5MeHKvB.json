A novel limited self-supervision framework for time-series data uses auxiliary tasks to improve performance without extra data. This approach focuses on data at-hand and introduces new forms of self-supervision for sequence-level classification tasks in clinical and synthetic data. Limited self-supervision is introduced for sequence-level tasks in healthcare, showing improved performance in identifying atrial fibrillation from electrocardiogram data. This approach aids in learning intermediate representations for sequential data, benefiting tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis. In healthcare tasks, sequence-level tasks face challenges due to high-D low-N settings. Transfer learning techniques can help by leveraging additional data to improve intermediate representations for the target task. Considering additional intrinsic tasks in the data can also enhance the learned representation, especially in sequential data structures. In this paper, the authors explore how leveraging the sequential structure of data can enhance performance on sequence-level tasks through self-supervision. They propose using self-supervised auxiliary tasks like signal reconstruction to learn useful intermediate representations of the data, building on past work in this area. In this study, the authors introduce the concept of limited self-supervision for sequential data analysis. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving performance across datasets without additional data. Additionally, they compare different forms of self-supervision and propose a new method called piecewise-linear autoencoding. The study introduces limited self-supervision for sequential data analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of piecewise-linear autoencoding. It suggests the potential for improved performance in various time-series and sequence classification tasks through this form of self-supervision. The inclusion of multiple streams of auxiliary self-supervision is also emphasized for enhanced results. In this work, the focus is on time-series data and self-supervision for pretraining or feature extraction. The approach involves a multitask learning framework without the need for additional data, aiming to improve performance on the target task. Multitask learning trains a single model on multiple related tasks to enhance generalization. Multitask learning has been successful in various clinical tasks and deep learning, showing its value for representation learning. Schwab et al. explored a multitask framework for learning from sequential health data. Our work was inspired by Dai and Le's comparison of sequence-autoencoding and language modeling for leveraging unlabeled data in natural language tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance. Our work focuses on self-supervision for time series without additional data, exploring multiple streams of simultaneous supervision and comparing various auxiliary tasks on general time series data. Training a sequence classification model to forecast data as an imputation method improves performance, with the potential benefit of better handling missing data. We examine the impact of auxiliary self-supervision more broadly to enhance overall performance. In this section, a limited self-supervision framework is proposed for improving supervised representation learning. The baseline encoder-decoder architecture and four self-supervised auxiliary tasks are described. Time-series tasks are categorized across dimensions such as target vs. auxiliary tasks, external supervision vs. self-supervision, and sequence-level vs. subsequence-level tasks. Target tasks are the main focus, while auxiliary tasks aim to enhance performance. External supervision involves task labels provided by an external source. In this work, external supervision involves task labels provided by an external source, while self-supervision requires no additional supervision. Target tasks are sequence-level tasks requiring external supervision, denoted as y. Auxiliary tasks are self-supervised and can be either sequence- or subsequence-level. The focus is on comparing four different self-supervised auxiliary tasks using a fixed encoder architecture with LSTM cells. The study focuses on recurrent neural networks with LSTM cells for sequential tasks, using a 1-layer LSTM with task-specific hidden units. The architecture is flexible and can work with any representation-learning gradient-based approach. The baseline architecture includes a single-layer LSTM encoder and a fully connected target decoder. The model is trained by minimizing multi-class cross-entropy. The study explores training a model with auxiliary tasks to improve performance on sequential tasks. The model is trained by minimizing multi-class cross-entropy and includes a single-layer LSTM encoder and a fully connected target decoder. Four self-supervised auxiliary tasks are considered, including autoencoding, forecasting, partial-signal autoencoding, and piecewise-linear autoencoding. These tasks take the output of the encoding network as input. At the end of the sequence, auxiliary tasks involve autoencoding and forecasting. Autoencoding aims to reconstruct the input signal from the hidden state, encouraging learning of latent structure. Forecasting predicts future elements in the sequence based on the hidden state dynamics. The decoder outputs x t+1:t+h given past values x 0:t, using a single-layer LSTM to decode the next h observation values. This variant of AE decodes only the previous h steps of the signal x t\u2212h:t\u22121 and makes predictions at every encoding step from x h onwards. The input to the decoding layer includes the current value, x t. This task allows for examining signal reconstruction impact without learning long-term dependencies, enabling a meaningful comparison with Forecasting. Piecewise-Linear Autoencoding (PL-AE) efficiently represents signals with line segments, encouraging a compact representation capturing important details. It consists of two vectors, a value vector v, and a position vector p, defining a reconstruction through linear interpolation. The decoder in Piecewise-Linear Autoencoding (PL-AE) generates points using an autoregressive LSTM, mapping previous point values and positions. Position values are normalized to enforce a total sum constraint before interpolation. The model is optimized to minimize a loss function that includes cross-entropy and auxiliary MSE losses. The study explores the use of auxiliary self-supervision to improve performance on sequence-level tasks. It considers various tasks on synthetic and real data, including Piecewise-Linear Segment Prediction (PLA) on simulated data with piecewise-linear signals. The dataset for estimating the number of distinct segments in a signal ranges from -1 to 1 with 1 to 6 line segments. Another task involves classifying patients based on continuous glucose monitor data from individuals with type 1 diabetes. The dataset includes 1,863 days of data from 40 patients, with the goal of identifying signal dynamics through patient classification. The final task involves using ECG data from the PhysioNet Challenge to diagnose atrial fibrillation (AF). The dataset contains four classes: normal sinus rhythm, AF, other arrhythmia, and noise. The training data consists of 8,528 samples, with 771 labeled as AF. Signals with less than 30 seconds of data are excluded. The training data consists of 8,528 samples, with 771 labeled as AF. Signals with less than 30 seconds of data are excluded and all signals are truncated to 30 seconds. The data is downsampled to 125, speeding up training time. The validation set is used as the test set, with 10% of the training data randomly sampled for validation. Models are implemented in PyTorch and optimized using Adam with a learning rate of 1e \u2212 3. The decoding horizon had little effect on performance, so h = 6 was used for all experiments. The number of hidden units is set per task based on validation set performance to balance training time, memory constraints, and target-task performance. Different tasks have different hidden unit sizes: 128 for PLA, 512 for T1D, and 256 for AF. Decoding layers have 1 (or 2 for PL-AE) fully connected output layers. Overfitting is mitigated by early stopping on a withheld validation set. Auxiliary tasks make predictions at multiple points in the signal to prevent the vanishing gradient problem. The study introduces a self-supervised auxiliary task framework to improve target task performance in sequence classification. Label propagation and linearly annealed loss contributions are used, with code and data available for replication. Different types of auxiliary tasks are explored, and the relationship between auxiliary task and target task performance is analyzed. The study introduces a self-supervised auxiliary task framework to improve target task performance in sequence classification by examining the relationship between auxiliary task and target task performance. The experiments measure AUC-ROC on the target task and MAPE for the auxiliary tasks, showing that limited self-supervision improves sequence-level task performance without additional data. The inclusion of four auxiliary tasks enhances performance for all three sequence-level tasks. The study introduces a self-supervised auxiliary task framework to improve target task performance in sequence classification. The inclusion of four auxiliary tasks enhances performance for all three sequence-level tasks, with PL-AE outperforming all other auxiliary tasks. The study introduces a self-supervised auxiliary task framework to improve target task performance in sequence classification. The temporal granularity of the output suggests that modeling fine temporal granularity does not help and may hurt performance. The forecasting task underperforms all other auxiliary tasks, in line with previous findings. The performance of particular combinations of auxiliary tasks is shown in Table 1. Our novel forms of self-supervision, Autoencoder and Partial-Signal Autoencoder, outperform other approaches on all datasets. The effect of training data size on auxiliary tasks shows an increase in improvement as data increases. There is a weak relationship between auxiliary task performance and target task performance on T1D data. Different relationships emerge when conditioning on training data size. The performance of self-supervised auxiliary tasks is examined in Table 2, showing they outperform standard combinations. Investigating why these tasks help, model performance improves with more training data, indicating they provide better representations, not just regularization. The relationship between auxiliary task error and target performance is explored, specifically for AE with the T1D data. The correlation is highly dependent on the amount of data, with a weak positive correlation indicating a regularizing effect with limited training data, and a strong negative correlation with the full amount of training data. Auxiliary tasks provide significant improvements at 1,000 and 1,500 training examples. Auxiliary self-supervised tasks show improvements at 1,000 and 1,500 training examples, suggesting they can both regularize and enhance representations. The study introduces a self-supervised framework to boost sequence-level task performance without extra data, showing consistent enhancements across different tasks. Piecewise-linear autoencoding emerges as the most beneficial auxiliary task. In contrast, forecasting for self-supervision led to minimal improvements. Forecasting encourages encoding data dynamics, which can be valuable for sequence-level tasks. Multi-output forecasting architecture predicts future values simultaneously using a recurrent decoder. PS-AE is a decoder applied at each encoding step, expanded only h steps. It aims to produce short-term reconstructions and encourages fine-grained modeling of the signal over short periods. Piecewise-Linear (PL) Autoencoding introduces a new approach to signal representation by generating a PL representation of a signal with n distinct pieces using a recurrent layer. This method aims to explore the level of signal granularity required for target-task performance. In order to evaluate the use of self-supervised auxiliary tasks in a replicable setting, classification was performed on 7 data sets from the UCR Time Series Archive. Tasks with fixed length sequences and a sample to label ratio greater than 100 were included, ensuring the baseline architecture performed better than random chance. The last 20% of the training sample for each dataset was used as a validation set. The study evaluated the use of self-supervised auxiliary tasks in classification on 7 datasets from the UCR Time Series Archive. The addition of auxiliary tasks improved performance significantly, bringing the model closer to state-of-the-art levels. While not achieving state-of-the-art on most tasks, the model showed improvement over baseline, suggesting potential for enhancing baseline architectures with self-supervised tasks."
