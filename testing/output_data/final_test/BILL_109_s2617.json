The Military Retirees Health Care Protection Act acknowledges the unique demands and sacrifices endured by career members of the Armed Forces and their families over 20 to 30-year careers. These sacrifices are most evident during wartime, including the current Global War on Terrorism and past conflicts. Few Americans are willing to accept the demands of a military career for multiple decades. The Military Retirees Health Care Protection Act recognizes the sacrifices of military members who dedicate their lives to national service. Retired Armed Forces members rely on TRICARE for health care benefits earned through their service. Some civilian employers offer incentives for employees eligible for TRICARE to use its health care benefits over their own programs. The Department of Defense is making efforts in this area. The Department of Defense is proposing significant increases in enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments for retired members of the Armed Forces under the TRICARE program. These proposed increases far surpass the 31 percent rise in military retired pay over the past decade. Some TRICARE participants face challenges with healthcare providers due to lower payments and unique administrative requirements. The Department of Defense is not following regulations by counting accrual deposits against its budget. The Department of Defense is not following regulations by counting accrual deposits against its budget, which is impinging on readiness needs of the Armed Forces. Congress believes that the Department has a committed obligation to provide health care benefits to retired members of the Armed Forces exceeding that of corporate employers. The Department of Defense should find ways to control health care spending for retired members of the Armed Forces in the TRICARE program without increasing fees, deductibles, or copayments beyond the percentage increase in military retired pay. The TRICARE program should not increase fees, deductibles, or copayments for active duty members or their families beyond the percentage increase in basic pay or compensation. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES. The Pharmacy Benefits Program under Section 1074g of title 10, United States Code, is amended to limit cost-sharing increases based on retired pay adjustments for armed forces members. Additionally, premiums for TRICARE Standard for Reserve Component Members are adjusted to ensure monthly amounts do not exceed specified limits. In 2006, the percentage increase in TRICARE Standard coverage premium cannot exceed the increase in basic pay for uniformed services members. Copayments under CHAMPUS are capped at $535 per day, and enrollment fees are prohibited for those covered under subsection (c). In 2006, TRICARE Standard coverage premium increases are limited to the rise in basic pay for uniformed services members. Enrollment fees are not charged for individuals under subsection (c)."
