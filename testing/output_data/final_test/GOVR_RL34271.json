    "content": "The FCC released 10 economic research studies on media ownership for public comment to support policy debates on ownership limitations, minority ownership, and pricing of MVPD services. The studies aim to promote diversity, localism, and competition in the media industry. In response to Section 202 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the FCC was instructed by Congress to review and potentially eliminate media ownership rules. This led to significant consolidation in the media sector. The FCC modified five rules and retained two others in an order issued on June 2, 2003. The FCC issued an order on June 2, 2003, modifying five media ownership rules and retaining two. The new rules aimed to loosen ownership restrictions but faced controversy and legal challenges. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the FCC's findings but criticized the unjustified assumption that all media outlets contribute equally to diversity and competition in local markets. The rules have never been implemented. The Third Circuit found the FCC's repeal of the Failed Station Solicitation Rule without considering its impact on minority station ownership to be arbitrary and capricious. As a result, the FCC was ordered to address this issue in a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in 2006. The Further Notice in Prometheus v. FCC initiated a quadrennial review of media ownership rules, including local television and radio ownership limits, cross-ownership bans, and dual network bans. It also sought comment on alternative regulatory schemes and minority ownership proposals. The FCC initiated a quadrennial review of media ownership rules in Prometheus v. FCC, including local television and radio ownership limits, cross-ownership bans, and dual network bans. The Further Notice sought comment on minority ownership proposals submitted by the MMTC in the 2002 biennial review proceeding. Two commissioners criticized the lack of discussion on minority ownership and specific proposed rules. The FCC commissioned 10 economic studies for its media ownership rules review, leading to questions about transparency in the contractor selection process. The FCC released 10 studies for public comment on media ownership rules, with a 60-day comment period. The studies underwent peer review as required by the OMB. Two commissioners criticized the short comment period and raised questions about the peer review process. The FCC also adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making seeking comment on proposals by the MMTC. The FCC released 10 studies for public comment on media ownership rules, with a 60-day comment period. Two commissioners criticized the short comment period and raised questions about the peer review process. The FCC also adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making that briefly described and sought comment on proposals by the MMTC and the Advisory Committee on Diversity for Communications in the Digital Age. Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, and Free Press submitted detailed comments on the studies, identifying alleged specification errors and presenting statistical results from re-running the models. The FCC released 10 studies for public comment on media ownership rules, with criticism from two commissioners on the short comment period and peer review process. Consumer groups identified alleged specification errors in the studies and presented revised models showing that loosening media ownership rules would not be in the public interest. The studies provide data and analysis needed to justify or modify numerical limits on ownership characteristics and programming, as required by the Third Circuit decision. The databases on minority ownership and programming are incomplete despite efforts to construct a time series database. Data analyses in the studies do not lead to strong policy conclusions, focusing on statistical relationships between media ownership and market outcomes. Significant relationships found in one model may not hold in another, leading to uncertainty in the results. Some researchers and peer reviewers found that statistical findings on media ownership were not robust, emphasizing correlation over causality. Certain studies overstated relationships by not controlling for other variables. Non-ownership factors like demographics were better predictors of programming than ownership characteristics. Media ownership may not significantly determine programming. No studies analyzed the relationship between ownership and minority programming. The 10 studies analyzed the relationship between ownership characteristics and programming, highlighting the numerous variables involved. However, no results were shown for minority programming specifically, with Spanish language programming being the focus instead. Studies 7 and 8 did not address minority programming at all. Ownership characteristics of broadcast networks can include affiliation with major networks, ownership by large station groups not owning a network, affiliation with non-major networks, co-ownership with local broadcast stations, cross-ownership with local newspapers or cable systems, ownership by cable program network providers, local ownership, minority ownership, or female ownership. Market characteristics like the number of broadcast stations, market size, concentration, co-owned stations, cross-owned media entities, demographics, and programming measures are also considered. The curr_chunk discusses quantitative measures of programming in radio, including prime-time and non-prime-time local news, public affairs programming, national news, minority and female programming, children's programming, and program quality. It also mentions broadcast and cable network programming sources. The curr_chunk discusses variables affecting programming, such as network affiliations and regulatory requirements. Studies show challenges in defining these variables and using proxy measures. One study involves a telephone survey on Internet and media usage patterns among US adults. The study conducted in 2007 involved 3,101 completed interviews with responses to 43 questions about television viewing habits and preferences. The questions covered topics such as time spent watching broadcast television, types of information obtained from different media sources, and preferences for news and current affairs content. The study in 2007 surveyed respondents on their media consumption habits, including sources like satellite TV, the Internet, newspapers, and radio. They were asked about the importance of these sources for breaking news, in-depth information, local news, and national news. Demographic information such as education level, income, location, race, age, and gender was also collected. Additionally, respondents were asked about their willingness to drop channels for a cost reduction and their interest in receiving new channels. The 2007 survey collected data on media consumption habits, including sources like satellite TV, the Internet, newspapers, and radio. Respondents were asked about the importance of these sources for various types of news. Demographic information was also collected. The survey included questions about willingness to drop channels for cost reduction and interest in receiving new channels. The data collected could be relevant to proposals by FCC Chairman Kevin Martin regarding cable television packages. Nielsen presents the data but does not provide analysis. The Nielsen study presents a large data set for researchers to use, with findings showing potential bias towards well-educated and higher-income Americans. Peer reviewer John B. Horrigan raises concerns about low survey response rates and design issues affecting the survey results. The FCC staff conducted a study to gather comprehensive data on media ownership from 2002-2005. The study aimed to explore if the Internet is a substitute or complement to traditional media. The data set covers various media types and expands on a previous 2002 Commission study. The study conducted by FCC staff collected data on media ownership from 2002-2005, including television, radio, Internet access, and newspapers across designated market areas. The focus was on data collection, generating numerous data tables for potential analysis. Over 100,000 observations and 13 million data points were collected, with a caveat on the accuracy of the combined datasets. The study by FCC staff collected data on media ownership from 2002-2005, showing stability in ownership over the period. Multichannel video penetration grew, with cable and satellite operators serving 83.5% of TV households in 2005. Broadcast TV saw a slight increase in stations and a decrease in owners, while co-owned TV and radio stations increased by over 20%. Minority-owned TV stations decreased by three. The number of minority-owned television stations decreased by three from 2002 to 2005, while female-owned stations remained constant at 26. Broadcast radio stations saw a moderate increase, with a decrease in owners and locally owned stations. Co-owned radio/television combinations increased by 19%. Minority-owned radio stations increased slightly, while female-owned stations decreased. The number of daily newspapers slightly decreased, along with a decrease in newspaper owners and locally owned newspapers. Same-city newspaper-broadcast combinations remained stable. The data from FCC Form 323 for 2001-2005 show no substantial changes in ownership. The data from 2001 to 2005 show no significant changes in minority ownership of commercial radio stations, a decline in minority ownership of commercial television stations, and concerns about the reliability of the minority ownership data due to incomplete databases and staggered filing deadlines. The author notes that licensees who are sole proprietorships or partnerships of natural persons are exempt from biennial filing requirements. Many stations failed to complete forms correctly in the initial years, leading to incomplete ownership information. Data from Form 323 is deemed inadequate and contains significant errors, lacking verification or quality control. These data could be used to supplement more reliable information. The author highlights the limitations of the data from Form 323, noting errors and lack of verification. Despite these issues, comparisons to Census Bureau data for 2002 show estimates for minority-owned commercial radio stations. The study analyzes the relationship between TV station ownership and programming quality in the US from 2003 to 2006. The peer reviewer commends the authors for their work in compiling diverse data on minority-owned TV stations and finds the methodology and conclusions reasonable. The study focuses on seven types of programming\u2014local news, public affairs, minority, children's, family, indecent, violent, and religious\u2014using alternative definitions for each. It examines programming quality based on viewership and advertising content. Major findings include broadcast TV offering more news, religious, and violent programs, while cable TV provides more public affairs, children's, and adult programming. Niche programming is also discussed. The study found that niche programming like minority, adult, and religious shows are less widely available compared to general interest programming. Program production for network news, public affairs, family, and religious programming is decreasing, while Latino, children's, and violent programming are on the rise. News and violent shows are highly rated, while Latino/Spanish-language, children's, and family programming have lower ratings. The quality of news programming is declining, but more violent programming is gaining popularity. Affiliates of major broadcast networks offer more advertising minutes at higher prices than other networks. Television networks offer more advertising minutes at higher prices compared to other broadcast stations, leading to a decline in program quality for viewers. Ownership structure influences the amount of local news programming, with stations owned by parent companies with newspapers offering more local news. Corporate parents with larger revenue may offer more or less local news. Local ownership is associated with more public affairs and family programming. Ownership structure does not significantly impact the amount of violent programming on network affiliates. Ownership structure has minimal impact on other programming types or advertising market outcomes. The study is deemed useful for policy purposes by a peer reviewer, who suggests including cable television in the empirical analysis for more robust results. The peer reviewer criticizes the empirical analysis for not including cable television data and ratings in the regressions. They also question the assumption that advertising is inversely related to quality, stating that advertising in media markets functions like a price. The study analyzes the relationship between ownership characteristics of broadcast television stations and the quantity of news and public affairs programming they broadcast. Data was collected on news operations of radio, television stations, and newspapers over a four-year period. Modeling techniques were used to control for various factors. Ownership characteristics of broadcast television stations were analyzed to determine their impact on the quantity of news and public affairs programming. The study found that certain ownership characteristics, such as television-newspaper cross-ownership and ownership by major broadcast networks, were associated with additional minutes of news programming per day. However, most ownership characteristics did not have a significant impact on public affairs programming provision. The study analyzed ownership characteristics of broadcast television stations and their impact on news and public affairs programming. Local ownership is linked to less news programming, while television-radio cross-ownership is associated with more public affairs programming. Higher parent revenues result in less public affairs programming. The sample sizes for some variables were small despite over 6,700 observations for 1,700 stations. The analysis does not include cable channels and Internet news programming, which could impact the audience interested in local broadcast stations' news shows. It also does not distinguish between local and non-local news programming or address the quality of news programming. Individual stations may choose to increase the quality of programming rather than the quantity. The peer reviewer, Philip Leslie, identifies strengths and limitations of the data used in the study. He notes the high level of detail on programming and ownership, but also points out limitations such as the lack of information on viewership for each station. Leslie suggests that while the data is valuable, the limitations raise questions about the broader relevance of the findings. The study examines the relationship between radio station ownership characteristics and the quantity of news programming aired. Data from over 1,000 stations were analyzed, with a focus on the impact on consumers. Market characteristics like size were also considered in the analysis. Market characteristics, such as size, commute time, audience demographics, income, education, and age distribution, have a greater impact on the quantity of news programming aired than station ownership variables. Station owners expanding their radio operations by acquiring more stations may lead to some news programming being aired, but the overall quantity of news may not significantly increase. Geographic distance between the parent company and stations does not affect the amount of news aired. The ownership of radio stations does not significantly affect the quantity of news aired, but it does have a negative impact on the probability of stations airing any news at all. Stations with waivers of FCC rules are more likely to air news, while cross-owned radio stations with in-market television stations are less likely to air news programming. However, if they do air news, the quantity aired will be relatively larger. Overall, in-market television cross-ownership increases the expected quantity of news programming. The study found that in-market television cross-ownership increases the expected quantity of news programming by 31%. Radio station ownership does not significantly affect news quantity but has a negative impact on the probability of airing news. Cross-owned radio stations with in-market television are less likely to air news, but if they do, the quantity aired will be larger. The presence of public affairs programming also increases with radio station expansion. The peer reviewer, Scott Savage, finds the methodology and assumptions reasonable but suggests a stronger justification for ownership variables in the model. He recommends augmenting the dataset with measures of market concentration for concrete conclusions on economies of scope and market power effects. The relationship between 'large owner' and 'small owner' market share and power needs clarification. Endogeneity issues may arise with 'number of in-market stations' and 'total number of stations'. This section examines how ownership structure influences radio stations' adoption of a news format using Arbitron data on format choices of 8,000 stations from 2002 to 2005. Fixed effects regression is employed to account for factors affecting format choices. The study assumes news format stations broadcast more news and analyzes format changes due to ownership shifts. More evidence is needed to make causal claims. Ownership structure influences radio stations' adoption of a news format. AM stations are six times more likely to be news stations than FM stations due to sound quality differences. Cross-ownership with a newspaper or television station increases the likelihood of being a news station. Commercial stations are less likely to adopt a news format. Ownership structure influences radio stations' adoption of a news format, with AM stations being six times more likely to be news stations than FM stations. Cross-ownership with a newspaper or television station also increases the likelihood of being a news station. Commercial stations are only about 25% as likely to adopt a news format as noncommercial stations. Stations with a local marketing agreement (LMA) may be less likely to be news stations, but entering into an LMA may make a station more likely to be a news station. Having a sibling news radio station in the market increases a station's propensity to adopt a news format by about 50%. Radio stations with owners in the same state are significantly more likely to be news stations. The peer reviewer, Scott Savage, assistant professor of economics at the University of Colorado, approves of the methodology and assumptions used in the study on ownership characteristics and news operations of newspapers. The study analyzed 134 newspapers in the largest 60 designated market areas in 2005. The local market was defined as the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), rather than DMA. The study analyzed 134 newspapers in the largest 60 designated market areas in 2005. The local market is defined as the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), rather than DMA. The absolute amount of space allocated for news in the \"general news\" section of the newspaper is used as a quantity measure of news operations. Newspapers that are co-owned with other newspapers within the same Metropolitan Statistical Areas are associated with a 5% decrease in the absolute amount of news provided. The level of newspaper concentration in the market has no effect on news operations. The peer reviewer, Philip Leslie, finds that the data in the study are well explained but focused on larger markets, not representative of all newspapers in the US. He questions how newspapers competing in markets are identified and suggests robustness checks on this issue. Leslie notes potential issues with defining news operations based on the quantity of news in the general news section of a newspaper. The study evaluates the effects of ownership structure on program content, advertising prices, and listenership for broadcast radio. Professor Leslie questions the causal effect of the analysis due to lack of exogenous variation in ownership structure. He notes a positive relationship between co-ownership of newspapers in the same market and the percentage of total newspaper space taken up by news, which contradicts the negative relationship with the absolute amount of news. The study analyzes the effects of ownership structure on broadcast radio programming using various data sources. Most regressions do not show significant relationships between ownership and programming variables. Market size is a key factor in the findings. Ownership concentration in broadcast radio markets does not significantly affect the number of available formats, but it does impact format spread. Smaller markets have higher ownership concentration due to FCC rules, leading to less format pile-up. Markets with more stations have more formats and less pile-up. Cross-ownership with local newspapers is also mentioned. In radio markets, ownership concentration does not affect the number of formats but influences format spread. Large markets with national radio companies have more formats and less pile-up. Commonly owned stations in the same market are more likely to have the same format. Ownership characteristics are less predictive than market demographics for format similarity. Consolidation in small markets leads to fewer formats. In small markets, consolidation leads to fewer formats. Newspaper-radio cross-ownership results in longer talk and news blocks. Stations with national owners offer more syndicated programs. National ownership negatively impacts music block length in the evening. Commonly owned stations in different markets are programmed similarly. Minimal association between cross-ownership and radio programming. Local radio consolidation in concentrated markets leads to reductions in music, local, live, and news programming in the evening. Stations in concentrated markets offer longer uninterrupted sports programming in the evening, offsetting shorter news segments. Commonly-owned news stations in the same market overlap in 14%-22% of their programming, while commonly-owned sports stations in the same market overlap in 8%-14% of their programming. Consolidation in local radio markets does not have a significant impact on advertising prices. National ownership of radio stations has a negative effect on advertising prices. Sports programming for commonly-owned stations, within or across markets, shows no statistically significant overlap. News stations in the same market have a significant overlap in programming, with more overlap within markets than across markets. National ownership of radio stations has a negative impact on advertising prices, while radio cross-ownership with television in large markets has a positive effect on advertising prices. Consolidation in local radio markets does not affect average listening to radio. Listeners in large markets served by large radio groups listen more, but concentration in large markets is associated with lower average station ratings. Stations with commonly owned stations achieve higher ratings, and cross-ownership of radio stations with local newspapers increases listenership. Ownership structure of radio stations has a significant impact on listenership, with cross-ownership of radio stations with local newspapers showing a positive effect. The econometric analysis is deemed simple and transparent by the peer reviewer, Andrew Sweeting, although causal effects are not directly proven. When analyzing coefficients in regressions, it is important to focus on patterns that are consistent across multiple specifications to indicate true correlations. Results without controls for market demographics should be disregarded, as these demographics can influence programming differences. Increasing the number of observations in station-pair analysis can lead to lower standard errors and affect coefficients. In the Edison data base, monitoring different stations on different days can create misleading impressions of programming overlap. For example, syndicated shows may appear to overlap across stations in the same market, even if they were never available on both stations on the same day. The study presents various measures of programming, with some more relevant for policy than others, such as ownership's impact on commercials or local news programming. This study examines the influence of cross-ownership of a newspaper and television station on the content of local television news broadcasts. It compares late evening local news broadcasts of cross-owned television stations with their major network-affiliated competitors in the same market. The findings show that local television stations devote approximately 26 minutes to total news coverage, with 80% of the time focused on local stories, but also include sports and weather news. Local news coverage, excluding sports and weather, is less than half of total broadcast news time. State and local political coverage averages around three minutes per newscast. Television stations cross-owned with newspapers have slightly more total news coverage, but other ownership factors are not significant. Cross-owned stations also have 80 to 100 seconds more local news coverage than non-cross-owned stations. Television stations cross-owned with newspapers offer more sports and weather coverage than non-cross-owned stations, but similar amounts of other local news. Television-newspaper cross-ownership is positively associated with state and local political coverage, while television-radio cross-ownership is linked to a significant reduction in political coverage. The study found that television stations cross-owned with newspapers provide more state and local political coverage, with a 50% reduction in coverage on non-cross-owned stations. Fox network affiliates also offer more political news. Cross-owned stations allocate more time to political candidates speaking for themselves, with Fox affiliates showing even more candidate coverage. Other ownership or network controls do not significantly impact political coverage. The study found that cross-owned television stations provide more state and local political coverage compared to non-cross-owned stations, with Fox network affiliates offering the most political news. Both cross-owned and non-cross-owned stations allocate political coverage fairly evenly, with slight differences in partisan slant measures. CBS and NBC affiliates devote less time to covering political opinion polls compared to other networks. The study found that cross-owned television stations provide more state and local political coverage compared to non-cross-owned stations. The cross-owned stations exhibit a slight Republican-leaning slant, with a positive association between Democratic voting preferences in the local electorate and Democratic slant in newscasts. Partisan slant is influenced by demand market forces. The peer reviewer, Matthew Gentzkow, found errors in the coding of the data set used for the study on cross-owned television stations' impact on the market. Despite corrections, some results could not be replicated, but the overall direction and significance of the coefficients remain unchanged. Gentzkow acknowledges the study's data as a significant advancement in understanding news coverage. The data provide a detailed view of local television news coverage, with a focus on specific categories. The study's sample selection criteria are well-designed for within-market comparisons. However, the data only cover three days in November 2006, raising concerns about generalizability. Professor Gentzkow notes that coding news content is subjective, with measures like minutes of news being more objective than identifying partisan issues. This study examines female and minority ownership in media industries in the US using data from the 2002 Survey of Business Owners. It highlights the importance of considering interactions between variables in the analysis and provides recommendations for the FCC on analyzing minority and female ownership of media enterprises. The study on female and minority ownership in media industries in the US based on 2002 data finds under-representation in radio, television, newspapers, and non-farm businesses. Women own only 14.01% of radio stations, 13.68% of television stations, 20.25% of newspapers, and 17.74% of non-farm businesses. Hispanics own even less, with only 3.71% of radio stations, 6.04% of television stations, 1.58% of newspapers, and 3.85% of non-farm businesses. Ownership disparities exist in media industries in the US based on 2002 data. Women own 14.01% of radio stations, 13.68% of television stations, 20.25% of newspapers, and 17.74% of non-farm businesses. Hispanics own 3.71% of radio stations, 6.04% of television stations, 1.58% of newspapers, and 3.85% of non-farm businesses. Blacks, American Indians, and Asians also face ownership challenges in various media sectors. Ownership disparities in media industries in the US are linked to systematic factors, particularly access to capital, which contributes to under-representation of minorities. High concentration ratios in certain industries indicate barriers to entry, likely in the form of capital requirements. Disparities in net worth between whites and nonwhites further highlight the economic challenges faced by minorities. The author recommends that the FCC improve its data collection process to track minority and female ownership in media enterprises more accurately. Currently, the data collected is deemed unreliable for serious analysis due to measurement errors. The average net worth ratio between whites and nonwhites is 3.5, indicating minorities have less capital for media ventures. Further analysis is needed for the position of females in media ownership. The FCC should improve data collection to accurately track minority and female ownership in media enterprises. Currently, firms are classified based on ownership demographics, but efforts should also include publicly traded vs. privately owned firms. The Commission should examine the rationale behind increasing minority and female ownership and how ownership policies impact media content. The peer reviewer suggests that the FCC should conduct a more comprehensive study on ownership disparity in media, rather than a small analysis. He argues that factors like education and industry experience should be considered, as attributing all disparity to race or gender is incorrect. Additionally, he criticizes the aggregation of minority categories, such as Hispanics, which may overlook important distinctions. Professor McCullough criticizes the authors for lumping together Hispanics and argues that attributing ownership disparity solely to race or gender is incorrect. He questions the lack of consideration for education and work experience in the analysis and suggests more research is needed to establish a link between race and access to capital. Additionally, he recommends that the authors define the variables they want collected for the FCC database on minority and female ownership of television broadcast stations. The television duopoly rule was amended in 1996 to allow ownership of two stations in certain markets, with specific conditions. The study from 1999 to 2006 focuses on transactions resulting in television duopolies post-rule change and the number of stations purchased or sold by minority or women owners in these markets. The relaxation of the duopoly rule from 1999 to 2006 did not benefit minority and female ownership of television stations. Instead, the largest 25 television broadcast station owners were the main beneficiaries. The rule change allowed for local management agreements (LMAs) between group station owners and the stations they managed, enabling cost reduction, market expansion, and increased advertising revenue shares. Some group station owners used LMAs to their advantage. The relaxation of the duopoly rule from 1999 to 2006 primarily benefited the largest broadcast group owners, who leveraged their control of LMAs to access attractive programming. These owners accounted for 83 out of 109 duopolies identified, with many acquiring \"sister\" stations outright. Only one minority-owned duopoly was created, which has since been dissolved, leading to a 27% drop in the number of minority-owned television stations between 1999 and 2006. Between 1999 and 2006, the number of minority-owned television stations dropped by 27%, with a more significant decrease of over 39% in markets with television duopolies. Female-owned stations were more likely to be found in non-duopoly markets, and 36% of those operating in duopoly markets were sold to non-female, non-minority owners. The study also presents untested hypotheses about the relationship between the revised duopoly rule and minority/female ownership. The argument made in 1992 by a minority broadcaster expressed concerns about how increasing ownership caps or loosening duopoly rules could negatively impact minority ownership. The broadcaster believed that relaxation of ownership rules in 1985 led to increased demand for stations, causing station prices to rise and putting minority-owned stations at a disadvantage. However, the relationship between the dual ownership rule and minority ownership remains unproven. The FCC's old minority tax certificate program was successful in promoting broadcast property sales to minority owners. The loosening of the dual ownership rule in 1996, following the elimination of the tax certificate program, led to a significant decline in minority ownership since 1999. However, the exact impact of the rule change versus other factors remains unclear. The peer reviewer criticized the analysis for a fundamental logical error. Professor McCullough criticizes the study for a logical error in assuming that duopoly markets are the sole reason for minority-owned stations being sold more frequently. The authors failed to control for differences between duopoly and non-duopoly markets, despite having access to statistical techniques to do so. The authors did not control for confounding variables in their analysis of minority-owned and women-owned broadcast stations, which undermines their findings. They attributed changes solely to the relaxation of the duopoly rule without considering other economic or demographic factors. The lack of evidence provided raises questions about the true cause of the decline in minority-owned and women-owned stations. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) submitted a study supporting the relaxation of the duopoly rule for television stations in smaller markets to improve financial relief and competitiveness against cable operators. The study shows declining profitability for television stations in markets 51-175 from 1997 to 2005, especially for lower-rated affiliated stations. The NAB study supports relaxing the duopoly rule for TV stations in smaller markets to improve financial relief. It shows declining profitability for stations in markets 51-175 from 1997 to 2005, especially for lower-rated stations. The study suggests that common ownership of two stations in smaller markets would help struggling stations. The study uses selective financial data, omitting even-numbered years when political advertising boosts revenues.

The study uses selective financial data, omitting even-numbered years when political advertising boosts revenues. The study examines the prevalence of vertical integration in television programming and its impact on independent programmers. The study analyzes the impact of vertical integration on TV networks by comparing ratings and advertising revenues of in-house vs. independent programming. It also examines the influence of MVPDs on subscriber fees and advertising revenues of integrated vs. independent cable networks. The study does not address strategic use of in-house \"must have\" programming by cable providers. The study found that a large portion of programming on broadcast networks during prime-time is produced in-house, with programs from production companies tied to a network being more likely to be broadcast on their affiliated network. Independently produced programs are spread evenly across networks, but in-house programming attracts just as many viewers. Vertically integrated prime-time broadcast programs perform worse in terms of advertising revenue compared to independent shows in the same time slot. Independent programs need 16% higher advertising revenues to air, indicating a lower standard for vertically integrated shows. When considering ownership affiliations, vertically integrated programs have 25% less advertising revenues on the margin. The study found that vertically integrated programs have 25% less advertising revenues compared to fully independent programs. This suggests that cost-based efficiency explanations for vertical integration may not be sufficient. The networks seem to demand similar advertising revenue generation for both independent and in-house programming, indicating small efficiencies from in-house production. Revenues from independent programming and programming from companies with ownership ties to rival networks may be influenced by rival networks' bargaining power over syndication revenue. Broadcast networks may demand higher advertising revenue if they can't share in syndication profits. Cable program networks lack system-level data on network performance, with evidence being more suggestive than for broadcast networks. The largest MVPDs have consolidated nationally over time due to cable consolidation and DBS growth. The cable industry has seen consolidation over time, with the growth of DBS providers. Each market has shifted from a monopoly for local cable to sharing with DBS providers and now with major telephone companies entering some markets. The share of vertically integrated networks has decreased, with cable networks owned by MVPDs falling from 40% in 1996 to 20% in 2005. Many cable networks are now without any MVPD ownership. The share of cable networks owned by MVPDs decreased from 40% in 1996 to 20% in 2005. Most cable networks are now owned by major media conglomerates. Vertical integration has a small negative effect on subscriber numbers but a small positive effect on subscriber growth rate. When a channel becomes vertically integrated, the number of viewers watching the channel decreases. Vertical integration of cable networks has little impact on license revenue, advertising revenue, and programming costs. Analysis shows that there are no noticeable benefits for revenues or costs before and after vertical integration. Even for newer networks started since 1997, there are no major differences in results. The efficiencies of vertical integration seem to benefit start-up networks more than well-established ones. Vertical integration of cable networks does not significantly impact subscriber growth rates. Evidence suggests that cable systems are more likely to carry a cable network if they have an ownership interest in it, but this relationship weakens with a higher DBS share in the local market. This indicates that competitive pressures may be driving vertical integration rather than efficiencies. The DBS share averages around 20%-25%, indicating that competitive pressures may drive vertical integration rather than efficiencies. There is little evidence that vertically integrated cable networks attract more subscribers, grow faster, raise more advertising revenues, or have lower programming costs. The regression analysis used in the study is considered valid but results should be viewed as suggestive rather than conclusive. The report highlights the absence of detailed vetting of results' robustness to alternative model specifications and the lack of meaningful cost measures. Large differences in prime-time program costs by format and network could bias or invalidate results. The study notes that most 'independent' cable networks are owned by affiliates of large media conglomerates, suggesting that financial resources or bargaining leverage, rather than vertical integration, may be the most significant advantage. The study questions the positive impact of vertical integration on cable network performance, suggesting that networks' success may be more attributed to their financial resources and bargaining leverage. The methodology used in the regression analysis is criticized for combining various aspects of vertical integration's effects, making interpretation of the results questionable. The FCC's fifth review of the radio industry focuses on data collection since the 1996 Telecommunications Act, including ownership consolidation, diversity, and trends in satellite radio. Professor Waterman approves the analysis of basic cable networks but notes the study overlooks the impact of vertical integration on independently owned networks and their placement on basic or digital tiers. The FCC's fifth review of the radio industry examines ownership diversity, format diversity, satellite radio, financial performance, listenership, and advertising rates. It highlights the increase in commercial radio stations but a decline in owners due to consolidation post-1996 Act. The study shows a decrease in the annual average of radio stations changing hands from 1996 to 2000 to 2001 to 2006. Consolidation in the radio industry has seen a slight increase since 2002, with the number of radio station owners with 20 or more stations doubling from 1996 to 2002. The two largest radio group owners in 1996 owned fewer than 65 stations each, but by March 2007, the top owners had significantly more stations. Clear Channel Communications, the largest group owner, announced plans to restructure and sell 448 stations in 2006. This indicates a trend towards consolidation, with approximately 60% of all commercial radio stations affected. Consolidation in the radio industry has increased since 2002. In the 299 radio markets delineated by Arbitron, one entity controls 40% or more of the market's total radio advertising revenue in 189 markets. The trend towards greater concentration in local radio markets has tapered off over time. The number of radio owners nationally has declined, reflecting a general trend across Arbitron markets. In March 2007, the average number of owners was 9.4, ranging from 6.5 in the smallest markets to 23.9 in the largest markets. The average number of radio formats available has remained steady at around 10 from March 1996 to March 2007, with smaller markets offering fewer formats. The number of radio formats has slightly declined in larger markets but increased in smaller markets. The growth in subscriptions to satellite radio services like Sirius and XM has been significant, with over 14.5 million subscribers. Earnings before interest and taxes margin (EBIT margin) is a key indicator of a company's profitability. Gross profit margins of radio broadcast companies were higher than S&P 500 companies before 2001. The EBIT margin for radio companies has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 companies since 2002. Radio companies show strong seasonality in gross margins, highest in the second and third quarters. Net profit margins for radio companies have been below the S&P 500 companies, despite higher gross profits. After the first quarter of 2002, radio companies have seen an increase in net profit margins compared to the median S&P 500 company. This is attributed to radio companies using more debt to finance operations, leading to higher interest expenses and lower net profit margins. The debt load of publicly traded radio companies has increased significantly since 2004, leading to higher volatility in earnings compared to S&P 500 companies. Fixed charge coverage after taxes measures a firm's ability to pay interest expenses from net income. The fixed charge coverage ratio for radio stations shows positive results, except for a few quarters in 2001 and 2002. The market to book ratio reflects the market's assessment of a firm's value after paying off creditors. The market to book ratio for radio companies exceeded that of the S&P 500 before 2000, but dropped below it in the first quarter of 2000 and has remained lower since. This suggests a decline in the market value of radio companies relative to book value compared to the S&P 500. The return measure for radio companies reflects stock price appreciation and dividends to shareholders. Radio company stocks outperformed the S&P 500 until 2000, with greater volatility due to leverage. Stock returns declined sharply in 2000 and 2001 but bounced back in 2002, exceeding the S&P 500 in some quarters. Since 2004, radio companies have underperformed the S&P 500, likely due to the slowing economy. The decline in radio industry stock value may be attributed to the slowing economy and decreased opportunities for profit through acquisitions. The average number of radio listeners per quarter hour has been decreasing since 2002. The average number of radio listeners per quarter hour has fallen from 19.7 million to 18.4 million, a 6.6% drop. Listener ratings remained steady between 2000 and 2005 but declined in 2005. Radio advertising prices have increased steadily since 1996, with a dip between 2002 and 2004. The cost of radio advertising has nearly doubled since the 1996 Act was passed. The cost of radio advertising has almost doubled since the 1996 Act, with an annual growth rate of approximately 10%, compared to a 3% increase in the CPI. Radio consolidation could impact advertising prices by giving companies more market power. George Ford, a peer reviewer, found the study's interpretation of financial trends to be in line with professional standards. Dr. Ford, a peer reviewer, found the study's interpretation of financial trends to be in line with professional standards. He criticized the statistics for not fully supporting the argument that consolidation has slowed. The Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, and Free Press submitted a detailed document criticizing FCC-commissioned studies and presenting their own econometric models. The Consumer Commenters revised econometric models in FCC-sponsored studies to correct mis-specifications. Their analysis showed that media ownership limits should not be relaxed as newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership leads to a decrease in local news production. The Commission studied the impact of mergers at the station level, finding that cross-ownership leads to a loss of independent voices and a decline in market-wide news production. This challenges recent studies and the basis for relaxing ownership rules. Consumer Commenters submitted studies critiquing FCC studies, with Media General, Inc. providing a rebuttal but not conducting its own regression analysis. The Consumer Commenters criticize the FCC studies for technical model specification issues and fundamental questions about addressing policy issues. They argue that the studies focus on the local news output of cross-owned stations rather than the entire market. The Consumer Commenters criticize FCC studies for focusing on local news output of cross-owned stations rather than the entire market. They argue that while cross-ownership may increase news output at individual stations, it leads to a decline in total local news output for the market as a whole. The Consumer Commenters argue that cross-ownership of television stations and newspapers may increase news output at individual stations but lead to a decline in total local news output for the market as a whole. They distinguish between grandfathered stations and those with waivers, stating that the behavior of acquired stations does not reflect the effects of cross-ownership. The behavior of TV stations in cross-ownership combinations reflects the long-term effect of cross-ownership. Waived cross-ownership situations involve recently merged TV stations and newspapers, with the analysis suggesting that the \"benefits\" of cross-ownership are just due to the acquisition of stations already producing more news. Newly minted TV-newspaper combinations in less concentrated, larger markets are likely to behave differently. The newly minted TV-newspaper combinations may behave differently due to waivers, potentially changing behavior if waivers become permanent. Consumer Commenters argue for FCC studies on media ownership's impact on local news and public affairs programming, highlighting a discrepancy in Study 4's focus on all news and public affairs programming. The Consumer Commenters criticize FCC-commissioned models for not considering key station and market characteristics that impact programming, such as television duopolies, Local Marketing Agreements, market concentration, ownership by major networks, and the ability to provide local news. These factors are essential for promoting localism, diversity of voices, and competition in media policy. The age of the television station, whether it is VHF or UHF, and ownership by major networks can influence revenues and programming, potentially impacting the ability to provide local news programming. The FCC is criticized for not accurately documenting the gender and race of broadcast licensees and commissioning last-minute studies without usable data on minority ownership. The Consumer Commenters criticize the FCC for flawed data on minority ownership, stating that relaxation of media ownership limits reduces minority ownership. They claim that external studies commissioned by the FCC had to resort to other data sources due to the absence of usable data on minority ownership. Study 7 relied on a Bureau of Census count of firms to estimate minority ownership. The Consumer Commenters criticize Study 7 for using firm count instead of station count to estimate minority ownership in broadcast. They also mention Study 8's findings on the impact of FCC's duopoly rules on minority ownership, stating that sales of minority stations were higher in duopoly markets. The Consumer Commenters criticize Study 7 for using firm count instead of station count to estimate minority ownership in broadcast. They question the confidence in Study 8's findings on minority ownership, pointing out flaws in the database used to build accurate minority ownership data. The Consumer Commenters criticize Study 8 for potentially overstating the decline in minority and female ownership of stations. They question the accuracy of the database used in the study and suggest that the findings may not accurately reflect the actual reduction in ownership. Study 8 is criticized for attributing changes in minority ownership solely to the duopoly rule without considering other factors like the elimination of the minority tax certificate program. Study 6's analysis of media bias is questioned for using a flawed methodology called \"contentless content analysis\" that fails to analyze the actual content of media coverage. The Consumer Commenters criticize the methodology used in attributing ideology to media outlets and argue that counting references to phrases or issues does not reveal how they were used or portrayed. They point out flaws in categorizing news coverage, such as labeling the Iraq war as a Democratic issue when President Bush frequently spoke about it during press conferences. The Consumer Commenters criticize the methodology used in Study 6, arguing that the author risked using a non-representative sample by analyzing a single special week before the 2006 election. They also question the objectivity of the peer reviewer of Study 6. Additionally, Study 9 is criticized for ignoring key characteristics of the contemporary video industry. The Consumer Commenters criticize the methodology used in Study 6 and Study 9 for ignoring key characteristics of the contemporary video industry. They argue that independents are disadvantaged in new shows and pilots due to biased data sets, leading to lower ratings for vertically integrated shows. The Consumer Commenters criticize Study 9 for using shows instead of hours or time slots, leading to misrepresented data on vertically integrated and independent programming ratings. They also point out a data limitation regarding the use of revenues instead of profits, which could introduce bias. The Consumer Commenters criticize Study 9 for using shows instead of hours or time slots, leading to misrepresented data on vertically integrated and independent programming ratings. They also question the exclusion of news programming, the focus on reality programming, and the failure to consider movies, programming tiers, and broadcast networks in the analysis. The FCC-commissioned studies and comments from Consumer Commenters provide a wealth of data on media ownership, viewer preferences, and programming. While there are gaps in data collection, there are now large, detailed datasets available for policy makers. However, databases on minority and female ownership are incomplete and inaccurate. The FCC-commissioned studies highlight incomplete and inaccurate data on broadcast and telecommunications properties, making statistical analysis unreliable. There is a lack of information on consumer demand for individual programs or channels, and the FCC has not collected data on specific programming tiers offered by MVPDs. Many statistical findings in the studies are not robust or statistically significant, leading to disclaimers from researchers and peer reviewers. Some researchers found that demand variables have a stronger influence on programming decisions than supply variables. The implications of this finding are open to competing interpretations regarding ownership limits and their impact on localism and diversity. Only the study on vertical integration performed statistical analysis. The 10 studies on cable ownership and programming faced technical criticisms, mainly focusing on the impact of media ownership on individual stations rather than total programming available to consumers. Consumer Commenters claim that modifying the studies showed loosening media ownership limits harmed the public interest. The 10 FCC-commissioned studies and additional data collection by Consumer Commenters suggest that loosening media ownership limits may harm the public interest. The studies have not undergone full review but were critiqued by Harold Furchtgott-Roth in an econometric review appended to Media General's reply comments. The 1996 Telecommunications Act mandates the FCC to periodically review media ownership rules and justify any numerical limits with reasoned analysis. The Consumer Commenters' data provides detailed media ownership and programming information, but gaps in data collection and analysis, especially regarding minority ownership, may hinder FCC's analysis of media ownership rules. Despite this, the data offers valuable insights for public policy discussions. The concept of diversity of voices remains ambiguous in the FCC's public interest determination. The concept of diversity of voices in media is ambiguous, with various interpretations such as different viewpoints, issues addressed, programming variety, and gatekeepers. Concerns arise regarding FCC rules, especially regarding minority ownership, due to inaccurate and incomplete data on the subject. The FCC's databases on minority and female ownership are inaccurate and incomplete, posing risks for policy analysis. The Third Circuit instructed the FCC to consider the impact of changes in media ownership rules on minority ownership, but without accurate data, such analysis is impossible. Loosening the television duopoly rule may have reduced opportunities for minority ownership, as station prices increased, putting minority-owned stations at a disadvantage. Further loosening of the duopoly rule could diminish opportunities for minority ownership in the media market. The accuracy and completeness of data on minority and female ownership are questionable, hindering the analysis of the impact of media ownership rules. The Third Circuit may not approve any FCC media ownership rule until accurate data is available. The Third Circuit requires accurate minority ownership data before approving any FCC media ownership rule. Governmental measures to promote minority broadcast entry must meet strict scrutiny standards under the Equal Protection Clause. Proponents of measures to facilitate minority broadcast entry propose defining socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) to include individuals with social disadvantages due to discrimination, in addition to economic criteria. The FCC sought comment on defining SDBs to satisfy constitutional standards, considering past court decisions and dissents. Empirical evidence may be required to demonstrate the nexus between membership in a racial group and program eligibility. The FCC's policies assume a strong correlation between race and behavior, focusing on ownership to improve programming. The dissent argues that this assumption may not always hold true, as it relies on preferences linked to race dictating owner behavior. The FCC's emphasis on minority-owned stations may not necessarily lead to the desired diversity in viewpoints. The FCC's policies assume a strong correlation between race and programming, but three difficulties suggest this nexus is less substantial. Market influences programming, owners have limited control, and the FCC lacks factual basis for the nexus. If the Supreme Court supports this view, FCC programs providing preferences to SDBs may face challenges. The FCC's policies assume a strong correlation between race and programming, but the Commission lacks data to support this. The burden would be on the FCC to demonstrate how favoring socially disadvantaged minority groups fosters diversity in broadcasting, but they do not have accurate data on minority ownership to make such a showing. The FCC lacks accurate data on minority ownership and diverse programming. They have not established that diverse programming is not currently being sufficiently provided by minority owners. The FCC has not performed a survey to identify issues of interest to socially disadvantaged groups or collected data on local news and public affairs programming to determine if minority-owned stations offer more programming addressing those issues. The FCC's media ownership rules are applied when an entity proposes to increase its media holdings nationally or locally. In a June 2, 2003 order, the FCC reviewed implementing bright line rules with specific limits on the number of media outlets a company can own in a local market. The Commission chose the bright-line approach for regulatory certainty, in addition to the goals of diversity, localism, and competition. The FCC's media ownership rules aim to provide regulatory certainty for companies in the media industry. Clear rules benefit firms entering or exiting the market, allowing for better business planning and investment decisions. Despite challenges in setting numerical limits, the FCC may consider a case-by-case approach as suggested by then-chairman Powell after the Third Circuit remanded the rules. The FCC is considering whether to modify its approach to setting numerical limits for media ownership rules. While currently using bright-line rules, the Commission is exploring alternative regulatory schemes. Data analysis suggests challenges in constructing effective numerical limits for fostering diversity, localism, and competition. The FCC is exploring alternative regulatory schemes for setting numerical limits on media ownership rules. Researchers have found few strong findings regarding the relationship between ownership characteristics and programming objectives, with statistical findings not being robust. The studies do not identify threshold ownership levels for setting numerical limits. Former FCC chief economist Leslie Marx proposed a methodology for determining the critical number of outlets needed to ensure competition goals. The FCC is considering new regulatory schemes for media ownership rules. Studies have not found strong evidence linking ownership characteristics to programming goals. Former FCC chief economist Leslie Marx suggested a method to determine the critical number of outlets needed for competition goals. Study 9 found that most prime-time programming on broadcast networks is produced in-house, ruling out cost-based efficiency explanations. The majority of independent cable networks launched in the study period are owned by large media conglomerates, indicating that financial resources and bargaining leverage, rather than vertical integration itself, are key advantages. Vertical integration reducing program source diversity is not driven by efficiency. A bright-line rule treating broadcast stations owned by major networks the same as independent stations may overlook the impact of vertical integration on diversity. Case-by-case analysis may be more effective in assessing acquisition impacts. The Consumer Commenters argue that large media companies owning broadcast networks use must-carry and retransmission consent rights to reduce cable network program source diversity. Broadcasters now have stronger negotiating power due to competition from DBS providers and telephone companies. The broadcasters have stronger negotiating power with competing MVPDs, but uncertainty remains regarding must-carry and retransmission consent rights for multiple digital signals. This regulatory issue could impact programming decisions in local markets. Analyzing proposed acquisitions on a case-by-case basis may be advantageous given the uncertainty. The FCC may consider analyzing acquisitions on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in must-carry and retransmission consent rules instead of implementing numerical limits. There are proposals for \u00e0 la carte pricing for program networks, allowing subscribers to opt out of certain channels for a price reduction. Advocates of \u00e0 la carte pricing argue that the current practice of bundling cable networks forces consumers to pay for unwanted channels to access desired ones. They believe tiered pricing leads to higher prices and overlooks the demand for niche channels. On the other hand, proponents of tiering argue it is cost-efficient, lowers retail prices, and enhances consumer experience by allowing channel surfing. Advocates of \u00e0 la carte pricing argue that it increases consumer benefits by allowing channel surfing, reduces risks for new cable networks, and supports niche networks. Studies show that in an \u00e0 la carte system, subscribers are interested in dropping channels for cost savings and would like access to channels not currently subscribed to. Most respondents could not identify specific channels they want to drop, suggesting contentment with large channel bundles. Premium channels like HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax were desired but not subscribed to due to larger package requirements. This indicates that most MVPDs already include general interest channels in their basic tiers. Study 3 found that niche programming is less widely available than general interest programming, with news and violent programming being highly rated. Latino/Spanish-language, children's, and family programming are rated lower, while non-Latino minority and religious programming are even lower due to low audience ratings. The public policy issue is how to best serve audiences for niche programming, such as non-Latino minority and religious content with low audience ratings. Tiered pricing may not consider the demand intensity for individual channels, leading to popular general interest channels being carried over highly valued niche channels. MVPDs typically offer popular programming on basic tiers and less popular content on higher-priced tiers or \u00e0 la carte. Subscriber demand data for individual channels is lacking, making it difficult to prioritize niche programming. The market shows that a small number of viewers can support niche programming if they are willing to pay enough for it. For example, DirecTV and DISH TV offer Korean language packages due to the willingness of households to pay between $25 and $30 a month for several Korean language channels. Demand for non-Spanish foreign language programming is high in households with limited English speakers or those wanting to maintain cultural ties. It's uncertain if there's enough demand for niche programming like non-foreign language minority or religious content to support \u00e0 la carte options. MVPDs may not offer such niche programming due to perceived low demand and opportunity costs. Some niche programming, like Korean language channels, are only available on higher priced tiers, even if offered as an \u00e0 la carte option. Subscribers must also purchase the basic cable tier, which includes local broadcast stations. Critics argue that requiring audiences to buy larger, more expensive tiers for niche programming not available \u00e0 la carte is unfair. Some niche programming, such as Korean language channels, is only accessible on more expensive tiers, even if offered \u00e0 la carte. The intensity of demand for niche channels and potential consumer welfare loss in the current system is unclear, making it difficult to regulate their carriage."
