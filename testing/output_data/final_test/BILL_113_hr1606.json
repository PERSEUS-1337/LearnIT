The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2013\" includes a section on the Supplemental Coverage Option, which amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to provide producers with additional coverage options based on yield and loss basis, individual or area, and margin basis. The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2013\" introduces amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act regarding the level of coverage available to producers. The level of coverage is dollar denominated and can be purchased up to 85% of individual yield or 95% of area yield. The Corporation must provide producers with information on catastrophic risk and additional coverage options within allowable limits. The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2013\" allows producers to purchase supplemental coverage in combination with a policy or plan of insurance, offering indemnities equal to a part of the deductible at a county-wide level. The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2013\" allows producers to purchase supplemental coverage triggered by losses exceeding 10 percent of normal levels, determined by the Corporation at a county-wide level. The premium for coverage under paragraph (3)(B) and clause (i) must not exceed 90 percent of the selected coverage level. Premium calculation should cover anticipated losses, reserves, and operating expenses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act amends the payment of premiums by the corporation for supplemental coverage options to cover operating and administrative expenses. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation will provide additional coverage based on individual and area yield and loss starting in the 2014 crop year. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation will use data from the Risk Management Agency or the National Agricultural Statistics Service to determine actual production history for additional coverage starting in the 2014 crop year."
