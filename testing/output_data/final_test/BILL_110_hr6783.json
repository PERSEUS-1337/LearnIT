Congress finds that the United States' strength lies in its commitment to democracy, freedom, and national unity, reinforced by rituals like the Pledge of Allegiance. The recitation of the Pledge is a recognized national unity ritual established by Congress in 1942. The national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, was inspired by the American flag still waving at Fort McHenry after British bombardment. Congress declared it the national anthem in 1931. Most Americans are immigrants or descendants, proud to be American. To become citizens of the United States, lawful permanent residents must renounce allegiance to their country of origin, swear allegiance to the US laws and Constitution, and demonstrate English language proficiency. English is the common language of the US, uniting its people regardless of race or ancestry. The government may take steps to reinforce national unity, including using its funding for this purpose. The Government aims to protect national unity by restricting the use of Federal funds for activities that undermine it. This includes withholding funds from schools that allow the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem in languages other than English. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PROHIBITION, ENFORCEMENT, AND PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\" is a section related to the prohibition, enforcement, and private right of action within a larger context of restricting the use of Federal funds for activities that undermine national unity. No State or local educational agency can require the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem to be recited in any language other than English in schools under their jurisdiction, except for events not affiliated with the agency. Organizations must not require the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem to be recited in any language other than English at official meetings or events. If a State or local educational agency violates this rule, they may lose federal funding for the following fiscal year. The Secretary will report to Congress on State or local educational agencies that violate the rules regarding the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem, and publish a list of agencies subject to withholding of Federal funds. Exceptions may apply if the Secretary finds no violation. The Secretary will report violations of rules on the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem by State or local educational agencies. Funds may not be withheld if appropriated after the finding and specifically designated for the agency. A notation of the report date and page number must be included in the appropriation. Private Right of Action: A person injured by a violation of the rules on the Pledge of Allegiance or national anthem by a State or local educational agency can seek relief through a civil action, including a declaratory judgment under United States Code. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key terms are defined such as elementary school, local educational agency, secondary school, Secretary, and State educational agency. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801) is defined in this Act along with key terms such as elementary school, local educational agency, secondary school, Secretary, and State educational agency."
