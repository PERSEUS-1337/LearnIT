    "content": "The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) established a national system for protecting rivers that meet specific criteria. Rivers must be free-flowing and have adjacent land with scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values to be included in the system. Free-flowing rivers are those in a natural state without human modifications. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (WSRA) established a national system for protecting rivers that meet specific criteria. A river may be included in the system even if it had been developed beyond its free-flowing condition, but future construction of structures is not condoned. Each river in the system is classified as wild, scenic, or recreational based on its characteristics and values at the time of designation. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act classifies rivers as wild, scenic, or recreational areas based on their characteristics. Designation provides protections from development and adverse impacts. Designation of rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act provides protections from development and adverse effects. Congress can designate rivers for potential addition to the system, with the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture studying and recommending segments for inclusion. Boundaries of potential additions are defined as within one-quarter mile from the river's high water mark. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act designates rivers for protection from development. The boundaries of designated rivers are typically within one-quarter mile from the high water mark on each side. Federal agencies manage these rivers and are required to establish detailed boundaries and prepare management plans for each segment to protect river values and address resource protection issues. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act aims to protect river values, preserve rivers in a free-flowing condition, and ensure water quality. It allows for the assumption or creation of federal water rights to achieve its goals, even though Congress usually defers to state law on water regulation. The Act is based on the Winters doctrine, which grants Congress the authority to reserve federal water rights when necessary. The Winters doctrine states that when Congress reserves property for a federal purpose, it also reserves enough water to fulfill that purpose. Courts may find a federal water right if Congress intended it, indicated by express language or implication from a congressional purpose. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act implies a reserved right under a provision that limits reservations to the amount necessary to achieve the act's goals. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act allows for the reservation of a federal water right for specified purposes, up to the quantity necessary to achieve those purposes. The quantity of the federal right is often controversial, as it is not always clear what amount is sufficient. The act aims to protect rivers in their free-flowing condition, but the protected amount may not be the full flow of the river. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act aims to protect rivers in their free-flowing condition, but the federal water right reserved may be less than the full flow of the river. Questions arise regarding the effect of designations and federal reservations on state laws. The act preserves state law and jurisdiction over unappropriated waters. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act preserves state law and jurisdiction over unappropriated waters, allowing states to exercise their jurisdiction as long as it does not impair the act's purposes. Federal water rights reserved under the act have a priority date from the reservation, being junior to existing rights but senior to rights established afterward. Federal reserved water rights under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act have a priority date from the reservation, which can vary based on legislation. These rights may not always be claimed if other federal rights or state laws can provide sufficient water. Adequate flows can also be obtained through state statutes, cooperative agreements, or defensive protests against harmful water right applications. Since the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was enacted in 1968, numerous rivers have been designated as protected waterways. Designating a river under the act aims to preserve the river from future changes without altering its flow. While the Act does not specifically protect water rights, some subsequent legislation for specific rivers in the arid West includes water rights protections. The majority of wild and scenic river legislation does not address water rights, but some designations do reference them. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, enacted in 1968, aims to preserve rivers without altering their flow. While the Act does not specifically protect water rights, some subsequent legislation for specific rivers includes water rights protections. Concerns have been raised about the nature of water rights under WSRA designations, with upstream and downstream landowners having different concerns about potential limitations on water use and development options. Factors such as the type of river designation (wild, scenic, or recreational) and the amount of water needed to protect each section's values vary depending on placement in the watershed. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, enacted in 1968, aims to preserve rivers without altering their flow. Concerns have been raised about water rights under WSRA designations, with different restrictions based on the type of river designation (wild, scenic, or recreational) and the type of land the river flows through. National parks, national forests, and wilderness areas have established water rights to protect their resources. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act confers implied water rights for designated rivers within protected land areas, potentially creating conflicts with existing water rights. The priority date of the federal land designation could supersede the original priority date of the river, impacting senior water rights. This issue has not been tested in court, and water rights provisions may aim to quantify new water rights under state law. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act may create conflicts with existing water rights by conferring implied water rights for designated rivers within protected land areas. The priority date of the federal land designation could supersede the original priority date of the river, impacting senior water rights. Legislation for specific rivers, like the Clarks Fork Wild and Scenic River in Wyoming, aims to quantify new water rights under state law and establish a priority date for such rights. The Clarks Fork River in a national forest has a designated water right with a priority date of November 28, 1990. It is unclear if this designation creates a secondary water right or impacts existing water rights. Similar language protecting the Cache la Poudre River in Colorado ensures that the designation does not interfere with established water rights. The water rights language for the Cache la Poudre River includes provisions to protect existing decreed water rights for stored or diverted water, establishes a priority date for the designated river segments, and sets jurisdiction for water disputes. The water rights language for the Cache la Poudre River includes provisions to protect existing decreed water rights for stored or diverted water. It could be argued that this provision undercuts the existing priority of water rights created by designation of the river segments in Rocky Mountain National Park and Roosevelt National Forest. The legislative history suggests a priority right was provided for the river for the first time. When a priority is specifically created within a designation, existing priorities should also be addressed to avoid ambiguity. Only one example was found where existing priority rights of the designated water body were acknowledged. The legislation aims to change Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument into a national park and designate the Gunnison River as a wild and scenic river. It includes provisions to protect existing water rights and states that no new water rights will be created by the designation. This language is seen as addressing concerns about potential changes to water usage for upstream and downstream owners. The focus is on protecting existing water rights rather than establishing new priority dates. The language in the current chunk aims to protect existing water rights in designated rivers in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, or Washington. It clarifies that the designation as recreational will not interfere with adjacent landowners' water supply. The Missouri River segments under the act also have provisions to ensure access to water for landowners and wildlife. The WSRA protects existing water rights in designated rivers and limits the licensing of water projects that could affect protected segments. It prohibits FERC from licensing projects on designated rivers and restricts federal agencies from assisting in the construction of water resources projects. The WSRA prohibits federal agencies from assisting in the construction of water resources projects that would adversely affect designated rivers. This includes restrictions on recommending authorization or appropriations for such projects. The prohibition also extends to potential additions to the wild and scenic rivers system for a period of three fiscal years after designation. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act prohibits federal agencies from assisting in projects that would harm designated rivers. If a river is not included in the system within three years, project plans can proceed. The act allows for developments near designated rivers as long as they do not impact the area's values."
