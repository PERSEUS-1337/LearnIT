    "content": "The United States and the Republic of the Philippines have a strong relationship dating back to the U.S. colonial period, with ties in military cooperation, a security alliance, and shared strategic and economic interests. Filipino Americans are the second-largest Asian American group in the U.S., and there are 350,000 Americans living in the Philippines. Despite overall agreement on the importance of the relationship, there can be friction over issues like U.S. obligations, Philippine sovereignty, human rights, and trade. The United States and the Philippines have a strong relationship with ties in military cooperation and shared strategic interests. Despite friction over issues like sovereignty and human rights, joint counterterrorism efforts have helped reduce threats in the southern Philippines. The Philippines has played a key role in the U.S. \"rebalance\" towards Asia, especially in addressing maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In April 2014, during President Obama's visit to the Philippines, an accord was announced for increased U.S. military presence through the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). This agreement followed discussions on Typhoon Haiyan recovery efforts, defense cooperation, economic ties, and U.S. foreign aid programs. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was announced during President Obama's visit to the Philippines in April 2014. It represents a milestone in U.S. military engagement in the country and is part of the Administration's rebalance policy in Asia. Despite challenges such as corruption and armed groups, the Philippines has made progress under President Benigno Aquino III. The Philippines has reached a settlement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and experienced solid economic growth. However, challenges like corruption, poverty, political violence, and extremism persist. U.S. support following Typhoon Yolanda included $87 million in disaster aid and $59 million in private sector contributions. President Obama expressed sympathy and support to the Philippines, strengthening bilateral relations. The U.S. provided humanitarian assistance to the Philippines after Typhoon Yolanda, with U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg coordinating efforts. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Tacloban and met with President Aquino. The U.S. response boosted its soft power in the region compared to China's limited aid. The military and humanitarian engagement showcased the U.S.'s capabilities for future contingencies. The U.S. military response to the disaster in the Philippines strengthens the case for an enhanced U.S. military presence in the country. Key U.S. policy objectives include maintaining the U.S.-Philippines alliance, assisting the Armed Forces of the Philippines, supporting peace and stability in conflict-affected areas, and promoting good governance and economic growth. Key concerns involve territorial disputes with China, particularly in Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals. China's increasing control over these reefs could lead to potential conflicts, forcing the United States to make decisions. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) allows for increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines on a nonpermanent basis. The Philippine government and the MILF finalized an accord for political autonomy in Muslim areas, but the region remains economically poor and politically unstable. The Philippines remains economically poor, politically unstable, and armed, with ongoing resistance to settlement efforts and sporadic armed attacks. U.S. assistance programs aim to combat corruption and improve governance, while the Partnership for Growth initiative focuses on economic development. President Aquino's term expires in 2016, raising uncertainty about the continuation of his clean government style. The U.S. Congress has imposed restrictions on military assistance in the Philippines to prevent extra-judicial killings. Despite practicing institutional democracy, the country struggles with corruption, patronage, weak judicial system, and human rights abuses. The Philippines ranks 69th out of 167 in the Economist Intelligence Unit's assessment. In 2013, the Philippines was ranked 69th out of 167 countries by the Economist Intelligence Unit in terms of democracy, categorized as a \"flawed democracy.\" The country scored high on electoral process and civil liberties but low on political culture. The fragmented nature of politics hinders effective policy implementation, with political parties driven more by individual interests than unified goals. President Benigno Aquino III maintains high public support. President Benigno Aquino III, son of former leaders, was elected in 2010 with high public approval for his anti-corruption stance. His presidency marked a shift towards cleaner governance and less focus on military solutions for insurgencies. In 2013, his Liberal Party gained strength in elections, giving him a stronger mandate. Aquino cannot seek re-election due to term limits. Analysts believe that as President Aquino nears the end of his term, it may become challenging for him to push for new legislative initiatives or stronger anti-corruption measures. His image has been tarnished by corruption allegations against legislators, including some of his allies. Despite the generally upheld freedoms in the Philippines, the government often struggles to protect them. The Philippine government faces challenges in protecting the rights of its citizens, especially at the local level, due to a weak judicial system and lack of security. Human rights abuses by the military, private militias, and political families are prevalent, with extrajudicial killings and violence against journalists being serious issues. The country is considered one of the most dangerous places for journalists, with low conviction rates for crimes against them. The Philippines faces challenges in protecting citizens' rights due to a weak judicial system and lack of security. Violence against journalists is a serious issue, with between 8 and 14 journalists killed in 2013. The State Department criticizes the dysfunctional criminal justice system for poor cooperation between police and investigators, few prosecutions, and lengthy delays. The justice system is underfunded, understaffed, and backlogged, leading to failures in proper investigations and prosecutions for violence against journalists. The Philippines has faced challenges in protecting citizens' rights due to a weak judicial system and lack of security. Violence against journalists is a serious issue, with between 8 and 14 journalists killed in 2013. The State Department criticizes the dysfunctional criminal justice system for poor cooperation between police and investigators, few prosecutions, and lengthy delays. President Aquino has pressured the Department of Justice to convict those responsible for the Maguindanao Massacre by the end of his term in 2016. The Philippines has experienced steady economic growth, with forecasts predicting a 6.7% expansion in 2014. The Philippines is expected to see a 6.7% GDP growth in 2014, slightly lower than 2013. Foreign direct investment has improved, with Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgrading the country's credit rating. The World Bank ranked the Philippines 108th for ease of doing business. Challenges to economic growth include poor revenue collection, inadequate spending on social services and infrastructure, and government corruption. The Aquino government has made efforts to address infrastructure, government corruption, and instability in the Philippines. Despite economic growth, Filipino workers still seek jobs overseas, making the country the fourth-largest recipient of remittances globally. Remittances from Overseas Filipino Workers totaled $26 billion in 2013, contributing significantly to the economy. While the Philippines benefits from trade relationships with China, Japan, and the United States, some concerns arise regarding the promotion of consumption over long-term investment. The country also faces challenges such as brain drain and the depletion of the middle class, impacting its democracy. In 2013, two-way goods trade between the United States and the Philippines reached $14.5 billion, with the Philippines enjoying surpluses with its major trading partners. The United States remains the largest source of foreign investment in the country. The Philippines is a major destination for foreign investment, with the United States being the largest investor. Other significant investors include Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Taiwan. The country is a key player in business process outsourcing, employing around 800,000 workers in the industry. The United States and the Philippines engage in regular economic talks under a Trade and Investment Framework agreement. The Philippines is a key player in foreign investment, with the United States as the largest investor. It participates in programs like the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences and the Partnership for Growth to promote economic growth and investment. The country also engages in regular economic talks with the United States under a Trade and Investment Framework agreement. The Philippines and the United States have a strong economic relationship, with the US being the largest investor in the country. They participate in programs like the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences and the Partnership for Growth to promote economic growth. The two countries have a five-year Joint Country Action Plan focusing on legal and regulatory reforms, business environment improvement, rule of law strengthening, and fiscal stability support. U.S. assistance to the Philippines includes development programs in Muslim areas to address radical ideologies. Major U.S. assistance programs in the Philippines aim to address economic, legal, and political conditions that attract radical ideologies. This includes strengthening the rule of law, improving government services in Mindanao, and bolstering the military's capacity to patrol the maritime domain. U.S. military assistance focuses on helping the Philippines transition to a more outward-focused military and establish a credible security presence in the region. The Obama Administration requested a large increase in Foreign Military Financing for the Philippines in FY2014, with additional maritime security assistance promised by Secretary of State John Kerry. The United States provided a total of $312 million in military assistance to the Philippines between 2002 and 2013, with some funding withheld by Congress to encourage human rights improvements. The Philippines plans to spend over $1.7 billion from 2013-2017 to enhance defense capabilities, with assistance from the United States in acquiring modern equipment. The Aquino Administration has purchased decommissioned U.S. Coast Guard cutters to strengthen the navy, with plans for more frigates and negotiations for surplus F-16 fighter jets. Defense ties with other Asian countries are also being strengthened. The Philippines is strengthening defense ties with other Asian countries like Vietnam and Japan, who also have maritime disputes with China. Agreements have been made for cooperation in maritime security, navy contacts, and information sharing. Japan, France, and South Korea are providing patrol boats and fighter jets to the Philippines. The Millennium Challenge Account has approved a $434 million compact with the Philippine government in 2010. In 2010, the MCC approved a $434 million compact with the Philippine government to modernize the Bureau of Internal Revenue, reduce poverty through infrastructure projects, and promote economic growth. Key projects include Revenue Administration Reform ($54.4 million), Kalahi-CIDSS ($120 million), and Secondary National Roads Development ($214 million). The Philippines is a treaty ally of the United States under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. The Philippines is a treaty ally of the United States and heavily relies on the US for its external security. Both nations conduct joint military activities to enhance the AFP's capabilities. The US designated the Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2003 due to its support for the US-led invasion of Iraq. The security relationship has gained importance with the US's policy of rebalancing towards Asia. The Philippines has had ambivalent attitudes towards U.S. military influence, with the closure of Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base in 1991. Despite protests, joint military activities resumed in response to China's actions in the South China Sea. A Visiting Forces Agreement allowing joint military operations was signed in 1998 and ratified in 1999. The VFA, despite opposition from various groups, requires U.S. military forces to have a non-combat role in the Philippines. The country became a key base for the U.S. War on Terror in Southeast Asia, with joint exercises targeting terrorist groups in Mindanao and Sulu. Military cooperation later shifted towards addressing security threats in the South China Sea. The U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty does not explicitly obligate the United States to defend disputed maritime areas in the South China Sea. Some officials believe the Treaty requires U.S. defense of the Philippines against China. The U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty may not explicitly cover defending disputed maritime areas in the South China Sea. Some argue that the Treaty obligates the U.S. to defend the Philippines against China, but there is uncertainty about the specifics of assistance and the need for congressional approval. President Obama affirmed the commitment to defend the Philippines but did not confirm if the Treaty applies to Philippine-claimed islets in the South China Sea. Balikatan, a joint military exercise between the U.S. and the Philippines, aims to enhance Philippine combat readiness and U.S.-AFP interoperability. The exercises focus on building the Philippines' defense capacity in territorial disputes and include humanitarian projects. The 30th Balikatan event in May 2014 involved 3,000 AFP soldiers and 2,500 U.S. troops, emphasizing maritime security and humanitarian assistance through joint naval, air, and land maneuvers. The 2013 Balikatan programs involved various military activities, including maritime surveillance, live-fire drills, bomb handling training, and mass casualty response exercises. Australia sent 65 military personnel to participate in drills and humanitarian activities. Concerns over Al Qaeda's links worldwide, including ties to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), prompted the deployment of U.S. military personnel to assist the Philippine armed forces against ASG and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). The Joint Special Operations Task Force\u2013Philippines (JSOTF-P) was established to support the Armed Forces of the Philippines in their fight against terrorism. The Task Force includes rotating units of U.S. Special Forces, Navy SEALS, and Psychological Operations. U.S. troops operate under special rules of engagement, playing a subordinate role and taking direction from AFP commanders. Since operations began, 17 U.S. troops have died in various incidents. The JSOTF-P was established to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in counterterrorism efforts. U.S. troops operate under special rules of engagement and have been involved in various incidents, resulting in 17 deaths. The Task Force has been reducing in size due to improved capabilities of Philippine armed forces and greater use of civilian police for security. JSOTF-P advises and assists Philippine Regional Combatant Commands with counterinsurgency and counterterrorism objectives. The JSOTF-P personnel have supported relief efforts in Leyte province after Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. Joint counterterrorism efforts have significantly reduced the Abu Sayyaf Group to a few hundred members, with key leaders killed or captured. The group's focus has shifted to criminal activities, resulting in sporadic kidnappings and bombings. Non-military aid, such as medical care and infrastructure development, has improved the AFP's legitimacy and created positive views of U.S. troops. The Philippine government lacks capacity to sustain U.S.-backed projects. ASG no longer a key terrorist threat but complicates security in Mindanao. Clashes between AFP and Abu Sayyaf in 2014 resulted in casualties. Joint exercises like CARAT and PHIBLEX are conducted annually. U.S. and AFP engaged in joint exercises near Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals in 2013. In 2013, joint exercises near Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals involved U.S. and Philippine marines, with discussions on increasing U.S. military presence in the Philippines in response to China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. The U.S. and Philippines are increasing joint military activities, with plans to redevelop the former U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay and shift naval and air assets there. Palawan may also become a center of joint military activity, with plans to build a port at Ulugan Bay military base. The United States and the Philippines finalized the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in April 2014, allowing for increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines on a rotational basis. The agreement grants U.S. forces access to Philippine bases and facilities rent-free, supporting bilateral training and modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) allows for increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines on a rotational basis, supporting bilateral training and modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The number of U.S. troops, costs, and location of military facilities for joint use are yet to be determined, amid long-standing maritime territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. The South China Sea, also known as the West Philippine Sea, is surrounded by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Various countries claim ownership of islands and features in the area, with disputes over maritime boundaries and resources. China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia all have military presence on different islands and features in the region. Bilateral tensions between the Philippines and China have escalated due to disputes over natural gas reserves and marine resources in the South China Sea. Tensions peaked in 2011 with clashes over Scarborough Shoal, leading to a standoff between Philippine and Chinese ships despite negotiations to de-escalate the situation. Since 2013, China has been sending naval vessels to Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands to isolate the Philippines presence there. In 2014, Chinese coastguard ships blocked Philippine supply ships from reaching the BRP Sierra Madre, leading to continued maritime tensions between the two countries. The Philippine government argues for special rights over natural resources in its EEZ under UNCLOS. In 2012, Manila proposed international arbitration with China over disputes, but Beijing refused. In 2013, the Philippines requested an Arbitral Tribunal under UNCLOS to rule on China's claims. Beijing argues against the Tribunal's legal standing and asserts historic rights to disputed territories. China offers joint economic activities but resists multilateral negotiations and vows no compromises. The Philippine government filed a complaint against China regarding its territorial claims in the South China Sea, specifically questioning the validity of the \"nine-dash line\" and Chinese maritime authority over certain areas. Despite Beijing's objections, a Law of the Sea tribunal accepted the case. The U.S. government supports a peaceful resolution based on international law and multilateral processes. In March 2014, the US and the Philippines expressed concern over developments in the South China Sea, supporting arbitration and emphasizing maritime claims based on UNCLOS. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel criticized China's 'nine-dash line' claim, calling for alignment with international law. Secretary of State John Kerry advocated for legal principles and a regional code of conduct to prevent conflict in the region during his Asia trip in February 2014. The U.S. Senate supported a peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains, condemning coercion and urging self-restraint. They also expressed objections to China's unilateral announcement of an Air Defense Identification Zone and supported a South China Sea code of conduct. The U.S. Senate supports peaceful resolution of territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, condemns coercion, and urges self-restraint. Senator Robert Menendez introduced a resolution reaffirming U.S. support for freedom of navigation and international law in the region, particularly in the South China Sea. Analysts are concerned about China's potential response to international arbitration in the Philippines' dispute. The Philippines' court filing strengthens the use of UNCLOS and international law for resolving maritime disputes. The United States supports the Philippines' right to use international arbitration mechanisms. Counterterrorism efforts have weakened Islamist groups in the Philippines, and there is potential for a political settlement with Muslim separatists. The political settlement between Manila and the Muslim separatist movement in the south brings hope for reduced violence. However, historical, political, and economic grievances fuel separatist and communist insurgencies. Islamist and Communist groups still carry out armed attacks and bombings, with the Abu Sayyaf Group being a significant terrorist threat in the past. The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) has established ties with various terrorist organizations and carried out deadly bombings in the Philippines. Joint counterterrorism efforts with the US have weakened ASG and other groups. The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) aim to establish an independent Islamic state for Muslim ethnic groups in the region. The Moro people in the southern Philippines have a history of conflict with the central government, accusing it of neglecting their region economically and supporting Christian settlers. The Moro Rebellion of 1903-1913 resulted in a 10-year war against the U.S. military. The MNLF and MILF seek to establish an independent Islamic state for Muslim ethnic groups in the region. Over 120,000 people have been killed in fighting related to Muslim secessionist insurgencies since the late 1960s. The MNLF and MILF have been involved in conflicts with the central government since the late 1960s. The MNLF signed a peace treaty in 1996, creating the ARMM. The MILF, established in 1980, has engaged in peace negotiations with the government. Some units of the MILF have cooperated with ASG and Jemaah Islamiyah. Manila and the MILF have been in negotiations for substantial autonomy in Mindanao. In 2012, a Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was agreed upon. The MILF agreed to a Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2013, leading to the Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro in 2014. Despite hopes for peace, some groups like the MNLF and BFF continue to oppose the settlement. In August 2013, MNLF founder Nur Misuari threatened to declare independence for regions in western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, feeling sidelined by the Framework Agreement. Insurgents clashed with government troops in Zamboanga city, taking nearly 300 people hostage. The BIFF carried out attacks on civilian and military targets, with government troops responding with force. The Communist Party of the Philippines also played a role in the conflict. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has waged an insurgency since the late 1960s, with over 40,000 deaths related to the conflict. The CPP's military arm, the New People's Army (NPA), has around 4,000-5,000 fighters and remains active in the central Philippines. The U.S. government designated the CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations in 2002, but does not directly support the Philippines military in its fight against the NPA. Peace negotiations between the government and the CPP have taken place under President Aquino. Under President Aquino, peace negotiations between the government and the CPP began in 2011 but stalled. The Aquino Administration remains open to a political settlement while the AFP continues to weaken the NPA militarily. The NPA carries out small-scale attacks on police, army units, and economic targets. Filipino soldiers and guerrilla fighters served under the US Armed Forces in WWII, promised citizenship and benefits by the Roosevelt Administration. Congress has provided benefits to Filipino WWII veterans but denied many \"active military\" status for full benefits. Citizenship granted to Filipino soldiers was not extended to their families. In 2009, the Obama Administration established a $198 million Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation (FVEC) fund, providing one-time payments to eligible Filipino veterans. Many veterans have complained about inadequate coverage and denied claims for benefits. Members of the 113th Congress have proposed bills to support Filipino veterans, aiming to facilitate eligibility determination and acknowledge their service for full veterans' benefits. The 113th Congress proposed bills to support Filipino veterans by facilitating eligibility for full veterans' benefits, allowing benefits for lawful U.S. resident veterans in the Philippines, and exempting children of naturalized Filipino World War II veterans from immigrant limitations."
