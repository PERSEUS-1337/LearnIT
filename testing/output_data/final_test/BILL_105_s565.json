Definitions for terms related to liability of business entities providing use of a motor vehicle or aircraft are provided, including definitions for \"aircraft,\" \"business entity,\" \"gross negligence,\" \"intentional misconduct,\" and \"motor vehicle.\" The term \"motor vehicle\" is defined as provided in section 30102(6) of title 49, United States Code. The term \"nonprofit organization\" includes organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or not-for-profit organizations operated for public benefit. The term \"State\" refers to various states and territories. A business entity is not liable for injuries or deaths resulting from the use of its motor vehicle or aircraft by a nonprofit organization outside of the business scope, as long as the entity authorized the use. Subsection (b) does not apply to injuries or deaths resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct by a business entity, including crimes of violence or acts of international terrorism. The Act preempts state laws inconsistent with it, except for those providing additional protection for business entities in cases involving hate crimes, sexual offenses, or civil rights violations. The Act does not supersede any Federal or State health or safety law. States can elect to not apply the Act to civil actions in State courts involving volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or governmental entities if certain conditions are met."
