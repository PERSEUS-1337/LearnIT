    "content": "The Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused extensive damage to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, releasing radioactive materials. Public concerns about health effects and radiation have attracted global attention. The EPA operates RadNet, a network of monitoring stations in the United States to track environmental releases of radioactivity. The EPA operates RadNet, a network of monitoring stations in the United States to track environmental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons tests and accidents. The EPA provides updates on air monitoring related to the Japanese nuclear incident. Factors affecting the spread of radioactive material include particle size, wind patterns, amount of material released, and the melting or burning of nuclear fuel rods. The EPA operates RadNet, a network of monitoring stations in the United States to track environmental releases of radioactivity. Factors affecting the spread of radioactive material include particle size, wind patterns, amount of material released, and the melting or burning of nuclear fuel rods. The larger and hotter the fire, the more material is injected into the air. Travel time and distance affect the decay and dispersal of radioactive material. Rain and snow can wash particles out of the air. U.S. nuclear authorities state that the reactor incident in Japan does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. The EPA and Department of Energy reported minuscule levels of iodine isotopes and Xenon-133 in Sacramento and Washington State, respectively, with no health concerns. NRC assured that natural background radiation is much higher than detected levels, and there is no reason for concern in the US. Radiation was also detected in Charlottesville, VA. A press report on March 22 mentioned radiation detected in Charlottesville, VA, from the reactor incident in Japan. Health experts stated that the radiation had been greatly diluted over thousands of miles and poses no health risk in the United States. Comparing the dose to natural sources, it is estimated that the average American receives 310 millirem per year. The NRC limits public radiation exposure to 100 mrem per year. At a rate of 0.00310 mrem per year, it would take 32,258 years to reach 100 mrem. Some atoms decay into more stable forms through radiation emission. Alpha particles are charged and slow-moving, losing energy quickly in matter. Alpha particles are charged and slow-moving, losing energy quickly in matter. Beta particles are electrically charged and less massive than alpha particles, easily absorbed by matter. Neutrons emitted by heavy atoms like uranium and plutonium have no electrical charge and can travel tens of meters in air. Gamma rays are photons released during radioactive decay, less-energetic than x-rays. Gamma rays are highly penetrating and require thick lead to stop them. Radioactivity is measured in curies or becquerels, with specific activity measuring how radioactive a material is. Half-life is the time for half of the atoms in a radioactive material to decay. The specific activity of iodine-131 is 124,000 curies per gram with a half-life of 8 days, while uranium-235 has a specific activity of 0.000002 curies per gram and a half-life of 700 million years. Uranium-235 emits minimal radiation, and gamma rays' threat to human health increases with energy. Each radionuclide decays in a specific way, with uranium-235 emitting gamma rays when it decays. When uranium-235 decays, it emits gamma rays of 186 keV or less and alpha particles. Cesium-137 emits gamma rays of 662 keV and beta particles. Fission of heavy atoms like uranium-235 and plutonium-239 releases radiation and fission products like cesium-137, iodine-131, and strontium-90. Uranium-235 and plutonium-239 can support a nuclear chain reaction. In nuclear reactions, a supercritical mass of uranium or plutonium supports a chain reaction that releases vast energy in atomic bombs. Control rods containing boron or cadmium are used in nuclear reactors to absorb neutrons and prevent overheating. Nuclear reactors use control rods containing boron or cadmium to absorb neutrons and regulate the fission process. Uranium-235 is the fissile isotope used in reactors, requiring enrichment to increase its concentration for fuel production. Unlike atomic bombs, reactors cannot explode due to different fuel compositions. Nuclear reactors use low enriched uranium (LEU) as fuel, which does not have enough uranium-235 for a chain reaction like in an atomic bomb. Reactors are configured differently from bombs to prevent explosions. Fuel rods hold pellets of LEU or mixed oxides (MOX) for fuel, with zirconium being the metal of choice due to its low neutron absorption and resistance to heat and corrosion. The nuclear reactor's core sustains a chain reaction with fuel rods, even when control rods are inserted. Heat generated from radioactive decay must be dissipated to prevent rods from melting or burning. Cooling at Fukushima Daiichi NPP was done by pumping cool water into the reactor. If not dissipated, heat can cause zirconium cladding to react with water, producing hydrogen. Venting to relieve pressure introduced hydrogen into the secondary containment, potentially causing issues. The explosions at reactor units 1-3 at Fukushima Daiichi NPP were caused by introducing hydrogen into the secondary containment due to pressure. Efforts to cool the fuel rods with seawater have led to the formation of salt crusts on the uranium fuel rods, which can block water circulation and potentially cause the rods to overheat and melt. When fuel rods heat up, their zirconium cladding can ignite, causing uranium to melt and release radioactive material. Workers are now using fresh water instead of seawater to address this issue. As fuel fissions in a reactor, the ratio of fission products to fissile material in fuel rods increases, leading to the creation of spent fuel. Spent fuel rods are highly radioactive initially, generating intense heat and requiring cooling in water pools for several years until short-lived radionuclides decay. The spent fuel pools at nuclear power plants are used to cool fuel rods for several years until radionuclides decay. If a pool is drained, the fuel rods could heat up, melt, and release radioactive material. The pools do not have a containment structure, making them more dangerous than active fuel rods. The zirconium cladding on the rods can catch fire when exposed to air, releasing a deadly mix of radioactive elements into the atmosphere. The spent fuel pool at the No. 4 reactor at Fukushima Daiichi NPP contains 548 fuel assemblies. The fuel rods at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP were recently moved from the reactor to the storage pool, increasing the risk of burning and releasing radioactivity. There is concern about reactor 3 using MOX fuel, which contains plutonium that can cause lung cancer if inhaled. Water is being pumped into the spent fuel pools to cool the rods and prevent radiation release. Humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from various sources. Ionizing radiation, with its high energy level, causes ionization in atoms within cells and tissues, leading to molecular damage and disruptions in cell division. This can result in permanent damage to sensitive tissues like skin, hair, bone marrow, and the cells lining the stomach and intestine. Ionizing radiation can also damage DNA, leading to mutations and potentially causing cancer. Humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from natural sources like cosmic radiation. Humans are exposed to ionizing radiation from natural sources like cosmic radiation and terrestrial radiation from radioactive materials. Terrestrial exposure is mainly from inhaling radon, produced by the decay of uranium. Medical practices like CT scans and nuclear medicine procedures have significantly increased radiation exposure in the US. Other manmade sources include consumer products, industrial activities, and nuclear power generation. Ionizing radiation exposure is measured in absorbed dose, with the international unit being the gray (Gy). The biological impact depends on the type of radiation, with alpha particles being more damaging due to their mass, charge, and energy deposition in tissues. Equivalent dose is a quantity used by radiation scientists to measure all types of exposure on an equal basis. It is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by a factor that reflects the relative effectiveness of each type of radiation to cause harm. For alpha particles, the factor is set at 20, making alpha radiation more harmful than beta or gamma radiation. The unit for equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv), with the more common unit being the millisievert (mSv). The sievert (Sv) is the unit for equivalent dose in radiation exposure, with the more common unit being the millisievert (mSv). The average annual equivalent dose to an individual in the United States is 6.2 mSv (620 mrem), with natural background sources accounting for 3.1 mSv (310 mrem) and medical procedures for 3.0 mSv (300 mrem). Other sources contribute 0.1 mSv (10 mrem) to the total exposure. Comparatively, a jet airplane flight exposes individuals to 0.5 mrem per hour, a chest x-ray to 6 mrem, and living at an altitude of one mile to additional radiation. The health risks of ionizing radiation can occur from external and internal exposure. External exposure is mainly from radioactive material emitting gamma radiation, which can be stopped by lead or concrete. Cesium-137 is a common source of gamma radiation. Alpha and beta particles are not significant sources of external exposure. Alpha particles travel only a short distance through the air. Internal radiation exposure can occur through inhalation or ingestion of radioactive material. The potential harm depends on the type and quantity of material taken in and how long it remains in the body. Isotopes emitting alpha particles pose a greater hazard than those emitting beta particles and gamma radiation. The fate of the material also depends on its chemical identity, such as Strontium-90 accumulating in bones. Iodine-131 (131I), a beta emitter, accumulates in the thyroid gland, damaging surrounding cells and increasing the risk of thyroid diseases and cancer. It can be found in grass, leafy crops, and milk of contaminated animals. Children are at higher risk due to their active thyroid glands. Despite its short half-life of 8 days, iodine-131 posed a significant health risk after the Chernobyl incident in 1986. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 led to a health risk, particularly thyroid cancer in children due to exposure to radioactive iodine. Children in southern Belarus and northern Ukraine were exposed to radiation through contaminated milk and vegetables. Radiation scientists can calculate the effective dose for partial-body exposures. The health effects of ionizing radiation exposure depend on the total dose and dose rate. Acute effects like radiation sickness are associated with high doses over a short period, while long-term effects such as increased cancer risk result from chronic exposure to low levels of radiation. Cancer risk from radiation exposure is calculated using data from studies like those on the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) states that chronic exposure to low-level radiation increases the risk of fatal cancer. They recommend an annual exposure limit of 1 mSv for the general population. Exposure to 70 mSv over a lifetime results in a 1 in 300 increased risk of cancer death. Potassium iodide tablets are of interest for thyroid cancer protection. Potassium iodide tablets, also known as KI, protect against thyroid cancer by saturating the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine-127. This prevents the absorption of radioactive iodine-131, offering limited protection. However, it does not protect against other radioactive materials or radiation in general. Taking potassium iodide as a precaution is only necessary if iodine-131 exposure is expected. The amount of radioactive material from the Japanese nuclear reactor incident reaching the US is minimal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend taking potassium iodide supplements in response to the Japanese nuclear reactor incident due to health risks associated with it. The U.S. Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation reported on the health risks from radiation exposure. The U.S. Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation found it challenging to characterize the effects of radiation at low levels. They developed a lifetime risk model predicting 1 in 100 people would develop cancer from a dose of 0.1 Sv above background. At Fukushima Daiichi NPP, workers are making sacrifices with the legal limit on radiation exposure being raised. Japan's Health Ministry raised the legal limit on radiation exposure for workers to 250 millisieverts from 100 millisieverts, allowing them to stay on site longer. Health Minister Yoko Komiyama stated that further increases would be detrimental to worker health. An acute dose of 250 mSv increases cancer risk, with 25 out of 1,000 people expected to develop solid cancers or leukemia. Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP may be exposed to additional radiation for at least a year to allow their bodies to repair cell damage. Japan's Ministry of Education reported low external doses from monitoring stations near the NPP, with most readings below 15 microsieverts per hour. Staying indoors can reduce exposure, and short-lived radionuclides like iodine-131 decay significantly over time. The release of radionuclides like iodine-131 and cesium-137 from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP poses a risk of thyroid cancer, especially for children. Japanese authorities have found elevated levels of iodine-131 in spinach, vegetables, and milk, leading to restrictions on their distribution and consumption by Prime Minister Naoto Kan on March 23. Authorities in Japan have restricted the distribution of spinach, cabbage, broccoli, and other vegetables in Fukushima Prefecture due to radioactive contamination. Additionally, traces of radioactive iodine were found in drinking water in Tokyo, prompting a warning for infants to avoid tap water. Despite the detection of iodine-131 at levels exceeding recommended limits, the Health Ministry stated that negative consequences were unlikely for infants who consumed the water. The radiation levels in infant formula in Japan decreased from 79 becquerels per liter on March 24 to no radiation detected on March 27.
