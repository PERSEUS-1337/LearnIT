    "content": "The U.S. specialty crop sector is governed by various laws, including the farm bill, which guides USDA programs and funding for agricultural trade, conservation, and food assistance. Congress can make changes to these laws through the farm bill, annual appropriations bills, or separate legislation. These programs include crop insurance, disaster assistance, and crop protection. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 aims to address challenges in the specialty crop sector such as pests, diseases, trade restrictions, and competition from imports. It authorizes funds for pest and disease response, streamlining export permits, enhancing scientific standards, and providing additional program funds. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorizes funds for various programs to support the specialty crop industry, including pest and disease response, streamlining export permits, and providing additional program funds. The law allocates funds for block grants to states to increase competitiveness in specialty crops and prioritize specialty crop research. The funding for these programs comes from discretionary funds, with the majority going towards state block grants. The United Fresh Produce Association called for full funding of the block grant program and technical assistance program for exports, as well as maintenance of the Agricultural Marketing Service Training and Development Center. They also requested additional funding to expand the Fruit and Vegetable program. The final appropriations act for USDA in FY2006 included $7 million for the specialty crop block grant program and no additional funds for the Fruit and Vegetable program. The Fruit and Vegetable program received additional funding beyond the $9 million authorized in a 2004 law. Legislation in the 109th Congress proposed $20 million annually for FY2006 and FY2007, but was not passed. The House-passed USDA appropriations bill included $15.6 million for specialty crop block grants in FY2007. The Senate-reported bill included a provision for $10 million for the program in FY2007. Congress is expected to complete action on agriculture appropriations after the November 2006 elections. In anticipation of possible consideration of specialty crop policies in the 2007 farm bill, Congresswoman Darlene Hooley and Senator Ron Wyden introduced measures to amend the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. The bills propose expanding block grant programs and creating new grants to help producers develop business plans and marketing opportunities for value-added products. Legislation introduced in February 2005 would have authorized $50 million annually through FY2007 in mandatory Commodity Credit. In 2005, Congress proposed H.R. 710, the Farmers' Markets Infrastructure Assistance Act, to allocate $50 million annually for farmers' markets. Despite the authorization of a Farmers' Market Promotion program in 2002, no funds have been allocated. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service has provided support to farmers' markets through tailored research and technical assistance. H.R. 710 aims to provide targeted support for the establishment of farmers' markets, but as of the report date, no action had been taken by the 109th Congress. Under \u00a7304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, every imported item must be marked in English to show its country of origin to the \"ultimate purchaser.\" The U.S. Customs Service defines the \"ultimate purchaser\" as the last U.S. person who will receive the item as imported. Certain products like vegetables and fruits in their natural state are exempt from country of origin labeling requirements. Section 10816 of the 2002 farm act amended the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to require retail-level COOL on \"perishable agricultural commodities,\" as defined by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA). It mandates PACA-regulated retailers to inform consumers of the origin of these products through labeling by means of a label, stamp, mark, placard, or other visible sign at the final point of sale. The labeling was required to be implemented by September 30, 2004. The USDA appropriations act delayed the mandatory labeling date for fruits and vegetables until September 30, 2008. The United Fresh Produce Association opposes mandatory COOL and advocates for a voluntary program covering all food items and distribution channels. Concerns include retailers shifting labeling burdens to producers. The industry has voluntarily labeled U.S.-grown produce and tree nuts for years, with a trend towards increased COOL in supermarkets. Proponents of mandatory COOL argue for consumer choice based on food source knowledge, especially with increasing imports posing health risks. Illness outbreaks can occur from both imported and U.S.-grown produce. In 2006, an outbreak of illness from E. coli O157:H7 contamination of fresh spinach from California occurred. Regulations require imported produce to meet the same standards as U.S. produce. Congress passed a planting flexibility provision in the 1996 farm act, allowing producers to receive subsidy payments for a specific base crop but grow a different crop on the same acreage. Specialty crops were restricted on base acres, except for cases with a history of planting such crops. In the 2002 farm act, Congress renewed the restriction on growing specialty crops on program acres, except for soybeans which became eligible as a \"base\" crop. This caused issues for farmers in the Midwest who traditionally rotated soybeans with vegetable crops, as the new rules limited their acreage for rotation and made landowners less willing to rent to vegetable growers. The 2002 farm act restricted growing specialty crops on program acres, causing issues for Midwest farmers who rotated soybeans with vegetables. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to prevent loss of base acres if planting fruits or vegetables for processing, but no action was taken on them. The 109th Congress has not taken action on bills related to crop planting flexibility. Decoupling farm payments from planting decisions is a key issue in farm policy debates. The concept of decoupling began in the 1980s, with the 1996 farm act introducing major provisions. Restrictions on planting fruits and vegetables on \"flex\" acres were imposed, but the World Trade Organization later ruled against specific provisions of the U.S. cotton program. The World Trade Organization found that certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program, including planting flexibility, were not in compliance with the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. Concerns arose about potential legislative changes to align with WTO rules, but any adjustments to planting restrictions for specialty crops would not be considered until the 2007 farm bill. The H-2A program is the only program for importing foreign agricultural workers. Employers must apply for certification from the U.S. Labor Department. Several bills were introduced in Congress to make changes to the program, including provisions for foreign workers to become U.S. permanent residents. None of these bills had been passed into law as of the date of the report. Positions on guest worker reform proposals are mixed within the specialty. The UFPA strongly supports guest worker reform proposals like S. 359 / H.R. 884, citing the need for a legal workforce and improved conditions for workers. Opponents argue that the bills would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants and pose security risks. The discussion occurs amidst high levels of unauthorized migration to the U.S. The debate over a large-scale temporary worker program to address unauthorized migration to the United States raises various issues, including program requirements, eligibility, permanent resident status, treatment of family members, labor market tests, numerical limits, enforcement, and security concerns. The debate over a large-scale temporary worker program in the United States raises questions about enforcement, security provisions, and program requirements."
