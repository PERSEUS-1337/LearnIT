    "title": "SB 1317",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature adds Article 2.10 to Chapter 4 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code, focusing on Aquifer Protection. Groundwater is crucial for farms and communities, but there has been significant overdraft in some areas, especially during droughts. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act was passed in 2014 to address this issue, but full implementation will take time, allowing overdraft to continue in some regions. Despite the drought, there has been a significant increase in converting pastureland to new permanent crops irrigated by deep groundwater wells, leading to existing wells drying up and exacerbating overdraft in some regions. New developments also rely on individual wells, further stressing overdrafted groundwater basins. The increase in new wells for groundwater demands in California has led to alarming subsidence, threatening resources and infrastructure like roads and aqueducts. This subsidence could also permanently damage aquifers, jeopardizing future groundwater resources. The lack of protection for aquifers, existing groundwater users, and infrastructure from the increase in new wells is a statewide concern that requires regulation to prevent undesirable results. This act applies to charter cities and is in line with the policy in the California Constitution. The term \"basin\" is defined in the Water Code. In this article, key definitions related to water regulation are provided, including terms like \"Basin,\" \"Board,\" \"Bulletin 118,\" \"De minimis extractor,\" \"Department,\" \"Disadvantaged unincorporated community,\" \"Groundwater,\" \"Groundwater extraction facility,\" \"Groundwater sustainability plan,\" and different priority levels for basins. In addition to key water regulation definitions, terms like \"Primary drinking water standards,\" \"Probationary basin,\" \"Special act water district,\" and \"Undesirable result\" are defined in relation to water management. Cities or counties overlying high- or medium-priority basins must comply with specific requirements. Establish a process for issuing groundwater extraction permits by January 1, 2018, requiring applicants to prove no negative impact. Prohibit permits for new facilities in probationary basins or basins with critical overdraft conditions. Groundwater extraction permits are not required for de minimis extractors, replacing existing facilities, providing drinking water for public health, habitat conservation, or renewable energy projects like utility scale solar. Groundwater extraction permits are necessary for renewable energy projects like utility scale solar, photovoltaic or wind energy facilities approved after January 1, 2017, and groundwater extraction facilities in high- or medium-priority basins. Cities or counties overlying low- or very low priority basins can establish a process for issuing permits for groundwater extraction facilities. A city or county must review applications for groundwater extraction facilities within specified timelines. Fees for reviewing these applications are determined by specific sections. Existing ordinances before January 1, 2018, can impose conditions on new groundwater extraction facilities to prevent undesirable outcomes. This article exempts cities or counties overlying medium- or high-priority basins from requiring a groundwater extraction permit if a groundwater sustainability plan is deemed adequate. It also does not apply to basins with adjudicated groundwater rights or those managed by special act water districts. The County of Napa's groundwater conservation ordinance and water availability analysis policy satisfy the requirements of Section 65891.4, exempting it from certain regulations. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies have the authority to cover mandated costs."
