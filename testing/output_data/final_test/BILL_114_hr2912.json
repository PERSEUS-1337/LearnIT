It consists of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the U.S., owned by national and State-chartered commercial banks operating on a fractional reserve basis. In 1977, Congress changed the Federal Reserve System's monetary mandate to a dual mandate for maximum employment and stable prices, emphasizing the importance of price stability to prevent economic damage from inflation and deflation. The recent economic challenges, including the housing bubble burst and the 2008 financial crisis, have led to job losses and a weak recovery. Policymakers are reassessing financial institutions to strengthen the system. The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary measures, such as quantitative easing and keeping interest rates low, to support the economy.
