    "content": "The \"Bank On Our Communities Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a Community Credit Renewal Program. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to establish the Community Credit Renewal Program within the Treasury to provide assistance to community banking. The Secretary will provide up to $15 billion in assistance to community banking institutions through the Community Credit Renewal Fund. Assistance will be given based on the institution's viability, which can be demonstrated by receiving capital from investors other than the Secretary. The Community Credit Renewal Fund will provide capital to community banking institutions based on their viability, demonstrated by receiving capital from investors other than the Secretary. The capital received should enable the institution to remain well-capitalized and increase outstanding loans within a 2-year period. The Community Credit Renewal Fund requires community banking institutions to increase commercial and industrial loans by at least 5% compared to the smallest amount held in 2009. Institutions must notify the Secretary of proposed capital solicitation from investors before investment. The Community Credit Renewal Fund requires community banking institutions to notify the Secretary of proposed capital solicitation from investors, which must be matched or supplemented by an investment from the Secretary. If the Secretary does not refuse to make the matching or supplementary investment within a specified timeframe, the community banking institution can proceed with the capital investment plan. The Secretary may refuse to make a matching or supplementary investment if the aggregate capital raised is insufficient to meet requirements, but not solely based on a CAMEL composite rating of 3. The Secretary may refuse to invest if capital raised is insufficient, not based solely on a CAMEL rating of 3. Investments must meet specific criteria, including receiving capital from investors other than the Secretary within a set timeframe and not exceeding $15 billion in total funds. Lending incentives and penalties, such as interest rates, are also outlined. The penalty rate for community banking institutions assisted under this subsection will be increased by the Secretary to a rate at least 5 percentage points higher than the initial rate if the institution fails to increase its loans by an amount equal to the capital received by December 31, 2010. The Secretary may exempt community banking institutions from increasing commercial and industrial loans by at least 5 percent under certain circumstances. The community banking institution may redeem or repurchase securities or stock held by the Secretary at a discount level established by the Secretary for each dollar lent in commercial and industrial loans above specified amounts. The Secretary may allow for a reduction in interest or dividends on securities held by a community banking institution receiving assistance. If lending increases beyond federal assistance, additional discounts on stock redemption may be established. The curr_chunk defines an insured depository institution as having total assets of less than $5,000,000,000, with terms 'insured depository institution' and 'appropriate Federal banking agency' having the same meanings as in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
