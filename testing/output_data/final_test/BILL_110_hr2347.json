    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007\". The Congress acknowledges the Genocide Convention's definition of genocide and the prohibition on incitement to commit genocide. 133 UN member states have ratified the Convention, pledging to prosecute violators. On October 27, 2005, at the World Without Zionism Conference in Tehran, Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be \"wiped off the map\" and made similar inflammatory comments. The United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 1737 on December 23, 2006, which imposed sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Iran's nuclear program faced sanctions after failing to comply with Resolution 1737, leading to the approval of Resolution 1747 by the United Nations Security Council. Domestic discontent in Iran is growing, and targeted financial measures could increase political pressure. The nuclear crisis is hindering Iran's economic development and investment in key sectors. Targeted financial measures are a strong non-military tool to deter Iran from engaging in dangerous activities like its nuclear weapons program and support for terrorism. Foreign investments in Iran's energy sector have provided additional financial resources for these activities, leading to a growing interest in disassociating from such companies. Policy makers and fund managers may have reasons to divest from companies supporting Iran's nuclear weapons program or operating in sanctioned countries. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY IN CAPITAL MARKETS.
