    "content": "The formula for determining official mail allowance is amended to reduce the value. Additionally, the transfer of certain funds is prohibited, and there is an expansion of a rule. Paragraph (6) of section 3210(a) of title 39, United States Code, is amended to restrict Members of Congress from sending unsolicited franked mail within 60 days of any primary or general election where they are a candidate for reelection. Members running for other public offices are also prohibited from sending unsolicited mail outside their congressional district. Members of Congress are restricted from sending unsolicited franked mail within 60 days of any primary or general election where they are a candidate for reelection. Senators are also prohibited from sending unsolicited mail within 60 days of any election they are a candidate in. The Select Committee on Ethics oversees these regulations. The Select Committee on Ethics of the Senate and the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards prescribe rules for Members of Congress to comply with restrictions on mass mailings. Mass mailing is defined as sending newsletters or mail with substantially identical content during a session of Congress. Rules include timeframes for mailing and delivery to postal facilities. The rules for mass mailings by Members of Congress include restrictions on the number of pieces sent in a session, with exceptions for certain types of mailings such as direct responses, communications between government officials, and news releases. Mass mailings must be sent within 60 days of the communication they respond to. SEC. 4 repeals Subparagraph (H) of section 3210(a)(3) of title 39, United States Code. SEC. 5 mandates the return of excess amounts from official allowances of Members of the House of Representatives to the Treasury for deficit reduction. Any remaining amount in a Member of the House of Representatives' official allowance must be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction. Definitions for \"Member of the House of Representatives\" and \"official allowance\" are provided in the section. The Act and its amendments will be effective at the start of the first Congress after the Act's enactment."
