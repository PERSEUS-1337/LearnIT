    "content": "The Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program advocates for residents in nursing facilities and other care settings to improve quality of care and life. Ombudsmen assist residents with complaints, protect their rights, provide information and education, and advocate for systemic changes. The LTC Ombudsman Program, authorized under the Older Americans Act, provides resident-focused services in various adult residential care settings. Funding for OAA activities, including the LTC Ombudsman Program, has been appropriated by Congress through FY2015, with the possibility of reauthorization by the 114th Congress. The 114th Congress may reauthorize the OAA, potentially amending existing authorities or establishing new ones for the LTC Ombudsman Program. Funding for program activities and authorities under the Elder Justice Act will also be considered. The report outlines the LTC Ombudsman Program's legislative history, administrative function, funding sources, and facility types funded in 2013. It includes findings from an IOM evaluation and other related studies. The LTC Ombudsman Program was created in 1972 as a demonstration project and later established under the Older Americans Act in 1978. It received separate authorization of appropriations in 1987 and was incorporated into Title VII of the OAA in 1992. Further issues for Congress to consider regarding the program are identified. In 1992, the Older Americans Act (OAA) incorporated the LTC Ombudsman Program into Title VII, authorizing elder rights protection activities. The 2006 amendments made no major changes. The Elder Justice Act included initiatives to assist state LTC Ombudsman Programs, but no funding has been provided. There are 53 LTC Ombudsman Programs operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico, with 575 local programs as of 2013. The AoA's National Ombudsman Reporting System (NORS) compiles national statistics on ombudsman activities, including cases reported, staff, volunteers, and funding. State Ombudsman Programs are mandated by law to address resident complaints, provide services, represent residents' interests, and recommend changes in laws. The Office of the State Ombudsman is responsible for protecting residents in long-term care facilities by investigating complaints related to the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents. They also analyze and monitor laws and regulations affecting LTC facilities at federal, state, and local levels. Most state Ombudsman Programs are located within State Units on Aging (SUAs) or government agencies. The organizational placement of Ombudsman Programs varies across states due to discretion granted by the OAA. Some are located within State Units on Aging or government agencies, while others exist independently or in organizations outside of state government. This variation impacts the structure, operation, and effectiveness of the programs. The Ombudsman Programs vary in structure and operation across states, with unique features like independence and strict disclosure requirements. Concerns have been raised about inconsistent interpretation of OAA provisions and compliance issues. To address this, AoA published a final rule for State LTC Ombudsman Programs in 2015. The LTC Ombudsman Program was placed under Title VII of the Act in 1992 with minimal regulations. AoA received general support for the proposed rule, which aims to improve program quality and benefit residents. The rule addresses areas such as State Agency Policies and Definitions. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Office of the State LTC Ombudsman and outlines requirements for its establishment, including Ombudsman selection and program administration. It also details the responsibilities of the State LTC Ombudsman, such as training requirements, fiscal management, and annual reporting. The curr_chunk outlines state agency responsibilities related to the Ombudsman program, including fiscal management, annual reporting, and coordination with other entities. It also specifies the responsibilities of agencies hosting local Ombudsman entities, focusing on personnel management and access to facilities. The curr_chunk outlines policies for representatives of the Office, including their duties and conflict of interest requirements. States may need to update policies to comply with the final rule effective July 1, 2016. AoA will provide technical assistance for implementation. The Office of the Ombudsman intends to provide technical assistance and training to states before the rule's effective date. Ombudsman Programs participate in various federal initiatives, including quality improvement efforts and collaborating with Quality Improvement Organizations. They also inform nursing home residents and family members about long-term care options and have an expanded role in home care services. Ombudsmen assist residents and family members with quality measures in selecting nursing homes and improving care planning instruments. They also help residents transition to other care facilities, refer them to community resources, and monitor discharge planning. Some Ombudsman Programs are involved in federal nursing home transition initiatives like the CMS Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration program. Ombudsmen may participate in state-level coalitions and advisory committees overseeing these initiatives and receive training to better assist residents with transitions. Some states have expanded their LTC Ombudsman services to include assistance for individuals in Duals Demonstrations. These programs provide support, investigation, and resolution for beneficiaries, as well as systems-level analysis. Some states have also extended their LTC Ombudsman Programs to cover LTC in home settings, using various funding sources. State-based home care ombudsman programs use various funding sources, including grant funding and state funding, to cover complaints related to home care services. The role and function of home care ombudsmen vary, with no standardized best practices in place. These programs may also benefit the Medicaid program and qualify for Medicaid administrative funding for certain activities. Examples of activities eligible for Medicaid administrative funding include identifying and referring potential Medicaid enrollees, tracking and reporting enrollee requests for assistance, advocating for transitions between Medicare and Medicaid coverage, and assisting individuals in Medicaid waiver programs and transitioning out of nursing facilities. The LTC Ombudsman Program activities include identifying and reporting Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as assisting individuals with accessing non-Medicaid benefits and services. State Medicaid agencies must have agreements with the LTC Ombudsman Program for Medicaid funding. The state Medicaid agency is the sole entity authorized to submit claims for federal matching assistance. The LTC Ombudsman Program activities receive a 50% federal matching rate. Funding for the Ombudsman Program has been appropriated by Congress through FY2015 under Title III and Title VII of the OAA. Title VII authorizes grants to states for the LTC Ombudsman Program and Elder Abuse Prevention Program. In 2015, Title VII programs received $20.7 million in federal funding. Total funding for ombudsman activities in 2013 was $92.5 million, with 55.8% from federal sources and 44.2% from nonfederal sources. In 2013, federal funding for LTC Ombudsman Program activities decreased to 56%, while state funding increased to 37% and local funding decreased to 7%. Total funding in 2003 was $68.0 million, with $42.9 million from federal sources, $19.1 million from state sources, and $6.1 million from local sources. There were 1,233 paid staff in state LTC Ombudsman Programs in 2013, a 7% increase since 2003. In 2013, LTC Ombudsman Programs saw a 7% increase in paid staff since 2003, with 1,233 staff members. The program heavily relies on volunteers, with 9 out of 10 staff being volunteers. In 2013, there were just under 12,300 total volunteers, two-thirds of whom were certified to investigate complaints. The number of volunteers has fluctuated over the past decade, with an average of 12,300 volunteers per year. 48 states and the District of Columbia reported having at least one certified volunteer, while two states and Puerto Rico reported no volunteer activity. In 1991, HHS recognized the importance of volunteers in the Ombudsman Program for high complaint resolution rates. The IOM evaluation emphasized the need for proper recruitment, training, and supervision of volunteers. State programs have varying procedures for certifying volunteers, with different training requirements. In 2013, ombudsmen reported over 16,500 nursing facilities and about 53,400 other residential LTC facilities nationwide. The total number of regulated facilities increased by 15% from 2000 to 2013, mainly due to a rise in assisted living facilities and similar facilities. The workload of staff and volunteers in residential LTC facilities is substantial due to the requirement for ombudsmen to investigate and resolve complaints. In 2013, the nationwide ratio of paid ombudsmen to facilities was one ombudsman to every 56 facilities, with one ombudsman per 2,400 beds. Each state has a unique ratio of paid ombudsman staff per facility bed. The 1995 IOM study recommended a staffing ratio of one paid full-time equivalent staff per 2,000 LTC facility beds. Despite the high number of facilities, ombudsman staff and volunteers visited 70% of nursing homes regularly in 2013. The proportion of regular visits to assisted living and other LTC facilities was 29% in 2013, declining from 54% in 2003. State ombudsman programs are responsible for training new and existing staff. The Older Americans Act (OAA) requires the development of model standards for training Long-Term Care (LTC) ombudsmen, both paid and unpaid volunteers. State LTC Ombudsman Programs are responsible for establishing training procedures based on these standards, with input from citizen groups, LTC providers, and ombudsmen. Many states have their own training standards, with some providing direct training and others requiring local programs to conduct it. Assistance in developing training programs is available from the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center. In 2013, ombudsmen opened 125,000 new cases of resident complaints and closed almost 124,000 cases in LTC facilities. The number of complaints decreased by less than 2% compared to FY2012. Over the past decade, resident complaints have decreased by one-third. The top five complaint categories in nursing homes were problems with discharge planning, unheeded requests for assistance, lack of dignity or respect, resident conflict, and medication administration issues. The top five resident complaints in nursing homes and other LTC facilities for 2013 have remained consistent over the past decade, including issues with food quality, medication administration, discharge procedures, lack of dignity, and poor facility conditions. These complaints accounted for over one-fifth of all complaints in each facility type. The Ombudsman Program was last evaluated nationally in 1995, with subsequent studies examining factors affecting its effectiveness amidst the growth of long-term care facilities. The 1995 IOM study highlighted the importance of the Ombudsman Program in improving long-term services and supports, but noted it was understaffed and underfunded. Recommendations included developing guidelines for program visibility, recruiting more volunteers, and enhancing collaboration with nursing homes. Establishing ways for ombudsman programs to enhance collaboration with state nursing home survey and certification agencies is crucial for oversight of nursing home care quality. Studies have shown that factors like funding, staff, volunteers, autonomy, and strong relationships are key to program effectiveness. Research in California and New York found variations in program location and staffing, with many coordinators reporting inadequate budgets to meet requirements. In California and New York, program coordinators perceived their programs as effective, especially in nursing homes. Staffing, resident care, and residents' rights were identified as pressing issues. A 2010 study found no single factor associated with program effectiveness, but training quality and organizational autonomy were linked to effectiveness in mandated activities like complaint investigation and policy advocacy. In 2011, AoA awarded a contract to NORC at the University of Chicago to develop an evaluation study design to assess the effectiveness of LTC Ombudsman Programs. NORC issued a report with evidence-based recommendations for a comprehensive study design that includes process and outcomes evaluation activities, adaptable and scalable based on resource needs. The role of the LTC Ombudsman Program in ensuring quality care in LTC facilities will be a key issue for federal policymakers. The 114th Congress may focus on resource adequacy, expanding home and community-based services, improving Ombudsman training, preventing elder abuse, and reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. State LTC Ombudsman Programs are under pressure to monitor quality of care in residential care facilities. Regular visitation to these facilities is often limited. State LTC Ombudsman Programs face challenges due to limited visitation to facilities and stagnant federal funding. The number of facilities overseen has increased, driven by growth in residential care settings. Coordinators report a lack of resources and the need to prioritize certain mandates. Policymakers may need to address these issues to ensure quality care in LTC facilities. Policymakers may need to consider additional staffing and resources for ombudsman programs to oversee residential care facilities and provide specialized training. There is a perceived need for an in-home care ombudsman program to address quality of care issues for LTC recipients receiving care at home. However, expanding ombudsman activities to home settings without additional resources may strain the system. Expanding the role of ombudsmen in quality improvement efforts and transitions from nursing homes requires well-trained staff. Ombudsmen, mostly volunteers, need consistent training standards to effectively assist home care recipients. They must be educated on long-term care services and possess communication and critical thinking skills to resolve complaints. Policymakers should consider establishing federal training requirements for ombudsmen to serve as valuable resources for community services. The LTC Ombudsman Program plays a key role in identifying and investigating complaints of resident abuse and neglect in nursing facilities. A study from 2006 to 2013 found that while the total number of abuse and neglect complaints decreased, physical abuse by a nonresident was the most frequent complaint each year. Complaint reductions were seen for all types of abuse and neglect except for financial exploitation, pointing to a need for federal training requirements or technical assistance for training. The national trends show a decline in reporting in residential care facilities, prompting a need for further research and understanding. The Elder Justice Act provisions could provide resources to address elder abuse, and a bipartisan bill was introduced to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015 (S. 192) was passed by the Senate and referred to the House Education and Workforce Committee. It includes provisions for the LTC Ombudsman Program and would authorize appropriations through FY2018. The bill also amends definitions related to LTC facilities. The bill aims to redefine the term \"resident\" in LTC facilities to include individuals of any age, allowing them to receive Ombudsman Program services. It also requires the state LTC Ombudsman to manage the Office and investigate complaints from residents with limited decision-making capacity. The bill expands Ombudsman Program services to residents of all ages in LTC facilities, requiring the Ombudsman to seek evidence of resident consent in complaints involving those with limited decision-making capacity. It also mandates private access to Ombudsman services and support for resident and family councils. The bill expands Ombudsman Program services to residents of all ages in LTC facilities, requiring private and unimpeded access for representatives. It also mandates support for resident and family councils. The bill expands Ombudsman Program services to residents of all ages in LTC facilities, requiring private and unimpeded access for representatives. It clarifies that representatives must have appropriate access to review information when a resident is unable to communicate consent and has no legal representative. Additionally, it specifies that representatives have access to files, records, and information necessary for investigating complaints. The Ombudsman and Office representatives are considered a \"health oversight agency\" under HIPAA, allowing for the release of residents' health information under certain circumstances. The bill expands Ombudsman Program services to residents of all ages in LTC facilities, ensuring private access for representatives to files, records, and information necessary for investigating complaints. It amends disclosure requirements to allow the Ombudsman to disclose information as needed to serve residents with limited decision-making capacity. Additionally, it addresses conflict of interest issues by replacing the subsection with new descriptions for individual and organizational conflicts. The bill requires state agencies to prevent conflicts of interest in the designation of Ombudsman and local representatives. Ombudsman must not be involved in licensing or have ownership in LTC facilities. The bill requires state agencies to prevent conflicts of interest in the designation of Ombudsman and local representatives. Ombudsman must not have any financial ties to LTC facilities or related organizations, and must not have management responsibility for adult protective services. Organizational Conflict of Interest requirements must be followed if the Office poses a conflict. The state agency must not operate the Office in cases of organizational conflict of interest, unless disclosed and identified to the Assistant Secretary in writing. The state agency must disclose and remedy any organizational conflict of interest involving the Office as required by the Assistant Secretary."
