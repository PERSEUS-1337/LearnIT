This paper introduces algorithms that utilize lossless compressed representations of deep feedforward networks to perform inference without full decompression. The approach leverages the permutation invariance of bipartite graph layers in feedforward networks, achieving better efficiency than traditional methods. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset validate the effectiveness of this approach. Our approach focuses on utilizing lossless compressed representations of deep feedforward networks for efficient inference tasks, particularly on the MNIST dataset. This method aims to overcome the limitations of current deep neural networks, which are often too large and complex for fast and energy-efficient inference on devices or for scaling deep learning as a service. By introducing succinct structures that can operate near the entropy bound, we enable efficient operations on compressed representations without complete decompression. Succinct structures for feedforward neural networks enable efficient operations on compressed representations without complete decompression, overcoming limitations of current deep neural networks for fast and energy-efficient inference on devices. Efficient implementations of arithmetic coding have been developed for video standards like H.264/AVC and HEVC. A neural network model described in a study is used to create concise structures for deep neural networks, focusing on feedforward neural networks with permutation-invariant functions. The study describes a neural network model that creates concise structures for deep neural networks, focusing on feedforward neural networks with permutation-invariant functions. The model consists of partially-labeled bipartite graphs for the first two layers, with nodes in the input and output layers being distinguishable. Each time nodes of an unlabeled layer are connected, it is treated as a labeled layer in the K-layer neural network construction. The study presents a neural network model that constructs concise structures for deep neural networks using partially-labeled bipartite graphs. An inference algorithm is used for the bipartite graph, which is then applied to a K-layered neural network. The optimized representation of the bipartite graph is utilized as input for the algorithm, resulting in output Y. The study introduces a neural network model that creates compact structures for deep neural networks using partially-labeled bipartite graphs. An inference algorithm is applied to the bipartite graph and then to a K-layered neural network, resulting in output Y. The algorithm requires minimal additional dynamic space for the inference task compared to storing the representation and structure. The output Y is a permutation of the uncompressed neural network output \u1ef8. The neural network model introduces compact structures for deep neural networks using partially-labeled bipartite graphs. The space complexity for decoding individual nodes and the queue is discussed, with the expected space complexity for the queue being less than or equal to 2(m + 1)N. The algorithm encodes non-zero tree nodes at a certain depth using Elias-Gamma integer codes. The algorithm encodes non-zero tree nodes at a certain depth using Elias-Gamma integer codes. Set f as the first element obtained after dequeuing Q. Decode the child node of f corresponding to color i and store it as c. Enqueue c in Q. Update the Y vector using the required activation function. The compressed structure obtained by the iterative use of the algorithm is succinct.
