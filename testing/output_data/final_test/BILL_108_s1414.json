    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia Personal Protection Act\" and includes Congressional findings. Congress finds that the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals in the District of Columbia to keep and bear arms for sporting use and lawful defense, despite local laws depriving law-abiding citizens of this right. The high murder rate in the District may be partly attributed to these restrictions. Legislation is needed to correct the District of Columbia's law to restore citizens' Second Amendment rights and enhance public safety by allowing law-abiding individuals to possess firearms for self-defense in their homes and businesses. Federal regulations already exist, and local laws disarming citizens are unnecessary. The legislation amends the District of Columbia Code to prevent the Council, Mayor, or any authority from restricting the possession and use of firearms allowed under Federal law. It also repeals the D.C. semiautomatic ban. The legislation repeals the D.C. semiautomatic ban and registration requirement for firearms. SEC. 5. REPEAL REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT. Section 2502.01 of title 7, District of Columbia Code, is amended to remove the registration requirement for firearms. SEC. 6. REPEAL D.C. HANDGUN BAN. SEC. 6. REPEAL D.C. HANDGUN BAN.
