Generic advertising, on the other hand, promotes products without specific producer names. It is argued that generic advertising can help expand total demand for basic agricultural products. Examples of generic advertising include The Beef: It's What's for Dinner and Pork: The Other White Meat ads. These programs also aim to expand foreign markets and fund research and education. Since the prototype Florida Citrus Advertising Tax in 1935, numerous mandatory farm commodity promotion programs have been established by states or the federal government. Nine out of ten U.S. farmers were contributing to these efforts by the mid-1990s. Mandatory check-offs are preferred by many commodity groups to address the \"free rider\" issue. Requests for mandatory check-offs have been made to Congress or USDA to stimulate product demand in the face of globalized farm markets and increased foreign competition. Mandatory check-off programs have faced challenges from some U.S. producers who view them as a \"tax\" for funding activities they wouldn't support voluntarily. Several cases, including Glickman v. Wileman Brothers and Elliot, Inc., have reached the U.S. Supreme Court, with producers questioning the legality of these programs. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that mandatory assessments for generic advertising violated First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that such programs should be presumed valid and not overridden by the preferences of a minority of producers. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. United Foods, Inc. on June 25, 2001, that mandatory assessments for the mushroom check-off violated the First Amendment. The Court stated that the mushroom check-off program is a stand-alone advertising scheme, different from broader regulatory programs like the peach/nectarine marketing order. The case Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association involved a ruling that the national beef check-off program violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the program, stating that the check-off messages constitute government speech and are not subject to a First Amendment challenge. The Supreme Court upheld the national beef check-off program, stating that the messages in the beef promotions are considered government speech established by Congress and the Secretary. The program's funding through targeted assessments does not disqualify it as government speech. The Supreme Court upheld the national beef check-off program as government speech funded through targeted assessments. Various agricultural groups reacted favorably to the decision, while some expressed disappointment. Since the Johanns decision, legal challenges to agricultural check-off programs have been stalled or ended, including those on beef, dairy, pork, watermelons, and cotton. The Supreme Court did not address the constitutionality of check-offs if ads are attributed to dissenting individuals. Congress retains final oversight, and potential statutory changes may be considered. The Johanns decision could influence new legislation for check-off programs, which are required to evaluate their economic effectiveness. Researchers use various indicators to assess benefits versus costs, including market data analysis and surveys. Difficulty arises in isolating the impact of program promotion dollars from other variables. Economists use sophisticated models to isolate the effects of program promotion dollars from other variables. Studies show positive benefit-to-cost ratios, ranging from 2-1 to as high as 10-1. However, interpreting these ratios can be complex and may not address questions about program effectiveness, equal sharing of benefits among contributors, or the economic impact on non-contributors. Some check-off programs collect funds for activities to enhance product demand, with restrictions on using funds for government influence. Critics question the line between advertising and advocacy, especially when funds are used for industry image promotion. The proximity of check-off program staff to trade associations can further complicate fund usage. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agreed to release liability for air pollution violations by animal feeding operations participating in a national study, funded by hog farms paying $2,500 each. The National Pork Board committed $6 million to cover fees, which was challenged by the Campaign for Family Farms. A USDA judge ruled the spending was against public policy, but denied an injunction pending appeal. The board spent check-off funds as planned despite an injunction pending appeal. Check-off programs typically start after industry proposal and USDA order, with periodic referenda for support. Concerns include fair representation on governing boards overseeing program staff and policies. Some groups are questioning the dominance of powerful economic interests in check-off efforts due to industry changes. The Johanns decision may lead Congress to consider exempting certain producers from mandatory assessments for generic advertising. Congress could also redefine provisions in commodity promotion laws and reexamine requirements for advertisements to clarify they are speech. The curr_chunk discusses the need to clarify that advertisements are speech by the government in check-off programs, especially in relation to nutritional guidelines. The focus is on reconciling the messages of check-off programs with government-sponsored dietary guidelines."
