    "content": "The text chunk discusses the revision of tax treatment of derivative transactions entered into by a corporation with respect to its stock under Section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text chunk explains that no gain or loss is recognized by a corporation when receiving property or services in exchange for its stock. It also discusses the nonrecognition treatment of Section 1032 derivative items in determining a corporation's tax liability. The term \"derivative items\" refers to obligations under options, forward contracts, or futures contracts related to a corporation's stock, reflecting changes in stock value or distributions. It excludes deductions for compensation or under section 83. Income recognition on certain forward contracts is required for corporations that acquire their stock as part of a plan involving a forward contract. The excess amount received under the contract over the stock's fair market value is treated as original issue discount on a debt. The excess amount received under a forward contract for stock acquisition is treated as original issue discount on a debt, unless proven otherwise within a specific timeframe. The term 'forward contract' includes transactions having the same effect as a forward contract. Any reference to stock in this section includes treasury stock. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section. Basis for property acquired by a corporation in certain exchanges for its stock is covered in section 362. The item relating to section 1032 in the table of sections for part III of subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to read as follows: certain exchanges for its stock, see section 362. The amendments made by this section apply to transactions entered into after the date of the enactment of this Act."
