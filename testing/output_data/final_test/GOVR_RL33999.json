    "content": "The Senate passed a revised version of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, clearing it for the President after he vetoed the original bill due to a provision allowing victims of Saddam Hussein's regime to sue the current Iraqi government. The revised bill would authorize all but $215 million of the $696.4 billion requested for national defense funding in FY2008. The revised FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 4986, includes a 3.5% pay raise for military personnel and reauthorizes various bonuses. The President is expected to sign the bill, except for Section 1083 which amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The revised FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 4986, includes provisions that could result in billions of dollars in Iraqi funds being tied up by court proceedings, undermining efforts to rebuild Iraq and train Iraqi security forces. The bill also includes a provision allowing the President to waive its application to Iraq. The revised FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act includes a provision allowing the President to waive its application to Iraq for national security interests and promoting democracy. It also mentions negotiating compensation for claims related to terrorist acts by the Saddam Hussein regime against U.S. citizens or armed forces. The Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) was signed into law on December 26, providing budget authority for ongoing Pentagon operations. However, legal authority for enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses expired on January 1, 2008, leading to a temporary halt in payments. The Army, Navy, and Air Force have added an addendum to new bonus agreements, stating that payment is not guaranteed until legislatively authorized. The Marine Corps has suspended bonuses altogether and directed units to extend current enlistments for eligible Marines awaiting reenlistment bonuses. The delay in enacting a defense authorization bill caused military personnel's basic pay to increase by 3% instead of 3.5% on January 1. The revised authorization bill, H.R. 4986, would retroactively authorize the 3.5% pay raise and various bonuses for those eligible for reenlistment. The bill was initially approved by the House and Senate but was not signed by the President, resulting in a \"pocket veto.\" The House adjourned, leading to a potential \"pocket veto\" of the bill. Democratic leaders argued that Congress was not adjourned, challenging the President's ability to use this procedure. If the President neither signs nor vetoes a bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays) and Congress is adjourned, the bill does not become law. This \"pocket veto\" prevents Congress from overriding the President's decision. The President's ability to use a pocket veto after an adjournment between sessions of Congress has been a subject of constitutional debate. Recent presidents have argued that Congress cannot override a pocket veto during an adjournment within a two-year Congress. The White House considered Congress to be in a state of adjournment regarding the defense authorization bill H.R. 1585. The President used a pocket veto on the defense authorization bill H.R. 1585, but also returned it to Congress with a \"Memorandum of Disapproval.\" The House did not acknowledge the pocket veto and introduced a new bill, H.R. 4986, based on the vetoed bill with necessary changes. The House introduced a new bill, H.R. 4986, based on the vetoed defense authorization bill with necessary changes. The revised bill passed the House and Senate with strong majorities, clearing it for the President to sign into law. The President signed the conference report on the FY2008 Defense Appropriations bill, providing $460.3 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Defense's activities. The conference report on the FY2008 Defense Appropriations bill includes $11.6 billion for Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles. A continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 52) was passed to fund federal agencies through December 14, 2007, due to the lack of enacted FY2008 appropriations bills. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations bill includes funding for MRAP vehicles. A continuing resolution was passed to fund federal agencies through December 14, 2007. The House passed a bill providing $50 billion for war costs, with additional funds pending congressional action on the President's request. The bill requires DOD to withdraw U.S. forces from combat in Iraq and aims to have them in supporting roles by December 2008. The Senate rejected motions related to war funding and deployments. House-Senate conferees agreed on $21.4 billion for DOD military construction and housing programs in the FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. The FY2008 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill included agreements on military construction and housing programs. The White House released a budget request for FY2008 with $647.2 billion for national defense, including funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The budget request for FY2008 includes $17.4 billion for campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, $5.2 billion for defense-related activities of other agencies, and $483.2 billion for the Department of Defense's base budget, with an additional $141.7 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration has requested emergency appropriations for war-fighting costs in FY2008, totaling $189.3 billion. Congress has begun action on the defense authorization bill, with the House passing H.R. 1585 and the Senate marking up S. 567. The Senate Armed Services Committee marked up its version of the defense budget bill on May 24 and reported it as a clean bill on June 5. Congress approved $99.4 billion for the Department of Defense in FY2007, $6.0 billion more than the Administration had requested. Additional details on congressional action on defense funding bills will be added as proceedings continue. The House and Senate versions of the annual budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 99 and S.Con.Res. 21, show congressional action on defense budget authority and outlays. The defense authorization bill authorizes funds for programs within the national defense budget function, with mandatory programs requiring budget authority projected under standing law. The bill does not provide funds but authorizes their appropriation. The authorization bill authorizes funds for defense programs but does not provide funds itself. Appropriations bills may provide more, less, or the same amount as authorized. Defense appropriations bills usually align with authorized amounts. The FY2008 defense and military construction appropriations bills are detailed in congressional action. Funding for defense-related activities of agencies other than the Defense Department is not included in the table. The \"302(b)\" allocations under the Congressional Budget Act compare funds for defense and military construction/veterans affairs appropriations bills to non-defense bills. Point of order holds against bills exceeding their 302(b) allocation. Recent years saw defense allocations trimmed to increase non-defense funds, with emergency appropriations used for defense costs. Questions arise about the affordability and spending balance in DOD's budget plan. The Department of Defense's funding plan for FY2008-FY2013 projects an increase in the base budget, but fiscal pressures and unbudgeted funds for military operations abroad may pose challenges. The current mix of federal programs is deemed fiscally unsustainable in the long term due to factors like the aging population and rising health costs. The nation's aging population and rising health costs are driving an increase in spending for federal entitlement programs, leading to rising deficits and interest on the national debt. To balance the federal budget by 2012 and cover the costs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, federal spending on discretionary programs would need to be reduced. Some recommend sustaining the defense budget at 4% of GDP to protect it from fiscal pressures. The Administration has submitted a budget proposal for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY2008 separate from its base budget request. Congress may find it challenging to subject the cost-of-war appropriations request to the same oversight as regular defense spending. If defense committees mark up the FY2008 funding bills on their usual schedules, they will have to review the President's $482 billion base DOD budget request in less than four months. The President's $482 billion base DOD budget request and the additional $142 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may pose a challenge for Congress. The defense committees may lack the necessary tools to scrutinize ongoing combat operations funding. Congressional focus has been on the FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill for combat operations, which also aims to reduce U.S. troop involvement in Iraq. Additionally, DOD does not include ongoing operations costs in future budget projections. DOD projects relatively flat defense budgets from FY2009 through FY2013, despite rising costs in health care, operations, maintenance, and new weapons. Congress lacks clarity on how fiscal constraints may impact future defense budgets. The Korean War has led to a 2.5% annual increase in costs above inflation, with new expensive weapons expected to enhance U.S. forces. The rising cost of military personnel, including pay and benefits, has also contributed to budget challenges. The Administration has proposed an increase in active-duty end-strength by adding 92,000 soldiers and Marines, costing at least $12 billion annually. The Navy and Air Force are cutting personnel levels to fund weapons programs, raising concerns about the Navy's ability to sustain its fleet within budget constraints. The Navy released a long-range shipbuilding plan in February that falls just short of its goal of maintaining a fleet of 313 ships. The plan assumes an increase in ship construction funding from $12.5 billion in FY2008 to $17.5 billion in FY2013, but funding challenges may arise due to future defense budget pressures. Even if the Navy receives the requested budgets, it may face delays in acquiring all planned ships due to rising costs and construction issues. The Navy's shipbuilding plan faces challenges due to escalating costs and delays in new ship types. Unachievable plans may hinder decision-making on building new designs or upgrading existing vessels. The services' tactical air forces modernization plans also suffer from budgetary and technological optimism. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps are facing challenges with their fighter plane procurement plans due to escalating costs and budget pressures. The F-22A and F-35 programs have been affected, resulting in reduced purchases of aircraft. This adjustment is easier for aircraft budgets than for shipbuilding budgets, which fund fewer units at higher costs. The military services face challenges in managing their aircraft procurement plans due to budget constraints and escalating costs. New systems receive higher funding priority, leading to reduced budgets for legacy systems. This results in delays in fielding new aircraft, requiring legacy aircraft to remain in service for longer periods than planned. The Department of Defense is requesting $147 billion for war funding in FY2008, which is 29% of the total amount requested for all routine DOD activities. This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that the Administration has submitted a request for war funding for the full year. Congress has typically funded war costs in two bills since FY2003, but the Administration requested an additional $5.3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Program vehicles in July 2007. The Department of Defense is requesting $147 billion for war funding in FY2008, with an additional $42.3 billion requested by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. The total request for FY2008 would be $189.3 billion, 14% above the FY2007 enacted level. The original FY2008 Global War on Terror request of $141.7 billion is similar to FY2007 funding request, with exceptions for troop levels and training Afghan and Iraqi security forces. The Department of Defense is requesting $147 billion for war funding in FY2008, with an additional $42.3 billion requested by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates for extending the troop surge in Iraq. The House passed a continuing resolution to fund government operations temporarily, including funds for war costs and MRAPS. The Department of Defense is requesting $147 billion for war funding in FY2008, with an additional $42.3 billion requested by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates for extending the troop surge in Iraq. The original FY2008 war request includes $109.7 billion for Iraq and $26.0 billion for Afghanistan and other counter-terror operations, supporting a total of 320,000 deployed personnel. Secretary Gates announced major elements of the Administration's new request to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The anticipated request for war funding in FY2008 includes $6.3 billion for operations, $13.9 billion for force protection, $8.9 billion for reconstituting the force, $6.4 billion to enhance ground forces, $3.3 billion in emergency requests, $1.0 billion for military construction, $1.0 billion for training and equipping Iraq security forces, $.9 billion for military intelligence, and $.2 billion for coalition support and Commanders Emergency Response Program. Senator Byrd stated that detailed justification material for the new request is expected. The House and Senate are considering the FY2008 war funding request separately. The House passed its bill in May 2007, while the Senate resumed consideration in September. The President has not formally submitted the additional $42.3 billion request announced by Secretary Gates. If the continuing resolution is enacted, DOD's $5.3 billion request for MRAPs would be funded. In its report on DOD's FY2008 Appropriation, the House Appropriations Committee deferred consideration of $2.0 billion in war-related requests to the GWOT bill, potentially increasing emergency war funding. The House and Senate bills differ in their approaches to war funding, with the Senate transferring $13.4 billion of GWOT-requested funds to DOD's baseline program. The Senate-reported version provides $128.3 billion for GWOT, a cut of $13.4 billion from the GWOT request. However, most programs in DOD's GWOT request are included in the baseline program. The SASC report recommends transferring funds from the GWOT to the baseline program, arguing that military personnel, procurement, and construction funds dedicated to \"growing the force\" should be considered part of DOD's regular program. This transfer aims to identify the full funding for expanding the Army and Marine Corps, originally justified for conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan but now proposed as a permanent expansion. The FY2008 GWOT request includes $4.1 billion for military personnel and $689 million for operations. The FY2008 GWOT request includes $4.1 billion for military personnel, $689 million for operating and maintenance costs, and $169 million for military construction to support the increase of 92,000 Army and Marine Corps troops by 2012. The Senate authorizers have approved funds for weapon system upgrades such as CH-47 Army helicopters, Bradley fighting vehicles, and Abrams tanks, which were part of the Army's ongoing modernization efforts. DOD argues that much of its war-related procurement request is for reconstitution or reset of equipment. The Senate authorizers have approved funds for weapon system upgrades such as CH-47 Army helicopters, Bradley fighting vehicles, and Abrams tanks, which were part of the Army's ongoing modernization efforts. The war-related procurement request is for reconstitution or reset of equipment expected to wear out sooner due to combat stress, typically upgraded versions contributing to modernization. The SASC endorses transfers to the base budget to capture integrated costs and not obscure the true cost of actual end strength. Both authorizing bills recommend an increase of $4.1 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAP), more effective than uparmored HMMWVs against Improvised Explosive Devices. The MRAP is deemed an urgent new war requirement and is more effective than uparmored HMMWVs against IED attacks. The Administration requested an additional $5.36 billion for MRAP, with cuts to lower priority GWOT programs. Operational testing is ongoing, with the first 100 vehicles produced failing testing. MRAP II is being tested to stop explosively formed projectiles in Iraq, with about 200 vehicles currently in theater. The Administration requested $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicles to replace uparmored HMMWVs in theater. The Army and Marine Corps are testing several variants, with a potential purchase of 18,000 to 23,000 vehicles. The goal is to deliver about 8,000 vehicles in theater by ramping up production. The Department of Defense (DOD) is expected to request an additional $10 billion for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Currently, DOD has about $4.3 billion in funding for MRAPs, with a potential total of $10.2 billion if the new FY2008 request is approved. The cost of an individual MRAP is estimated to be over $1 million, compared to $350,000 for an uparmored HMMWV. The FY2008 DOD Appropriations Act does not address DOD's war funding. The FY2008 DOD Appropriations Act, H.R. 3222, does not address DOD's war request. House leaders plan to propose a separate bill at a later date to address funding for additional military equipment and programs, including C-17 transport aircraft, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, Blackhawk MEDEVAC helicopters, the Global Train and Equip Program, and readiness of stateside units in the strategic reserve. Shortfalls in funding for the Defense Health Program are also noted. The House appropriators deferred $2.0 billion in baseline requests to the war bill, categorizing some requests as war rather than baseline requirements. This highlights the ongoing dilemma in war funding of distinguishing between necessary war requirements and capabilities for future needs. The HAC requires a DOD report outlining assumptions underlying reset efforts. The HAC requires a DOD report to outline assumptions for reset efforts and distinguish between war and baseline requirements. $2.0 billion was cut from DOD's baseline request, with items like special pay, procurement for heavy Army trucks, and upgrades to aircraft considered war-related. The HAC proposes transferring $2.0 billion from DOD's baseline request to GWOT, freeing up funding for other programs and making it easier for DOD to comply with overall spending caps. This adjustment allows for easier modifications to DOD's GWOT request compared to its baseline program. The House appropriators included several general provisions related to war in the markup of H.R. 3222, including prohibitions on spending funds for training foreign security forces with human rights violations, separate budget justifications for operations over $100 million, written notification of mobilization periods for reservists, and limitations on operation and maintenance obligations until DOD submits a report on contractor services. The House appropriators included provisions in H.R. 3222 related to war, such as requiring DOD to provide monthly reports on military personnel deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2008 GWOT request mirrored the FY2007 Supplemental request in funding levels and force levels for military operations. The original request did not include the additional cost for increasing Army brigades. The additional $4 billion cost for increasing five Army brigades was completed in June 2007. Secretary Gates announced an extra $6.3 billion for operations to cover the costs of retaining the brigades in Iraq and redeploying them by July 2008. If force levels decrease later in the year, some of these funds may not be needed. The Congressional Budget Office projected a surge could cost $10 billion for a four-month period and $22 billion for a 12-month surge between FY2007 and FY2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a 12-month surge could cost about $22 billion, higher than DOD's estimates due to assumptions of more support troops needed. The House authorizers cut $881 million from DOD's $6 billion request for the LOGCAP program but added $401 million for additional Army and Marine Corps personnel. The HASC also established a Defense Readiness Production Board to address readiness concerns. The Defense Readiness Production Board is set up by HASC to identify critical readiness requirements. DOD is authorized to use multiyear procurement contracts up to $500 million for items of critical readiness importance without statutory approval. SASC transfers $4.1 billion from DOD's GWOT request for higher Army and Marine Corps force levels to the base budget. DOD's O&M request is reduced to $72.0 billion with $712 million transferred to \"grow the force.\" $1 billion is authorized for critical readiness purposes. DOD is requesting $37.6 billion for reconstitution, which includes equipment repair, replacement of battle losses, upgrading equipment, and expanding supply inventory. $8.9 billion is for equipment repair, with $7.8 billion for the Army and $1.3 billion for the Marine Corps. The remaining $28.7 billion is for procurement. In a report to Congress in September 2006, DOD estimated that equipment replacement in FY2008 would be about $5.0 billion for the Army and about $500 million for the Marine Corps, levels substantially below the requested amounts. The increase in reconstitution requirements for the Army and Marine Corps in FY2008 may reflect an expanded definition of war-related equipment replacement and a decision to request more than one year's requirement. The FY2008 war request includes upgrades and replacements for equipment, with over $8 billion in war-related procurement funds still to be contracted. Congress may choose to delay some items requested by DOD, as seen in previous years. The services request replacements for aircraft and helicopters, both for battle losses and stressed aircraft. Services are instructed to request new major weapon systems only for combat losses already experienced. The FY2008 war request includes upgrades and replacements for equipment, with over $8 billion in war-related procurement funds still to be contracted. Congress may choose to delay some items requested by DOD. Services are instructed to request new major weapon systems only for combat losses already experienced, with exceptions made for stressed aircraft. The administration withdrew its request for new aircraft in response to congressional doubts. The FY2008 request includes upgrades and replacements for equipment, such as new V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, F-35 JSF, and C-130Js. The House authorizers mostly supported the procurement request, except for cuts to certain aircraft requests and additional funding for Mine Resistant Ambush program. The SASC reduces GWOT funding for procurement from $36.0 billion to $28.3 billion, including transfers to the base budget, program cuts for troubled programs like V-22, UH-1Y/Ah-1Z, and C-130J aircraft, and program adds for Mine Resistant Ambush Program (MRAP). The committee questions DOD's plan for rapid production buildups and transfers procurement to the base budget for greater visibility. The SASC reduces GWOT funding for procurement from $36.0 billion to $28.3 billion, including transfers to the base budget and program cuts for troubled programs. DOD's FY2008 GWOT procurement request focuses on replacement needs and upgrades rather than war losses, with $11 billion allocated for force protection, including body armor and armored vehicles. The committee questions the clarity of the war-related connection for the requests. The FY2008 GWOT procurement request includes funding for equipment such as fire-retardant uniforms, unmanned aerial vehicles, and mine protection vehicles. Congress has added funds for more armored vehicles and body armor in response to concerns about force protection. Additional funding has been allocated for Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs) to address the threat of IEDs. The House and SASC have added $4.1 billion for MRAPs in response to concerns about force protection. The House bill authorizes $4.6 billion for MRAPs, with funds taken from lower priority programs. The SASC also raises concerns about differences in MRAP strategies between the Army and Marine Corps. In FY2008, DOD is requesting an additional $4.0 billion for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund to combat IEDs, with a total of $12.1 billion if approved. Congress has raised concerns about the management practices of the organization. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) is facing scrutiny for its financial management practices, lack of a spending plan, and duplication of work. Congress is skeptical about fully funding future budget requests unless improvements are made. The FY2008 request for an additional $4 billion for the Joint IED Defeat Fund is being endorsed by House authorizers, while the SASC transfers $500 million from the base budget to classify all JIEDD funds as war-related. The SASC requires a management plan for JIEDDO within 60 days, calls for $50 million in funds for blast injury research, and additional funding for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi forces in FY2008 GWOT. Total funds for Iraq and Afghanistan would amount to $19.2 billion and $10.6 billion respectively. The FY2008 GWOT requests for Iraq and Afghanistan are lower than FY2007, with concerns raised by Congress about progress and total costs. OMB must submit reports every 90 days on fund usage and estimate total training costs within 120 days. An independent organization will assess Iraqi forces' readiness to enhance security in 18 provinces in the next 12-18 months. The House endorses funding but requires progress reports on Iraqi training. The House and SASC endorse DOD's funding request for coalition support and training Iraqi security forces, with requirements for quarterly progress reports and prior congressional notification. DOD requests $1.7 billion for coalition support and $1 billion for the Commanders Emergency Response Program in FY2008. In FY2008, Congress supports the Commanders' Emergency Response Program (CERP) and coalition support funding levels similar to FY2007. Congress has proposed cutting the Administration's request for coalition support. The House reauthorizes CERP without setting a funding limit, while the SASC sets a $977 million cap for CERP and supports limits on coalition support and support services for OIF and OEF operations. DOD requests $908 million in FY2008 for war-related military construction and family housing, lower than FY2007. Concerns about permanent basing in Iraq persist. Some FY2008 projects, previously rejected, include building roads, power plants, and barracks in Iraq. Congress approved most FY2007 projects but prohibited funds for permanent U.S. forces in Iraq. The House and SASC reject funds for permanent basing of U.S. forces in Iraq in FY2008. They reduce the GWOT request for military construction, prohibit using funds for permanent basing in Iraq or controlling Iraqi oil resources, and transfer funds for state-side projects to the base budget. The House extends the prohibition on establishing permanent bases in Iraq in its appropriations bill. The House and SASC reject funds for permanent basing of U.S. forces in Iraq in FY2008, including controlling Iraqi oil resources. The House extends the prohibition on establishing permanent bases in Iraq in its appropriations bill. The budget request includes a 3% pay raise for military personnel effective January 1, 2008, to keep pace with private-sector wages. Some argue for a 3.5% raise to address a perceived pay gap, while the Defense Department denies such a gap. The budget request includes a 3% pay raise for military personnel in FY2008 to maintain their policy of keeping military pay at the 70th percentile of pay for civilians with similar education and experience. The Administration requested a 2.2% increase, equivalent to ECI, for FY2007, which was ultimately approved by Congress. The budget also includes funding to increase active-duty end-strength by 65,000 Army personnel and 27,000 Marines by 2013. The Administration's budget proposes to increase troop-strength for overseas deployments, facing challenges regarding the cost and skepticism about extended missions. Additionally, there are proposed increases in Tricare fees and co-pays for retirees under 65. The Defense Department's medical insurance program, Tricare, is facing increases in fees to curb rising costs. The budget request aims to generate $1.9 billion from higher fees to offset a projected $64 billion annual cost by FY2015. The proposal includes indexing future fee increases to national health care premium rates. Service members and retirees' organizations oppose the plan, arguing for alternative cost-saving measures. Some groups argue that Tricare fee increases should be tied to the Consumer Price Index rather than health insurance premium rates. Congress blocked proposed fee hikes for one year and established a study group to find alternative solutions. National Guard units have been stripped of equipment needed for deployments, hindering their training and emergency response capabilities. Some argue for elevating the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the rank of general and equipping additional Guard combat units with Stryker armored vehicles. The Stryker combat vehicle equips Army brigades and National Guard units, providing versatility in domestic disaster-response missions. The surveillance and information network within a Stryker brigade is crucial. The Future Combat System is a $164 billion program to develop networked combat vehicles and sensors. The Future Combat System is a $164 billion program criticized for being technologically risky. Congress cut $326 million from the Administration's FY2007 request for the program. Concerns arise about its efficiency in armored warfare versus counter-insurgency operations. Critics may try to slow the project's pace, especially for technologically exotic components not deployed within the next five years. The Navy may resume building nuclear-powered surface warships, which have operational advantages like high speed and long-distance travel without fuel concerns. Despite higher costs, proponents argue that the focus on construction expenses overlooks these benefits. The Navy may resume building nuclear-powered surface warships for long distances, citing rising oil prices as a reason. A Navy study in 2006 concluded that nuclear power would add $600-700 million to the cost of a medium-sized warship, with operating costs only slightly higher than oil-powered vessels. Congress may require certain warships to be nuclear-powered in the future or mandate both oil-powered and nuclear-powered versions of planned ships. The Navy's plan to increase its fleet with Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) using modular packages of weapons and equipment is under scrutiny by Congress. The program, which began in FY2005, faced restructuring in FY2007 due to escalating costs, leading to the cancellation of contracts for three ships and a reduction in the number of LCS ships requested in the FY2008 budget. Congress may endorse the Navy's actions, allocate funds for additional ships, or take other measures in the FY2008 defense bills. In FY2008, Congress may endorse the Navy's plan to increase the production rate of Virginia-class submarines to address the shortfall in the sub fleet caused by the retirement of Los Angeles-class subs. Funding for additional ships and components may be added to ensure construction costs are controlled. In FY2008, Congress may endorse the Navy's plan to increase the production rate of Virginia-class submarines to address the shortfall in the sub fleet caused by the retirement of Los Angeles-class subs. Additional funding for an extra sub may be needed in FY2010, with concerns raised about potential budget imbalances if purchased before 2012. Congress may also reject the Administration's proposal to drop development of the General Electric F-136 jet engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Defense Department officials argue that ending the alternate engine program would save $1.8 billion, as improvements in jet engine design make it feasible to rely on a single engine for future fighter planes. However, many Members of Congress are skeptical, citing past reliability issues with single engines. Supporters of dual engines claim competition between manufacturers led to cost savings, but this is disputed. Congress is showing strong support for increasing the fleet of long-range cargo jets, specifically the C-17s, beyond the Defense Department's plans. In response to the Department's review, Congress rejected the retirement of any C-5s and added 10 C-17s to the FY2007 defense funding bills. The Administration's decision to enlarge the Army and Marine Corps may require a larger airlift fleet. The Air Force is seeking $315 million in FY2008 for a new mid-air refueling tanker to replace aging KC-135s, with a contract for 179 planes initially. There is also a debate over the $119 million requested in the FY2008 budget for a new nuclear warhead. The FY2008 national defense budget includes $119 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, aimed at replacing aging warheads without nuclear testing. Supporters argue for its necessity due to maintenance concerns, while critics fear it may lead to resuming nuclear testing. The FY2008 budget includes $175 million for a non-nuclear warhead program for Trident missiles, allowing quick strikes on urgent targets. Critics fear the RRW program may lead to nuclear testing resumption, while supporters argue for its necessity due to maintenance concerns. The $8.9 billion requested in FY2008 for the Missile Defense Agency is under scrutiny due to budget limits. Some skeptics argue that the program may require real-time intelligence and could be misinterpreted by other countries. Members of Congress may try to slow down the program, as done in the previous year. Efforts to reduce funding for technologically challenging missile defense programs like the Airborne Laser and a third anti-missile site in Eastern Europe are being considered by Congress. The proposal to deploy anti-missile interceptors in Poland as a defense against Iran is facing opposition from Russia. Iraq War veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are affected by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's recommendations approved by President George W. Bush. Critics may try to reverse some BRAC decisions, potentially disrupting the base closure process. The process was designed to prevent political interference in saving specific bases. The furor over Walter Reed has sparked public calls for action. Critics may argue for a reevaluation of other parts of the BRAC package due to changes in circumstances since 2005. Impact assistance may be sought by jurisdictions expecting a population influx from closed installations. Members may review weapons acquisition programs for cost and technical issues, aiming to strengthen the government's position with industry. The Navy aims to regain authority over ship design from industry, especially concerning the troubled Littoral Combat Ship program. Members may also question the Army's reliance on private entities like Boeing and SAID for managing the Future Combat System, citing a lack of in-house expertise in the Defense Department. The Defense Department lacks in-house expertise for managing acquisitions, leading to calls for a long-term plan to restore this capability. Congress has completed work on the annual budget resolution, setting ceilings for national defense spending for the next five years. The budget resolution's ceiling on military activities funding may indicate the level of support in each chamber.
