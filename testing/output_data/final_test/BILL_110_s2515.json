    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Skilled Trades Second Responders Act of 2007\" and includes findings. Congress finds that skilled construction workers play a crucial role in disaster response and recovery efforts by providing essential skills and equipment to support first responders and reconstruction activities. Construction craft workers have historically supported first response operations after natural and manmade disasters, but there is a lack of systems in place to mobilize and integrate them effectively. The experience of past disasters highlights the need for a cohesive national, State, and local system to identify, train, certify, register, and integrate skilled craft workers into disaster preparedness and response efforts. Integrate skilled craft workers into disaster preparedness and response activities, providing training in health and safety procedures to assist in rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts. The Second Responder Program in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is amended to include a Second Responder Training and Integration Program. This program aims to integrate skilled craft workers into disaster preparedness and response activities by providing training in health and safety procedures for rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts. The Director of the Institute will establish a national program for training skilled construction workers to assist first responders in disasters. This program includes developing a national plan for integrating construction activities into disaster-response plans and providing training for construction personnel on working with first responders during emergency response activities. The program aims to provide specialized safety, health, and skills training to construction workers for disaster response activities. It also includes establishing community-based registries of skilled workers, maintaining readiness through training and exercises, and developing agreements with industry contractors and labor organizations. The national program aims to provide specialized training for construction workers in disaster response. It involves coordinating with relevant agencies, private organizations, and allocating $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2008. The national program allocates $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for specialized training in disaster response."
