FINDINGS.\" Step 4 - Summarized chunk: \nCongress finds that there are over 600,000 bridges in the US, with many being over 26 years old and in need of maintenance or replacement. $20.2 billion annually is needed to address the deficient bridge backlog by 2030. Current annual bridge investment is approximately $17.1 billion, with eligible funds defined as those authorized or designated in specific surface transportation projects or activities within 60 days. The term \"eligible funds\" includes excess or inactive funds identified by the State within 60 days of enactment, allocated for a demonstration project. Excess funds refer to funds remaining available after completion or cancellation of a specific transportation project. Inactive funds are unobligated Federal funds for a surface transportation project with less than 10% obligated or funds available for a project unlikely to be used, as certified by the State. Availability of funds for bridge projects: Eligible funds certified by the State can be made available for any eligible project under title 23, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to obligate or deobligate funds for such projects upon request by a State. The eligible funds can be reobligated for any project under title 23, United States Code, remaining available for 3 fiscal years. They are subject to title 23 requirements, excluding population-based allocations. The Secretary must submit an annual report to specific committees detailing actions taken under this section, excluding title 23, United States Code requirements."
