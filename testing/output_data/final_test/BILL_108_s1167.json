    "content": "The section discusses boundary conflicts near Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri, defining terms like \"appropriate Secretary,\" \"boundary conflict,\" \"Federal land surveys,\" and \"original land surveys.\" The term \"original land surveys\" refers to surveys conducted by the United States General Land Office in Missouri for issuing land patents. The \"Public Land Survey System\" is the system of surveys for issuing land patents by the Bureau of Land Management. A \"qualifying claimant\" is a property owner in Barry or Stone County, Missouri, with a boundary conflict due to reliance on Federal land surveys. The Secretaries of the Army and Agriculture will work together to resolve boundary conflicts and landownership claims on Federal lands in Barry and Stone Counties, Missouri, caused by subsequent Federal land surveys. They will aim to reestablish the corners of the Public Land Survey System with minimal cost and inconvenience to affected private landowners. Qualifying claimants must inform the appropriate Secretary in writing of any boundary conflicts with Federal land. The notice for boundary conflicts with Federal land in Missouri must include a land survey plat, legal description, and information on ownership claims supported by documentation. The deadline for submitting a notice for relief under this section is within 15 years of the enactment of the Act. The appropriate Secretary has the authority to resolve boundary conflicts with qualifying claimants by conveying land or confirming Federal title. The appropriate Secretary can confirm Federal title to land in cases of boundary conflicts if there are Federal interests at stake. Qualifying claimants must be compensated for the value of overlapping property. The conveyance of land will be without consideration, and the Secretary will cover associated costs. Compensation for qualifying claimants under this section includes reimbursement for survey costs and valuation based on contributory value to adjoining private parcels. Federal improvements to the land are not considered in the valuation process. The appropriate Secretary is responsible for compensation resulting from Federal land surveys. The appropriate Secretary is responsible for compensating qualifying claimants for survey costs and valuation based on contributory value to adjoining private parcels.
