    "content": "The Small Business 503 Loan Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 is cited as the short title. It amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 by adding a new section regarding payment and prepayment of development company debentures. The Small Business 503 Loan Refinancing Assistance Act of 1993 allows borrowers to make payments on debentures at original terms, adjust interest rates, or prepay debentures. Borrowers can request an interest rate adjustment on debentures purchased by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administration. The Federal Financing Bank approves requests for interest rate adjustments on debentures if certain conditions are met, including timely submission, no prior approvals, non-default status of the debenture and borrower's loan, and agreement to adjust the loan's interest rate accordingly. The Federal Financing Bank adjusts the interest rate on debentures based on the current market yield of US obligations plus 4.5%, with a minimum rate of 8% and a maximum of 12%. The rate of interest on a debenture does not impact other terms. Prepayment of a debenture is allowed if conditions are met, with a repurchase premium required. The repurchase premium amount is calculated based on the unpaid principal balance, interest rate of the debenture, and a factor 'P' determined in accordance with a specific table. The applicable percent for prepayment of debentures varies based on the year in which the prepayment is made, ranging from 1.00 to 0.50 over a 10 to 25-year term loan. The prepayment percentages for debentures range from 1.00 to 0.10 over a 6 to 10-year term loan. Requirements for prepayment of debentures include: \n- The debenture must be outstanding and not in default\n- Only non-Federal funds can be used for prepayment\n- Prepayment must occur within 5 years of the enactment of this section\n- The borrower's loan secured by the debenture must be extinguished\nProhibition of additional fees or penalties beyond those specified in this section. The section outlines conditions for adjusting interest rates or prepayment, with definitions for borrower and issuer. The Administrator must issue regulations within 30 days. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended to include a new item at the end.
