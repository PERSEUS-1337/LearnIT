    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Space Act of 2003\". The Congress acknowledges the decline in the commercial space launch market, leading to a decrease in the US global market share and government-licensed launches. They emphasize the importance of reducing costs and improving safety in commercial space transportation to achieve US space goals. Additionally, they prioritize opening outer space to American economic, scientific, and cultural enterprises. The Federal space investments, policy development, and regulatory action should prioritize commercial suborbital human spaceflight vehicles for innovation and competitiveness. Space transportation carries risks, and the focus should be on Federal regulation of the new commercial suborbital human spaceflight industry. The suborbital human spaceflight industry should prioritize safety for the general public and allow involved individuals to accept inherent risks. A 3-year extension of the excess third party claims payment provision is needed to evaluate changes to the commercial space launch indemnification regime. Regulatory guidelines should be established by the Secretary of Transportation to ensure safe and cost-effective commercial space launch operations. The public interest is served by creating clear legal frameworks. The public interest is served by establishing a clear legal and regulatory regime for commercial space transportation. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS. Authorization of Appropriations for Office of Commercial Space Transportation in the United States Code is amended for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Findings in the same section are updated to include human spaceflight and space capabilities. Definitions in the Code are also reorganized. The Code is amended to include definitions related to crew and spaceflight participants for public safety. The Code is amended to include definitions related to crew and spaceflight participants for public safety. A spaceflight participant is an individual not crew carried in a launch or reentry vehicle. A suborbital rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle for flight on a suborbital trajectory with thrust greater than lift for most of its powered flight. A suborbital trajectory is the intentional flight path of a vehicle where the vacuum instantaneous impact point stays on Earth's surface. The Code is amended to include definitions related to crew and spaceflight participants for public safety. A spaceflight participant is an individual not crew carried in a launch or reentry vehicle. The holder of a license under this chapter may launch or reenter a spaceflight participant only if certain training and medical standards are met. The Code is amended to include definitions related to crew and spaceflight participants for public safety. A spaceflight participant must meet specified medical standards, be informed of the vehicle's safety record, and the vehicle must be marked accordingly. Amendments are made to ensure liability coverage for personal injury, death, property damage, or loss sustained by employees. The Secretary of Transportation is tasked with creating a streamlined regulatory framework for commercial human spaceflight, focusing on safety while allowing trained participants to assume risk. A report on progress must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. Additionally, there is an extension of indemnification for commercial space transportation. SEC. 5. Commercial space transportation indemnification extended to December 31, 2007. SEC. 6. Liability regime for commercial space transportation. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the liability risk-sharing regime for commercial space transportation, recommending modifications and analyzing the current regime's adequacy and effectiveness. The study will consider other countries' regimes, the designation of \"ultra hazardous\" for space activities, international treaties, impacts of reusable launch vehicles and spaceports, and the feasibility of airline-like liability regimes. The study will evaluate the current liability regime for commercial space transportation, considering alternative approaches and quantifying impacts where possible. Results must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The Office of Space Commercialization is redesignated as the Office of Space Commerce with authorized appropriations of $1,800,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2005. Additionally, there is a delegation of licensing authority. The Secretary of Commerce delegates licensing authority to the Director of the Office of Space Commerce, including licensing private sector parties for operating remote sensing space systems and serving as the Executive Secretary for the Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board."
