    "content": "Prior to the enactment of PRWORA, there were no overarching rules regarding noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits. PRWORA established default rules for noncitizens' eligibility for federal, state, and local public benefits, creating various categories of aliens and benefits. Congress, states, and localities have enacted measures post-PRWORA that either expand or restrict noncitizens' eligibility for benefits. Numerous measures enacted prior to PRWORA were nullified or modified by PRWORA. The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976 restricted unemployment insurance payments to aliens who were lawful permanent residents, lawfully present for work, or residing in the US under color of law. Noncitizens not meeting these criteria were ineligible for benefits. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 outlined eligibility criteria for individuals aged 65 or older, requiring residency in the US as a citizen or lawful permanent resident for at least five years. Noncitizens eligible for Medicare Part B must have resided continuously in the US for five years prior to enrollment. Other noncitizens were excluded from benefits, except in cases where eligibility was not specified. States sometimes enacted their own regulations regarding noncitizens' eligibility for certain benefits. California's Proposition 187, adopted in 1994, aimed to restrict public benefits for non-U.S. citizens, LPRs, or those lawfully present in the U.S. It barred access to social services, healthcare, and education for unauthorized individuals. Proposition 187 in California aimed to restrict public benefits for non-U.S. citizens, LPRs, or those lawfully present in the U.S. However, many provisions of Proposition 187 were found to be preempted by federal law and not enforced. PRWORA effectively invalidated existing laws governing noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits, making unauthorized aliens ineligible for various state services. The U.S. Department of Education also modified its guidance on federal financial aid eligibility for noncitizens under the Higher Education Act after PRWORA's enactment. PRWORA, enacted in 1996, standardized eligibility for federal, state, and local public benefits for noncitizens by invalidating preexisting measures and establishing uniform taxonomies of aliens and benefits. This legislation also set general rules for when specific aliens are eligible for certain benefits. Under PRWORA, aliens are categorized as qualified or not qualified for specific benefits. Qualified aliens include LPRs, asylees, refugees, parolees, and certain victims of domestic violence. All other aliens, such as those unlawfully present or on nonimmigrant visas, are not qualified. Benefits are classified as federal public, federal means-tested, and state and local public benefits. The PRWORA defines federal and state/local public benefits as grants, contracts, loans, licenses, and various assistance programs provided by government agencies. Federal means-tested public benefits are not explicitly defined, giving federal agencies discretion in designating eligible benefits. The PRWORA grants federal agencies discretion to designate federal means-tested public benefits, including Medicaid, food stamps, SSI, TANF, and SCHIP. State means-tested public benefits are not addressed directly, but affidavits of support by alien sponsors may be enforced by states providing such benefits. PRWORA establishes rules for alien eligibility for specific benefits. Aliens, whether qualified or not, face restrictions on receiving public benefits under PRWORA. Non-qualified aliens are generally ineligible for federal, state, or local public benefits. Qualified aliens are also subject to limitations on SSI, TANF, Medicaid, food stamps, and other means-tested benefits. Certain qualified aliens are barred from receiving federal means-tested benefits for five years after entering the U.S. in a qualified status. Certain qualified aliens may be ineligible for various public benefits unless they have worked 40 qualifying quarters under the Social Security Act and did not receive federal means-tested benefits during that time. The income and resources of the alien's sponsor may be considered until the alien naturalizes or meets the work requirement. States have the authority to determine noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits under PRWORA, with exceptions and limitations. States have the authority to determine the eligibility of qualified aliens for certain public benefits under PRWORA, with restrictions on limitations and income attribution to sponsors. This flexibility has led to varying court interpretations on the uniformity of state actions under PRWORA. PRWORA allows states to determine eligibility for public benefits for qualified aliens, leading to varying court interpretations. Amendments to PRWORA, like IIRIRA, clarify Congress's intent and restrict states from granting in-state tuition to unauthorized aliens. The IIRIRA made amendments to PRWORA, allowing certain victims of domestic violence to be considered qualified aliens for benefits. Congress has also passed legislation separate from PRWORA to make noncitizens eligible for benefits. For example, CHIPRA grants states the option to provide Medicaid and CHIP coverage to lawfully residing children and pregnant women. The phrase \"lawfully residing in the United States\" includes certain aliens not qualified for PRWORA benefits, such as lawful nonimmigrants and those with temporary protected status. The ACA also allows persons who are \"lawfully present\" to participate in certain health care programs. DACA beneficiaries have been deemed ineligible for some benefits. States have enacted measures addressing noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits, some authorized by PRWORA. These measures make aliens eligible for state benefits they would otherwise be denied, while others restrict qualified aliens' eligibility for certain benefits. Some states define public benefits more broadly than PRWORA, seeking to bar unauthorized aliens from receiving them. For example, Farmers Branch, Texas, attempted to classify residential occupancy licenses as \"public benefits\" to prevent renting to unauthorized aliens. Georgia also used a broad definition to restrict access to benefits. States have enacted measures addressing noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits, some authorized by PRWORA. Georgia and Montana have broad definitions of public benefits to restrict access for unauthorized aliens, including adult education, licenses, and state services. Legal issues arise in determining alien eligibility for benefits, such as constitutional rights, federal law preemption, and state or local measures. The legal issues surrounding noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits include questions about equal protection, preemption, and defining what constitutes a benefit. The constitutional guarantee of equal protection applies to all persons in the United States, including aliens, leading to potential legal challenges if aliens are treated differently than citizens in eligibility for public benefits. The level of scrutiny applied by courts in reviewing challenges to such measures often determines their legality. The level of scrutiny applied by courts in reviewing challenges to measures regarding noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits determines their legality. \"Rational basis review\" presumes constitutionality and requires challengers to negate all rational justifications, while \"strict scrutiny\" demands the government to show necessity and narrow tailoring to achieve a compelling interest. Other degrees of scrutiny may apply based on the persons and rights involved. Federal restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits are subject to rational basis review and have generally been upheld. The Supreme Court upheld a law barring LPRs who had not resided in the US for five years from enrolling in Medicare Part B, citing the government's authority to regulate aliens' entry and residence. Congress could have reasonably determined that aliens' ties to the US strengthen over time, impacting their claim to benefits. Lower courts have also upheld similar restrictions under rational basis. Lower courts have upheld PRWORA's restrictions on federal means-tested public benefits for qualified aliens who have not resided in the US for the required period, rejecting arguments for more stringent review. The five-year bar on benefits eligibility for aliens is considered arbitrary but not invalid. State and local measures face a more complex scrutiny in challenges. The level of scrutiny in challenges to state and local measures varies depending on the persons and rights affected. There is no fundamental right to receive public benefits, but measures involving suspect classifications, such as alienage, are subject to heightened scrutiny. State and local measures restricting noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits, especially lawful permanent residents, have been subject to strict scrutiny. In Graham v. Richardson, the Supreme Court struck down laws in Pennsylvania and Arizona that limited state benefits for lawful permanent residents (LPRs), emphasizing that LPRs contribute to economic growth like citizens. However, state measures excluding aliens from political functions are subject to rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. Certain states have enacted measures defining public benefits to include employment with state or local governments, leading to potential lenient review for denials of such employment. Unauthorized aliens are not considered a suspect classification, making state and local measures denying benefits to them subject to more deferential review. However, denying significant benefits to certain unauthorized aliens could face heightened scrutiny. In Plyler v. Doe (1982), the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute denying education to unauthorized alien children, stating that education is of \"supreme importance\" and denying it could lead to a permanent underclass, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. Lower courts have similarly ruled against Proposition 187's denial of public education to unauthorized alien children. Courts have ruled against denying public education to unauthorized alien children, suggesting that state and local measures may receive more deferential review if they align with Congress's standards for treatment of aliens. Questions have arisen regarding whether the PRWORA provides a uniform rule for such measures, potentially subjecting them to rational basis review. Several courts and commentators have noted that legal challenges regarding measures classifying persons based on alienage have mainly been brought by lawful immigrants. There is debate on whether classifications affecting lawful nonimmigrants might be subject to less stringent review. Courts have differing conclusions on whether PRWORA provides a uniform rule for noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits. In the 2004 Soskin v. Reinertson case, the Tenth Circuit suggested that PRWORA does provide a uniform rule. The Tenth Circuit interpreted a state law repealing optional state-funded Medicaid coverage for certain aliens as addressing Congressional concerns about individual aliens burdening the public benefits system. States have limited discretion in determining noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits under PRWORA, with some coverage required and some forbidden. Previous court decisions have upheld state rules terminating certain noncitizens' benefits eligibility as not conflicting with national policies on aliens. The Tenth Circuit upheld a state law repealing Medicaid coverage for certain aliens, citing concerns about individual aliens burdening the public benefits system. Some courts have found that PRWORA does not establish a uniform rule allowing states to classify persons based on alienage for public benefits. New York's highest court applied strict scrutiny in a 2001 case, concluding that PRWORA does not reflect a uniform national policy on aliens' eligibility for benefits. The Aliessa court allows States to extend public benefits to aliens not lawfully present in the US, creating potential wide variation in benefit eligibility based on localized concepts. Maryland's highest court also applied strict scrutiny in a similar case in 2006. The court disagreed with the state's argument that it could provide different benefits to resident alien children and pregnant women based on their arrival date in the US under PRWORA. The court found that PRWORA did not prescribe a uniform rule and questioned the government interests recognized by PRWORA. It also suggested that state measures classifying individuals based on arrival date may not be permissible. Even if PRWORA did not prescribe a uniform rule, state measures classifying persons based on alienage would still be subject to strict scrutiny. The structure of the programs and framing of the issues can significantly impact the outcome in such cases. Some courts have suggested that repealing state programs benefiting qualified aliens not eligible for federal benefits may not be subject to strict scrutiny if the beneficiaries are exclusively aliens and comparable programs for citizens are federal. The Ninth Circuit found that noncitizens challenging the repeal of a Washington law failed to raise an equal protection claim due to lack of similarly situated individuals. Other courts have applied rational basis review in upholding similar measures, especially when distinguishing between classes of aliens. The level of scrutiny applied to state and local measures denying lawful nonimmigrants benefits is questioned, with fewer challenges involving nonimmigrants compared to lawful immigrants. Federal courts have noted a lower level of scrutiny for measures affecting nonimmigrants. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a Louisiana law prohibiting lawful nonimmigrants from taking the state bar exam, applying rational basis review. This decision distinguished a previous case involving lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and emphasized the difference between LPRs and nonimmigrants in terms of political power. The Fifth Circuit upheld a Louisiana law barring lawful nonimmigrants from certain activities, citing their lack of political power compared to citizens and LPRs. This decision was consistent with previous rulings that highlighted the differences in rights and restrictions between nonimmigrants and other immigrant groups. In a 2007 decision, the Sixth Circuit upheld a Tennessee law allowing lawful nonimmigrants to only obtain \"certificates for driving,\" not driver's licenses. They noted that lawful permanent residents are the only subclass of aliens treated as a suspect class and found that strict scrutiny may not apply to measures affecting nonimmigrants. The law was deemed to serve homeland security interests by indicating Tennessee's stance on immigration. The Sixth Circuit upheld a Tennessee law allowing lawful nonimmigrants to obtain \"certificates for driving,\" serving homeland security interests. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit applied strict scrutiny to strike down a New York law restricting pharmacist licenses to U.S. citizens and LPRs. The Second Circuit rejected exceptions to strict scrutiny for measures involving aliens who are not lawful permanent residents (LPRs), noting that lawful nonimmigrants are similar to LPRs in living and working in the US for extended periods. The court disagreed with the reasoning of other circuits and found that the \"transience\" of nonimmigrant aliens does not justify barring them from obtaining pharmacist licenses. The Second Circuit rejected exceptions to strict scrutiny for measures involving nonimmigrant aliens, stating that their transience does not justify barring them from obtaining pharmacist licenses in New York. This decision could have broader implications for noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits in certain states. The Second Circuit's decision on nonimmigrant aliens obtaining pharmacist licenses in New York could impact noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits in certain states. The court suggested that state or local measures denying licenses to federal government-admitted aliens may be preempted by federal law. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes that federal law, treaties, and the Constitution itself are the supreme Law of the Land, preempting state laws inconsistent with NAFTA. State and local measures on noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits can raise preemption questions due to federal power over immigration regulation. Federal statutes may preempt state and local measures in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption. Preemption claims have been raised in response to state and local measures regarding benefits for unauthorized aliens. The Supreme Court distinguished between impermissible regulations of immigration and permissible measures affecting aliens in the 1976 decision in De Canas v. Bica. In De Canas v. Bica, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws targeting the employment of unauthorized aliens are not necessarily regulations of immigration. California's law imposing criminal sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized aliens was upheld as it aligns with federal standards, even if it has indirect effects on immigration. Subsequent decisions have generally followed this precedent. Courts have generally followed De Canas, striking down state and local measures that determine who can be admitted to the country or the conditions for staying. State or local measures denying benefits to noncitizens have been found to be preempted regulations of immigration. For example, California's Proposition 187 restricted noncitizens' eligibility for public services. The court struck down California's Proposition 187, which restricted noncitizens' eligibility for public services, as it created its own scheme for determining who is entitled to be in the United States, regulating immigration by involving the state in determining who may be admitted and remain in the country. Some state and local measures have been found to be preempted for creating their own classifications of aliens and authorizing officials to determine aliens' status. There is debate over whether denying benefits to noncitizens constitutes immigration regulation, with some courts suggesting it effectively excludes aliens from certain jurisdictions. Some courts argue that denying benefits to noncitizens may impact immigration indirectly, while others believe it can significantly affect their ability to access housing. Local ordinances using federal immigration classifications for unauthorized purposes have been challenged in court. Measures not directly regulating immigration can still be challenged for being preempted by federal statutes. The outcome of such cases can vary. The outcome of cases where state or local measures are challenged for being preempted by federal statutes can vary. For example, provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding unauthorized aliens' eligibility for public benefits and workers' compensation have generally not been preempted. Similarly, measures related to alien harboring and nonimmigrant visas have not been seen as preempting state and local benefits for unauthorized aliens. Some courts have debated whether the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) preempts state measures on unauthorized aliens' eligibility for benefits, with conflicting views on whether PRWORA occupies the regulatory field in this area. The law includes national policy statements on denying benefits to illegal immigrants, covering benefits at all levels of government. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) addresses national policy on denying benefits to illegal immigrants and defines rules for immigrant eligibility for federal, state, and local benefits. It also outlines state legislative options in this area and establishes a system for verifying immigration status for benefit eligibility. Some courts have debated whether PRWORA preempts state measures on unauthorized aliens' benefit eligibility, with conflicting views on its regulatory scope. PWRORA allows states to provide benefits to unauthorized aliens without limits set by Congress, preventing implied preemption. Courts reject preemption arguments based on conflicting with congressional policy. Interpreting what constitutes a benefit raises statutory and administrative law issues. Courts often interpret statutes regarding noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits by looking at the plain meaning of the text or consulting legislative history. They may also consider agency interpretations of the statute and determine the level of deference to give. Courts grant deference to agency interpretations of statutes regarding noncitizens' eligibility for public benefits. Three key questions arise: what constitutes a public benefit under PRWORA, how states can provide benefits to unauthorized aliens, and what qualifies as a federal means-tested public benefit. These questions are central to the discussion on noncitizens' access to public benefits. PRWORA encompasses various types of government assistance, including grants, contracts, loans, licenses, and benefits like welfare, health, housing, education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. The term \"other similar benefit[s]\" raises questions about what constitutes federal, state, or local public benefits under PRWORA. Some argue for a narrow interpretation, limiting it to cash payments. Some argue for a narrow interpretation of PRWORA, limiting it to cash payments directly to aliens. Courts have generally viewed \"other similar benefit[s]\" as services assisting those in economic hardship, potentially incentivizing illegal immigration. In County of Alameda v. Agustin, the court rejected the argument that child support services and court-ordered payments were state benefits ineligible for unauthorized aliens without specific state laws. The court in County of Alameda v. Agustin concluded that child support payments were permissible for noncitizens under PRWORA, as they were made from private funds. PRWORA aims to reduce incentives for illegal immigration by denying publicly financed benefits to unauthorized aliens. The court distinguished child support services from the benefits listed in PRWORA as direct income support or services for disadvantaged individuals. The court determined that child support services are not considered state and local public benefits under PRWORA because they do not foster dependence on public support and aim to help recipients support themselves. These services do not provide ongoing public assistance and do not incentivize illegal immigration. Additionally, child support collection services are cost-effective and return more funds to the local agency than they cost. Other state courts have made similar decisions regarding workers' compensation and benefits for victims of hit-and-run accidents. Certain benefits such as compensating victims of hit-and-run accidents, enrollment at public higher education institutions, residential occupancy licenses, prevailing wages, and death benefits under federal employees' group life insurance policies are not considered public benefits under PRWORA. However, in-state tuition and certain health programs have been deemed as public benefits by some state courts. Questions have also been raised regarding the provision of professional licenses to unauthorized aliens by government agencies or with appropriated funds. PRWORA generally prohibits unauthorized aliens from obtaining law licenses unless state legislatures have specific statutes allowing it. State high courts, considered state agencies, regulate bar admission and rely on appropriated funds. There is debate over whether state courts are truly state agencies and whether bar applicants pay fees for their licenses. The decision on this issue remains uncertain, as well as the broader interpretation of benefits provided by government agencies or appropriated funds under PRWORA. Some have questioned what it means to affirmatively provide for unauthorized aliens' eligibility for benefits under PRWORA. There is debate over whether states must expressly reference Section 411(d) of PRWORA and specify that unauthorized aliens will be eligible. The conference report accompanying PRWORA suggests that a law must be enacted by a legislature and signed by the Governor to meet the requirements of this section. However, PRWORA itself does not mandate specific references to Section 411 or unauthorized aliens. Courts have found that PRWORA does not require states to reference specific provisions of federal law when making unauthorized aliens eligible for public benefits. One court suggested that a state must specify that its beneficiaries may include undocumented aliens to affirmatively provide for their eligibility. Courts have found that PRWORA does not require states to specify that beneficiaries may include undocumented aliens to affirmatively provide for their eligibility. State legislatures can delegate authority to determine eligibility for benefits to administrative agencies or local governments. Some courts believe they can grant benefits to unauthorized aliens within their power, but questions remain about the level of deference to be given. Some have questioned the deference given to federal agency determinations on means-tested public benefits. PRWORA does not define these benefits but excludes some from the general bar for qualified aliens. Executive agencies define federal means-tested public benefits as SSI, TANF, Medicaid, food stamps, and SCHIP. The definition of federal means-tested public benefits, including cash, medical, housing, and food assistance, was removed from the bill due to procedural rules. The excluded benefits for qualified aliens are SSI, TANF, Medicaid, food stamps, and SCHIP. The conference report accompanying the language ultimately enacted as PRWORA intended federal means-tested public benefits to be construed in line with the bill's definition. After PRWORA's enactment, regulations were proposed by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development, which were deemed reasonable by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. OLC found that the statutory text is ambiguous, and the agency's construction is reasonable. Several aspects of the text and legislative history of PRWORA could potentially support a broader interpretation of 'federal means-tested public benefit.' However, OLC cited Congress's decision not to include discretionary spending programs in the definition. It also referenced the well-settled canon of interpretation that where language is deleted from an earlier draft, it may be presumed inconsistent with congressional intentions. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) found that the definition of federal means-tested public benefits was not included in the PRWORA legislation. Individual agencies then identified specific mandatory spending programs as providing these benefits. No court has addressed the permissibility of these agency interpretations, but legal barriers could arise for parties seeking a broader or narrower application of the term in court. The PRWORA legislation does not define the term \"federal means-tested public benefits,\" leaving it to agencies to interpret through rulemaking. Courts typically defer to agency interpretations when Congress has not addressed the issue directly. However, agencies could interpret the phrase differently in the future. Noncitizen eligibility for public benefits raises complex legal issues due to federal, state, and local statutes, as well as questions of constitutional, statutory, and administrative law. Noncitizen eligibility for public benefits raises complex legal issues involving constitutional law, statutory interpretation, and administrative law. Congress is considering changes to noncitizens' eligibility, leading to litigation in different jurisdictions with varying conclusions on related issues."
