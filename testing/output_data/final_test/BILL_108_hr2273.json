    "content": "The Act titled \"Unsafe Meat and Poultry Recall Act\" authorizes mandatory recalls for adulterated, misbranded, and unsafe meat products under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The term 'meat product' is defined as carcass, meat, or meat food product of certain animals. Notification to the Secretary is required if a meat product is believed to be adulterated or misbranded, with exceptions for household consumers. If the Secretary determines that a meat product is adulterated or poses a threat to public health, appropriate persons involved in handling the product must cease distribution, notify others in the supply chain, and recall the product. If a person refuses to take required actions for a recalled meat product, the Secretary can order them to stop distribution, notify others in the supply chain, and recall the product immediately. Whenever the Secretary orders a mandatory action for a recalled meat product, consumers must be notified, and distribution of the product must cease immediately. If the Secretary determines that there are not adequate grounds for the mandatory actions, the order will be vacated after a hearing. The Secretary will vacate the order if issued under subsection (d). Additional remedies provided in this section are in addition to any other available remedies. The definition of 'person' is expanded to include individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, or other business units in the Federal Meat Inspection Act. SEC. 3. RECALL AUTHORITY OVER POULTRY AND POULTRY FOOD PRODUCTS. Amends the Poultry Products Inspection Act to include a new section on notification, nondistribution, and recall of adulterated, misbranded, and other unsafe poultry products. The Poultry Products Inspection Act requires immediate notification to the Secretary if a person believes a poultry product is adulterated or misbranded. Household consumers are exempt from this requirement. The Secretary may also issue voluntary nondistribution and recall orders for unsafe poultry products. If the Secretary determines that a poultry product may pose a threat to public health, appropriate persons involved in handling the product must take actions such as ceasing distribution, notifying others in the supply chain, recalling the product, and informing consumers. Refusal to comply with these actions is not allowed. If a person refuses to take required actions for a poultry product, the Secretary can order them to stop distribution, notify others in the supply chain to do the same, and recall the product. Consumers must also be informed in such cases. The Secretary can order a person to cease distribution of a poultry product if they refuse to take required actions. If grounds are found inadequate after a hearing, the order can be vacated. Additional remedies may also be available."
