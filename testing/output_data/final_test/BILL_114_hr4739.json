    "content": "The Act titled \"Greater Sage Grouse Protection and Recovery Act of 2016\" aims to protect and recover the Greater Sage Grouse species. The Act defines key terms such as Federal resource management plan, Greater Sage Grouse, and State management plan. The section outlines the purpose of State-approved plans for the protection and recovery of the Greater Sage Grouse, aiming to demonstrate their effectiveness over multiple life cycles. It also delays any Endangered Species Act findings for states with such plans until September 30, 2026. The delay imposed by paragraph (1) is effective without regard to any other laws or provisions. The conservation status of the Greater Sage Grouse remains not warranted for listing under the Endangered Species Act until September 30, 2026. Coordination between State and Federal resource management plans is emphasized to foster effectiveness. The Governor of a State with a management plan can restrict the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture from making changes to Federal resource management plans affecting the Greater Sage Grouse for at least five years upon notification. This provision has retroactive effect and aims to enhance coordination between State and Federal plans. If a withdrawal, amendment, or modification of a Federal resource management plan affecting the Greater Sage Grouse was made in the past three years, the State management plan takes precedence over the Federal plan. The Federal plan in effect before the changes will apply to the management of the Greater Sage Grouse and its habitat, as long as it aligns with the State plan. The State management plan takes precedence over Federal resource management plans for the Greater Sage Grouse. Disagreements on plan consistency are resolved by the Governor. Major Federal actions consistent with State plans are not affected by NEPA findings. Reporting requirements are mandated annually. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture must report annually on the status of Greater Sage Grouse on Federal lands. Judicial review is not allowed for the implementation of this section."
