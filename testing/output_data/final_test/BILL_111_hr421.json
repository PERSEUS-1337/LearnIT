The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 defines troubled assets as residential mortgages in pre-foreclosure, with missed payments, or in forbearance, and other financial instruments determined by the Secretary after consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve can purchase assets to promote financial market stability with approval from Congress. A \"rehabilitated mortgage\" is a modified mortgage with lower monthly payments based on the borrower's income. The term 'independent appraiser' refers to a licensed person in the state where they practice, disclosed to the borrower or buyer, and not influenced by any parties involved in the transaction. SEC. 3. LIMIT ON AUTHORITY TO WRITE OFF LOSSES. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to authorize the establishment of the Troubled Asset Restoration and Assistance Program (TARAP) by the Secretary of the Treasury. Through TARAP, the Treasury can purchase lender or servicer losses on rehabilitated mortgages, paying up to 80 percent of the difference between the original asset and the rehabilitated asset under certain conditions. The difference between the original asset and the rehabilitated asset may be written off as a loss to the lender or servicer. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES. Section 101(c) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to include new paragraphs authorizing the issuance of regulations and guidelines to define terms, determine asset values, and operate the program. The Secretary is also authorized to make rules regarding documented best efforts. The Secretary is authorized to make rules regarding documented best efforts, required timelines, and other processes and procedures. SEC. 5. ELIGIBLE ASSET. Section 101 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is amended to include new subsections regarding eligible assets for TARAP, focusing on primary residences that are troubled assets or have been rehabilitated by the lender after October 3, 2008. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARAP) outlines eligibility criteria for assets, including the requirement that assets valued over 150% of fair market value are not eligible unless a reduction is agreed upon. Lenders or servicers must adhere to disclosure requirements and use independent appraisers as per program guidelines. The TARAP program guidelines allow for up to 80% payment for asset rehabilitation, require efforts to create affordable debt ratios, and provide mechanisms for assets that cannot be rehabilitated. The program authority ends by December 31, 2009. DEFERRAL OF ALL FORECLOSURES ON ANY PRINCIPAL DWELLING OF A CONSUMER FOR A 90-DAY PERIOD. After the enactment of this Act, no creditor, servicer, or holder of a mortgage can initiate or continue foreclosure actions on a consumer's eligible mortgage for a 90-day period. Consumers have the right to defer any foreclosure actions during this time. Consumers have the right to defer any foreclosure actions, including sales, on their eligible mortgage for a 90-day period after the enactment of this Act. They can defend against foreclosure or take legal action to ensure compliance with this right. No provision in this section affects the consumer's obligations. The term \"eligible mortgage\" refers to a first lien residential mortgage on the consumer's principal residence, with no impact on the consumer's obligations despite any foreclosure deferral."
