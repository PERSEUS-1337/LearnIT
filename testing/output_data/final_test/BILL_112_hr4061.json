    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Student Right to Know Before You Go Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the choice of investing in higher education or job retraining programs in the United States leads to varying outcomes based on the program of study, institution selected, and level of education attained. Individuals with an associate degree earn $1,500,000 over a lifetime, while those with a high school diploma earn $1,300,000, and those with a baccalaureate degree earn $2,300,000. However, 28.2 percent of associate degree holders earn more than the median salary of baccalaureate degree holders. The earnings and employment prospects linked to specific education programs determine an individual's income. Workers with a baccalaureate degree earn significantly more over their lifetime compared to those without a degree. The cost of college has increased by 439 percent from 1982 to 2007. In 2010, college graduates left with over $25,000 in debt, double from 15 years ago. Student debt in the US surpassed credit card debt in 2011, reaching nearly $1 trillion. 84% of undergraduates had at least 1 credit card in 2008, with average debt of $4,100. Recent research shows that over half of student loan borrowers face financial difficulties within 5 years of leaving school. Access to transparent information about the costs and benefits of higher education is crucial. Despite increasing college enrollment, graduation rates have not significantly improved. Unemployment among young adults remains high. (9) Certain degrees offer higher employment potential and starting salaries for young adults. The outcomes vary across different institutions of higher education. (10) Collaboration among states, colleges, and stakeholders is needed to provide transparent information on college costs, financial aid, earnings, and post-graduation employment rates. Stakeholders need to collaborate to make data points available to students, parents, and taxpayers in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner. This collaboration will provide a more comprehensive statistical overview of higher education in the US, increase accountability, and efficiency. A state-based reporting system is necessary to ensure informed decision-making for students, parents, taxpayers, and policymakers, maximizing their return on investment and bringing transparency to higher education. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"administering entity\" refers to a State, multi-State compact, or a data system operated by the Department of Education. The term \"educational institution\" includes institutions of higher education and schools offering postsecondary education programs. The term \"Secretary\" in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 4. Participation in statewide individual-level integrated postsecondary education data systems. Amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965 requires institutions to fully participate in a state-administered postsecondary education data system or an alternative system if none exists in the state. The Higher Education Act of 1965 amendment mandates institutions to participate in a certified data system operated by another entity, effective one year after enactment. SEC. 5. STATEWIDE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEMS. Statewide Employment and Learning Exchanges: The Secretary will certify integrated postsecondary education data systems upon request by an administering entity, ensuring compliance with requirements for Higher Education Act purposes. Before certifying an individual-level integrated postsecondary education data system that includes data from a Federal education and training program, the Secretary must consult with the head of the Federal agency responsible for administering the program. The system must be compatible with IPEDS and have the ability to submit data without disclosing personally identifiable information. The system for integrated postsecondary data collection must submit data to the Secretary in a timely manner without disclosing personally identifiable information. It includes data from educational institutions and may also include data from other Federal education and training programs. Subtitle C of Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, educational assistance and training programs under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, programs under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, and training, education, and educational assistance programs of the Department of Defense are included in the integrated postsecondary data collection system. The integrated postsecondary data collection system, established 5 years after the enactment of this Act, will use a unique identifier system to protect individual privacy and include specific data and information. The integrated postsecondary data collection system will gather data on student reporting, remedial enrollment rates, credit accumulation, and postsecondary completion. Additional information may be required by the Secretary for alignment purposes. The integrated postsecondary data collection system will include a data audit and governance system to ensure data quality, validity, and individual privacy compliance with Federal and State standards. The system will not disclose any personally identifiable information. The integrated postsecondary education data system ensures compliance with privacy laws and has a policy on data use by other entities. The administering entity must coordinate with an overseeing agency to be certified. The integrated postsecondary education data system coordinates with an overseeing agency to match data with administrative wage and earnings data, creating an interoperable employment and learning exchange. This system provides data on average individual annual earnings disaggregated by educational program, degree received, educational institution, employment sector, and State. Technical assistance grants are awarded to educational institutions to support this initiative. Grants are provided to educational institutions and administering entities to assist with compliance costs related to postsecondary education data systems. Applications for these grants must be submitted to the Secretary. Applicants for grants related to postsecondary education data systems must submit an application to the Secretary as per the specified requirements. Transition plan for postsecondary education data systems grants. The Secretary shall ensure no duplication of reporting for educational institutions, allow consolidation of reporting requirements, and establish safeguards for integrated postsecondary education data systems. The Secretary will provide a transition plan within 3 months of the Act's enactment, outlining new compliance options for reporting requirements under the Higher Education Act. The plan will detail transition requirements and implementation timelines."
