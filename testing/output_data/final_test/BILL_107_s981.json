The Secretary will provide grants to States for emergency assistance programs to help eligible households purchase gasoline. States will receive allotments based on funds appropriated for the fiscal year. States must submit applications for the program. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State must submit an application to the Secretary containing information on the designated State agency and the emergency assistance program. Eligible households will receive assistance to purchase gasoline. To be eligible for a payment under this Act, a household must submit an application to the State with specific information, including proof of driving distance and previous assistance received under a State program.

To be eligible for a payment under this Act, a household must submit an application to the State with specific information. The State may not exclude a household from eligibility based solely on income less than 110 percent of the poverty level. Priority may be given to households with high gasoline costs in relation to income. SEC. 8. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines a grade of gasoline for price determinations, a method for calculating average prices, and calculates the average per gallon price as part of program requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, calculates trigger and release prices for each State based on the average per gallon price of gasoline. Monthly price calculations are also done to determine payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines if a State should provide payments based on the average per gallon price of gasoline, with conditions for exceeding or falling below trigger and release prices. The State uses funds from grants to make payments to eligible households for up to 3 months, with the amount determined by the State. The State administers payments to eligible households, ranging from $25 to $75 per month based on household income. Up to 10% of funds can be used for administrative costs. Definitions include \"covered grade,\" \"release price,\" and \"trigger price.\" The Act specifies that payments provided under it will not be counted as income or resources for other federal programs or the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, these payments will not be considered as TANF assistance under the Social Security Act, and the period of receiving these payments will not count towards the 60-month limit. SEC. 10 amends Section 404(d) of the Social Security Act to allow states to use funds from grants for a Low-Income Gasoline Assistance Program. SEC. 11 grants discretionary activities to the Secretary. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can reserve up to 5% of funds for administering the Act and increasing grants to States in emergency gasoline price situations. $500,000,000 is authorized annually for the Act's implementation."
