The section defines key terms related to the Veterans Medicare Subvention Demonstration Project, including \"medicare-eligible veteran,\" \"veteran,\" and \"Veteran Integrated Service Network.\" The Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration project for VA reimbursement from the Medicare program for healthcare. The Secretaries will conduct a demonstration project for VA reimbursement from the Medicare program for healthcare services provided to medicare-eligible veterans through a managed care plan in up to three Veteran Integrated Service Networks for a three-year period starting in 1997. The project may expand to include fee-for-service arrangements. The Secretaries will conduct a demonstration project for VA reimbursement from the Medicare program for healthcare services provided to medicare-eligible veterans through a managed care plan. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make monthly payments to the Department of Veterans Affairs from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for each medicare-eligible veteran enrolled in the managed care plan. The Secretaries establish a minimum enrollment number for medicare-eligible veterans to enroll in a managed care plan under the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The amount determined is 93 percent of the average adjusted per capita cost for the year. Before the Department of Veterans Affairs can receive payment for the demonstration project, a maximum number of medicare-eligible veterans must be established. The Secretaries will determine baseline costs and enrollment numbers to ensure equivalent expenditures for these veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs will establish a managed health-care plan for medicare-eligible veterans participating in a demonstration project. The plan will provide health care through VA facilities or groups. The Department of Veterans Affairs will establish a managed health-care plan for medicare-eligible veterans, providing health services through VA facilities or other entities. The plan will adhere to standards set by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The enrollment fee for medicare-eligible veterans will be waived, and payments will be treated accordingly. The payments received under subsection (e) for care provided to veterans will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation to cover the costs of care. Reporting requirements include submitting a report to Congress on the number of medicare-eligible veterans opting for the demonstration project instead of other health insurance plans.

Adjustments to the project may be made based on the review findings. The Secretaries will adjust the demonstration project annually to align cost targets with actual spending.
