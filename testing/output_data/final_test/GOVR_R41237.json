    "content": "The United States has been striving for operational control of its borders for the past 85 years, with the founding of the U.S. Border Patrol in 1924 marking the official beginning of these efforts. Border agencies have developed strategies to prevent activities that violate U.S. laws on cross-border activities, rooted in traditional enforcement activities and deterrence-based principles. Efforts to gain control of the border began with the interception of illegal immigrants and contraband. The strategy evolved over 50 years but maintained the core principle of preventing illegal entry and apprehending those who crossed illegally. In the 1980s, there was a shift towards reducing drug smuggling across the border, leading to an increased focus on gaining operational control to interdict illicit activity. In the 1990s, border agencies shifted towards deterrence in addition to interdiction, deploying more resources to monitor and engage suspected violators. A 1993 study highlighted the overwhelming challenges on the Southwest border, recommending a focus on preventing illegal entry rather than just arresting immigrants. In 1994, the USBP implemented its first National Strategic Plan (NSP) to gain control of the borders by focusing resources on areas with the highest illegal entry. The NSP aimed to deter illegal entry by placing agents and resources directly on the border, rather than just arresting immigrants after entry. The Prevention Through Deterrence policy was part of a broader Comprehensive Border Control Strategy to combat unauthorized immigration. It emphasized deterrence at the borders, alien smuggling, and visa overstays. Congress directed the INS to hire new agents and reallocate USBP agents to front-line duty at the border. Following a series of terrorist attacks in the 1990s, Congress created three commissions to understand the terrorist threat: the Gilmore, Bremer, and Hart-Rudman Commissions. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a biometric entry-exit screening system for national security. The 9/11 Commission recommended consolidating various border screening systems with US-VISIT to streamline inspections and improve security. Legislation post-9/11 focused on airline, visa, and maritime security, leading to Acts like the USA PATRIOT Act and Enhanced Border Security Act requiring biometric identifiers in travel documents. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 merged various enforcement functions to form the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security within the Department of Homeland Security. This included the creation of the DHS and legislation to combat national security challenges. The Administration further subdivided border enforcement functions, consolidating them within CBP. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 merged enforcement functions to form the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security within the Department of Homeland Security, consolidating agencies for enhanced border security. Four main federal agencies now secure the US borders: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, United States Coast Guard, and Transportation Security Administration. Border protection has evolved in response to emerging threats to the border, with policymakers reassessing existing approaches. Scholars propose a conceptualization illustrating different levels of protection based on the interaction of border threats and deployment of resources. As threat levels increase, the desired level of protection also rises, requiring increased deployment of border protection resources. To achieve higher protection, government must increase deployment of border protection resources. \"Border control\" guards against illegal entry, while \"border safety\" protects against mid-range threats like violence and smuggling. \"Border security\" thwarts terrorism. A flexible border structure can adjust to threats for necessary protection. Congressional policymakers face challenges in determining security functions needed as threats grow. Homeland security functions may overlap into border security. Some policymakers propose National Guard presence along the Southwest border for increased protection. Government expenditures rise with higher protection levels, requiring more investments in technology and manpower. Deploying resources for border protection must consider opportunity costs and risks of reallocating resources to other activities. The potential tradeoff in market efficiency and economic impact of increased security levels at the U.S. border must be considered by policymakers when balancing security and commercial interests. Critics and advocates of border protection policy have various competing alternatives for effectively protecting the border. Some call for more enforcement and stricter admission criteria, while others seek to lessen these measures. Some individuals advocate for stricter border enforcement, while others aim to reduce restrictions on cross-border activity. The competing visions of U.S. border policy can be categorized into a unilateral security model and an interdependence model. These models serve as guides for understanding border security policy and its relationship to interior activities and foreign affairs. The fortress vision of border security focuses on protecting the population by establishing a secure perimeter with barriers and patrols. This approach historically involved fortifying cities or communities to ward off outside threats. In contemporary application along the U.S. border, this metaphor suggests a patrolled perimeter barrier. The fortress vision of border security involves a patrolled perimeter barrier to protect against threats like terrorism and drug-trafficking. Ports of entry serve as access points where CBP officers control admission. Critics argue that fortifications create negative perceptions of the United States. Critics of the fortress model argue that it fosters ill will, criminal industries, and division within communities. They believe it goes against American values and undermines border protection legitimacy. Supporters claim that an interdependent approach introduces vulnerabilities and allows for spillover of activities near the border. Critics argue that the fortress model for border protection is flawed as it is based on a non-interdependent world view and rigid elements like border fencing. They suggest a more suitable model would be the metaphor of a complex organism with multiple systems working together for survival. The systems of a complex organism are interdependent and flexible, allowing for communication and compensation between them. This model emphasizes the dynamic interdependence of parts for survival and adaptation to changes or trauma. The complex organism paradigm highlights the dynamic nature of border threats, emphasizing the need for overlapping systems to expel undesirable elements while facilitating the movement of desirable ones. Critics may argue about its security compared to a fortress-based approach. Some argue that a complex organism approach to border security may be more effective in the long run. This paradigm recognizes the interconnectedness of border systems and the need for balance within the entire system. By distributing risk throughout the organism, security can be enhanced through overlaps and backups. Addressing the supply and demand for legal and illegal border crossings through non-enforcement channels can also reduce pressure on border protection mechanisms. The complex organism paradigm for border security emphasizes cooperation and extending protection into neighboring countries to create a buffer region. This approach aims to improve relations, increase economic activity, and promote civil society growth in border regions. Unilateral border protection methods involve using military or police forces without considering neighboring countries, leading to fortified borders and increased tensions. Cooperation in border security is essential for building trust and stability, as it benefits both states by neutralizing dangers and reducing conflicts. However, cooperation may also have potential shortcomings. Cooperation in border security has potential drawbacks, as the reliance on each other for security is based on trust. If the relationship deteriorates, countries could be exposed to threats without unilateral actions. Achieving cooperation may be challenging due to lack of mutual interests, enforcement capabilities, or uncertainty on implementation. The most successful border protection strategy would likely involve numerous cooperative arrangements based on mutual economic and security interests, along with unilateral safeguards. The U.S. border protection framework already incorporates elements of a complex organism model, such as multiagency teams sharing information. However, there is a tendency towards unilateral and static tactics, which may be effective in pockets but a more comprehensive and dynamic approach is likely to be the most effective in the long run. A comprehensive and dynamic approach to border threats is necessary for effective protection. Policymakers often focus on reinforcing the physical perimeter of the United States, assuming threats primarily come from the exterior. However, visa overstays and internal networks also pose significant risks. The focus on reinforcing the physical perimeter of the United States against external threats overlooks the risks posed by visa overstays and internal networks of criminals. Geo-focused enforcement efforts may not effectively deter illegal behaviors, as barriers for legal travelers can be exploited by criminals. The appeal of concentrating resources at the border for addressing illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and terrorism persists, despite problematic assumptions. Focusing enforcement efforts at the border is a low-cost/high-yield approach compared to interior or abroad. Interior enforcement is costly due to the large area and potential disruption to businesses. Abroad, lack of compliance, untrustworthy information, and security strategy variations create security gaps. Geographically focusing on the border yields the lowest security risk without needing neighbor cooperation. The border serves as the central policy focus in efforts to address externally generated threats to homeland security. Border officials and Congress have developed a comprehensive strategy to achieve an advantage over border violators. The border officials and Congress have developed a comprehensive strategy to address threats from border violators. The current framework consists of a QHSR underpinning supported by agency-specific strategic elements. Strategic plans focus on layered security, expanded zone of security, and domain awareness for border protection. The current framework for border protection, outlined by border officials, includes lessons learned from historical responses to threats. The HSQR defines the mission as securing and managing U.S. borders, with goals to control air, land, and sea borders, safeguard trade and travel, and disrupt criminal organizations. The framework aims to create a control point for the flow of people across the border, damming violations while allowing legal traffic. The border protection framework aims to control illegal border incursions while facilitating legal traffic. Interior frameworks also focus on enforcement policies to combat unauthorized immigration, such as \"attrition through enforcement\" tactics. Unauthorized aliens face difficulties in finding employment, receiving benefits, and sustaining themselves in the US. Policymakers aim to reduce unauthorized migration by implementing enforcement-based strategies at the border and in the interior. DHS publications outline various strategic elements for border protection, with commonalities across different strategies. The strategic elements for border protection agencies include organizational and operational aspects such as policy direction, coordination, and deployment of layered security. These elements aim to improve management, achieve goals, and form the general border protection framework. The strategic elements for border protection agencies involve deploying layered security, maximizing domain awareness, and expanding security zones through cooperation. These elements interact with the goals of prevention, facilitation, and criminal dismantlement, forming interconnected pillars and cross-functional streams. Technological advancements play a crucial role in achieving these goals. The DHS leadership plays a central role in achieving border protection goals through strategic elements that extend outward. Policy dilemmas arise in decision-making regarding priorities, risks, and opportunity costs. The dilemmas of formulating a border protection policy include the law of diminishing returns, heightened goal conflict, and the opportunistic nature of border incursions. These challenges are not unique to the current framework but are inherent in any border protection strategy. Border violators seek to use successful targets and methods with high impact and success rates to reduce cost and risk. Frustrating these goals may lead them to abandon the operation, posing dilemmas for border agencies. These challenges are fundamental in border protection debates and efforts to develop a comprehensive approach. The organizational elements of border protection lie outside the scope of this discussion. The remaining three geographically oriented strategic elements, layered security, expanded zone of security, and domain awareness, have received significant attention and resources from Congress. Layered security, in particular, has been a visible aspect of post-September 11 border protection efforts. Layered security aims to maximize apprehension probability of law violators by identifying vulnerabilities and creating interdependent redundancies. Supporters advocate for visible, proactive tactics while opponents prefer subtle approaches. This approach raises risks and costs for law violators. Layered security aims to maximize apprehension probability of law violators by creating interdependent redundancies. Each tactic has a certain probability of apprehending violators, reducing the overall probability of unauthorized border crossings. The deployment of multiple security layers raises risks and costs for law violators, serving both interception and deterrence functions. The concept of layered security involves multiple security layers that work together to reduce the probability of successful intrusion. Cooperation between different monitoring zones along the border enhances domestic security by increasing protection and mutual gains. Unilateral monitoring mechanisms can be divided into three zones within the United States, creating an integrated system for border security. The border security system consists of different monitoring zones - identification, reaction, and border buttress. The focus is on outside threats, with detection systems placed close to the border for quick response. In a cooperative model, the zones are reversed, with the reaction zone at the border and identification zones further away. In a cooperative border security approach, the system is bidirectional, detecting threats from both abroad and within the United States and its neighboring countries. Each country has its own monitoring zones mirroring those of the United States, allowing for coordinated detection and response to potential threats. The United States also maintains a reaction zone at the border as an added layer of protection. The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) is a multiyear plan launched in November 2005 by the DHS to secure America's borders through infrastructure, technology, and manpower. It constitutes a more unilateral approach to border protection, focusing on defense-inspired fortifications to respond to external threats. The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) involves fortifications along the border to address incoming threats from outside the United States. It includes manpower, infrastructure, and technology as layers of security, with the SBI Program Office responsible for constructing fencing and deploying technology like the \"virtual fence.\" Operational control of the border under SBI would involve barriers, detection equipment, and manpower based on risk assessments. The deployment of components under the Secure Border Initiative (SBI) is based on risk assessments for gaining operational control. SBI raises costs of illicit crossings, creating delays that increase the probability of interdiction. Barriers force law violators to adjust behaviors by diverting traffic to remote locations or ports of entry, funneling border activity to areas with higher interdiction probabilities. The border security strategy involves funneling border activity to areas with higher interdiction probabilities, reinforcing security layers at ports of entry and setting up interior checkpoints in targeted traffic zones. This merging of legal and illegal transportation channels allows border agencies to focus on screening individuals attempting to evade inspections. The concept of expanding the border involves pushing information-gathering and traffic control abilities away from the geographic border. The border security strategy involves extending border control measures beyond the geographic border, such as issuing visas at consulates abroad and sharing law enforcement information internationally. These efforts create a buffer zone for identifying traffic bound for the United States, enhancing threat detection and facilitating legal traffic flows through bilateral or multilateral agreements with foreign governments. The expansion of border control measures involves extending enforcement activities into the interior of the United States through agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, and USCG. The centralized leadership of DHS aims to enhance border security through information sharing and cooperation to address border threats. Numerous border expansion initiatives and partnerships have been pursued at federal, state and local, international, and community levels to enhance border enforcement efforts. Interagency partnerships have facilitated seamless integration of border enforcement with interior enforcement, drawing on resources of non-border specific entities. In response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress initiated rebuilding relationships and authorities between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The 9/11 Commission recommended greater information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies to prevent future attacks. This led to the creation of partnerships at the federal level for border protection, focusing on enforcement and intelligence. The federal partnerships for border protection focus on enforcement and intelligence, with initiatives like the Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BEST) involving multiple agencies to disrupt criminal organizations threatening border security. Partners include ICE, CBP, DEA, ATF, FBI, USCG, U.S. Attorneys Offices, state and local law enforcement, Mexican law enforcement, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Canadian Border Services Agency. The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) was established in 1974 to collect and disseminate information on drug, alien, and weapon smuggling, expanding to include counterterrorism post-9/11. Jointly operated by the DEA and CBP, EPIC is a multi-agency tactical intelligence center with online query capabilities from 33 federal databases. It operates 24/7 to provide timely intelligence to field enforcement entities. Federal partnerships like BEST and EPIC aim to enhance intelligence sharing and overcome pre-9/11 blockages. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for deputization of state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law, expanding border enforcement. Federal laws enacted in 1996 provide state and local law enforcement authority to assist federal officers in immigration law enforcement. The DHS collaborates with state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce immigration laws through initiatives like the Criminal Alien Program established in 1991. State and local entities can enter into agreements with ICE to enforce immigration law under INA \u00a7287. The DHS collaborates with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify criminal aliens during their incarceration, allowing for their removal while in custody. This partnership has faced controversy for potentially diverting resources from local law enforcement and blurring the line between federal and state authorities. The United States is working to harmonize its immigration and security policies with other countries, including sharing data and allowing prescreening by U.S. officials on foreign soil. Efforts like the M\u00e9rida Initiative aim to standardize security standards globally, such as in aviation security after the attempted terrorist attack on Delta Flight 253 in 2009. DHS is working on regional resolutions to lift aviation standards worldwide to match those of the United States. The United States and Canada have implemented various measures to enhance border security, including the Smart Border Accord signed in 2001. Trusted traveler programs like NEXUS have been expanded, and negotiations are ongoing for proposed pre-clearance agreements. The U.S. and Canada have expanded trusted traveler programs like NEXUS. Negotiations for pre-clearance pilot programs were halted due to sovereignty issues. The FLUX alliance aims to expedite international travel for registered travelers, currently involving U.S. and Dutch citizens in each other's programs. Currently, U.S. Global Entry participants can apply for the Dutch Privium Program, and vice versa. The FLUX alliance only includes the U.S. and the Netherlands. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) security measures include the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to assess eligibility and security risks for travelers to the U.S. All VWP travelers must use ESTA since January 12, 2009. One criticized aspect of expanding border partnerships is the lack of effort by border officials to strengthen community ties. Advocates believe that collaboration between officials and community groups can benefit both parties, especially in cases where immigrants are hesitant to report criminal activities. Deeper partnerships with community groups are seen as crucial for future growth of border protection efforts. Maximizing domain awareness, which involves obtaining information on individuals' identities, locations, and intentions, is key for preventing unlawful activities. The intelligence system plays a crucial role in homeland security activities by gathering information on potential threats and benign transit, similar to a central nervous system with data-gathering nodes sending feedback for analysis and distribution. Gathering information on travelers at the border serves as an efficient collection point for intelligence. The intelligence mechanism serves as a crucial collection point for information gathering and feedback to analysts at the border. Various tactics, including document inspection and contraband inspection dogs, are used for layered security. CBP employs tactics to maximize information gathering on traveler identity for achieving domain awareness. CBP employs tactics such as document standardization, security measures, and biometrics to enhance traveler identity verification at ports of entry. These measures aim to prevent identity misrepresentation and fraud during border crossings. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology is used by CBP for automated capture of document information and visitor registration. The system aims to capture unique visitor identities, assess threat levels, and track visa overstays in real time. Concerns have been raised about high thresholds for proving identity, potentially leading to errors in preventing legitimate entries. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) allows individuals to address grievances over admission denials and treatment at the border. Concerns exist about identity errors due to increased reliance on technology for border security. CBP and sister agencies use databases to aid in the admissions process and law enforcement tasks. US-VISIT is a central information and identification system used for admissions and law enforcement tasks. It was created in 1996 by Congress to track the arrival and departure of foreign nationals. The system includes various data systems like IDENT and TECS II, with a focus on border protection. Upon arrival at designated ports of entry, DHS collects biometric information from nonimmigrant aliens, including a digital photograph and 10 fingerprints. This information is entered into IDENT and compared against the database. CBP's Automated Targeting System and National Targeting Center conduct screenings to determine if the individual is a criminal or holds a valid visa. Additionally, information is shared with other systems like TECS II and foreign governments through information-sharing agreements. The CBP's National Targeting Center conducts screenings at designated ports of entry to collect biometric information from nonimmigrant aliens. Various systems like US-VISIT, SEVIS, NSEERS, and E-Verify are used to track individuals and enhance border protection measures. These systems aim to not only provide border protection but also to deter illegal activities. The focus of border protection goes beyond just providing security at the border. Implementing universal employment verification could decrease the demand for unauthorized workers, ultimately reducing the supply. Sharing information among agencies enhances enforcement actions and lowers investigation costs. This interconnected system of intelligence networks improves decision-making for field officers and analysts, leading to more effective border protection. Border agencies have established registered traveler programs for eligible individuals to expedite processing procedures and reduce congestion at border checks. Participants undergo fingerprinting and background checks to ensure low security risk, allowing agencies more time to verify their eligibility. Examples include the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers. The use of technology in border security programs like SENTRI, NEXUS, and Global Entry has evolved from a tactical measure to a strategic objective. Technology enhances efficiency and serves as a force multiplier for rapid detection and collection of data at the border. The deployment of technology at the border allows for rapid detection, collection, and dissemination of data related to identity and threats. It enhances security judgments and can address vulnerabilities such as human error. Technology provides heightened detection capabilities and objectivity, potentially offering solutions to border protection dilemmas. Critics warn against over-reliance on technology. Critics caution against over-reliance on technology for border protection, emphasizing the importance of experienced field officers. DHS acknowledges the need for a balance of manpower, technology, and infrastructure. Critics view technology as a costly investment that is more symbolic than effective in securing borders. The emphasis on technology is driven by perceived information capabilities and a preexisting market. The growth of the homeland security equipment industry has been fueled by the market for military technology, which can also be used by law enforcement agencies. This industry emerged after the 9/11 attacks, with technologies like ground-based radar and unmanned aerial vehicles being marketed as \"force multipliers.\" While these technological tools are valuable, there is a risk in relying solely on them for border protection, as traditional approaches like human intelligence gathering and immigration laws play crucial roles. Border protection involves intelligence gathering and using immigration laws to create legal pathways for immigration. Technology is important but has limitations and vulnerabilities. Changing border protection frameworks may introduce new problems and vulnerabilities that need monitoring and enforcement by border protection agencies. Border protection agencies need time to learn and adjust to tradeoffs in their activities. As they accumulate learning and refine tactical responses, some side effects should decrease. Tradeoffs can have direct or indirect consequences on the success of the border protection mission, creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by unlawful individuals. Failure to address systemic challenges can worsen these vulnerabilities. Border officials face systemic challenges such as corruption, with criminals attempting to infiltrate CBP and enlist officers on their payrolls. DHS is increasing internal investigations to root out double agents. DHS is intensifying internal investigations to uncover double agents within CBP. Efforts include offering retirement benefits to deter corruption. CBP faces pressure to expedite processing at the border, leading to potential security risks. Registered traveler programs are promoted as a solution, but infrastructure limitations hinder their effectiveness. Inadequate port of entry infrastructure hinders benefits of programs, limited outbound information reduces tracking ability of border protection officials, vulnerabilities in current border security framework, circumvention of protection through shifting targets and means. As border protection increases, law violators become more sophisticated in circumventing measures, making detection and interdiction harder. Border incursions aim to reach destinations away from the border region, posing challenges for interior enforcement agencies. Fraud and identity misrepresentation remain a significant method for border incursions despite efforts to secure identity documents. Despite efforts to secure identity documents, border protection can still be circumvented by individuals misrepresenting themselves. This can lead to resentment among stakeholders, including community groups, state and local officials, and foreign entities, who may perceive tactical decisions as illegitimate or detrimental to their communities. Stakeholder opposition could undermine key elements of the protection framework, such as the use of information provided by foreign governments. The effectiveness of the current border protection framework relies on stakeholder relations and addressing vulnerabilities. Foreign governments providing information must be managed carefully to prevent misuse. Policymakers and the public must determine acceptable vulnerabilities and the extent to which they should be overcome. Evaluating the framework's effectiveness in securing the border is crucial. The border protection framework aims to safeguard lawful trade and travel, disrupt criminal organizations, and enhance domain awareness. Scholars have criticized the framework, citing a \"gap hypothesis\" between official policies and outcomes, particularly in immigration control. Scholars and non-scholars acknowledge a gap between official immigration policies and outcomes, attributed to unintended consequences or inadequate implementation. Some scholars, like Peter Andreas, criticize the border framework's ineffectiveness in reducing unauthorized immigration. Despite criticism of the border protection framework for failing to reduce unauthorized immigration, analysis of open source data shows an ambiguous picture of its effectiveness. While efforts have not significantly decreased migrant flows, they have made illegal border crossings less visible and more dispersed, projecting an image of a more secure and orderly border. The success or failure of the current approach remains debated, with evidence both supporting and refuting its effectiveness. Since the 9/11 attacks, significant resources have been allocated to enhance border protection efforts, with appropriations to CBP and other supporting agencies increasing substantially. This increased funding has led to a significant ramp-up in law enforcement efforts at the border and in support of border security. The increased funding post-9/11 led to a significant ramp-up in border protection efforts, including more detention beds, border patrol agents, and fencing. This increase in resources should result in more enforcement activities as a deterrent against unlawful border crossings. Interior enforcement actions, such as detaining and removing aliens, support the border protection function. The increase in funding post-9/11 led to a ramp-up in border protection efforts, including more detention beds, border patrol agents, and fencing. This has resulted in an increase in the detention population and removals. Tactical infrastructure and increased manpower have led to a diversionary effect on illegal entries, pushing crossings to areas without fencing. CBP prosecutes all eligible individuals to support deterrence efforts. Operation Streamline, a zero tolerance policy for border incursions, began in 2005 to prosecute eligible individuals under illegal entry provisions of the INA. This initiative led to a 38% increase in criminal immigration violation defendants from FY2005 to FY2009. The deployment of more resources towards border protection aims to deter terrorists, criminals, and border violators, potentially resulting in fewer apprehensions. The increased resources for border protection since 2001 have led to a significant decrease in USBP apprehensions. The number of Border Patrol agents more than doubled from 9,821 in FY2001 to 20,119 in FY2009, showing an inverse relationship with apprehensions. Critics argue that doubling the number of agents between FY1995 and FY2000 did not impact apprehension rates, but others suggest that a tipping point was reached where sufficient manpower effectively deterred border violators. Force multipliers like technology and infrastructure may have also enhanced apprehension abilities and deterrence. The USBP \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" approach has successfully redirected unauthorized aliens from urban to remote areas along the Southwest border, making apprehensions more challenging. This shift is evident in the changing patterns of apprehensions by state, with California seeing a decrease and Arizona experiencing an increase in apprehensions as a result of border enforcement strategies. The pattern of unauthorized migration is shifting back to California as apprehensions in Arizona increase steadily. Arizona's percentage of total apprehensions has remained stable at around 48%, indicating a shift in migration routes. Unauthorized migrants are exploring other parts of the border due to increased enforcement in Arizona, seeking easier crossing routes. This trend has been consistent over the past two decades, with migrants adapting to enforcement efforts by moving to less guarded areas. Supporters of current strategic border efforts point to a decrease in drug-related violence in Mexico as evidence of success. Drug trafficking organizations are facing challenges controlling production zones and smuggling routes, leading to increased violence as they compete for territory and markets. DHS officials speculate that their border protection policies have disrupted previous supply channels, contributing to the violence between Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The deployment of physical barriers along the Southwest border and the planned virtual fence along the entire US border are increasing pressure on Southwest border points of entry. Mexican smugglers are becoming more aggressive in corrupting CBP officers, leading to disruptions in illegal cross-border activities. Critics argue that these border protection efforts are tightening supply corridors, while supporters point to decreased drug-related violence in Mexico as evidence of success. Critics challenge the effectiveness of border protection efforts, arguing that enforcement diverts migration flows rather than deters it. They claim that unauthorized migration is driven by economic factors, such as higher wages in the United States, which outweigh the deterrent effects of enforcement. Critics doubt the effectiveness of border enforcement efforts, including interior measures like attrition through enforcement. They argue that these efforts only contribute to the black market for unauthorized labor, making deterrence an ineffective approach. Critics use data from the broader economy to support their claims, showing how changes in border apprehensions correlate with labor demand in sectors hiring unauthorized immigrants. The chart illustrates year-over-year changes in apprehensions and labor demand, showing a strong correlation between the two. Critics argue that apprehensions are driven by labor demand, challenging the effectiveness of border enforcement. Despite increased border resources, the relationship between unauthorized immigration and apprehensions remains complex. Since FY2000, there has been an inverse relationship between decreasing apprehensions at the border and the increasing trend of the estimated unauthorized population. This suggests that more individuals may be entering legally or finding ways to elude border officials. The data indicate that the unauthorized population is operating independently from border apprehensions, with no reliable estimates on how many successfully evade capture and enter the country. There are no reliable estimates for how many aliens successfully evade capture and enter the country. Most estimates of the unauthorized population derive from the Current Population Survey, which does not ask about legal status but does ask whether someone is a citizen. Analysis of available data suggests that despite some support for the viability of the estimates, there is no way of knowing what percentage of the people here illegally entered the country surreptitiously, and what percentage entered through a port of entry but then overstayed their visa. The current border protection approach may not be deterring illegal workers due to labor market demand. The incomplete implementation of intended components hinders effectiveness, and artificial market barriers lead to black market solutions satisfying latent demands. Analysis of deterrence efforts involves counterfactual scenarios. Analyzing deterrence efforts in border protection involves counterfactual scenarios, making it challenging to determine the impact on terrorism prevention. Despite increased immigration prosecutions, the effect on terrorism prosecutions is not statistically significant due to the small number of terrorists in the US. Critics question the effectiveness of the current framework in deterring terrorism. Critics question the effectiveness of the current border protection framework in deterring terrorism, citing concerns about the validity of metrics used to measure performance, such as apprehension data. The lack of large-scale terrorist attacks since 9/11 is seen as an indicator of the measures' success by proponents. The apprehension statistics may overstate the actual number of people attempting to cross the border, making it difficult to determine if changes are due to migration patterns or enforcement policies. Increases in apprehensions could be from more migrants or increased border patrols. However, apprehensions provide the best available data on illegal border crossings. The effectiveness of current border control policies is inconclusive, suggesting a need for reevaluation. Addressing immigration control in a broader context could help reduce threats. Achieving better immigration control may free up resources to combat other border threats. This section presents policy options for improving border protection efforts in the short and long term, with a focus on unauthorized immigration. Measures include enhancing ports of entry and capacity for managing individuals entering the US. Border areas between ports of entry are not addressed due to existing funding and natural barriers. These measures aim to reduce strain and improve border security. Some possible measures to improve border protection include constructing separate Ports of Entry for trusted travelers, increasing resource deployment along the border, and conducting visa checks abroad. These measures aim to reduce strain and enhance operational control at the border. Visa checks for individuals flying to the United States are currently done at the U.S. border, but airlines do not have access to electronic visa records. The attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009 highlighted the vulnerability of the visa checking system. Electronic confirmation of visa status could improve air traffic security. Matching security standards with foreign countries is also crucial for border protection. The lack of matching security standards between the United States and other countries is a concern for border protection. CBP relies on MOUs to enforce strict security standards abroad. Advocates suggest deploying the National Guard to the Southwest Border, but limitations from the Posse Comitatus Act may restrict their law enforcement capacity. The National Guard may face restrictions in serving in a law enforcement capacity at the border due to lack of immigration law training. Proponents see it as a temporary solution until more law enforcement personnel can be deployed. Long-term border protection sustainability requires a holistic approach considering various threats and systems. Legislating policies to address underlying drivers may complement current border protection measures, reducing operational stress on border control agencies. A holistic approach involves modifying tactics and overlapping systems without abandoning existing border protection components. The approach to border protection involves incentivizing legal behavior, improving border capacity, reducing foreign supply of violators, and decreasing domestic demand for unlawful incursions. Analysts believe addressing these elements is necessary for achieving operational control and reducing border stress. Providing proper incentives for desired behavior is the most cost-effective method to prevent undesirable actions. Incentivizing good behavior through appropriate rewards and transparency mechanisms is crucial for achieving operational control and reducing border stress. This can involve providing legislative rewards, developing feedback mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in operations. Some potential options for incentive modification and feedback mechanisms to improve border protection include creating new or expanding existing legal immigration pathways. This would provide affordable options for individuals seeking economic opportunities or reuniting with family members, potentially reducing the use of resources by border officials. To enhance border protection, legal immigration pathways could be expanded, reducing resource use. Circular migration principles could improve visa compliance, ensuring re-entry for law-abiding visa holders. Engaging community groups in border protection efforts can improve relations and increase involvement in enforcement. To improve community relations and involvement in enforcement efforts, an ombudsman's office could be established in CBP and ICE. Border officials have adopted a professional model from the Armed Forces, which can be beneficial for law enforcement missions but may create a disconnect with some border communities. Promoting a law-enforcement culture is important, but officials should also be integrated into the community. Promoting a law-enforcement cultural paradigm modeled on the beat cop could improve community relations. Emphasizing professional conduct for promotion and status maintenance would enhance legitimacy. Border officials need to improve their capacity for screening, scanning, and maintaining operational control. Despite being mandated by law, DHS has yet to fully implement a biometric entry/exit system. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not fully implemented a biometric entry/exit system, with the exit component being particularly problematic. Improved scanning technology is needed to reduce processing time at ports of entry, but privacy concerns have been raised about full-body image scans. DHS does not have public plans for deploying biometric exit capability, relying on biographic data for air and sea travelers. Future solutions for improving ports of entry include adding more ports, pushing ports away from the border, and improving the design of existing ports to reduce bottlenecks and wait times. Negotiations for a pilot program to place ports in the interior of a neighboring country stalled over CBP officer authorities in Canada. CBP is addressing bottlenecks at airports through \"model POEs\" with combined customs and immigration inspections and more space for passengers. Future POE designs include exit inspection capabilities and space for expansion. Outbound inspections are now a focus due to concerns about violence in Mexico, particularly regarding money and gun flows. Outbound inspections at POEs in Mexico are crucial to address violence by monitoring funds and weapons flow. Placing vehicular POEs away from urban centers can alleviate congestion and allow for more inspection lanes, while existing POEs could focus on pedestrian and small vehicle crossings to maintain urban ties. This approach aims to enhance border protection in the long term. Proactive border protection measures involve engaging foreign partners to reduce security pressures on the US border. For example, CBP has MOUs with foreign agencies to match security standards. Increasing Mexico's border inspections and enforcement can help control the flow of illegal goods and money. Boosting foreign economies and labor markets can reduce the incentive for individuals to migrate to the United States, improving border protection effectiveness for both countries. Cooperation and assistance between the United States and Mexico, such as through the Merida Initiative, can enhance border security measures. Lessons learned from these efforts could also be applied to develop cooperative border protection with Canada. Incentive to migrate to the United States can be reduced by boosting foreign economies and labor markets. Policymakers should target efforts towards labor markets that are sources of unauthorized populations. Proactive foreign border protection efforts should be coupled with domestic policies to reduce demand for border incursions. Policymakers face challenges in finding policy changes that effectively reduce demand without unintended consequences. Potential proactive domestic policy options include expanding attrition policies. Expansion of Attrition Policies: Utilizing electronic employment verification and biometric screening could reduce unlawful incursions. Making these policies mandatory for all employers and detention facilities may be considered. Decriminalization of drugs is also suggested to eliminate a major revenue source for illegal activities. Opposition from immigration and privacy groups is expected due to concerns about the impact on aliens and U.S. citizens. The decriminalization and regulation of illegal drugs could cut off criminal revenue, generate government income through taxation, and reduce law enforcement and detention costs. Critics argue that the drawbacks, like increased drug addiction, outweigh the benefits. This shift in policy would allow border officials to focus on other priorities, such as controlling borders, protecting lawful trade and travel, and combating transnational criminal organizations. The current border protection framework is based on enforcement to prevent undesirable actions, but its effectiveness is debated. While enforcement measures may deter border violations, they are costly and fail to address root causes. Additionally, they can create inefficiencies in market systems, benefiting criminal enterprises. Border protection is a complex system that interacts with other systems. The border protection system is a complex organism that interacts with other systems. Policymakers need to address the underlying causes of threats to release pressure on border protection mechanisms. A unified approach to tackling different threats to homeland security may be more effective than solely relying on enforcement measures. Policymakers must consider the level of acceptable risk in pursuing a comprehensive border protection strategy, balancing the costs to businesses and communities with potential negative consequences of less protection. These fundamental questions are continuously faced as circumstances change and risks are recalibrated. Table B-1 lists appropriations for key border protection entities, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). CBP is the only agency with a sole focus on border security, while others have additional missions. Funding figures should not be solely interpreted as for combating illegal immigration and border security, but as aggregate funding for agencies with diverse missions. The aggregate funding for agencies involved in combating illegal immigration and providing border security is listed in Table B-1. Funding should be seen as the total budget for agencies with various missions."
