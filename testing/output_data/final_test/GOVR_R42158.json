    "content": "The Klamath River Basin, located along the California-Oregon border, has been a focal point for discussions on water resources and species management. Severe drought conditions in 2001 led to conflicts among various interests, including farmers, fishermen, wildlife refuge managers, and environmental organizations. Issues with Klamath Basin fisheries in 2002 and 2006, as well as conflicts over the relicensing of the Klamath Hydropower Project, have exacerbated these tensions. Low water conditions and disputes over water rights in 2013 have reignited these issues. Congress has oversight authority over federal activities in the Klamath Basin. The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement (KHSA) were signed in 2010 to address conflicts in the Klamath Basin related to water management, federal lands, and the Endangered Species Act. Congress has oversight authority over federal activities in the basin. The KBRA and KHSA agreements aim to address conflicts in the Klamath Basin by setting limits for water allocations, providing supplemental water and power supplies, and potentially removing four nonfederal hydroelectric dams. The agreements also include assurances to settle ongoing water conflicts between basin tribes and other entities. The Secretary of the Interior led a study process to determine if removing dams in the Klamath Basin is in the public interest. Congressional authorization is needed for the final step. The Klamath agreements require congressional approval for key components, with some activities already underway. This report focuses on Congress considering the agreements, which could lead to revisiting previous issues and addressing new ones in the sparsely populated Klamath River Basin. The upper basin relies on water from the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project for irrigation, along with off-project irrigators. The area supports wildlife refuges, Native American tribes, and endangered fish species. The Klamath River has seven dams, with six owned by PacifiCorp as part of the Klamath Hydroelectric Project. The Klamath Hydroelectric Project (KHP) historically provided hydroelectric power for the basin, but a new long-term license has not been granted due to issues with state certification under the Clean Water Act. The project currently operates under a temporary annual license. Congressional focus on the Klamath Basin often revolves around events from 2001. The Klamath Basin has been in the spotlight due to events in 2001, 2002, and 2006, including water rights disputes and limitations on water deliveries. In 2001, water deliveries were reduced to protect endangered fish, leading to protests by irrigators. In 2002, irrigators received more water than allocated in 2001, but thousands of fish died on the lower Klamath River due to poor water conditions. In 2006, ocean fishing for salmon was severely restricted, leading to a decrease in commercial and recreational salmon catch. The federal government provided emergency funding of at least $170 million in response to events in the Klamath Basin. Between 2001 and 2007, the federal government provided emergency aid totaling approximately $35 million and $60 million for events in the Klamath Basin. Additional funding was allocated in 2010 and 2013 for water shortages and drought relief, including $10 million in supplemental appropriations and $2 million for a drought initiative. The 2002 farm bill also allocated $50 million to the basin, with further USDA funding authorized in subsequent farm bills. In 2013, Oregon upheld water rights claims for the Klamath Tribes dating back to \"time immemorial.\" These rights were exercised over junior water rights holders, leading to limited water deliveries in the upper basin. Federal talks were facilitated between 2002 and 2010 to address conflicts in the Klamath Basin. Between 2002 and 2010, negotiations involving various stakeholders in the Klamath Basin led to two major settlement agreements, the KBRA and the KHSA, aimed at addressing water and endangered species issues. These agreements were set to expire in 2012 but have been extended to 2014. The KBRA and KHSA agreements in the Klamath Basin were set to expire in 2012 but have been extended to 2014. In 2013, a task force addressed additional issues leading to the \"Upper Klamath Basin Settlement Agreement.\" The KBRA involves promises to support diversions for irrigators and wildlife refuges based on forecast inflows into Upper Klamath Lake. The KBRA and KHSA agreements in the Klamath Basin were extended to 2014. Environmental interests would gain federal and state funding for fisheries restoration and assurances for dam removal under the KHSA. Three of the four largest tribes agreed to support the project and refuge diversions in exchange for restoration actions and economic aid. The effects of KBRA allocations on water users are subject to debate, but generally expected to result in less water. The KBRA and KHSA agreements in the Klamath Basin were extended to 2014, with environmental interests gaining funding for fisheries restoration and assurances for dam removal. The allocations under the agreement are expected to provide less water for Klamath Project irrigators in wet years but more certainty in dry years. Irrigators who did not initially agree to the KBRA have since come to an agreement with the Klamath tribes to prevent future curtailment of deliveries in exchange for retiring some water rights. The KBRA and KHSA agreements in the Klamath Basin involve significant federal appropriations for implementation. The KHSA could lead to the removal of four nonfederal hydroelectric dams owned by PacifiCorp. The KHSA outlines a process for environmental review by the Secretary of the Interior for potential removal of dams, with costs covered by ratepayers and a California Water Bond. The Dam Removal Entity is yet to be defined, and the agreement addresses interim dam operation, transfer, decommissioning, and removal. One dam would be transferred to the Bureau of Reclamation, and decommissioning of other project resources would begin. Unlike the KBRA, the federal government is involved in the KHSA, with Reclamation interpreting some actions as not needing explicit congressional authorization. The KHSA outlines a process for potential dam removal, with the Dam Removal Entity yet to be defined. The Department of the Interior and most parties agree that congressional authorization is necessary for a final decision on dam removal. In July 2013, the Oregon congressional delegation requested a separate task force to address outstanding water rights conflicts in the upper basin. The task force released a report on December 3, 2013, recommending support for authorizing legislation with specific components in addition to the KBRA and KHSA. This included a new settlement agreement among water rights holders in the Upper Klamath Basin and authority to serve off-project irrigators with low-cost power. Cost concerns were addressed by recommending that any authorizing legislation for the Klamath agreements include only new authorities. The task force recommended a new settlement agreement for the Upper Klamath Basin, costing $250 million over 15 years. The agreement aimed to prevent water rights disputes and included provisions for increased inflows into Upper Klamath Lake, riparian restoration, and regulatory assurances related to the ESA. Senior water rights holders agreed not to call on junior water rights in exchange for these measures. The Upper Klamath Basin agreement, along with the KBRA, requires congressional authorization for implementation. In the 114th Congress, S. 133 would authorize the agreements with certain changes, including approximately $250 million for new federal activities. This would cover actions such as a drought response plan and potential water rights retirement for junior water rights holders. S. 133 authorizes new activities in the Klamath agreements, including a drought response plan, potential water rights retirement for junior water rights holders, economic development payments for tribes, ecosystem restoration activities, and provision of low-cost power for irrigators. It also provides congressional authorization for dam removal steps under the KHSA, with assurances that certain preexisting rights and authorities would not be affected. Other changes to Klamath authorizing legislation are included in the bill. S. 133 authorizes new activities in the Klamath agreements, including dam removal and ecosystem restoration, with added reporting requirements and alterations to provisions. It also addresses dam removal costs, property owner compensation, and revenue disposition. Congress may consider the legislation's cost, specific strategies, and potential water supply disruptions. The federal government's role in the Klamath Basin involves managing the Klamath Project, wildlife refuges, and tribal responsibilities. The Klamath agreements require congressional authorization for certain actions, such as dam removal, water rights retirement payments, and increased federal involvement in the basin. The Klamath agreements propose actions like dam removal, water rights retirement payments, and low-cost power for irrigators to address conflicts in the basin. Federal involvement in the area's resource allocation conflicts is seen as crucial, and supporters argue that the agreements represent a consensus among traditionally opposing interests. Without authorization of these provisions, some supporters may withdraw their support. Supporters of the Klamath agreements believe they offer the best opportunity to solve the region's problems, with potential cost savings in federal expenditures and job creation. Opponents argue that federal involvement is unnecessary and could harm the local economy, suggesting that existing processes could achieve the same goals without the need for dam removal and water quality improvements. Some oppose dam removal in the Klamath Basin due to dams being an energy source. Concerns include undermining federal laws and high costs for federal implementation of agreements. The cost estimates for implementing the Klamath agreements, particularly the KBRA, have varied over time. The original 2010 estimate was $970 million over 10 years, with most costs expected to be covered by the federal government. In 2011, the estimate was revised to $795 million over 15 years, reflecting increased state commitments and altered assumptions. The 2011 estimate for implementing the Klamath agreements included increased state commitments and altered assumptions. A 2013 report estimated $923 million in federal funds would be needed, with $250 million from newly authorized appropriations. Cost estimates for the KHSA have remained unchanged. Cost estimates for implementing the KHSA have not changed significantly since the original agreement, with states primarily responsible for funding dam removal. Previous studies estimated potential costs of around $290 million, less than the combined amount expected from ratepayers and the state of California. One potential issue is whether the federal government will be recommended as the dam removal entity, raising questions about handling additional costs like overruns and potential lawsuits. There is no formal estimate of future savings to state and federal governments from the agreements. Supporters of the agreements highlight potential future savings for state and federal governments, including $170 million in aid since 2001. They argue that decreased litigation costs would result from the agreements, although opponents caution that savings are not guaranteed and additional funding may still be necessary. Additionally, supporters believe the agreements could bring economic benefits. Studies suggest that the KBRA and KHSA could generate economic benefits, with estimates of restoration values ranging from $16 billion to $84 billion. However, some question the validity of these estimates and the feasibility of obtaining funding from Congress in a constrained budgetary environment. Some supporters believe that congressional authorization of the agreements, particularly the KHSA, could imply support for dam removal, a key step in the agreement. Despite not formally recommending dam removal, the study findings highlight the importance of congressional authorization for the future of the agreements. Some stakeholders support dam removal as a means to restore rivers, while others view it as unnecessary and costly, impacting renewable energy availability. The extent of federal government involvement in funding dam removal remains unclear, with disagreements on whether it would proceed without the KHSA and Secretary of the Interior's determination. Opponents argue that PacifiCorp-funded dam removal may not be necessary. Opponents and supporters of the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) are divided on the potential outcomes of PacifiCorp-funded dam removal under FERC relicensing conditions. The impact of the Klamath agreements on the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and other federal laws is a point of contention. Previous biological opinions have set minimum flows for coho salmon and actions for the recovery of Lost River and shortnose suckers. Supporters believe the agreements will be considered under the ESA, while ensuring that they do not interfere with the ESA's implementation by the Department of the Interior or the National Marine Fisheries Service. A conflict exists between stakeholders regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Klamath agreements, which could impact the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Some groups argue that the defined water allocations for irrigators in the agreements may undermine the ESA by providing more water than stipulated in recent low water years, potentially decreasing flows for fisheries. While the agreements do not waive application of the ESA, there are concerns that they could influence regulatory agencies to adopt biological opinions allowing for the flows outlined in the agreements. Supporters of the Klamath agreements argue that they would provide more resources to improve fish habitat, potentially leading to greater fish abundance and allowing for less restrictive flows under the Endangered Species Act. Some believe the agreements could promote cooperative actions for species recovery, contrasting with previous regulatory approaches. Stakeholder opinions on the agreements vary between supporters and opponents. Supporters of the Klamath agreements have varied reasons for their support, including guarantees related to water supplies and potential dam removal. Opponents have diverse reasons for their opposition, such as perceived economic damages and lack of environmental protections. Nonfederal parties within both the KBRA and the KHSA support the agreements. Nonfederal parties listed in the KBRA and KHSA agreements include state agencies, tribes, a county, parties related to the Reclamation Project, off-project interests, and environmental groups. Other groups and individuals have expressed support for the agreements, including off-project irrigators in the upper basin. Supporters advocate for linking the agreements and have the backing of California, Oregon, and the Obama Administration. The KBRA and KHSA agreements are supported by California, Oregon, and the Obama Administration as a potential solution to resource conflicts in the basin. Government representatives highlight the costs of previous conflicts, while environmental groups support the agreements for specific provisions like dam removal and fisheries restoration. Irrigators on the Klamath Project pledge support for restoration provisions and reduced water in wet years in exchange for these benefits. Off-project irrigators in the upper basin support restoration provisions and reduced water in wet years in exchange for benefits from water supplies in dry years. PacifiCorp supports removing its four dams under the KHSA as a cost-effective option for ratepayers compared to FERC relicensing. Disagreements existed over FERC relicensing or surrendering the dam license before the KHSA. The Klamath agreements offer two options for PacifiCorp: implementing changes for fish passage and water quality, or surrendering its license and decommissioning some or all of the hydropower projects. Both options are costly and opposed by some groups and individuals, including county officials. Opponents of the Klamath agreements include local officials in Klamath County, Siskiyou County, tribes, environmental organizations, and off-project irrigators. Some groups have reached the Upper Basin Agreement, while others oppose it due to its ties to the KBRA and KHSA. Concerns include potential damage to the region's economy. Some off-project users and Siskiyou County oppose the agreements due to economic damages to farmers, loss of flood protection, and property tax concerns. Critics argue that the agreements favor farmers over fisheries and tribal rights. The tribe asserts its senior water rights over the Klamath Reclamation Project. Opponents raise concerns about uncertainties in fisheries restoration under the KBRA and argue for dam removal through existing processes rather than tied to the KBRA. The KHSA allows the company to avoid project upgrades that would benefit fisheries in the short term. Opponents of the Klamath agreements argue that the provisions disproportionately benefit PacifiCorp and irrigators at the expense of fisheries. Some environmental groups, including Waterwatch of Oregon and Oregon Wild, criticize various aspects of the agreements such as the lack of water supplies for fish and lease-land farming on wildlife refuges. These groups, along with the Hoopa Valley Tribe, call for voiding the KHSA and resuming water quality certification processes under the Clean Water Act for dam upgrades or removal. The Yurok Tribe withdrew from the Klamath agreements in September 2015, citing inaction by Congress and disagreements with the Upper Klamath Settlement Agreement."
