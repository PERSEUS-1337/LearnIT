The request included funding for various programs such as Energy counter-proliferation programs in Russia, North Korea, Department of Justice national security related programs, National Security Council operations, Forest Service and Department of the Interior for fire fighting, Legislative Branch for secure radios for Capitol Police, and moving prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay. If approved, the total supplemental defense funding for FY2009 would reach $145 billion. The $7.1 billion supplemental request for international affairs included funding for State Department operations, embassy security, international peacekeeping, foreign assistance programs, and humanitarian assistance to various countries. This additional amount, along with previous funding, would bring the total supplemental appropriations for FY2009 to over $11 billion.

The funding would be available if the President determines additional resources are required. Additionally, the proposal requested authority for the Director of OMB to transfer funds for influenza-related needs.

This would allow transfers of up to $3.1 billion from various sources, including funds appropriated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and discretionary funds available to the Department of Health and Human Services in FY2009. The White House proposed transferring $2.76 billion from the BioShield Special Reserve Fund to HHS for medical countermeasures for influenza. Additionally, a supplemental proposal requested $200 million in humanitarian assistance for Pakistan, including funds for migration, refugee assistance, and international disaster assistance. Congress was urged to act quickly on the supplemental request due to potential funding shortages mentioned by Secretary Gates in April 2009. The DOD's operations funds are running out in July, and without supplemental funding by Memorial Day, they may need to delay running out of funds. Cash flowing and fund transfers may extend funding into early August. Congressional action on war-related funding has been delayed in recent years due to various contentious issues.

Total supplemental defense funding proposed for FY2009 amounted to $145 billion, offset by $3.4 billion of rescissions. The FY2009 defense request of $145 billion is significantly lower than previous years due to a decrease in weapons procurement funding from $65 billion to $28 billion. This reduction is mainly attributed to a decrease in Mine Resistant Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle acquisitions.

Congress debated issues such as funding for major weapons programs, security assistance to Pakistan, and border security with Mexico in the defense supplemental discussions. Representative Murtha, the Chairman, was involved in preliminary talks. In discussions of the defense supplemental, Representative Murtha and Senator Inouye intend to add significant amounts for major weapon systems like a new mid-air refueling tanker, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Navy F/A-18E/F fighter, Navy E-2D radar plane, and Army Stryker armored vehicles. Additional funds may cover monthly stipends for service members affected by \"stop loss\" orders. Murtha may propose adding $16-18 billion to the request.

The Administration included funds for four Air Force F-22 fighter aircraft in the supplemental request, but Secretary of Defense Gates plans to terminate the program. There are disagreements in Congress about splitting purchases between competing bidders for the aerial tanker program. The Air Force is preparing to recompete the contract with bids from Boeing and a team of Northrop Grumman and EADS. Several Members of Congress suggest splitting the contract between both bidders, but the Air Force argues it will increase costs significantly. The House committee added $6 billion for weapons, but not as much as some had discussed. The House committee added $6 billion for weapons procurement, including funds for C-17 cargo aircraft and C-130 variants. They did not add funds for Air Force aerial tankers.

Additionally, $165 million was added to cover the cost of repairing three Navy ships. $400 million was allocated for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund to support Pakistani security forces in combating insurgent forces. Funding for such security assistance is usually provided through the State Department, but Congress has supported similar activities in Iraq and Afghanistan through the Defense Department. Many legislators want security assistance to be coordinated with foreign policy goals, urging that assistance to Africa and other areas be provided through the State Department. Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Clinton argued that the State Department is not prepared to administer large amounts of security assistance to Pakistan. The House Chairman's mark of the supplemental bill provided $400 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capabilities Fund through the State Department.

The CDC reported cases of swine flu in California and Texas in April 2009, leading to a global spread of the new pathogen. The World Health Organization declared a flu pandemic in June 11, 2009. The United States initiated a response to the outbreak, with the Department of Health and Human Services developing a vaccine. Congress considered supplemental funding for pandemic flu preparedness, following previous funding for pandemic planning efforts. In FY2008, Congress allocated $75 million to USAID for avian and pandemic flu activities. President Obama requested $1.5 billion for response efforts to the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security's \"Biodefense Countermeasures\" account could be used for procurement of medical countermeasures for influenza. The Administration was seeking a way to purchase a large number of vaccines against H1N1 flu, with funds available to HHS supporting vaccine development but not sufficient for large-scale procurements. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan lacks discussion on costs and financing for 324 action items. Stafford Act declaration for H1N1 pandemic has not been made, limiting access to disaster relief funds. Representative Obey proposed over $2 billion for the outbreak, $550 million more than requested. The House Appropriations Committee approved $550 million above the request for the current outbreak in a May 7 markup.

Additionally, funds could be used for purchases for the Strategic National Stockpile, vaccine production facilities, and the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund. The curr_chunk discusses an additional $5.8 billion appropriation to HHS for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, with funds becoming available for obligation 15 days after a detailed written request from the President to Congress. Funds can be used for purchases for the Strategic National Stockpile and the Covered Countermeasure Process Fund, but not for construction or renovation of privately owned vaccine production facilities. The Secretary of HHS would need to report to the Appropriations Committees on funds obligated and actions taken. The curr_chunk discusses the reporting of funds obligated for pandemic flu preparedness and a report on CDC's initial response to the outbreak. $50 million is allocated for global efforts to control the outbreak, with the possibility of using funds from various accounts for pandemic response activities if WHO declares a global flu pandemic. OMB must seek approval before using these funds. The Administration's original request proposed funding for various programs, including Department of Energy counter-proliferation programs, Strategic Petroleum Reserve site maintenance, Department of Justice national security-related programs, and the decision to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison. OMB must seek replenishments for any funds reprogrammed for pandemic response activities. The Administration requested funds for various programs, including shutting down the Guantanamo Bay prison. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the request, while the House Appropriations Committee did not provide the $50 million requested for the Department of Defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not agree to provide $30 million for the Department of Justice to implement executive orders to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison. The committee expects the Department to report on its plan for implementation and submit a reprogramming request for any necessary funds. Senators Inouye and Inhofe offered an amendment to delete the funding for closing the prison. Senators Inouye and Inhofe offered an amendment, S.Amdt. 1133, to delete funding for relocating detainees to the US. The Senate approved the amendment by a vote of 90-6 on May 20, and the funding was not included in the final act (P.L. 111-32). The FY2009 supplemental assistance request for Iraq aimed to reduce the US presence in the country, with a total non-humanitarian foreign operations aid request of $482 million. This, combined with previously appropriated amounts, would bring total assistance to $605 million, similar to FY2008. The FY2009 assistance request for Iraq aimed to reduce the US presence in the country, with a total non-humanitarian foreign operations aid request of $482 million. This, combined with previously appropriated amounts, would bring total assistance to $605 million, similar to FY2008. The Administration requested to rescind and re-appropriate $1 billion from the FY2009 \"bridge\" appropriation to the Iraq Security Forces Fund in order to extend the availability of these funds until September 2010.

The House allocation for the State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs account for Iraq was increased by 224% to $486 million to fund the Iraq Mission through the first quarter of 2010. Senate mostly followed the Administration request for Iraq reconstruction aid in the FY2009 supplemental. The Senate bill departed from the Administration's request by not rescinding $1 billion from the FY2009 \"bridge\" supplemental and still appropriating $1 billion in the new supplemental. It also transferred unobligated balances to the Department of State for training Iraqi security forces. The Senate bill matched the Administration's $150 million request for the State Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The enacted supplemental for Iraq Reconstruction closely follows the Administration's request, providing $439 million for ESF, $20 million for INCLE, and $2 million for IMET. Congress extended the ISFF appropriation from the previous year and allocated $453 million for CERP funds. Not less than $15 million of ESF is designated for targeted development programs determined by the Ambassador, with a focus on incorporating women in stabilizing Iraq. The act also includes $486 million for State Operating Expenses, addressing the FY2010 request. The $486 million House level for State Operating Expenses was adopted early to assist embassy transition. Despite progress in Afghanistan, insurgent threats have escalated since 2006, raising doubts about U.S. stabilization efforts. The Obama Administration conducted a strategic review in response to continued instability in Afghanistan, focusing on non-military steps such as economic development, building local governing structures, and reforming the Afghan government. The new strategy includes adding at least 21,000 U.S. troops in 2009 and improving Pakistan's efforts to curb militant activity. The FY2009 supplemental request reflects the Administration's strategy by seeking to increase economic aid. The Obama Administration's strategic review in response to instability in Afghanistan includes increasing economic aid. The requested funding of $980 million would come from three accounts and focus on improving governance and anti-corruption efforts in the Afghan government.

The $839 million ESF request represents a shift towards countering insurgency in the south and east, with support from the Ministry of Justice, U.S. contributions to the World Bank's Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, and funding for basic services and short-term employment opportunities totaling $135 million. Economic growth efforts amount to $170 million and include projects in agriculture, monetary and fiscal policy reform, central business registry expansion, national land registry creation, and micro and small business credit activities. Additionally, the $129 million INCLE program focuses on counternarcotics and rule of law efforts in Afghanistan. The State, Foreign Operations portion of the request includes $261.5 million for State Department Diplomatic and Consular Program account funds to support operational expenses for civilian staff surge in Kabul and PRT staff expansion. Additionally, there is a $140 million request for USAID Operating Expenses to increase staff in the PRTs, $101.5 million for security protection, and $87 million for embassy physical expansion. The Administration's request for operational expenses in Afghanistan amounted to about $600 million, including funds for housing, security forces, and the Commander's Emergency Response Program. Additionally, there was a request to extend the availability of $125 million previously appropriated for the Afghan Security Forces Fund until September 2010. The House approved H.R. 2346 for economic assistance to Afghanistan, providing $3.6 billion for the ASFF and $453 million for the CERP. The Appropriations Committee report detailed allocations for NADR, INCLE, and ESF accounts, with breakdowns for various categories within ESF. The House bill allocated $115 million for Governance and Civil Society and $20 million for Rule of Law. It provided more funding for State Department operating expenses and staff expenses to support a proposed staff surge in Kabul. The House also matched the Administration's request for USAID operating expenses and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

It provides funding for ESF, INCLE, ASFF, and CERP matching the requests. Not less than $150 million is allocated for programs benefiting women and girls. 10% of INCLE funds are withheld until the Afghan government addresses narcotics and human rights issues. $70 million is designated for the National Solidarity Program. The enacted supplemental provides $413.2 million for State Diplomatic and Consular Program operating expenses, meeting the $363 million requested. Half of the additional amount is for air transport needs of the Embassy. The Embassy Security account is allocated $67 million less than requested due to concerns about land acquisition. The USAID Operating Expense account request of $140 million is met by the legislation. The Administration requested $497 million in new foreign operations assistance to help Pakistan address security and economic challenges, emphasizing the importance of ongoing CSF reimbursements for U.S.-led military efforts in the region. Additionally, the establishment of a Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was deemed necessary to enhance Pakistan's security forces and support stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and the region. The DOD assistance request aimed to continue CSF payments for Pakistan's operational and logistical support. The U.S. has provided significant financial support to Pakistan since 2001, with concerns raised about the lack of proper accounting oversight. Pakistan has received around 80% of the funds at an average rate of $80 million per month. Additional funds are expected in FY2009, with a proposed $25.8 million for counterdrug efforts. The PCCF funds would support security development plans, train Pakistani security forces for counterinsurgency, and provide humanitarian relief. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates supports funding the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) with up to $3 billion over five years. There is debate in Congress about whether the PCCF should fall under the Department of Defense or the Department of State. The foreign operations request includes $430 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF) to address Pakistan's economic crisis and balance of payment deficit. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) would supplement Islamabad's Standby Agreement with the IMF, providing $21.5 million for USAID's Community Rehabilitation Infrastructure Support Program in Pakistan. Additionally, $8 million would be allocated for humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons in Pakistan's western border regions. The FY2009 ESF total for Pakistan would reach about $1.03 billion, including funds for elite police training and expanding the air wing. The supplemental request includes $22.5 million to expand the air wing of the paramilitary Frontier Corps in Pakistan for counternarcotics and border security. Additionally, $2 million is requested for Crisis Response Team training courses for the Federal Investigative Agency's anti-terrorist team. State Department and USAID operations costs would cover security, construction, and maintenance of U.S. posts in Pakistan, with a focus on renovating the existing chancery and constructing a new annex in Islamabad. Furthermore, $45.6 million is requested for diplomatic and consular activities, including enhancing U.S. public diplomacy efforts. The FY09 supplemental appropriations include $30.9 million for U.S. public diplomacy efforts, $9.1 million for increased security at U.S. facilities, and $5.5 million for a staffing surge.

The FY09 supplemental appropriations include funding for various activities in Pakistan, such as diplomatic and consular activities, public diplomacy broadcasting near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, Pentagon counterdrug activities, USAID operating costs, and Inspector General oversight. Congress also established two new funds to build Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities: the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) with $400 million and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) with $700 million. These funds will be overseen by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State respectively. The conferees directed the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to develop a plan for transitioning the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund from Defense to State by FY2010, fully executed by FY2011. Additionally, the Administration seeks funding for new humanitarian requirements in FY2009 that were not anticipated in the regular budget request. The Administration's FY2009 emergency supplemental request asked for $293 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account. This included humanitarian assistance for Iraqi refugees, Palestinian refugees in West Bank and Gaza, support for international organizations in South Asia, assistance in conflicts in Africa, and global protection/emergency response requirements/food. The Administration's FY2009 emergency supplemental request included $10 million for global protection/emergency response/food assistance, $3 million for Burmese refugees in Thai-Burma camps, and an additional $200 million for humanitarian needs in Pakistan. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill allocated $343 million for the MRA account, citing urgent humanitarian requirements for refugees and IDPs in various regions. The Committee expressed concerns about UNRWA's transparency and fund usage in the West Bank and Gaza. Section 21004 of the bill focuses on accountability measures for assistance to the region, including limiting funds to UNRWA to $119 million and requiring an accountability report from the Secretary of State. Additionally, $1,000,000 would be transferred to the Inspector General for oversight. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $345 million for the MRA account to assist refugees and IDPs, with specific amounts designated for various regions. The enacted FY2009 Supplemental legislation provides $390 million for MRA to address urgent humanitarian needs globally. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $345 million for the MRA account to assist refugees and IDPs globally, with specific amounts designated for regions like the Middle East, South and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Colombia. The legislation also limits funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to $119 million and includes reporting requirements for accountability and transparency. Additionally, $45 million of MRA funding is anticipated for humanitarian assistance in Pakistan. The Administration requested $200 million for the IDA account to address humanitarian needs in specific complex emergencies in East and Central Africa and to assist IDPs in Pakistan. The request was later revised to include an additional $30 million for IDA, totaling $230 million. The House Appropriations Committee bill matched the initial request, citing increased insecurity, armed conflict, and weather complications in Africa. The Committee highlighted concerns about limited humanitarian access in Somalia and urged safe access for operations. It also noted the loss of life and limited assistance in Sri Lanka, urging compliance with international humanitarian law and support for displaced populations. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $245 million for the IDA account to address basic needs of IDPs in various regions and respond to humanitarian crises. The enacted legislation provides $270 million in IDA funding, with a focus on IDPs in Pakistan and worldwide, including Sri Lanka. The House and Senate approved bills provided additional funding for humanitarian assistance in Sri Lanka and worldwide through P.L. 480 Title II grants. The House bill allocated $500 million, while the Senate bill allocated $700 million, exceeding the Administration's request. The enacted legislation (H.R. 2346, P.L. 111-32) increases P.L. 480 Title II assistance to $700 million for urgent humanitarian food assistance, $400 million above the Administration's request. This increase aims to address food emergencies exacerbated by the global financial crisis and recession, enhancing resources for food aid emergencies. The Administration requested humanitarian assistance activities under the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for Burma, West Bank/Gaza, and Pakistan. An additional $200 million was allocated for Pakistan, with $130 million for ESF. Enacted legislation provided $13 million for Burma for humanitarian assistance. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess U.S. and donor assistance for Cyclone Nargis. The Secretary of State will review U.S. policy towards Burma. Jordan receives $150 million for assistance related to refugee populations. Pakistan will receive $125 million for humanitarian assistance. West Bank and Gaza will receive $5 million less than requested for ESF funding. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund is limited to $2 million for urgent humanitarian assistance. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a statutory limit of $2 million from the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund for humanitarian assistance. They expressed concerns about granting additional authority within the Department of Defense for funding humanitarian projects. The Committee recommended that DOD collaborate with the Pakistani Government to establish a mechanism for funding humanitarian needs in support of counterinsurgency operations in Pakistan. The Administration requested $38 million for Development Assistance funding, but the conferees did not include funding for this as it was expected to be met through other accounts. The Secretary of State was directed to report on incidents in Sri Lanka that may have violated international humanitarian law or been crimes against humanity. The White House requested Congress to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by up to $100 billion, in line with commitments made at a G-20 meeting. Several countries have pledged $255 billion towards the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow fund. The IMF also agreed to create $250 billion in new Special Drawing Rights. The IMF agreed to create $250 billion in new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to expand world foreign exchange reserves by about 4% and provide resources to countries in crisis. A proposal for a new increase in IMF quota resources was pending, including reforms in governance, finances, and procedures, as well as selling gold to cover non-lending operations costs. In 2008, a proposed Fourth Amendment to the IMF Articles was pending, aiming to create a new allocation of about SDR 21.4 billion. U.S. participation in the IMF quota increase and a subscription of $100 billion for the NAB would require congressional approval. Contributions to the IMF for quota increases or new resources must be authorized by Congress. In 1967, a Presidential Commission recommended that U.S. payments to the IMF should not impact the Federal budget. Concern arose in 2009 that procedural aspects of the budget process could affect congressional consideration of new U.S. subscriptions to the IMF. Members of Congress may vote against providing budget authority for a proposed $100 billion line of credit to the IMF through the NAB due to \"bailout fatigue.\" Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), questioned the budget scoring procedures for IMF subscriptions in 2009, suggesting an alternative \"exchange of assets\" method. Concerns were raised that changing the procedure could weaken support for the $100 billion line of credit to the IMF through the NAB. The White House and Congress agreed to treat the U.S. subscription to the IMF as a line of credit for budgetary purposes. The Administration requested authorization and appropriations for the IMF in the defense supplemental, asking Congress to extend a line of credit totaling $108 billion for NAB and quota subscriptions. This new framework differs from past IMF quota increases, which had no budgetary impact. Under the new framework, the U.S. contribution to the IMF would be scored as a loan for budgetary purposes, requiring $5 billion to be appropriated. This change is expected to ease the prospects for enacting the legislation. The final enacted supplemental (P.L. 111-32) includes IMF funding as requested by the Administration."
