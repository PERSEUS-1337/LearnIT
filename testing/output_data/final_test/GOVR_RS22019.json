    "content": "Several types of investments are preferentially treated under the individual income tax, including IRAs, pensions, capital gains, dividends, owner-occupied housing, and life insurance policy earnings. There are two types of IRAs that exempt investment earnings from tax\u2014the traditional (deductible) IRA and the Roth IRA. Contributions to the deductible IRA are deducted when made, withdrawals are taxed, and eligibility is phased out as income increases for active participants in employer pension plans. Early withdrawal penalties and mandatory distribution requirements apply. The Roth IRA was introduced in 1997 as an option with tax-exempt earnings. Contribution limits increased to $5,000 under the 2001 tax cut, with a tax credit for low-income individuals. Pensions also receive favorable tax treatment, allowing firms to deduct contributions not included in employees' income. Tax benefits for pensions, similar to deductible IRAs, have been in place since the inception of the tax law. Pensions come in defined benefit and defined contribution plans, with regulations to prevent tax benefits for owners and highly compensated managers. Pension assets invested in corporate stock are subject to corporate level tax. Employer pensions receive significant tax benefits compared to IRAs, according to the latest Joint Committee on Taxation estimates for FY2009. In FY2009, employer pensions, Keogh plans for self-employed individuals, and IRAs resulted in significant revenue losses. Dividends and other savings receive favorable tax treatment, including lower rates for capital gains and dividends. Owner-occupied housing and life insurance policies also have tax advantages. The tax benefits of life insurance policies include deferred gains exempt from tax, with significant revenue losses estimated for capital gains, dividends, gifts, imputed rent, mortgage interest, property taxes, and capital gains on homes. IRA limits were expanded by the 2001 tax bill. In 2002, contribution limits for pension plans, including 401(k) plans, were increased. Individuals 50 and over had additional increases in 2002 and 2008. The tax cuts in the bill expired in 2010, but the increased limit became permanent in 2006. The Pension Protection Act allowed IRA rollovers to charity for those aged 70 and \u00bd without tax effects. President Bush proposed renaming Roth IRAs as Retirement Savings Accounts and introducing Lifetime Savings Accounts with increased contribution limits. The latest proposal aims to increase contribution limits for new accounts, eliminate income limits, and allow rollovers from existing accounts with tax implications. It is expected to initially gain revenue but ultimately result in a loss, costing more in the long run. The proposal also includes combining employer savings accounts and simplifying rules to prevent discrimination. This could be part of a broader tax reform proposal. The Enron scandal and economic recovery influenced previous legislative proposals on pensions, but the Pension Protection Act of 2006 eventually addressed various issues. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made revisions to pension policy, including liberalizations of IRAs. IRAs were introduced in 1962 for parity with employer pensions, made universally available in 1981 to encourage savings, and income limits were adjusted in 1986 and 1997. Economists debate the savings effects of IRAs, with some studies showing a positive impact on savings behavior. Some studies suggest that IRAs have a positive impact on savings behavior, but others dispute this claim. Economic theory does not fully support an IRA savings effect, and some argue that employer-provided savings accounts are more effective. While IRAs benefit well-off individuals, the evidence on lower taxes increasing savings is mixed, with little change in savings rates as tax rules change."
