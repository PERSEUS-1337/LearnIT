    "content": "Despite the impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) on various tasks, they still exhibit sensitive reactions to noise attacks. This has led to research on developing noise-robust networks. A new training regularizer is proposed in this work to minimize the expected training loss of a DNN with a Gaussian input. The regularizer is efficiently approximated for deep networks by leveraging the output mean of a shallow neural network. Experiments on LeNet and AlexNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. The proposed regularizer improves robustness against Gaussian noise in deep neural networks, enhancing overall robustness against various attacks by two orders of magnitude. DNNs have shown impressive performance in tasks like object recognition and speech recognition but are susceptible to small input noise. Recent studies have revealed that deep neural networks are vulnerable to small input noise, indicating a lack of robustness. There is a growing interest in the machine learning community to investigate this behavior, with systematic approaches to constructing adversarial attacks that lead to misclassification errors. Some noise perturbations are doubly agnostic, causing misclassification errors across different networks regardless of the input. Data augmentation is a popular method to improve deep neural network (DNN) robustness under adversarial attacks. However, it may not be sufficient due to the large amount of data needed for high-dimensional input noise and the negative impact of high energy noise on performance. Data augmentation can impact DNN performance on noise-free test examples due to a trade-off between accuracy and robustness. DNNs are sensitive to adversarial examples, which are small imperceptible noise that degrades performance. Research aims to understand and measure network robustness. Szegedy et al. (2014) proposed a spectral stability analysis for DNNs by measuring the Lipschitz constant of layers. Fawzi et al. (2017a) defined robustness as the mean support of minimum adversarial perturbation. Robustness was studied against adversarial perturbations and geometric transformations, independent of ground truth class labels. Several metrics have been proposed to measure DNN robustness against adversarial attacks and noise, with a trade-off between robustness and test error highlighted in theoretical studies. Various approaches have been suggested to build networks that are robust against different types of attacks, including statistical hypothesis testing on dataset distributions and analysis of latent feature spaces. The geometry of decision boundaries in DNN classifiers was studied to develop a curvature test for robustness. A proposed graph for training Gaussian robust networks is shown, with an efficient method for computing output mean using an extra forward pass. Various methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural networks, including denoising adversarial examples, using bounded ReLUs with Gaussian noise, distilling knowledge from deep models, and implementing new training regularizers. These approaches aim to enhance the network's ability to correctly classify inputs and defend against adversarial attacks. Recent work by Cisse et al. (2017) introduced a new training regularizer for deep neural networks that enforces a bound on the Lipshitz constant of the network's output. Bibi et al. (2018) derived analytic expressions for the output mean and covariance of networks with a generic Gaussian input, enabling the approximation of deep networks with shallower ones for easier application of the derived expressions. This approach eliminates the need for data augmentation or training new architectures, making training routines more efficient in the presence of various input noise types. Our new regularizer addresses limitations in training routines by tackling Gaussian input noise without data augmentation, improving overall robustness against attacks. Networks with a single hidden layer can be represented as g(x) = Bmax(Ax + c1, 0) + c2. Bibi et al. (2018) showed that \u00b52 = A\u00b5x + c1, \u03c32 = diag(\u03a32), \u03a32 = A\u03a3xA. Theorem (1) results can be extended to deeper models. To extend Theorem (1) results to deeper models, a two-stage linearization was proposed in Bibi et al. (2018) using Jacobians and biases of the first order Taylor approximation around a ReLU layer in a DNN. A new robust training regularizer is proposed as an alternative to noisy data augmentation to improve robustness against attacks by addressing limitations in training routines. This regularizer aims to minimize the expected training loss of a DNN when subjected to noisy input distribution D through sampling. The paper discusses the use of an analytic expression for expected loss to avoid expensive data augmentation in training neural networks. It introduces a trade-off parameter to model the training loss and highlights the impact of using Monte Carlo estimates through data augmentation, which can increase dataset size and training complexity. The paper proposes a surrogate loss to replace the second term in Equation 1, which encourages the output mean of the network to match the correct class label for every noisy example. This regularizer promotes separation among the output means of classes when training data is noisy, leading to simpler and more cost-effective training. The paper suggests a regularization method to replace data augmentation for training neural networks. It introduces a surrogate loss to encourage output mean alignment with correct class labels in noisy data scenarios, simplifying training. However, the computational complexity of network linearization poses challenges in utilizing this approach effectively. The paper proposes a generic approach to train robust networks against noise, focusing on networks parameterized by \u03b8 with ReLUs as activations. It restricts the noise distribution to Gaussian noise for its adversarial nature and useful properties. The paper presents a method to train robust networks against Gaussian noise by approximating the second term in the equation using a simplified network structure. The network is parameterized by \u03b8 with ReLUs as activations, and the noise distribution is restricted to Gaussian noise for its adversarial nature. The paper introduces a method to train robust networks against Gaussian noise by approximating the second term in the equation using a simplified network structure. The subnetwork \u03a5(., \u03b8 1 ) is affine, while the second subnetwork \u2126(., \u03b8 2 ) is not linear in general. Linearizing \u2126 at \u00b5 3 with parameters (B, c 2 ) yields an approximation without the need for explicit access to B or c 2.

The proposed regularizer allows for efficient training on noisy examples without data augmentation, demonstrating effectiveness on various network architectures and datasets. The text discusses a new robustness metric against additive noise, with a focus on Gaussian distribution. Networks trained with this regularizer show improved robustness compared to those trained with Gaussian augmented data. The challenge lies in defining robustness against additive noise sampled from a distribution D. The text introduces a new robustness metric against additive noise, focusing on Gaussian distribution. It addresses the challenge of defining robustness against noise sampled from a distribution D. The proposed robustness metric measures the probability of a classifier preserving the original prediction after adding noise from a distribution. It is defined as the expected robustness over a testing dataset, with a 0/1 robustness measure over randomly sampled examples. The robustness score is calculated by averaging a measure over the testing dataset T. It is assessed against Gaussian noise by averaging over a range of testing variances. The computation is made more efficient by sampling a single noise sample with the average energy over D. The effectiveness of the proposed regularizer in improving robustness is demonstrated through experiments comparing it with data augmentation approaches. Models with the highest robustness are presented, showing that training with the regularizer can achieve similar or better robustness than noisy data augmentation on MNIST and CIFAR100, while maintaining high accuracy. Architecture details for input images in MNIST and CIFAR are provided, with a focus on achieving robustness with high noise-free test accuracy.

It achieves similar or better robustness than noisy data augmentation on MNIST and CIFAR100, while maintaining high accuracy. Changes were made to the AlexNet implementation in TorchVision to accommodate for differences in input image sizes. Key modifications include adjusting hidden units, pooling kernel sizes, padding sizes, and layer sequences. Dropout layers were removed for simplicity. Optimization hyper-parameters details are provided in the appendix. The study compares models trained with data augmentation and a proposed regularizer to improve robustness. Data augmentation enhances robustness but decreases accuracy on noise-free examples. Training experiments were conducted on LeNet with different datasets, augmentation levels, and noise levels. Robust training experiments were also performed with varying trade-off coefficients. The study conducted experiments with varying noise levels to test the robustness of the proposed regularizer. Results showed that increasing noise levels degraded testing accuracy on noise-free data, but the proposed regularizer showed a more graceful degradation compared to data augmentation. The regularizer enforces separation between output predictions analytically, improving robustness as training \u03c3 x increases. Models trained with the regularizer show better testing accuracy over baseline models, especially with a large factor of augmentation. However, as \u03c3 x increases, Monte Carlo estimates via data augmentation may not capture noise effectively. Data augmentation alone is insufficient to capture noise, leading to the proposal of a unified robustness metric for fair comparison. Gaussian robustness enhances overall robustness, as shown in metrics for various attacks on LeNet and AlexNet networks trained with a proposed regularizer. Training with the regularizer improves robustness and accuracy compared to baseline models. Our proposed regularizer improves robustness against various attacks, outperforming data augmentation alone. Results for LeNet show comparable robustness to 21-fold data augmentation for MNIST and twice the robustness for CIFAR10. Our method also outperforms data augmentation for CIFAR100.

Results for LeNet show comparable robustness to 21-fold data augmentation for MNIST and twice the robustness for CIFAR10. Additionally, our regularizer improves robustness by 15% on CIFAR10 and around 25% on CIFAR100 compared to data augmentation. The best robustness achieved through data augmentation is even worse than the baseline, possibly due to the trade-off coefficient \u03b1 in Equation 1. Our proposed regularizer enhances robustness against various attacks, surpassing the effectiveness of data augmentation alone. The robustness of models trained with our regularizer is compared to baseline models under different attack types such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Fast Sign Gradient Method (FGSM), and DeepFool L2Attack (DF2). Experiments were conducted on LeNet for MNIST and AlexNet for CIFAR100 datasets. The Gaussian Network Robustness (GNR) metric was used along with testing accuracy (ACC) to evaluate the models' performance. Our proposed regularizer significantly improves robustness metrics for LeNet on MNIST and AlexNet on CIFAR100, surpassing the effectiveness of data augmentation alone. The regularizer enhances robustness against various attacks, with models showing a two orders of magnitude improvement in robustness while maintaining testing accuracy. This lightweight analytic regularizer addresses the sensitivity of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations without the need for computationally expensive data augmentation. The experimental setup details for the proposed lightweight analytic regularizer include using PyTorch version 0.4.1, fixed hyperparameters, and two optimizers - Adam and SGD. Training datasets are split into 10% validation and 90% training sets, with validation loss monitored after each epoch. The training process involves monitoring validation loss after each epoch. If validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, the learning rate is reduced. Training continues until validation loss does not improve for a set number of epochs or reaches 100 epochs. The model with the best validation loss is reported. The robustness against Gaussian noise is measured by averaging over different noise levels. The final robustness is the average over multiple testing \u03c3 x, a special case of the more general Equation (4). The area under the curve of the robustness with varying testing \u03c3 x represents the overall robustness of a model under varying input noise standard deviation \u03c3 x. The proposed efficient regularizer improves robustness against various attacks, with models trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 showing improved accuracy compared to baseline models. The proposed regularizer improves robustness against various attacks on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Training with the regularizer enhances robustness against Gaussian attacks and 6 other types of attacks."
