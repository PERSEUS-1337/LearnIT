    "content": "The National Park System, managed by the National Park Service, consists of 391 units covering over 84 million acres. The NPS had an appropriation of $2.39 billion for FY2008 and requested $2.40 billion for FY2009. The NPS aims to conserve and interpret natural, cultural, and historic resources for public enjoyment, facing challenges in balancing recreational use with preservation. The National Park Service faces management challenges in balancing recreational use of parklands with resource preservation and funding. Activities that remove resources are not allowed, and the NPS supports preservation of natural and historic places. Yellowstone National Park was the first national park established in 1872, preceding the creation of the NPS in 1916. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Congress created national parks like Sequoia, Yosemite, Mount Rainier, Crater Lake, and Glacier from western public lands to promote tourism. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allowed the President to designate national monuments on federal lands with historic or scientific interest, managed by the NPS. The National Park Service (NPS) was established in 1916 by President Wilson to manage and protect national parks and monuments. The NPS promotes and regulates the use of federal areas to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the park system in 1933 by transferring national monuments and historic sites to the NPS. The 110th Congress is currently considering legislation related to the NPS. The 110th Congress is considering legislation and oversight on various National Park Service (NPS) related topics, including proposals to enhance NPS funding, addressing the maintenance backlog, science-related activities, security of NPS units, and management of wild and scenic rivers. This report does not cover topics primarily affecting other federal lands and agencies. For more information on federal land management, refer to CRS Report R40225. Information on NPS funding, maintenance backlog, science activities, security, and wild and scenic rivers is being considered by the 110th Congress. Additional details on NPS management can be found in various CRS reports, including those on appropriations, BLM and Forest Service lands, and creating new NPS units. Legislation in recent Congresses has been considered to study, designate, and fund National Heritage Areas (NHAs) and establish criteria for managing NHAs. There has been increased demand for recreational opportunities on federal lands, including motorized off-highway vehicles (OHVs). Initiatives have been proposed by the Administration and Congress to strengthen visitor services and park programs in preparation for the NPS's 100th anniversary in 2016. The National Park Centennial Initiative, announced in 2006, aims to raise $3 billion over 10 years for parks through public/private efforts. It includes adding $100 million annually in discretionary funds, challenging the public to donate $100 million annually, and matching public donations with federal funds. The Administration requested $2.13 billion for park operations in FY2009, an increase of $160.9 million from FY2008. FY2009 appropriations for NPS programs are pending. The Administration sought an increase in park operations for FY2008 as part of the National Park Centennial Initiative. Legislation has been introduced to establish a mandatory program with $100 million annually for 10 years to match private donations. The funds will finance \"signature projects and programs\" identified by the NPS Director. The National Park Centennial Initiative aims to increase park operations by establishing a fund for signature projects and programs identified by the NPS Director. Another House bill proposes a National Park Centennial Fund of $30 million annually over 10 years, with funds available without further appropriation. The bill specifies seven park initiatives in areas such as education, diversity, and environmental protection. Matching funds are not required, but the Secretary of the Interior may accept them. The bill proposes a $30.0 million offset for the Centennial Fund by repealing a provision of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this provision would not affect direct spending. The debate revolves around financing the Centennial Fund, initially planned to be funded by fees for commercial activities on DOI lands. The bill proposes various financing mechanisms for the Centennial Fund, including establishing new fees for commercial activities on DOI lands, creating a $100.0 million Centennial Fund annually for 10 years, and using revenues from offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico and special postage stamps. Additionally, the bill requires the Administration to submit annual funding proposals consistent with certain criteria. The bill proposes funding mechanisms for the Centennial Fund, including new fees for commercial activities, a $100 million annual fund for 10 years, and using revenues from offshore oil and gas activities. The Secretary of the Interior can accept donations for projects, with debates on the role of private donors in park funding and concerns about commercialization and private influence. Discussions also include whether to seek private contributions first before federal matching, or provide federal funding without a private match requirement. The FY2008 appropriations law included $24.6 million to match private donations for 110 projects eligible for funding. The Administration expects legislation to create a ten-year program for the Centennial Fund. The Administration plans to establish a ten-year program with $100.0 million in mandatory funding per year for the National Park Centennial Fund. Congress debates funding levels for maintaining infrastructure and acquiring new assets. The National Park Service faces a significant deferred maintenance backlog estimated at $6.12 billion to $13.11 billion for FY2007, with a focus on roads, bridges, and trails. Other federal land management agencies also have maintenance backlogs, but attention has primarily been on the NPS backlog. The Forest Service estimated its backlog at $5.66 billion, while the Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management had smaller backlogs. The National Park Service and other agencies have a combined maintenance backlog estimated at $14.39 billion to $22.26 billion. The agencies attribute the backlog to decades of funding shortfalls, leading to accelerated deterioration of facilities. The Administration proposed $471.5 million for total maintenance in FY2009, with a focus on cyclic maintenance to prevent further deterioration. The Administration is seeking $189.7 million for NPS deferred maintenance for FY2009, with funding also provided through other sources like the NPS construction appropriation and fee receipts. The DOI estimates the NPS backlog has increased from $4.25 billion in FY1999 to $9.61 billion in FY2007. The NPS backlog increased from $4.25 billion in FY1999 to $9.61 billion in FY2007. It is unclear what caused the change, whether due to delayed maintenance or more accurate estimates. The total funding provided for backlogged maintenance during this period is also uncertain. Annual budget requests and appropriations do not specifically allocate funds for backlog maintenance, but rather combine funding for all NPS construction, facility operation, and regular and deferred maintenance. In FY2002, the Bush Administration aimed to eliminate the backlog over five years, with a proposed investment of $4.9 billion. The NPS budget justification for FY2008 mentioned an \"almost $5 billion federal investment\" in addressing the backlog, but this figure includes appropriations for various line items, of which deferred maintenance is just one part. The NPS has been defining and quantifying its maintenance needs by developing computerized systems for tracking and prioritizing maintenance projects. They use industry standard measurements like the Asset Priority Index (API) and Facility Condition Index (FCI) to assess the importance and condition of facilities. The NPS uses the Facility Condition Index (FCI) to assess facility conditions and prioritize maintenance funding. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate the maintenance backlog by the NPS's 2016 centennial anniversary. The National Park Centennial Fund is established to address the NPS maintenance backlog and protect natural and cultural resources. It will be funded by taxpayer designations on tax returns and supplemented by contributions from the General Fund of the Treasury. The fund will receive $200.0 million for FY2008, increasing by 15% annually until FY2016. After 2016, the fund will supplement annual appropriations for park operations. The Government Accountability Office will provide biennial reports on Congress's progress in eliminating the NPS deficit in operating funds. The progress of Congress in eliminating the NPS deficit in operating funds and the funding needs of national parks compared with park appropriations are being reported. Three bills on the Senate calendar relate to the NPS maintenance backlog, with provisions regarding National Heritage Areas and federal agencies' maintenance backlog. Annual reports on federally owned land maintenance costs are to be made available to the public. The Federal Government is addressing the maintenance backlog of each agency, including the cost of buildings and structures. Science-related issues in park management, such as monitoring air quality and regional haze, are being addressed through programs like the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. Newly designated parks and wilderness areas must be classified as Class I areas by state actions to protect them from visibility impairment caused by air pollution. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed changes to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) rules in June 2007 to determine if proposed activities would degrade air quality in Class I areas. Proponents argue current rules are too restrictive, while opponents fear increased emissions from coal-fired power plants in these areas. The National Park Service (NPS) monitors air quality indicators at 60 park units and uses data from state and local monitoring stations. In its 2006 report, the NPS found that 86% of park units showed stable air quality from 1996-2005. The National Parks Conservation Association released a report in August 2006, stating that air pollution is a significant issue in parks. They provided 10 recommendations to improve air quality. Another concern is the commercialization of unique organisms in parks, with a draft Environmental Impact Statement completed in September 2006. The preferred alternative for researchers involves a benefits-sharing agreement before using research results commercially. NPS supports natural resources research, including air quality studies and cooperative ecosystem research. Funding for natural resources research has increased modestly in recent years. The Park Service conducts cultural resources research, including archaeological inventories, reports on cultural landscapes and structures, museum collections, and historical research. Funding has increased from $18.0 million in FY2002 to $19.9 million in FY2008, with a request for $20.3 million in FY2009. Congress funds these programs under NPS Resource Stewardship, with a total of $373.0 million appropriated for FY2008 and a request for $410.4 million for FY2009. The NPS has sought to enhance its ability to prepare for and respond to threats since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The NPS has focused on security enhancements at national icons and along U.S. borders to prepare for and respond to threats. This includes expanding physical security assessments, increasing patrols, implementing terrorism response training, and reducing equipment backlog. Law enforcement rangers and special agents have increased patrols, electronic monitoring, intelligence monitoring, and training in preemptive and response measures. Measures have been taken to increase security. The NPS has implemented security measures to protect national icons and borders, including increasing patrols and implementing terrorism response training. A 2008 assessment by the DOI Inspector General identified weaknesses in park police management that affect security. Recommendations included hiring a senior-level security professional, developing asset security plans, and upgrading surveillance cameras. The Department of Interior (DOI) has improved security at national icons and monuments since 2001, creating a central security office and implementing physical security plans. Recommendations include linking security rankings to funding priorities and balancing core mission with security needs. Legislation on immigration reform and border security also impacts national park units. Legislation related to immigration reform and border security impacts national park units along U.S. borders. Provisions include the construction of fences and barriers, creation of a border zone controlled by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and transfer of land from agencies managing border lands to Homeland Security. Additionally, there are calls for studies on the effects of physical barriers on park units, as well as proposals to increase customs and border protection personnel and provide surveillance equipment for border lands, with priority for National Park Service units. Legislation related to immigration reform and border security impacts national park units along U.S. borders. Provisions include the construction of fences and barriers, creation of a border zone controlled by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and transfer of land from agencies managing border lands to Homeland Security. Additionally, there are calls for studies on the effects of physical barriers on park units, as well as proposals to increase customs and border protection personnel and provide surveillance equipment for border lands, with priority for National Park Service units. Bills such as S. 1348, H.R. 1645, S. 2366, S. 2368, and H.R. 4088 aim to develop a border protection strategy that safeguards NPS units and other federal land areas. These bills also authorize the employment of additional law enforcement officers and special agents by the Department of the Interior. The law mandates the construction of physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along less than 700 miles of the southwest border for enhanced control. Recent issues include the impact of illegal border activities on federal lands, efforts to secure federal lands, and initiatives to address illegal border activities such as drug trafficking, alien smuggling, and terrorism. The impact of illegal activities on federal lands, including damage from organized crime and terrorism, has led to concerns about security efforts and funding for the National Park Service (NPS). In FY2009, the President requested increased funds for the US Park Police (USPP) and law enforcement to hire new officers. The President requested $169.8 million for law enforcement in FY2009, a 10% increase over the previous year. The funding is intended to enhance law enforcement at park units along the southwest border addressing resource damage and safety issues from illegal immigration, as well as protect historic structures and archaeological sites. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was authorized in 1968 to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for future generations. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System classifies rivers as wild, scenic, or recreational based on various factors. Congress designates rivers into the system, which now includes 166 river units spanning 11,434.2 miles in 38 states and Puerto Rico. The NPS manages 37 river units totaling 3,043.7 miles. Legislation is enacted to study rivers for potential inclusion in the system, with a national registry of eligible rivers maintained by the NPS. The Nationwide Rivers Inventory (NRI) identifies rivers with \"outstandingly remarkable\" values for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture assess study areas for designation, with Congress making final designations. Designated rivers are managed by federal agencies like NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS, with each agency required to develop a management plan to protect river values. The managing agency establishes boundaries for each component of the system within limitations. Management of lands within river corridors has been controversial, with debates over the impact on private lands, activities within the corridor, and local input in developing management plans. State-nominated rivers must be designated for protection under state law, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and administered by a state agency. The 110th Congress is considering legislation to designate, study, or extend components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. On May 8, 2008, segments of the Eightmile River in Connecticut were designated as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The law requires the Secretary of the Interior to administer segments of the main stem and specified tributaries of the Eightmile River, totaling about 25.3 miles, as a scenic river. The 109th Congress enacted legislation to designate, study, or extend specific components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including the Upper White Salmon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 2005 and the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act. The Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Study Act (P.L. 109-370) directs the NPS to evaluate a 40-mile stretch of the lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook in CT for possible inclusion in the system."
