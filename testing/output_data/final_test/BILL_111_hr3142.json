    "content": "The Act is titled as the \"Homeowners' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Act\" and includes a Mortgage Emergency Assistance Program. The Secretary will establish a program to make mortgage payments for a 1- to 4-family residence when certain conditions are met, including unpaid monthly installments and financial hardship beyond the mortgagor's control. The program will provide assistance to the mortgagor if they can resume full mortgage payments within 36 months, the property is their principal residence, they do not own other mortgaged residential property, they have applied for assistance, and have not been more than 60 days in arrears on a residential mortgage in the past 2 years. The mortgagor must demonstrate that prior delinquency was due to financial hardship beyond their control. If found ineligible, they cannot reapply for assistance for 6 months unless there is a material change in their financial circumstances. Financial hardship can be caused by a reduction in income or an increase in expenses. If a mortgagor faces financial hardship (such as loss of job, reduced income, illness, divorce, or death in the household), the Secretary may consider employment history, credit, and income. Nonprofit housing counseling agencies in each State are designated to assist in implementing the program. Nonprofit housing agencies approved under this subsection must assist eligible mortgagors for the entire duration of their assistance under this Act. SEC. 3. LEGAL ACTION. Legal action regarding a mortgage for a 1- to 4-family residence is prohibited unless the mortgagee sends notice to the mortgagor and meets certain time requirements, including a 30-day notice period and an initial meeting with an approved counseling agency. The Secretary shall issue regulations for a uniform notice informing mortgagors of potential temporary assistance for mortgage payments under this Act. The notice to inform mortgagors of mortgage assistance must include program details, meeting attendance requirement, legal action explanation, approved counseling agencies list, sent via first class mail, and comply with Secretary's requirements. SEC. 4. APPLICATION FOR ASSISTANCE. To apply for assistance under this Act, a mortgagor must attend a face-to-face meeting with the mortgagee or an approved counseling agency within 30 days of receiving notice. The meeting aims to restructure the mortgage payment schedule to prevent legal action. If the mortgagor meets with the counseling agency, the agency must notify the mortgagee within 5 business days. If the mortgagor cannot resolve the default within 30 days of the meeting, they can apply for mortgage assistance under this Act. An approved counseling agency will help prepare and submit the application to the Secretary within 30 days. The Secretary may pay counseling agencies a fee for their assistance. The approved counseling agency must notify the mortgagee within 5 business days of submitting an application for assistance under this Act. The application must include a financial statement disclosing all assets, liabilities, and household income. Intentional misrepresentation of financial information may result in denial of assistance and repayment requirements. The mortgagee can take legal action to enforce the mortgage without restrictions after receiving assistance. An application for assistance can be obtained from an approved counseling agency. The Secretary must determine eligibility within 60 days and notify the mortgagor and mortgagee within 5 days of approval or denial. The Secretary provides assistance payments to eligible individuals within 60 days of application, notifying both the mortgagor and mortgagee within 5 days of approval or denial. The Secretary pays the full amount due to the mortgagee for the mortgage without acceleration, including principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and attorneys' fees. Monthly assistance payments are also provided by the Secretary. The Secretary shall make monthly mortgage assistance payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the mortgagor. The mortgagor must pay monthly payments to the Secretary, not exceeding 35% of their net effective income, for up to 36 months of eligibility. Upon receiving payment from the mortgagor, the Secretary will send the total mortgage payment directly to the mortgagee. If the mortgagor fails to pay amounts due directly to the Secretary within 15 days, a review of their financial circumstances will be conducted. If the delinquency is not due to a change in financial circumstances, future mortgage assistance payments will be terminated. If the delinquency is due to a change, the mortgagor's required payments will be modified. The Secretary may modify the mortgagor's payments as needed. Assistance payments can be provided for up to 36 months, with periodic reviews to determine continuation, termination, or adjustment of payments. SEC. 6. REPAYMENT OF ASSISTANCE. The Secretary provides assistance payments to the mortgagee, with any excess amount becoming a loan to the mortgagor. The mortgagor must repay the assistance loan, including interest, through a repayment agreement with the Secretary. Monthly payments start once mortgage assistance is no longer needed. The mortgagor must repay the assistance loan based on their housing expense relative to their net effective income. If housing expense is less than 35 percent, the mortgagor pays the difference to the Secretary. If housing expense is more than 35 percent, repayment is deferred until housing expense decreases. The mortgagor must repay mortgage assistance if housing expense is less than 35% of net effective income. Repayment is required until the mortgage is paid in full, with interest accruing monthly at the current average yield on 30-year bonds. Repayment is secured by a lien. Repayment of assistance to the Secretary is secured by a mortgage lien on the property and other obligations as required. The lien does not take priority over other existing liens on the property. Repayment must be made within 14 days after each mortgage payment is due or when the mortgage is paid in full. Subordination of the mortgage lien may be allowed for home improvement loans necessary to preserve the property. Repayment of assistance to the Secretary is secured by a mortgage lien on the property and must be made within 14 days after each mortgage payment is due or when the mortgage is paid in full. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Definitions under this Act include an approved counseling agency, gross household income, and household. The curr_chunk defines terms related to housing expenses, mortgagee, mortgagor, net effective income, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. SEC. 8. Authorization of appropriations for providing assistance under this Act and related costs."
