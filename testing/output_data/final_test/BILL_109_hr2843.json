FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that remote control railroad operations pose a security threat as terrorists could easily access and operate locomotives carrying hazardous materials, potentially causing intentional accidents. The risk of terrorists hijacking remote control locomotive operations is too great, potentially causing intentional accidents with other trains carrying hazardous materials and disrupting commerce. SEC. 2 prohibits railroad carriers from using remote control locomotives to transport hazardous materials. Violations result in civil penalties ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 per violation. Each day of violation is considered a separate offense. SEC. 3 of the Act mandates railroad carriers to maintain an inventory of remote control transmitters, assign them only to authorized personnel, and keep them secure when not in use. Violating this rule incurs a civil penalty of at least $5,000 per occurrence. SEC. 4 of the Act requires the manual control area of remote control locomotives to be locked when operated without railroad carrier personnel. Violating this rule incurs a civil penalty of at least $5,000 per occurrence. SEC. 5 of the Act outlines the process for imposing civil penalties on railroad carriers for violations. The Secretary of Transportation must provide notice and a hearing before finding a violation and imposing a penalty. The amount of the penalty is determined based on various factors, including the nature of the violation and the violator's culpability. The Attorney General can take civil action to collect the penalty. SEC. 6. CRIMINAL PENALTY. A railroad carrier violating this Act may face fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. In cases involving hazardous material release resulting in death or injury, the maximum imprisonment is 10 years. Violations require actual knowledge or reasonable care by the carrier.
