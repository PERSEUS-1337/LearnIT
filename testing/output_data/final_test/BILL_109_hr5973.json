The \"Hydrogen Transportation Wins Over Growing Reliance on Oil (H2 GROW) Act\" offers a 50% tax credit for expenses on qualified hydrogen-powered vehicle refueling property installation. The credit is applicable in the year the property is put into service by the taxpayer. Qualified property must be depreciable and have its original use with the taxpayer. The \"Hydrogen Transportation Wins Over Growing Reliance on Oil (H2 GROW) Act\" provides a 50% tax credit for hydrogen-powered vehicle refueling property installation. The property must be used for hydrogen fuel production, storage, or dispensing at a taxpayer's facility for public vehicle fueling. The credit cannot exceed the regular tax reduced by other applicable credits, and the property's cost reduces its basis for tax purposes. The tax credit for hydrogen-powered vehicle refueling property installation under the \"Hydrogen Transportation Wins Over Growing Reliance on Oil (H2 GROW) Act\" can be carried forward for 20 years if it exceeds the limitation for the current year. No double benefit is allowed if a credit is already claimed for the property under subsection (a). Special rules apply for the credit carryforward. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the provisions of this section, with special rules applying. The section will not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2013.
