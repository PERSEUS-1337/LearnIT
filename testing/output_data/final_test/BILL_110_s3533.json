    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges the importance of judicial clerkship programs for young lawyers, recognizing their role in shaping future leaders of the legal profession. Despite various analogous programs in different branches of government, Congress lacks a similar initiative. The Congress creates the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program to engage young lawyers in the legislative process, modeled after judicial clerkship programs. This program aims to improve Congress's operations and enhance public understanding of its work. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program is established by Congress to involve young lawyers in the legislative process, similar to judicial clerkship programs. The Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program is established for appointing law school graduates as Congressional Clerks in the Senate or House of Representatives. Selection Committees from the Senate and House will choose clerks, with the Senate selecting at least 6 clerks annually for a 1-year term. The Committee on House Administration selects at least 6 Congressional Clerks each year to work for the House of Representatives. Criteria for selection include being a law school graduate with excellent academic and extracurricular records, a commitment to public service, and strong communication skills. After selection, Congressional Clerks interview for positions in Senate or House Committees or individual Members' offices. Placement requirements are overseen by Selection Committees. The Selection Committees ensure equal apportionment of Congressional Clerks between majority and minority party offices. Congressional Clerks receive compensation and benefits comparable to judicial clerks in the District of Columbia. They must adhere to all laws and regulations like other Senate or House employees and are excluded from the office's employee count. The Selection Committees develop rules for the Congressional Clerkship program, including defining a Member of the House of Representatives. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2009 and beyond from House and Senate accounts to implement the provisions of this Act."
