    "content": "When Congress enacts a new law, it can impact existing relationships, rights, and contracts. This interference can involve public contracts with the government or private contracts between parties. One notable example is the 1989 savings and loan bailout statute, which prohibited thrift institutions from including \"supervisory goodwill\" in their capital requirements. The 1989 savings and loan bailout statute prohibited thrift institutions from using \"supervisory goodwill\" towards minimum capital requirements, leading to numerous thrifts falling below the requirements and being liquidated. The United States has paid out $2.28 billion on claims filed by acquiring thrifts out of $34.34 billion sought. Additionally, a 1993 congressional enactment eliminated tax deductions for acquiring thrift institutions, impacting agreements. A bill in Congress may require renegotiation of existing collective bargaining agreements. The United States has enacted various statutes that interfere with existing contracts, such as terminating dealership contracts for financial assistance, transferring security screening at airports to federal hands, blocking prepayment of certain mortgage contracts, and terminating equipment and supply contracts under Medicare statutes. This report explores legal theories for aggrieved contract parties seeking redress in such situations. The report explores legal theories for seeking redress when federal statutes interfere with existing contracts. Claims may include breach of contract or takings under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause. Claims are not applicable if the statute only applies to contracts entered into after enactment. Protection of settled expectations in contract law is crucial for an ordered society. Government may need to address new problems, even if it means interfering with existing contracts. Congressional drafters can ensure a statute is interpreted prospectively by explicitly stating so in the bill text. Contracts generally do not provide immunity against future legislation, as stated by the Supreme Court. While Congress can interfere with existing contracts, disappointed parties may seek monetary relief. Balancing settled expectations and legislative latitude is important, even in contracts involving the government. The government's ability to contract with private parties is essential for sovereignty and practicality. The Supreme Court emphasizes that the United States must honor its contracts like individuals. While the government has certain defenses to breach of contract that private parties do not, courts are hesitant to allow the government to avoid its contractual obligations simply because it is sovereign. When the government enters into a contract, it is entitled to the same protections as a private party. The distinction between the government acting in a sovereign versus proprietary capacity affects the application of takings theory. Government's sovereign immunity must be waived for claims of congressional interference with contract rights. This waiver applies to breach of contract and takings claims. The Tucker Act and Little Tucker Act waive sovereign immunity for breach and takings claims against the United States, vesting jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The Tucker Act covers claims based on the Constitution and contracts, including takings claims, as the Takings Clause does not waive sovereign immunity. The Tucker Act and Little Tucker Act waive sovereign immunity for breach and takings claims against the United States. The Little Tucker Act gives federal district courts jurisdiction over claims up to $10,000, while the Tucker Act covers claims based on the Constitution and contracts. The remedy available under both statutes is exclusively monetary. The Tucker Act and Little Tucker Act provide monetary remedies for breach and takings claims against the United States. Specific performance or injunctive relief is not available, only damages or just compensation can be sought. Appeals from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or federal district courts go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Due process claims cannot be heard under these acts. A \"public contract\" is a contract with the United States as a party, involving the purchase or sale of goods, services, or resources on public lands. These contracts differ from traditional private contracts due to the government's dual roles as sovereign and contracting party. Types of public contracts include those conferring benefits, implementing statutory programs, or involving government purchases. Appeals for claims under the Tucker Act must go to a federal district court under federal question jurisdiction, not the Federal Circuit. The concept of breach of contract involves the failure of one party to perform a promised action in a contract, leading to potential relief such as damages. Challenges to congressional interference with public contracts are often based on breach of contract. The United States is bound by its contracts like individuals, with similar breach rules applying. Scrutinizing the contract terms is the first step in determining if a federal enactment has breached the contract. If the contract anticipates later congressional actions, it may not constitute a breach. In cases where a federal enactment is questioned for breaching a contract, the key lies in whether the contract explicitly or implicitly allows for such actions. For instance, in Mobil Oil and Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States, the Supreme Court had to determine if a federal statute constituted an anticipatory breach of pre-existing federal lease contracts with oil and gas producers. Special mention goes to instances like the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, where financial institutions faced contract breaches due to changes in tax laws affecting their acquired assets. The Guarini amendment in 1993 abolished the deductibility of losses on the sale of assets of acquired institutions, breaching federal agreements with acquiring institutions. This breach was held to violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Centex Corp. v. United States case. The Guarini amendment in 1993 abolished the deductibility of losses on the sale of assets of acquired institutions, breaching federal agreements with acquiring institutions. The court found that Congress had eliminated the benefit to reduce excessive costs of acquisition transactions, impacting specific contracts deemed unduly favorable. Congress's imposition of additional requirements on entities previously contracted with the United States may be seen as a breach, as seen in Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States. Companies paid $156 million to the Department of the Interior for lease contracts to explore and produce oil and gas off the North Carolina coast. After submitting an exploration plan, Congress enacted the Outer Banks Protection Act, adding new conditions to the Secretary's approval process. The oil companies claimed this violated their lease contracts, leading the Supreme Court to agree and entitle them to restitution of the upfront payments. The delays caused by the new act were found to breach lease contracts, making lessees subject only to requirements in those leases and existing law. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 led to contracts between the Department of Energy and nuclear power providers for spent fuel disposal, but Congress's failure to authorize a repository has resulted in breach of contract claims and $2.1 billion in damages since 1998. Since 1998, 81 breach of contract claims against the Department of Energy have resulted in $2.1 billion in damage awards and settlements out of $8.6 billion sought. As of August 9, 2012, 33 cases are still pending, including some on appeal to the Federal Circuit. The defense of sovereign immunity cannot be asserted by the United States in breach cases due to waivers in the Tucker Acts. The sovereign act defense states that the United States is not contractually liable for its \"public and general\" acts as sovereign. The doctrine of sovereign acts balances the government's need for legislative freedom with its obligation to honor contracts. It ensures that government contractors and private contractors are affected the same way by public and general enactments. In Yankee Atomic Electric Co. v. United States, legislation requiring payment into a cleanup fund did not breach a pre-existing contractual agreement. The court rejected the breach claim, stating that the legislation was not meant to increase the contract price retroactively for the government's benefit as a contractor. It was enacted to address contamination at enrichment facilities and the need for decommissioning, benefiting the public. The government could assert a sovereign act defense, but federal legislation targeting existing contracts specifically does not qualify for this defense. An example is seen in Winstar Corp. v. United States, where Congress withdrew an accounting device from federal contracts after thrift institutions acquired failing thrifts. The Supreme Court ruled that the United States could not invoke the sovereign acts defense in this case. The defense of sovereign acts was deemed inappropriate due to the impact on the government's contractual obligations and financial interests. The unmistakability defense asserts that Congress's sovereign power cannot be contracted away unless clearly empowered to do so. Both doctrines overlap in examining governmental actions breaching contracts, but applying the unmistakability doctrine raises questions. The dispute arises from governmental action alleged to breach an existing contract, with questions on the application of the unmistakability doctrine. The majority rule, as seen in Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority v. United States, states that legislation outside the sovereign acts doctrine falls outside the unmistakability doctrine. This was exemplified in a case involving changes to rent subsidies under the Housing Act of 1937, breaching existing contracts. The court found that the new law breached existing contracts as it did not fall under the unmistakability doctrine. The law targeted HUD's contractual obligations to reduce costs, which was deemed actionable. The government's ability to terminate contracts for convenience is protected by sovereign defense, allowing Congress to cancel contracts. The government has the sovereign defense to terminate contracts for convenience, allowing Congress to cancel them, especially in federal procurement contracts. This defense is not dependent on being expressly stated in government contracts but is often included in clauses for contracts where the United States receives goods or services. The government has the sovereign defense to terminate contracts for convenience, allowing Congress to cancel them, especially in federal procurement contracts. Such clauses serve to notify the unwary government contracting partner of the federal termination power and define damages owed upon termination. Plaintiffs often add a takings claim under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause when filing breach of contract complaints against the United States, as contract rights are considered property under the Takings Clause. The government reserves the power to amend statutes and agreements, which does not constitute a taking of contract rights. Implied authority to amend agreements under a statute prevents property rights from accruing. A reservation of the right to amend may not always need to be express but can be implied from prior government actions. Breach of contract and takings claims against the United States are often brought together. The Court of Federal Claims and Federal Circuit tend to prioritize breach theory over takings claims in cases against the United States. This preference is based on the idea that interference with contractual rights typically leads to a breach claim rather than a taking claim. For instance, in cases related to Congress's withdrawal of an accounting technique in the S&L bailout statute, most decisions have been based solely on breach grounds, with only a few exceptions. Various reasons have been given for this emphasis on breach adjudication by the courts. The Federal Circuit's preference for breach adjudication in cases involving the United States is based on several reasons. One key factor is that the government enters contracts in a proprietary capacity, leading to remedies arising from the contracts themselves. Additionally, courts tend to prioritize breach claims over takings claims, especially when there are non-constitutional grounds for resolution. This approach results in dismissal of taking claims if a breach claim is made, or both theories can be pleaded but the taking claim is secondary. The debate over pursuing breach, taking, or both legal theories is significant. If a breach claim is found, the taking claim is dismissed; if not, the taking claim may proceed. However, if the taking claim is based on a property right independent of the contract, it may still be pursued. The issue of which theory to pursue is not just a technicality but can have a substantial impact on potential recovery. The choice between pursuing breach, taking, or both legal theories can significantly impact the plaintiff's recovery. Damages for breach of contract may include additional losses, while takings law typically does not cover such losses. Prejudgment interest is mandated in takings claims but not in breach cases. The sovereign act defense is only available for breach claims. The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause imposes substantive constraints on federal legislation. The Supreme Court's substantive due process constraints for economic legislation are minimal, requiring only a rational basis connecting means and government end. Retroactive aspects of legislation may face more scrutiny, especially when abrogating contracts for federal revenue enhancement. Lynch v. United States highlighted stricter scrutiny for such actions during the Depression. In Lynch v. United States, a 1933 statute withdrawing the consent of the United States to be sued under contracts of war risk insurance from World War I was held to violate due process. In Perry v. United States, a 1933 joint resolution purporting to abrogate a clause in government war bonds calling for payment in \"gold coin of the present standard of value\" was held invalid. The Court based its decision on Congress's power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, stating that no breach of contract action can be filed against the United States when it interferes with an existing private contract. The chief legal constraints on congressional interference with existing private contracts stem from the Constitution, particularly the Takings Clause and Due Process Clause. The Impairment of Contracts Clause only applies to states, not the federal government. Courts have more leeway in impairing private contract rights than federal government obligations due to the lack of governmental self-interest in private contracts. The Constitution imposes legal constraints on congressional interference with private contracts, primarily through the Takings Clause and Due Process Clause. Unlike states, the federal government has more freedom to impair contract rights. Successful challenges to federal interference with private contracts are rare, as Congress has considerable leeway in shaping economic policies. The Supreme Court allows Congress leeway in economic legislation to affect private contracts. In Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, the Court ruled that government actions incidentally interfering with contracts are not considered takings. The Supreme Court ruled in Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States that government requisitioning of steel plates during World War I did not constitute an appropriation of contract rights. The Court explained that the government's action made performance under the contract impossible, but did not acquire the contract right itself. Therefore, the company's losses due to nonperformance were considered consequential and not subject to takings law remedies. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act transferred airport security responsibilities to a federal agency, eliminating the value of security services' contracts. The Federal Circuit rejected the takings challenge, stating that the losses were caused indirectly and did not constitute a taking. The Omnia rule establishes limits on takings claims, stating that no taking occurs when a contract is frustrated by government action not directed at the claimant. This was seen in cases involving lease contracts and a nuclear waste transporter, where losses were deemed consequential and noncompensable. The Omnia rule has three limits. It does not apply when congressional legislation targets an existing contract right. In such cases, the Penn Central test is used to assess the impact on the contract. This test evaluates the economic impact, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. The meaning of these factors is still evolving after 34 years, making the Penn Central test difficult to satisfy. The Penn Central test is challenging to satisfy, especially for plaintiffs asserting takings claims based on targeted legislation. Examples show the uphill battle for parties to private contracts under this test, where the economic impact and interference with expectations are evaluated. In one case, the Supreme Court found no taking of rights under a collective bargaining agreement despite a federal statute requiring additional contributions to a pension plan. The government action in the pension plan case did not constitute a taking as it did not involve invasion or appropriation, and the United States did not take anything for its own use. In another case, Conrail was relieved of its contract duty without a taking of contract rights. Omnia does not apply when the United States takes over a contract right rather than just affecting it. The United States did not take over the obligation of the steel manufacturer to deliver, as noted in the Omnia case. The Court later found a taking when the United States appropriated all the rights and advantages of a contract assignee. Legislative impairment of existing private contract rights would not be tested under Penn Central. A government action directly blocking transfer of consideration may not constitute a taking if only one party has performed. For example, U.S. sanctions against Libya prevented Americans from working for Libyan enterprises, leading to termination of employment contracts. The court ruled this did not constitute a taking as the economic impact was minimal since the employment had not yet begun. The plaintiffs faced a loss of income due to sanctions, which interfered with existing contracts. Substantive due process constraints on economic legislation are minimal, requiring legislation to not be arbitrary. Government interference with contracts must be substantial to warrant closer scrutiny. If an impairment of contract is found, the court determines if it is of constitutional dimension. If the impairment is minimal, the inquiry may end; if substantial, the legislation is examined more closely. The Fifth Amendment due process review for economic legislation impairing private contracts is minimal, requiring a high burden of proof to show legislative arbitrariness. The Supreme Court does not view government interference with private contracts in the same light as its own contracts. Substantive due process challenges to such legislation have not been successful."
