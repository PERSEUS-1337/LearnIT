A seller of travel must register with the Attorney General's office at least 10 days before conducting business in the state. The registration requires filing necessary information and a $100 fee for each business location. A late fee of $5 per day, up to $500, is applicable for delays. Registration will not be approved until all fees are paid. The seller is considered to be doing business in the state if they solicit business from locations within the state.

Prior to transferring or selling any interest in a seller of travel, the owner must file a notice with the Attorney General's office, providing necessary information about the transferee. The selling, encumbering, or transferring owner is responsible for all obligations imposed by law on the transferee sellers of travel until the required notice is filed. The Attorney General can suspend the registration of a seller of travel who fails to make payments or submits a check that bounces. The seller will be notified by mail and their registration will remain suspended until all fees are paid. The Attorney General has the authority to outsource the processing of registrations as needed. An individual exempt from this section must have a written contract with a registered seller of travel, act solely on behalf of that seller, provide services offered by the seller, and not receive payment from the passenger. The individual must disclose they are acting on behalf of a registered seller of travel and provide the seller's information. These disclosures must be made in writing to the passenger and displayed on the person's website and in the first email to the passenger regarding their purchase.
