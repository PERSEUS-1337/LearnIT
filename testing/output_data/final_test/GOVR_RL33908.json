    "content": "The General Mining Law of 1872 governs mining of hardrock minerals on federal lands, promoting mineral exploration and development in the western United States. It grants free access to prospect for minerals on public domain lands and allows individuals and corporations to stake a claim upon discovery of a deposit. Valid claims entitle holders to develop the minerals, excluding coal. Public domain lands are those retained under federal ownership since acquisition by treaty, cession, or purchase. The 1872 Mining Law governs mining of hardrock minerals on federal lands in the western United States. Acquired lands are subject to leasing only and not covered by the law. Major minerals developed include copper, silver, gold, lead, zinc, molybdenum, and uranium in states like Colorado, California, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona. The Mining Law of 1872 governs hardrock mineral mining on federal lands in the western United States, including states like Colorado, California, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona. Prospectors can locate claims on public lands believed to contain valuable minerals, with an annual maintenance fee of $125 per claim. Claimants with 10 claims or fewer may request a waiver of the fee and perform annual assessment work instead. Additionally, there is a $30 fee for first-time locators to record a claim, with fees adjusted every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. The annual maintenance fee for mining claims on federal lands is $125 per claim, with a waiver available for claimants with 10 claims or fewer. Fees are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. Revenue from maintenance and location fees totaled $54.7 million in FY2007 and $39.0 million in FY2008. A fee of $250 per patent application plus $50 per claim within each application has been required since January 3, 1989. If a patent application is approved, the claimant may purchase surface and mineral rights at a rate of $2.50 per acre. The per-acre fees for purchasing surface and mineral rights for placer and lode claims are $2.50 and $5 respectively. There is no limit on the number of claims a person can locate, no requirement for mineral production, and claims can be held indefinitely. The Mining Law allows for the claiming of mineral rights in states like Nevada, Arizona, California, Montana, and Wyoming. The number of active claims has fluctuated over the years, with a significant drop in FY1993 due to maintenance fees, and a rise in FY1997 due to the strength of the gold and copper industries. However, the number of active claims fell in FY2001 due to policy changes and delays in obtaining mining permissions. The Mining Law allows for claiming mineral rights in states like Nevada, Arizona, California, Montana, and Wyoming. Active claims stood at 207,241 in FY2005, with only a small percentage ever patented. Patenting a claim gives legal title to both surface and minerals, relieving the holder of annual fees. Congress enacted moratoria on mineral patents starting in FY1995, but applications meeting requirements filed before September 30, 1994, are allowed to proceed. The patent moratorium allows certain applications filed before September 30, 1994, to proceed, with third-party contractors authorized to process mineral examinations. It aims to prevent the transfer of public lands to the private sector, except for 237 pending applications. The annual moratorium on patenting creates uncertainty regarding potential reforms to the 1872 Mining Law. The mining industry seeks clarity for long-term planning, while environmentalists argue that the moratorium does not address environmental concerns. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 removed certain minerals from the claim-patent system of the 1872 Mining Law and established a leasing system for federal public domain lands. Coal was also included in this act. Common variety minerals were sold under the Materials Act of 1947. The Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of 1947 authorized leasing of leasable minerals in some acquired federal lands. The Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 and subsequent acts addressed environmental protection and management of federal lands, impacting mineral development. The Mining Law lacks direct environmental controls, but mining claims must adhere to general environmental laws. The industry must comply with Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, state reclamation standards, and relevant federal and state statutes. The Mining Law lacks direct environmental controls but mining claims must adhere to general environmental laws, Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, state reclamation standards, and relevant federal and state statutes. The evolving leasing system and withdrawals of lands from hardrock exploration have reduced the lands under the Mining Law authority. Critics argue the law is outdated, while supporters believe the current system works well. The National Mining Association asserts that the existing law meets essential criteria for mineral tenure. Mineral tenure law provides access to explore for minerals on public lands, with exclusive rights to develop valuable minerals. Existing unpatented oil shale claims were continued under the 1872 Mining Law. The Department of the Interior sought to invalidate these claims in the 1980s, but a court ruled in favor of claimants. Legislation to resolve oil shale issues was enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Legislation in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 addressed oil shale issues by offering general and limited patents for oil shale exploration. Limited patent holders must post a reclamation bond and pay $2.50 per acre. The claim-patent system allows for mineral exploration on public lands, which is supported by the mining industry for its benefits in bringing economic deposits into production. Critics of the Mining Law argue that restrictions on free access and security of tenure could hinder exploration efforts by mining firms, leading to increased costs and negative impacts on the industry and the country. They believe the claim-patent system gives away publicly owned resources without adequate royalties. Critics also argue that the current system creates land management issues by allowing private ownership of patented lands. The claim-patent system allows mineral claims to be held indefinitely without production, leading to concerns about speculative holding of claims. Critics argue that the system lacks adequate environmental protection and allows for non-mineral use of lands once patented. Discovery and prediscovery protection issues also arise under the Mining Law. The claimant has a valid possessory right against all parties once a valid location is established. Demonstrating discovery of a mineral deposit requires time, effort, and expense. The federal government typically allows claims based on general indications of a deposit, requiring proof of discovery only upon patent application. The industry aims to maintain free access and the right to obtain a patent, opposing major challenges to these principles. The industry opposes placing hardrock minerals under a leasing system due to concerns about federal government control, royalty payments, and government ownership. Proposals to amend the 1872 Mining Law include modifying the claim-patent system to require payment of fair market value and royalties, or converting it to a permitting system with added environmental standards. The mineral industry opposes placing hardrock minerals under a leasing system, citing concerns about federal government control, royalty payments, and government ownership. Proposed changes to the 1872 Mining Law include modifying the claim-patent system to require payment of fair market value and royalties, or converting it to a permitting system with added environmental standards. Supporters argue that comprehensive hardrock mining reform would burden the Department of the Interior and increase costs through royalties and rents. Proposed changes include eliminating the distinction between lode and placer claims, imposing time limits for claim development, expanding claim sizes, providing better prediscovery protection, and opening more public lands to mineral exploration. The current Mining Law allows claimants to produce minerals without a patent or paying royalties to the federal Treasury, which is seen as a subsidy by many. The mineral industry receives subsidies through various means, including not paying royalties to the federal government for mineral production on federal lands, claiming surface and mineral estates at below market value, and benefiting from tax incentives like the depletion allowance. The Clinton Administration considered eliminating these subsidies as a way to reform the industry. The Clinton Administration proposed charging mining companies a 5% fee on net smelter production from hardrock mining on federal lands to increase revenues and ensure a fair return to taxpayers. Proponents argue that incentives are necessary for those taking financial risks in mineral development, as mining is a capital-intensive process with years of development before production. The Bush Administration has not made a similar proposal in its budget requests. The mining industry opposes legislation to repeal the percentage depletion allowance and argues that new cost increases without cost reductions may make U.S. mineral deposits less competitive. Mineral prices fluctuate, and several nations are rewriting their mining laws to attract more investment, but political risks exist in developing countries. Critics highlight that the federal government may not receive fair market value for mineral resources. Critics argue that the federal government does not receive fair market value for land and resources transfers under the Mining Law, as it does not collect royalties or rents from mining activities. The price for clear title to surface and mineral rights has remained unchanged since 1872, based on outdated values. Determining fair market value for mineral-bearing lands is complex and controversial, with a 1989 GAO report estimating it to be substantially higher than the current per-acre prices. The GAO estimated that the federal government received less than $4,500 for 20 patents reviewed since 1970, despite lands being valued between $13.8 million and $47.9 million. The appraisal method was criticized by the Bureau of Land Management in 1989. The estimates were based on recent sales of comparable land, not the value at the time of patenting. BLM argued that sales of adjacent tracts with no mineral potential cannot establish fair market value. The value of hardrock mineral production on federal land was estimated at $600 million for FY2005, a decrease from $1.8 billion in FY1993. Acreage conveyed out of federal ownership through patenting has contributed to this decline. The lack of direct statutory authority for environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 has led to reform proposals. Critics argue that current environmental laws do not provide adequate protection for mined areas and suggest withdrawing lands from development under the Mining Law. Critics argue that federal land managers lack regulatory authority over patented mining claims and call for clear legal authority to ensure proper reclamation of mining sites. Cleaning up over 500,000 abandoned hardrock mine sites in the US is a major concern, with the BLM's Abandoned Mine Lands Program inventorying 11,000 sites and initiating cleanup efforts. The EPA lists over 40 abandoned mine sites for cleanup, and BLM oversees federal subsurface minerals on approximately 700 million acres of land. The Bureau of Land Management oversees mineral operations on 56 million acres of Indian trust lands, with 165 million acres withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those statutorily withdrawn. Another 182 million acres require approval from the surface management agency for mineral development. The Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA) mandates a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine if existing withdrawals should continue. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, with the BLM Director, Secretary, and the public convinced that certain lands should not be opened to multiple use, including mining and mineral leasing. Mineral industry representatives argue that federal withdrawals inhibit mineral exploration and limit the reserve base, as mineral reserves are not renewable. Mining industry supporters argue that mineral reserves are not renewable, and without new reserves or technological advancements, production costs may rise. They believe that higher domestic costs could lead to increased exploration on foreign soil, increasing import dependence. Critics of the Mining Law argue that mining often exclusively uses land, precluding other uses and potentially harming land values and uses. They point to unreclaimed mined areas, Superfund sites from past mining, and potential adverse effects on development from resource extraction. The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009 (H.R. 699) was introduced to reform the General Mining Law of 1872. It would limit patent issuance to claimants meeting specific requirements before September 30, 1994. The bill proposes the establishment of a Locatable Minerals Fund with two accounts for reclamation and community impact assistance. New mines would face an 8% royalty on net smelter returns, while existing mines would have a 4% royalty. Two-thirds of the royalty revenues would go towards reclamation efforts. The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009 proposes depositing royalty revenues into reclamation and community impact assistance accounts. Exploration and mining permits with reclamation plans would be required for mining activities. New reclamation standards and financial guarantees would be established. States, tribes, and political subdivisions could petition to withdraw lands from mining. Certain lands would be off-limits for mineral activities if they impair National Park system resources. The bill allows for civil suits in U.S. District Courts for those adversely affected by activities that impair National Park system resources. A hearing was held on H.R. 699, highlighting environmental and economic impacts of mining. The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009 (S. 796) was introduced in the Senate to limit patent issuance for claimants meeting specific requirements. The bill proposes increasing annual claim maintenance fees to $150 per claim, waiving fees for holders with less than 10 claims who perform required assessment work, raising location fees to $50 per claim, implementing a royalty rate of 2-5% based on production value on federal land, depositing royalty revenues into a new fund, granting royalty relief based on economic factors, and introducing exploration and mining permits. The bill proposes new requirements for non-casual mining operations on federal land, including exploration and mining permits with reclamation plans, water impact assessments, and financial assurances. The mining operations permit would be valid for 30 years with ongoing commercial production. Reclamation standards would be updated, and the Secretary would have the authority to withdraw land from the General Mining Law of 1872 based on specified criteria. Land use plans would be revised accordingly. The bill proposes new requirements for non-casual mining operations on federal land, including exploration and mining permits with reclamation plans, water impact assessments, and financial assurances. States, political subdivisions, and Indian tribes could petition the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw lands from mining under the 1872 Mining Law. A Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund would be established for restoration of land and water resources impacted by past mining in abandoned hardrock mining states and on Indian land. An abandoned mine land reclamation fee would be imposed on mine operators for deposit into the Reclamation Fund. The bill proposes new requirements for non-casual mining operations on federal land, including exploration and mining permits with reclamation plans, water impact assessments, and financial assurances. It also introduces the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2009, which aims to clean up abandoned hardrock mines by establishing a cleanup fund and imposing fees on hardrock mining operations on federal land. This includes a 4% royalty on existing hardrock mineral producers, an increase in the annual mining maintenance fee, and a requirement for miners to pay an annual reclamation fee. Miners on federal lands would be required to pay an annual reclamation fee of 0.3% of their gross annual income from mining, except for operators making less than $500,000. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 796 and S. 140 in July 2009, discussing various royalty regimes and rates. Industry supports a net income royalty, while other advocates support a gross value royalty. Other issues such as environmental permitting and mineral import dependence were also discussed. In the 110th Congress, hearings were held on a House bill (H.R. 2262) similar to H.R. 699. Industry groups opposed the 8% \"net smelter royalty\" and stricter environmental standards in the bill. Some suggested a royalty based on \"net profit\" or ability to pay, while others favored an ad-valorem royalty based on value. Supporters of the bill highlighted the high number of uranium claims near sensitive sites and the need for a dedicated revenue stream. The House passed H.R. 2262 by a vote of 244-166, addressing the need for a dedicated revenue stream for abandoned hardrock mine cleanup. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held an oversight hearing on hardrock mining on federal lands. Funds collected from an annual maintenance fee would be allocated to the Department of the Interior for Mining Law administration and the Cleanup Fund. The curr_chunk provides a list of references related to hardrock mining on federal lands, including reports from the National Research Council, National Wildlife Federation, U.S. Congress, and U.S. General Accounting Office. These references cover topics such as reclamation bonding practices, public subsidies for natural resource development, and the need for revision of the Mining Law of 1872."
