The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with other agencies, will conduct a program to assess and demonstrate solutions for managing salt cedar and Russian olive trees in the western United States, including reestablishing native vegetation and disposing of biomass. The Secretary will assess salt cedar and Russian olive infestation in the western United States, including acreage, severity, control methods, water consumption reduction feasibility, and land restoration challenges. The Secretary will identify long-term management strategies and provide grants to institutions of higher education for public policy development related to the destruction of salt cedar and Russian olive trees, biomass removal, and land restoration. The Secretary will establish a program funding 5 projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees in collaboration with various entities. The program will fund 5 projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees by implementing various methods, assessing their effects, and determining optimal combinations for long-term management strategies. The program will fund projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees by assessing soil conditions, implementing revegetation methods, preventing regrowth, monitoring water savings, and considering downstream impacts. The program will fund projects to control salt cedar and Russian olive trees by assessing soil conditions, implementing revegetation methods, preventing regrowth, and monitoring water savings. Additionally, it will assess impacts on groundwater and surface water, wildfire activity and management strategies, changes in wildlife habitat, conditions for biomass removal, and economic impacts associated with control methods and land restoration. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, will complete an analysis of economic means to use or dispose of biomass created from salt cedar removal within one year of funds availability. The analysis will determine economic viability of biomass removal from salt cedar and Russian olive trees, build upon existing research on beneficial uses of tree fiber, and explore economic development opportunities through wood product manufacture. Costs of projects under the Act will be assessed. The assessment, identification, demonstration projects, and analysis under the Act have specified cost limits: $4,000,000 for assessment, $2,000,000 for long-term management strategies, $7,000,000 for demonstration projects, and $3,000,000 for analysis. Cost-sharing is also outlined. The Act specifies cost limits for assessment, management strategies, demonstration projects, and analysis. Federal expense covers projects on Federal land, with a 75% cost share for projects on non-federal land for the first 5 years. The Secretary may grant 5-year extensions for long-term monitoring with 100% non-federal share in the form of in-kind contributions. Cooperation with Federal agencies and other entities is required for assessment, demonstration projects, and analysis. The Secretary will subject assessments, management strategies, demonstration projects, and analysis to independent review. An annual report to Congress will detail the results of the Act, including independent reviews and fund expenditures. Public access will be facilitated. The Secretary will facilitate public access to information resulting from the Act. Authorization of appropriations includes $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $15,000,000 for subsequent years."
