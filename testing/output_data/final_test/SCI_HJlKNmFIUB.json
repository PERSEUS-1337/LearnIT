    "content": "The brain can perform unsupervised learning alongside supervised learning, leading to the idea of combining both methods for better learning outcomes. The Hebbian-augmented training algorithm (HAT) aims to learn an unsupervised rule that complements supervised signals by focusing on synaptic activities. Testing on Fashion-MNIST dataset shows HAT consistently outperforms supervised learning alone, indicating the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in enhancing gradient-based methods. The meta-learned update rule is a time-varying function, making it challenging to pinpoint an interpretable Hebbian update rule for training. Eventually, the meta-learner transitions into a non-Hebbian rule that preserves important weights for learner convergence. Backpropagation is effective in neural net optimization but may not be biologically plausible due to various factors. Some supervised training schemes like contrastive Hebbian learning and equilibrium propagation are more biologically plausible, but it's uncertain if they accurately capture all neuron behaviors. The addition of local, unsupervised rules to standard backpropagation improves learning speed and robustness. Various hypothesized local learning rules in the brain involve using activation correlations for updates, such as Hebb's Rule, Oja's Rule, and nonlineear Hebbian rules. In the context of local, unsupervised learning rules like Hebb's Rule and Oja's Rule, meta-learning is used to investigate different optimization functions. Meta-learning involves one model learning a task while another model learns how to optimize the first model. This approach has been successful in finding robust optimization schemes, such as gradient-based and gradient-free optimization functions. The Hebbian-Augmented Training algorithm (HAT) is a fully differentiable architecture for learning unsupervised local rules and improving performance. It involves training a neural net twice per sample using unsupervised rules on the forward pass and backpropagation-based gradient descent on the backward pass. This approach aims to investigate the functional form of the meta-learned update rule. The Hebbian-Augmented Training algorithm (HAT) involves training a neural net twice per sample using unsupervised rules on the forward pass and backpropagation-based gradient descent on the backward pass. The process includes computing activations for each layer, updating weights using meta-learner M, and backpropagating through the network. The Hebbian-Augmented Training algorithm (HAT) involves training a neural net twice per sample using unsupervised rules on the forward pass and backpropagation-based gradient descent on the backward pass. The algorithm computes gradients for both M and L, updates weights using a meta-learner, and backpropagates the loss for each layer. The key insight is that the convolution of the meta-learner over the weights of the learner forms a fully differentiable framework. HAT aims to train the learner faster by utilizing metadata generated from the forward pass more effectively. The Hebbian-Augmented Training algorithm (HAT) utilizes metadata from the forward pass to improve convergence and performance of the neural net. HAT introduces stochasticity in the loss landscape, leading to better local optima. It can learn from unlabeled examples and shows positive effects on training accuracy. The HAT algorithm improves neural net convergence and performance by utilizing metadata from the forward pass. It shows stable performance post-convergence and is more effective with more labels. The HAT algorithm improves neural net convergence by utilizing metadata from the forward pass, showing stable performance post-convergence and being more effective with more labels. The meta-learner may converge slower with scarce labels, affecting update suggestions. Analyzing the learned update rule M after convergence reveals a linear dependence on inputs, indicating a \"rich-get-richer\" scheme in the meta-learned update rule. The meta-learned update rule in the context of the HAT algorithm shows a surprising linear dependence on inputs, leading to a \"rich-get-richer\" scheme. Despite attempts to directly apply this rule without meta-learning, results were negative. Three hypotheses are presented to explain this behavior. The meta-learned update rule in the HAT algorithm exhibits a linear dependence on inputs, leading to a \"rich-get-richer\" scheme. Three hypotheses are proposed to explain this behavior, including the transient nature of learning and the complexity of update rules. The HAT algorithm's meta-learned update rule shows a linear dependence on inputs, leading to a \"rich-get-richer\" scheme. The algorithm converges to better asymptotic losses with sufficient time and labeled data. However, the underlying form of the learned rule that makes HAT successful remains a mystery. The meta-learner may learn a useful update rule during training but does not converge to it in the long run, instead devolving into a linear function ConvergedRule. This discovery makes analysis challenging, but there is potential for improvement. Future work could involve investigating whether there exists a time during training where the meta-learner has converged to a useful function while the learner has not finished training. This could involve observing the function in a 4-dimensional space and checking for phase changes to determine if a single useful update rule is learned or if learning is transient and continuous. If successful, this could lead to an a priori rule without the need for metalearning update rules. The text discusses the potential of finding a universal learning rule through extracting local rules from different domains. It also explores how integrating local rules can measure the similarity between different learning problems, aiding in transfer learning. Additionally, an implementation detail addressing a gap in deep learning frameworks is mentioned. The text discusses implementing a function M for unsupervised weight updates in deep learning frameworks. It mentions the challenge of applying M to tensor slices in parallel and proposes convoluting M over a state tensor as a solution. An example is given with neural net layers of size 784 and 183, batches of size 50, and a meta-learner architecture of 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 1. The text discusses implementing a meta-learner neural net function M using convolutions for weight updates in deep learning frameworks. The function is applied to input tensors of size 3 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 183 \u00d7 784, resulting in an output of size 50 \u00d7 183 \u00d7 784. The function M, applied to input tensors of size 3 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 183 \u00d7 784, results in an output of size 50 \u00d7 183 \u00d7 784. The weight update dimension is 183 \u00d7 784, the same as the original weight tensor."
