FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the United States went to war against Iraq in 2003 without clearly defined political and military goals, adequate troop levels, or a strategy for post-invasion Iraq, contrary to established doctrines. The United States went to war against Iraq in 2003 without sufficient levels of armor and equipment for post-conflict success. The President's justifications for using military force, such as Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction and links to al Qaeda, have not been proven correct. The end of major combat operations in Iraq marked the beginning of the occupation phase. The justifications for military force against Iraq have shifted since the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. Public Law 107-243 authorized the President to use force against Iraq to defend national security, but current situation in Iraq does not pose a direct threat to the United States. Public Law 107-243 reflects the President's policies of preemption and unilateralism, leading to an open-ended occupation in Iraq with no clear exit strategy. The escalation of military force in Iraq deviates from traditional US policies of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is repealed. Congress should vote on a new authorization for the use of force resolution in Iraq that reflects the current situation, abandons the Bush Doctrine, and realigns US policy with diplomacy, deterrence, and containment. The US should establish a quick-reaction military force in the Middle East and enhance diplomatic relations to support Iraq's national steps. The Government of Iraq should promote national reconciliation. The US should engage neighboring countries and the League of Arab States for stability in Iraq. The US should continue providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. Diplomatic, economic, and military support should be redirected to Afghanistan to counter the Taliban. The US should aggressively pursue terrorist organizations like Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda."
