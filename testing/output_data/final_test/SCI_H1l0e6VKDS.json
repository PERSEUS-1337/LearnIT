    "content": "We propose learning to transfer learn (L2TL) to improve transfer learning by extracting information from a source dataset. L2TL optimizes shared weights between models for source and target tasks, using adaptive weights based on reinforcement learning. It outperforms fine-tuning baselines on various datasets, especially in cases of small-scale target datasets and label mismatch."
