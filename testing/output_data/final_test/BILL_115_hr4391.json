    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Promoting Human Rights by Ending Israeli Military Detention of Palestinian Children Act\". Congress finds that Israel ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits torture and cruel treatment of children, emphasizes detention as a last resort, requires humane treatment of children in custody, and considers their age-specific needs. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there are two separate legal systems, with Israeli military law imposed on Palestinians and Israeli civilian law applied to Israeli settlers. The Israeli military detains around 500 to 700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year and prosecutes them before a military court system that lacks basic guarantees of due process. Approximately 2,700,000 Palestinians, including 47% children under 18, live in the West Bank under military occupation, facing fear of arrest, detention, and violence by Israeli forces. Since 2000, around 10,000 Palestinian children have been detained and prosecuted in Israeli military courts. Children under 12 are questioned by Israeli military forces but cannot be prosecuted in these courts. Human Rights Watch and UNICEF reports documented widespread abuse of Palestinian children by Israeli security forces, including chokeholds, beatings, and coercive interrogation. The UNICEF report concluded that ill-treatment of children in Israeli military detention is systematic and institutionalized. The Israeli system of military detention of Palestinian children deviates from international norms, with reports from UNICEF highlighting ongoing ill-treatment despite some reforms. The 2013-2016 Annual Reports by the Department of State highlighted Israeli security services abusing and torturing Palestinian minors to obtain confessions, using tactics like threats, beatings, and solitary confinement. Confessions signed in Hebrew, a language most minors couldn't read, were used as evidence in Israeli military courts. There was a significant increase in detentions of minors in 2016, with Israeli authorities still using these coerced confessions. The use of \"administrative detention\" against Palestinians, including children, was highlighted. Defense for Children International Palestine collected affidavits from 429 West Bank children detained between 2012 and 2015, revealing that three-quarters endured physical violence, children lack the right to a lawyer during interrogation under Israeli military law, and 97 percent were interrogated without a parent present. Amendments to Israeli military law have not improved the treatment of Palestinian children during the initial 24 to 48 hours after arrest, where most ill-treatment occurs. Interrogators use coercive tactics like stress positions and threats to extract confessions from children, with 66 children held in isolation for an average of 13 days for interrogation purposes. The Child Committee expressed serious concern about allegations of inhuman treatment and torture of Palestinian children by Israeli forces during arrest, interrogation, and detention. The Committee stated that Palestinian children are systematically subjected to degrading treatment and acts of torture, with Israel disregarding previous recommendations to comply with international law. The purpose of this Act is to promote and protect the human rights of Palestinian children and ensure that US taxpayer funds are not used to support their military detention. The sense of Congress is that the detention and prosecution of Palestinian children in Israel's military court system violates international law and human rights standards, goes against American values, undermines peace efforts, and should be replaced with a juvenile justice system that treats Israeli and Palestinian children equally. The United States policy opposes military detention of Palestinian children due to human rights violations. US funds are prohibited from supporting this practice. Prohibition on the use of funds for supporting the military detention, interrogation, abuse, or mistreatment of Palestinian children in violation of international humanitarian law. This includes practices such as torture, physical violence, psychological abuse, solitary confinement, and denial of access to parents or legal counsel during interrogations. The Secretary of State must certify annually that funds for assistance to Israel were not used for prohibited activities, or provide a detailed report if unable to certify. The Secretary of State must include in reports a description of the detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children by Israeli military forces or police in violation of international humanitarian law."
