    "content": "Economic conditions have worsened due to COVID-19, leading to layoffs and financial hardship for many Americans. Government agencies and financial institutions are working to help affected individuals. Congress passed the CARES Act on March 27, 2020, to provide relief to consumers, small businesses, and industries impacted by the pandemic. The CARES Act, passed on March 27, 2020, aims to provide relief to consumers, small businesses, and industries affected by COVID-19. It includes provisions for rebate checks, loans for small businesses, protections for consumers with outstanding payments, and funds for disaster recovery programs. Division B provides supplemental appropriations for federal agencies to respond to the pandemic. The CARES Act, passed on March 27, 2020, includes provisions for stabilizing the economy, providing relief to households and businesses affected by COVID-19. Section 4003 allocates $500 billion for businesses in the aviation sector and financial system. Some view it as a necessary measure to prevent job losses and maintain economic stability. Additionally, Title IV allows federal guarantees for uninsured bank deposits and money market funds. The CARES Act includes provisions for small businesses and assistance to states and municipalities. Section 4003 allocates $500 billion to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for eligible businesses, states, and municipalities. Treasury Secretary can use the funds to provide support. Section 4003 of the CARES Act allocates $500 billion to the Treasury Secretary to support eligible businesses, states, and municipalities affected by COVID-19. Up to $46 billion is designated for direct loans and loan guarantees, with specific amounts for air carriers and businesses critical to national security. The remaining funds can be used to support Federal Reserve facilities for providing liquidity to the financial system. This authority expires on December 31, 2020. Section 4029 of the CARES Act allows for modification of outstanding loans and guarantees in the passenger air industry, with a restriction that assistance cannot extend beyond five years from the initial origination date. Recipients are required to repay the assistance with interest, fees, and possibly warrants, equity, or senior debt. The subsidy associated with this assistance will be estimated based on the present discounted value of assistance and income received by Treasury. The ultimate size of the subsidy will depend on finalized terms such as interest rates and fees. The CARES Act provides up to $32 billion in grants for airline-related industries to continue paying employee wages and benefits. The Treasury Secretary has discretion on seeking compensation for these grants. The funds come with terms and conditions, including executive compensation limits and restrictions on eligible recipients to avoid conflicts of interest. The CARES Act provides financial assistance to airline-related industries with oversight measures in place. Sections 4114 and 4116 impose limits on recipient firms, while Sections 4025 and 4115 prohibit conditioning assistance on collective bargaining negotiations. Enhanced oversight is provided through Sections 4018, 4020, and 4026, which establish a Special Inspector General, Congressional Oversight Commission, and reporting requirements for Treasury and the Fed. Direct support is available to specific industries deemed in need, such as passenger and cargo airlines and national security businesses. The CARES Act provides financial assistance to airline-related industries with oversight measures in place. Title IV support for these industries includes loans, loan guarantees, tax holidays, and payroll grants for air carrier workers. Up to $46 billion is available for federal loans and loan guarantees directly from Treasury to the aviation sector and businesses critical to national security. The CARES Act provides financial assistance to airline-related industries with oversight measures in place. Up to $17 billion is allocated for businesses critical to national security, with eligibility criteria defined by the Treasury Secretary. Section 4007 of the act implements a tax holiday for transportation-related excise taxes for the year 2020. The CARES Act provides financial assistance to airline-related industries with oversight measures in place. Section 4120 appropriates $32 billion to assist aviation workers, with specific allocations for passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and ground service contractors. Assistance must be used for employee wages and benefits. The Treasury Secretary has discretion on compensation and coordination with the Transportation Secretary is required for relief implementation. Eligible airlines are covered under Section 4113. The CARES Act provides $32 billion in financial assistance to aviation workers, with specific allocations for airlines and contractors. Eligible recipients would receive an amount equal to their 2019 second- and third-quarter salaries and benefits. The Treasury Secretary must publish streamlined procedures within 5 days and make initial payments within 10 days. Airlines representing 95% of U.S. capacity are participating in the Payroll Support Program, with 93 carriers receiving $12.4 billion as of April 25, 2020. The Federal Reserve, created as a \"lender of last resort\" to the banking system, has provided liquidity to nonbank financial firms during financial crises. In response to COVID-19, the Fed has begun lending to nonbank firms again under emergency authority. The CARES Act does not prevent the Fed from independently responding to COVID-19 using its own funds, leaving the decision to the Treasury Secretary. The Treasury Secretary decides how much of the CARES Act funds to provide to the Fed for liquidity support to businesses, states, and municipalities. The Fed can make loans, purchase debt securities, or buy seasoned obligations with broad discretion on program structure. Eligible businesses and states are defined by the act. The Treasury Secretary decides how to structure programs or facilities for CARES Act funds. Treasury has used funding to make equity investments in Fed facilities as a backstop. Fed programs are now backed by CARES Act funding, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The Federal Reserve has implemented various facilities to support financial markets, including the Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF), Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). These programs aim to provide liquidity and stability to the financial system during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides nonrecourse loans to private investors to purchase highly-rated asset-backed securities backed by nonmortgage loans. The Main Street Lending Program (MSLP) buys loans from depository institutions for businesses with up to 10,000 employees or $2.5 billion in revenues, deferring repayment for one year. The Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) purchases shorter-term state and municipal debt for states, larger counties, and larger cities. The Fed extends its role as a \"buyer of last resort\" for illiquid financial markets due to COVID-19 using its emergency lending authority. The Fed's 2020 facilities expand on its 2008 actions by purchasing loans of nonfinancial businesses and debt of states and municipalities. The Fed intervenes in affected markets by purchasing securities directly or making loans to financial institutions. Treasury has pledged ESF funds to protect the Fed from losses, with the Treasury Secretary approving each facility. The facilities charge interest and/or fees to users, with loans structured to avoid expected losses. The Treasury Secretary approved each facility, with loans and asset purchases funded by the Fed and backed by the ESF in case of losses. The MSLP and MLF were created after the CARES Act, with $215 billion pledged to date. There is discussion on leveraging the CARES Act funding of $454 billion to provide more assistance. Table 1 shows how this is achieved, such as the MLF planning to purchase $500 billion of assets using $35 billion of CARES Act funding. The Fed has issued reports to Congress detailing the purpose and participants of facilities funded by the CARES Act. Transactions under CARES Act 13(3) facilities will be publicly reported every 30 days, including amounts borrowed and interest rates. The Fed aims to assist states, municipalities, and medium-sized businesses with funding between 500-10,000 employees. The Fed aims to assist medium-sized businesses with 500-10,000 employees by creating programs with the Treasury Secretary. This includes providing financing to banks and lenders for direct loans to businesses. Fed assistance is not limited to these groups only. The Fed aims to assist medium-sized businesses with 500-10,000 employees by creating programs with the Treasury Secretary. This includes providing financing to banks and lenders for direct loans to businesses at an interest rate not higher than 2% and with no principal or interest due for six months to retain their workforces. The proposed facility is similar to the Fed's MSLP but with different terms outlined in Section 4003, which sets forth terms and conditions for the assistance provided. The assistance provided by the Fed and Treasury Secretary includes various terms and conditions for loans and loan guarantees, with oversight and reporting requirements detailed in the \"Oversight Provisions\" section. Loans must be approved if other credit is not available, obligations must be prudently incurred, and interest rates must reflect market conditions. The Treasury provides loans with interest rates based on market conditions pre-COVID-19, lasting up to five years. Warrants, senior debt, or equity are required, with restrictions on stock buybacks and dividends. Employment levels must be maintained, and the borrower must be a U.S.-domiciled business with operations and employees in the U.S. The borrower must have incurred or expect covered losses jeopardizing business operations, with compensation limitations for executives and employees. Air carriers have service obligations under Section 4005. Section 4005 of the act requires air carriers receiving financial assistance to maintain scheduled air transportation service to points served before March 1, 2020, considering the needs of small communities and healthcare supply chains. Section 4019 states that certain individuals are ineligible to participate in Section 4003 transactions. Section 4115 protects collective bargaining agreements for air carrier workers receiving grants under Section 4113, ensuring no involuntary furloughs or pay reductions until September 30, 2020. Compliance with CARES Act provisions is required, including refraining from stock buybacks and dividends until September 30, 2021, and limits on compensation of highly-paid employees. The CARES Act imposes limits on compensation of highly-paid employees for air carriers receiving support from March 24, 2020, to March 24, 2022. The Transportation Secretary may require carriers to continue services to points served before March 1, 2020. The Treasury Secretary may receive warrants, options, stock, and other financial instruments from recipients to compensate for the assistance. Some terms and conditions also apply to the Fed's assistance, which is limited to U.S. businesses. The CARES Act imposes limits on compensation for air carriers receiving support. Restrictions on executive compensation and capital distributions do not apply to Fed programs unless direct loans are provided. Fewer restrictions may have been placed on Fed programs due to their independence and purpose. The Fed's emergency assistance to nonbank entities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act is subject to restrictions, including providing liquidity to the financial system and not aiding failing companies. Actions must also have sufficient collateral and be based on sound risk management practices, which may pose challenges for entities impacted by COVID-19 without securities for collateral. The CARES Act requires that applicable requirements under Section 13(3) apply to Fed programs. The CARES Act created oversight mechanisms for Fed programs like the MSLP and MLF under Section 13(3), including a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) tasked with auditing Treasury's activities related to loans provided under the act. The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) oversees loans, guarantees, and investments made by the Secretary, providing detailed reports to Congress on activities and financial information. The SIGPR has the authority to hire staff, enter contracts, and report quarterly on Treasury loan programs. The SIGPR oversees Treasury loan programs with detailed reports to Congress. The position terminates in 2025, with $25 million allocated for its use. A Congressional Oversight Commission monitors implementation and issues regular reports to Congress. The Congressional Oversight Commission oversees the Federal Reserve System's authority under this subtitle, including the impact of loans, loan guarantees, and investments on the financial well-being of the United States. It also evaluates the transparency of transaction information, the effectiveness of minimizing costs to taxpayers, and maximizing benefits. The commission has the authority to hold hearings, gather evidence, obtain data, hire staff, and enter into contracts. The Congressional Oversight Commission oversees the Federal Reserve System's authority, evaluates financial impact, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. Commissioners are appointed by congressional leaders, paid based on Executive Schedule level I, and reimbursed for expenses. Funding comes from Senate contingency fund and House account, with prompt transfers by Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Title IV requires the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chair to issue reports, make disclosures, and provide testimony before congressional committees for specified purposes, including disclosing financial details on transactions under Section 4003(b). The financial uncertainty caused by COVID-19 is compared to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. During the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress proactively assisted in economic recovery by enacting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The CARES Act combines elements of both acts, with Title IV resembling the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in its support for firms and Federal Reserve financial sector facilities. The EESA authorized the Treasury Secretary to purchase or insure troubled assets up to $700 billion to restore confidence in the financial system during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Most TARP funding was not used for troubled assets but for other purposes. Most TARP funding was not used to purchase troubled assets but for capital injections, loans to the auto industry, and assistance for homeowners at risk of foreclosure. The EESA was later amended to reduce the authorized amount to $475 billion. Treasury received equity warrants in return for government assistance, aiming for a positive financial upside if private companies' fortunes improved. The government recouped more through interest and dividends ($24.38 billion) than through warrants ($9.58 billion). The EESA granted the government large equity positions in private companies in exchange for TARP assistance, with little ownership control exercised. The purchase authority expired on October 3, 2010, but assets purchased could be held indefinitely. The EESA included limits on executive bonuses and golden parachutes, with possible compensation clawbacks. It was later amended by ARRA to expand these limits and add corporate governance reforms for participating banks in the Capital Purchase Program. Early repayment without penalty was allowed, leading many banks to repay TARP funds. Congressional oversight was also a key component of the EESA. The EESA included oversight mechanisms like the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel, which issued reports and held hearings. The panel had 46 staff members and spent $10.7 million. The Treasury Secretary had to provide regular updates to Congress on TARP transactions. The EESA established oversight mechanisms for TARP, including the creation of the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP) with funding of $50 million. SIGTARP conducts audits and investigations of TARP, issuing quarterly reports until all assets are disposed of. Congress appropriated $22 million for SIGTARP in FY2020. The EESA required regulations to address conflicts of interest in TARP and directed the Secretary to minimize costs to taxpayers by encouraging private sector participation and designing terms for Treasury asset purchases to benefit taxpayers."
