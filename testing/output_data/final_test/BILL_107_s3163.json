    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ready To Educate All Children Act of 2002\". It includes findings and purpose. Congress makes the following findings regarding the need for 2,000,000 new teachers over the next decade, challenges in recruiting highly qualified teachers for rural and high poverty schools, and the importance of supporting high poverty schools to meet educational goals. To ensure success in school, the US must support the training of teachers, who have a significant impact on student learning. Many education graduates feel unprepared for the classroom, and new teachers often lack readiness to implement curriculum. Highly qualified teachers with strong verbal abilities and content knowledge are more effective in improving student academic achievement. The difference in student achievement growth between effective and ineffective teachers can be over 1 grade level. Studies show the importance of teachers' verbal and cognitive abilities on student achievement. Research indicates a positive impact on student achievement when taught by teachers with strong subject-matter knowledge. The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to teacher preparation programs to better prepare teachers for educating all children. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
