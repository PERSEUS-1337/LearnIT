    "content": "The report focuses on U.S. airborne electronic attack programs, including aircraft and EW systems. The President's FY2020 budget request seeks funding for these programs, raising oversight issues for Congress. Members have shown interest in improving EW capabilities, with provisions in recent National Defense Authorization Acts. The S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act discussed the Air Force's acquisition strategy for a new EW attack aircraft and a study on cataloguing all EW capabilities. Electronic warfare (EW) is a crucial component of modern warfare, especially in response to threats from technologically advanced adversaries like Russia and China. EW involves using the electromagnetic spectrum to detect, jam, and deceive enemy systems. DOD defines EW as military action using electromagnetic and directed energy to control the spectrum or attack the enemy. Electronic warfare (EW) is divided into electronic warfare support, electronic protection, and electronic attack. EW support involves detecting, locating, and understanding enemy radar and radio transmissions. Electronic protection limits electromagnetic signatures and hardens military equipment. Electronic attack includes jamming and deceiving enemy radars and communications. Developing advanced EW systems is crucial in the competition between major military powers. Details of EW programs are classified due to their close relation to intelligence systems. During the Cold War, EW capabilities supported military competition between the U.S.-led NATO alliance and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The post-Cold War era saw a shift to countering terrorist organizations, reducing emphasis on high-end warfare. However, the renewed great power competition has increased focus on EW in U.S. defense planning, particularly against technologically sophisticated adversaries. The United States is focusing on strengthening its efforts in Electronic Warfare (EW) to maintain military superiority over Russia and China. Both countries have prioritized EW in their military modernization efforts, with Russia using it in operations in Ukraine and Syria, and China integrating it into its broader military modernization. China's extensive civilian electronics industry may enhance its EW capabilities. EW has evolved since the 20th century. Electronic Warfare (EW) emerged in the early 20th century with the invention of radio and radar for military operations. It predates cyberwarfare, which focuses on computers and the internet. While there is some overlap between EW and cyberwarfare, EW targets the electromagnetic spectrum against radars and radio communication, while cyberwarfare targets computers and servers. Both activities can support each other in military operations. Electronic Warfare (EW) aircraft, such as EA-18G Growlers and EC-130H Compass Call aircraft, play a crucial role in ensuring the combat survivability and effectiveness of U.S. fighters, strike fighters, and attack aircraft. They detect and jam enemy radars and air defense equipment, allowing U.S. aircraft to safely penetrate enemy airspace. Fifth-generation stealthy aircraft like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are less dependent on EW support but still benefit from it in certain circumstances. EW aircraft, including the EA-18G Growler, EC-130H Compass Call, EC-37B Compass Call Re-Host, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, are crucial for ensuring the combat survivability and effectiveness of U.S. and friendly forces. The EA-18G Growler's primary mission is to detect and jam enemy radars, with typically four or five deployed in an aircraft carrier's air wing. The EA-18G Growler is a successor to the EA-6B Prowler and has gradually replaced it in service. It achieved initial operational capability in September 2009 and has a crew of two. The aircraft is equipped with an airborne electronic attack avionics suite and carries AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods. The EA-18G Growler, a successor to the EA-6B Prowler, carries AN/ALQ-99 jamming pods to be replaced by Next Generation Jammer pods. The Navy states that the EA-18G provides full-spectrum airborne electronic attack capabilities to counter enemy air defenses and communication networks, with high demand in overseas operations to protect coalition forces and disrupt command and control links. The Air Force does not have a similar aircraft. The Air Force does not have an aircraft similar to the EA-18G Growler, with the last comparable aircraft being the EF-111 Raven retired in 1998. The Navy has procured 163 EA-18Gs through FY2016 and does not plan further procurement. The Growler is receiving funding for a service life extension and is expected to be replaced in the 2030s. The EC-130H Compass Call is an EW aircraft based on a modified C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft, disrupting enemy command and control. The EC-130H Compass Call system disrupts enemy communications and coordination, supporting U.S. and Coalition forces. Operated by a crew of 14, it is a specialized asset used extensively in conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria for communications jamming and electronic attack against adversaries like ISIS. The EC-130H Compass Call system, used in conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, disrupts enemy communications and coordination through jamming and electronic attack. The Air Force plans to replace EC-130Hs with new EC-37B Compass Call Re-Host aircraft to improve capabilities and reduce maintenance costs. The Air Force plans to replace EC-130H Compass Call system with new EC-37B Compass Call Re-Host aircraft, based on Gulfstream G550, to enhance capabilities and reduce maintenance costs. L3 Technologies is the prime contractor for the EC-37B, with plans to procure a total of 10 aircraft at a rate of one per year. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is scheduled for 2023. The re-hosted COMPASS CALL platform will utilize 70% of the PME from legacy donor EC-130H aircraft without modification, with the remaining 30% being new or modified. This will provide increased range, speed, endurance, and operating altitude for better stand-off range and survivability in Electronic Attack (EA) missions. The Air Force's acquisition strategy of replacing the EC-130H fleet with new Gulfstream G550 aircraft has faced debate and protests. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is being procured in three versions for different branches of the military. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is the Department of Defense's largest acquisition program, with variants for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The F-35 has advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including radar warning, geolocation of electronic emitters, tracking multiple aircraft, high-gain countermeasures, and electronic attack through the radar. These capabilities are designed to provide wide-frequency coverage and quick response. Lockheed Martin F-35 has advanced electronic warfare capabilities including wide-frequency coverage, quick reaction time, high sensitivity, accurate direction finding, and self-protection countermeasures. The F-35's organic jamming capability is provided by its AESA radar and advanced jamming algorithms, potentially offering 10 times the jamming power of legacy aircraft. This eliminates the need for a dedicated electronic attack aircraft to support the F-35, allowing other aircraft to perform electronic attack missions. Lieutenant General Steven Rudder mentioned that the Marine Corps' new F-35Bs would have enough electronic warfare capability despite retiring the EA-6B. The primary airborne electronic attack payloads include the AN/ALQ-99 electronic attack suite, Next Generation Jammer, and Miniature Air Launched Decoy-Jammer. The AN/ALQ-99 tactical jamming system consists of electronic jamming pods and has been updated over time, currently carried by EA/18Gs. The Navy plans to replace the ALQ-99 with the Next Generation Jammer. The Navy plans to replace the ALQ-99 tactical jamming system with the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ), which is being developed in three increments to jam across three radio frequency bands. The first increment, now called the AN/ALQ-249 system or NGJ-MB, will provide EW capability in mid-band frequencies. The next increment will provide EW capability in low-band frequencies. The Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program aims to replace the ALQ-99 tactical jamming system in three increments to cover different radio frequency bands. The NGJ-MB, developed by Raytheon, will focus on mid-band frequencies, while the NGJ-LB, developed by L3 Systems, Northrop Grumman, and Harris, will target low-band frequencies. The Navy's FY2020 budget indicates that NGJ-MB is set to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in the fourth quarter of FY2022. Despite previous delays, the program is now refocused on addressing emerging threats in \"great power competition.\" The NGJ program, specifically the NGJ-MB, has gained renewed importance due to \"great power competition\" with Russia and China. Frank Kendall accelerated the program during his tenure as Undersecretary of Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests $524.3 million for NGJ-MB, with funding projected to decrease in subsequent years as research and development transitions to procurement. The total research and development cost for NGJ-MB is estimated at $3.985 billion, with $2.848 billion received through FY2019. Additionally, $6.2 million is requested for the first procurement funding. The budget submission requests $6.2 million for NGJ-MB procurement funding, projecting an increase to $144.7 million in FY2021 and $534.1 million by FY2024. The total procurement cost is estimated at $4.8 billion. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests $111.1 million for NGJ-MB in FY2020, with funding projected to increase to $241.5 million in FY2024. The total research and development cost for NGJ-LB is estimated at $3.5 billion. The NGJ has the potential to reduce the operational range of the EA-18G. The NGJ Mid-band pod and low-band pod proposals by Raytheon have been reported to increase drag, potentially reducing the operational range of the EA-18G. The Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and Jammer (MALD-J) are designed for electronic attack and have a range of about 500 nautical miles. The MALD is a mini cruise missile with a range of 500 nautical miles. A new version, MALD-X, is being developed to enhance electronic warfare capabilities. MALD-N is a derivative for Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighters. Members of Congress are interested in U.S. EW capabilities in the era of great power competition. In response to power competition, Members of Congress have met through the Electronic Warfare Working Group. Representative Bacon introduced a bill for the DOD to develop electromagnetic spectrum modeling capabilities. Congress is concerned about the priority given to airborne EW programs compared to other military EW programs and DOD priorities. The U.S. Congress is concerned about the priority given to airborne EW programs compared to other military EW programs and DOD priorities, especially in the context of renewed great power competition and advancements in air defense and EW capabilities by Russia, China, and other potential adversaries. There are concerns about Russia's deployment and sales of advanced air defense systems, like the S-400 SAM missile system, which could establish anti-access/area-denial zones. Some observers believe Russia's A2/AD air defense systems are overrated, while the Defense Intelligence Agency states that they are among the best in the world. The DOD states that Russian air defense systems are highly capable and are being exported to countries like China. China's air force has a large air defense force with advanced long-range surface-to-air missiles, including the Russian S-300PMU and S-400 systems. U.S. commandos are facing aggressive electronic warfare challenges in Syria, with adversaries testing them daily. Congress is concerned about funding priorities for airborne EW programs and their impact on other EW priorities. The potential oversight issue for Congress is the impact of funding priorities for airborne EW programs on overall U.S. military capabilities. Questions arise about the appropriateness of DOD's mix of airborne EW capabilities given the capabilities of potential adversaries like Russia and China. The evolution of U.S. military operational concepts and the shift away from specialized tactical EW aircraft in the Air Force and Marine Corps are also key considerations. The potential oversight issue for Congress is the impact of funding priorities for airborne EW programs on overall U.S. military capabilities. Questions arise about the appropriateness of DOD's mix of airborne EW capabilities given the capabilities of potential adversaries like Russia and China. Congress may consider policy for DOD regarding developing platforms that are capable of operating in A2/AD environments, including unmanned EW programs and stand-in jamming systems. The Air Force plans to replace 14 EC-130H aircraft with 10 EC-37Bs, with some Members of Congress interested in accelerating the procurement of EC-37Bs to replace EC-130Hs. The funding priorities for airborne EW programs and the appropriateness of DOD's mix of capabilities are oversight issues for Congress. The House Armed Services Committee supports the Air Force's plan to replace the EC-130H Compass Call fleet with EC-37 aircraft. The Air Force must comply with previous authorization acts before proceeding with the transition plan. The committee is concerned about the Air Force's plan to procure one EC-37 per year over 10 years for fleet recapitalization. The House Armed Services Committee supports the Air Force's plan to replace the EC-130H Compass Call fleet with EC-37 aircraft. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing on the Compass Call transition plan by February 1, 2019, including courses of action to accelerate fleet recapitalization, timelines, cost estimates, recommended actions, and potential cooperative development with the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force for EC-37B Compass Call aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports the Air Force's plan to replace the aging EC-130H Compass Call fleet with EC-37 aircraft. The Department of Defense must comply with provisions in previous National Defense Authorization Acts before proceeding with the transition plan. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports the Air Force's plan to replace the EC-130H Compass Call fleet with EC-37 aircraft. Delays in meeting certification requirements have caused work stoppages, prompting the committee to urge the Secretary of the Air Force to make a timely determination to avoid further delays and cost overruns. The Secretary is directed to provide a briefing to congressional defense committees within 60 days of the determination. In 2017, a law was passed requiring a briefing to congressional defense committees on the Compass Call transition plan, including accelerating fleet recapitalization and development for incoming EC-37 aircraft. The FY2019 DOD Appropriations Act includes an increase in funding to procure and modify an additional EC-37B Compass Call aircraft. The FY2019 DOD Appropriations Act increased funding to procure and modify an additional EC-37B Compass Call aircraft, aiming to accelerate fleet recapitalization and address performance concerns with the legacy EC-130H fleet. Congress added $108 million for the procurement of a fourth EC-37B aircraft. The Committee recommends considering increasing the procurement pace to two per year if operational availability is not disrupted."
