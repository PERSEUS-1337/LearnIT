    "content": "In the 19th and 20th centuries, the federal government determined tribal recognition ad hoc during treaty negotiations and under the Indian Reorganization Act. In the 1970s, requests for tribal recognition surged after key court decisions. To handle the influx, the Department of the Interior established a uniform process in 1978. Tribal recognition holds legal and practical significance. Tribal recognition is crucial as it establishes a government-to-government relationship between a tribe and the United States, granting inherent sovereign authority. Recognized tribes have sovereign immunity, can establish tribal courts, administer funds, operate gaming facilities, and bring land claims. The acknowledgment process under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and Indian Trade and non-Intercourse Act is crucial for tribes to establish their sovereign authority, obtain federal benefits, and exercise treaty rights. The process outlined in 25 C.F.R. Part 83 sets criteria for tribes to be recognized, impacting the group, federal and state governments, other tribes, and non-Indians. The acknowledgment process is essential for tribes to establish their sovereign authority, obtain federal benefits, and exercise treaty rights. Only American Indian groups with a continuous tribal existence and autonomy throughout history can be acknowledged. Groups subject to congressional termination or previous failed attempts cannot re-petition for acknowledgment. The process begins with a letter of intent signed by the governing body of the group. The acknowledgment process for American Indian groups requires a documented petition with thorough explanations and supporting documentation. The review process by the Office of Federal Acknowledgment takes 25 months from petition submission to final determination. Petitions can range from 30,000 to over 100,000 pages, and before active consideration, a preliminary review is conducted to provide technical assistance to the group. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment provides technical assistance to the petitioner to supplement or revise their petition. Once the petition is completed to the petitioner's satisfaction, it undergoes active consideration by a team within OFA to determine if it meets mandatory criteria for acknowledgment as an American Indian entity. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment assists petitioners in meeting criteria for acknowledgment as an American Indian entity, including continuous identification since 1900 and existence as a distinct community with historical evidence. The petitioner must demonstrate evidence of community at a specific point in time, including geographical concentration, consistent interaction, intra-group marriages, distinct culture, and social institutions. Additionally, they must show political influence or authority over members from historical times to the present. Section 83.7(c) outlines evidence required to demonstrate political influence or authority within a group, such as resource allocation, dispute resolution, behavioral influence, and economic organization. This criterion must be established for a specific point in time to prove community. Additionally, 25 C.F.R. Section 83.7(d) mandates providing a copy of the governing document, including membership details. Section 83.7(d) requires the petitioner to provide a copy of the governing document, including membership criteria. 25 C.F.R. 83.7(e) mandates that the petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or tribes that operated as a single entity. Membership lists must also be provided. Additionally, 25 C.F.R. Section 83.7(f) states that the petitioner's membership should mainly consist of individuals not belonging to any acknowledged North American Indian tribe. It is also required to establish that neither the petitioner nor its members are affected by congressional legislation terminating or prohibiting the Federal relationship. Proof of previous Federal acknowledgment may alter the criteria required for recognition. The Assistant Secretary determines previous federal acknowledgment during the technical assistance review. Evidence can include treaty relations, congressional or executive designation as a tribe, or federal acknowledgment of tribal interests. Petitioners with previous acknowledgment must show continuous identification as an Indian entity, current community status, and present political influence. Identification by external sources of leaders or a governing body is necessary. The Assistant Secretary reviews petitions for federal acknowledgment, looking for evidence of continuous identification as an Indian entity, current community status, and political influence. If evidence clearly shows the group does not meet these criteria, the Assistant Secretary will decline to acknowledge them as an Indian tribe. The Assistant Secretary reviews petitions for federal acknowledgment of Indian tribes, with a one-year timeline to publish a proposed finding in the Federal Register. Consideration may be suspended for technical or administrative issues, with the option to extend the comment period for up to 180 days. A formal hearing can be requested by the petitioner or interested parties for further inquiry. The Assistant Secretary will hold a formal hearing to inquire into the reasoning and factual basis for the proposed finding. The petitioner has 60 days to respond to comments, with a possible extension at the Assistant Secretary's discretion. A final determination must be published in the Federal Register within 60 days of considering arguments and evidence, with a possible extension based on comments received. The final determination becomes final after 90 days. The final determination becomes final 90 days from publication in the Federal Register unless a request for reconsideration is filed by the petitioner or an interested party with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA). If no request is received within 90 days, the final determination becomes a final agency action for the Department and becomes effective 120 days after publication. During the reconsideration process, the petitioner and interested parties submit briefs supporting or challenging the final determination. The IBIA can conduct limited independent reconsideration based on new evidence, unreliable evidence, inadequate research, or alternative interpretations. They may affirm or vacate the Assistant Secretary's determination based on these grounds. The IBIA can affirm or vacate the Assistant Secretary's determination based on new evidence, unreliable evidence, inadequate research, or alternative interpretations. If the IBIA affirms the final determination but finds other grounds for reconsideration, the requests are sent to the Secretary of the Interior for potential reconsideration. The Secretary may request the Assistant Secretary to reconsider based on any information, even outside the record. Petitioners and interested parties have 30 days to submit comments to the Secretary after the IBIA's decision. After a remand from the IBIA or a request for reconsideration by the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary has 120 days to issue a reconsidered determination. A reconsidered final determination becomes final upon publication in the Federal Register. Interior proposed a new rule for Part 83 in May 2014. Interior proposed a new rule in May 2014 to change the acknowledgment process for Indian entities, aiming to increase transparency, efficiency, and consistency. The public can comment on the proposed rule until August 1, 2014, which includes criteria changes such as requiring proof of tribal existence in 1900 or earlier. The proposed rule aims to change the acknowledgment process for Indian entities by requiring proof of community and political authority from 1934 to the present \"without substantial interruption.\" It would also require at least 30% of the petitioner's membership to be a distinct community. Additionally, proof of maintaining a state reservation or the United States holding land for the petitioner since 1934 would be acceptable. The proposed rule aims to change the acknowledgment process for Indian entities by requiring proof of community and political authority from 1934 to the present. It would also require at least 30% of the petitioner's membership to be a distinct community. For descent from a historical tribe, the proposed rule would make changes to the definition of \"historical\" and the requirement of proof for membership descent. The proposed rule aims to change the acknowledgment process for Indian entities by requiring proof of community and political authority from 1934 to the present. It would also require at least 30% of the petitioner's membership to be a distinct community. The petitioner may rely on the most recent available evidence for the historical period (1900 or before). Members of a petitioner who joined a federally recognized tribe after filing their petition by 2010 would not count against the petitioner. The burden would shift to Interior to show that Congress has forbidden or terminated the federal relationship with the petitioner. Under the proposed rule, OFA would issue proposed findings and the Assistant Secretary would make final determinations. The Assistant Secretary's decision would be final for Interior, with no consideration by the IBIA. Petitioners receiving a negative proposed finding could appeal to a judge within the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) for a hearing and recommendations. OFA would consider descent from a historical tribe as the first stage criterion for proposed findings. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) would consider various criteria for tribal recognition, including descent from a historical tribe, tribal existence, governing documents, membership, congressional prohibition, community, and political authority. Petitioners who received negative determinations could re-petition under limited circumstances, such as obtaining consent from the prevailing party in previous appeals. If an OHA judge determined that changes in the rules warranted a reconsideration of the final determination or that the wrong standard of proof was used, a petitioner could re-petition without seeking review by the IBIA or a federal court."
