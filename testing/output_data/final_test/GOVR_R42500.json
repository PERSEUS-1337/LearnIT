The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up an amendment to H.R. 5882, providing $4.320 billion in new budget authority. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (H.J.Res. 117, P.L. 112-175) was enacted on September 28, 2012, funding the legislative branch at the FY2012 level with a 0.612% increase.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made changes to the procedures, delaying the sequester implementation and reducing the dollar amount of the cuts.
