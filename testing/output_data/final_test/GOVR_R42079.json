    "content": "The Federal Reserve (Fed) has a high degree of independence from Congress and the President, which some see as beneficial for nonpolitical policymaking and credibility with financial markets. Critics argue that the Fed lacks transparency and accountability, especially in its decision to provide over $1 trillion in assistance to the financial sector without congressional input. Calls have been made for more oversight and transparency in the Fed's actions. Critics of the Federal Reserve call for more oversight, transparency, and disclosure, focusing on GAO audits and details of borrowers and loans. GAO has audited the Fed since 1978, with annual financial statements audited by private-sector auditors. The Dodd-Frank Act led to audits of the Fed's emergency activities and governance. H.R. 24 aims to eliminate restrictions on GAO audits. H.R. 24 aims to eliminate statutory prohibitions on GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending, requiring a one-time audit within 12 months of enactment. The Fed voluntarily discloses extensive information about its operations, with individual lending records for emergency facilities released as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. The act also mandates the release of individual records for discount window and open market operation transactions with a two-year lag, starting in the third quarter of 2012. Oversight and disclosure are separate issues that do not necessarily go hand in hand. The report provides an overview of existing Fed oversight and disclosure practices, highlighting recent legislative changes and proposals. It considers the potential impact of greater oversight and disclosure on the Fed's independence and its ability to achieve its goals. Regular congressional oversight of the Fed is done through statutorily required semiannual hearings and written reports to the House Financial Services. The House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hold semiannual hearings and receive written reports from the Federal Reserve. The terms of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last for four years and require presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. Governors serve one full term and are also subject to nomination and confirmation. Regional bank presidents vote on monetary policy decisions alongside governors. The Federal Reserve System operates without congressional budgetary oversight, being self-financed and not subject to appropriations. The Office of Inspector General within the Fed conducts investigations and issues reports to Congress, promoting integrity and preventing fraud. The Office of Inspector General within the Federal Reserve promotes integrity, prevents fraud, and strengthens accountability to Congress and the public. It conducts reviews on various Fed activities, such as emergency lending facilities and Dodd-Frank Act implementation. The Fed follows a transparent rulemaking process but is not subject to executive review or cost-benefit analysis requirements. It has an ombudsman and appeals process for supervisory decisions. The Dodd-Frank Act created a vice chairman for supervision within the Fed. The Federal Reserve's vice chairman for supervision is required to report to Congress semiannually on financial supervisory powers. Congressional oversight is hindered by the technical nature of monetary policymaking. Suggestions include creating oversight boards of experts or relying on GAO audits for enhanced oversight. The focus of the congressional debate is on GAO audits, which are seen as crucial for accountability. The GAO conducts audits of the Federal Reserve to improve performance and ensure government accountability. Audits are initiated through legislation or congressional requests, with the subject determined by priorities. GAO has had authority to audit the Fed since 1978, completing multiple audits each year. Federal statute limited audits between 1933 and 1978. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act of 1978 granted the GAO authority to audit the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, excluding certain activities related to foreign transactions and monetary policy matters. The act does not specifically mention activities taken under the Fed's emergency authority. The 1978 Federal Banking Agency Audit Act granted the GAO authority to audit the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, excluding certain activities related to foreign transactions and monetary policy matters. Significant additions in more recent acts have expanded the scope of GAO's audits, allowing audits of specific partnerships or corporations under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. This includes audits of Maiden Lane facilities and asset guarantees of Citigroup and Bank of America. The GAO has been granted authority to audit specific partnerships or corporations under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including Maiden Lane facilities and asset guarantees of Citigroup and Bank of America. The Fed has not taken any action under Section 13(3) since the financial crisis. Title XI of the Dodd-Frank Act allows GAO to audit open market operations, discount window lending, emergency authority actions, and programs created in response to the financial crisis for operational integrity and internal controls. The GAO has been authorized to audit specific partnerships or corporations under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including Maiden Lane facilities and asset guarantees of Citigroup and Bank of America. The audits focus on the effectiveness of security and collateral policies, fairness in transactions, and policies governing third-party contractors. The GAO is not allowed to evaluate the Fed's monetary actions or disclose confidential information without Fed approval. The GAO is authorized to audit specific partnerships or corporations under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including Maiden Lane facilities and asset guarantees of Citigroup and Bank of America. The audits focus on security and collateral policies, fairness in transactions, and policies governing third-party contractors. The GAO cannot disclose confidential information without Fed approval. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated a GAO audit of the Fed's response to the recent crisis, completed in July 2011, and a separate audit of Federal Reserve bank governance to assess potential conflicts of interest. The GAO audit in October 2011 evaluated the role of regional banks in the Fed's crisis response and proposed reforms to regional bank governance. Most information in the audit had already been publicly released by the Fed, with little new insights. Some data was presented in a more reader-friendly format, but some information was sensationalized. The GAO audit in October 2011 evaluated the Fed's crisis response, highlighting sensationalized information about the Fed's lending during the crisis. GAO recommended internal control improvements and increased disclosure. In the 112th Congress, Representative Ron Paul sponsored H.R. 459, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which aimed to allow GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending. The bill was amended in committee and passed by the House in July 2012. In September 2014, the House passed H.R. 24, which also focused on Fed transparency. In 2012, the House passed H.R. 24, which aimed to eliminate restrictions on GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending. The bill also required a one-time GAO audit of the Fed within 12 months of enactment. H.R. 5018 would have required the Fed to formulate a mathematical rule for setting monetary policy and submit it to GAO and committees within 48 hours of a policy decision. H.R. 3189 aimed to increase congressional oversight of the Fed by requiring submission of rule prescriptions to GAO and committees, triggering audits for rule changes or non-compliance. It would have mandated quarterly congressional testimony by the Fed chair, regardless of the vice chair of supervision position, and a written report on ongoing rulemaking. The bill also sought to eliminate restrictions on GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending, with a one-time audit requirement. The bill H.R. 3189 aimed to increase oversight of the Fed by requiring submission of rule prescriptions to GAO and committees, triggering audits for rule changes or non-compliance. It would have mandated quarterly congressional testimony by the Fed chair and a written report on ongoing rulemaking. The bill also sought to eliminate restrictions on GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending. H.R. 3189 aimed to increase oversight of the Fed by requiring quarterly congressional testimony on supervision, even if the vice chair position is unfilled. It also included a provision for a commission to examine and make recommendations on monetary policy and the dual mandate. The commission authorized by H.R. 3189 would examine and make recommendations on monetary policy, the dual mandate, macroprudential regulation, and lender of last resort functions. It would be funded through appropriations. These provisions were also included in H.R. 5983, which subjected the Fed's Board of Governors budget to congressional appropriations, except for monetary policy functions. S. 1484/S. 1910 aimed to increase Fed oversight by requiring quarterly reports to Congress on monetary policy, adding economic variables and projections to the report. The proposed bill, S. 1484 / S. 1910, aimed to increase oversight of the Federal Reserve by requiring quarterly reports to Congress on monetary policy, including discussions on mathematical rules and deviations from those rules, like the Taylor rule. It would have allowed FOMC members to include dissenting statements in the report and required the Fed chair to testify in the absence of the vice chair of supervision. Additionally, the bill mandated a one-time GAO study and biennial reports on enhanced prudential regulation of banks and systemically important financial institutions for the next 10 years. The proposed bills, H.R. 24 and S. 2232, aimed to increase oversight of the Federal Reserve by allowing GAO audits of monetary policy and Fed lending activities. The Senate did not proceed with S. 2232, while the House ordered H.R. 24 to be reported for further consideration. H.R. 24 would eliminate statutory restrictions on GAO audits and require a one-time audit of the Fed within 12 months of enactment. The Federal Reserve is required to provide annual reports to Congress, including details on open market operations and financial statements audited by an independent auditor. These reports are made public and include information on monetary and regulatory decisions. The Federal Reserve publishes an audit in its Annual Report and is required by Congress to produce reports on various topics. Despite limited statutory requirements, the Fed voluntarily discloses extensive information on its operations. Disclosure has increased over time, with more transparency in monetary policy decisions since 1993. Chair Janet Yellen endorsed this move towards transparency, providing detailed rationale for policy decisions to the public. Additionally, economic projections of Fed officials have been released since 2009. In 2009, the Fed started releasing economic projections of officials and in 2011, the chairman began holding quarterly press conferences. In 2012, a 2% inflation goal for monetary policy was announced. The Fed also discloses information on rulemaking, policies, and enforcement actions on its website. Fed lending increased during the financial crisis, leading to more public and congressional interest in disclosure. The Fed ranks as one of the more transparent central banks globally. During the financial crisis, the Fed publicly released detailed information on its emergency actions, including the terms and eligibility of borrowers, collateral details, and rationale for each crisis program. Monthly reports listed borrower types, collateral value, and interest income. Contracts with private vendors were also disclosed. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, borrower identities and specific collateral details were kept confidential. The Fed historically kept borrower identities and specific transaction details confidential, even during emergency actions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act required reporting on justification for using Section 13(3) authority and terms of assistance, but not borrower identities or specific transactions. Dodd-Frank Act included provisions for transparency in emergency actions under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Title XI of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to provide details on assistance given under Section 13(3), including recipient identity, amount, and terms of assistance. Information must be provided within 7 days and updated every 30 days. The Act also mandates public disclosure of borrower identities, amount borrowed, rates charged, and collateral pledged. Data for Fed programs created during the crisis had to be publicly disclosed by December 1, 2010. The December 2010 data release covered all facilities created during the crisis, excluding the discount window and open market operations. Going forward, information on credit facilities will be disclosed quarterly within one year of termination, and within two years for discount window loans or open market operations. This requirement also applies to any facility created under the Fed's emergency authority. Discount window transactions and open market operations data will be available quarterly starting in the third quarter of 2012. No emergency actions triggering a report have been taken since the Dodd-Frank Act. Programs not falling under these categories, like the Fed's central bank liquidity, are not covered by this requirement. The December 2010 data release disclosed information on central bank liquidity swaps, but foreign central banks are not required to disclose how they used the funds. Title XI mandates the Fed to provide an \"Audit\" page on its website linking to GAO reports and financial statements. The Inspector General conducted a study on the impact of exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act on public access to information on the Fed's emergency facilities. The December 2010 release did not include discount window transaction information. Bloomberg and Fox News Network sued the Federal Reserve for internal records on lending activities under the FOIA. The Fed initially denied the requests but released the information in March 2011. H.R. 5018 proposed a blackout period around FOMC meetings and required stress test scenarios to be determined through public rulemaking. H.R. 3189 proposed various measures to increase transparency at the Federal Reserve, including disclosing supervisory letters to large banks, conducting cost-benefit analysis for rulemaking, notifying committees before international negotiations, and publicly disclosing salaries and investments of Fed members. The proposed measures in H.R. 3189 aimed to increase transparency at the Federal Reserve by requiring public disclosure of stress test scenarios, supervisory letters to large banks, cost-benefit analysis for rulemaking, notification of committees before international negotiations, and disclosure of salaries and investments of Fed members. The proposed measures in H.R. 3189 aimed to increase transparency at the Federal Reserve by requiring public disclosure of salary and personal investments for Fed members above GS-15, releasing FOMC transcripts, and recording publicly the Board's vote on bank enforcement actions exceeding $1 million. The Export-Import Bank reporting requirements were part of H.R. 5983 reported by the House Financial Services Committee. Calls for greater Fed transparency focus on policy decisionmaking and disclosure of borrowers. Transparency can make Fed actions more predictable but risks hindering debate among policymakers. The Fed argues that revealing firms accessing its facilities could undermine investor confidence. The Fed argues that revealing firms accessing its facilities could undermine investor confidence, potentially leading to destabilizing runs on deposits, debt, or equity. A delayed release of information mitigates, but does not eliminate, these concerns. Critics may view less Fed lending as positive, but an unwillingness to access Fed facilities could make the financial system less safe. The impact on investor borrowing will only be apparent during the next liquidity crunch. The Fed argues that disclosing firms accessing its facilities could harm investor confidence, leading to destabilizing runs on deposits, debt, or equity. Historical examples like the RFC in the Great Depression and TARP fund recipients show mixed evidence on the impact of disclosure. The level of detail to be disclosed is a policy issue, with aggregate information being more useful for broad policy purposes. Repayment of TARP funds by banks raised concerns about perceived weakness if not repaid promptly. The Fed is hesitant to disclose specific borrower information, arguing it could harm investor confidence and lead to destabilizing runs on deposits, debt, or equity. While disclosing borrower identities could prevent favoritism, \"naming and shaming\" them may be questionable, especially if the programs were helpful for providing liquidity and maintaining financial stability. Greater disclosure and outside evaluation, like GAO audits, could help Congress oversee lending programs more effectively without stigmatizing recipients. Fed's independence in monetary policy decisions strengthens credibility and effectiveness in achieving price stability. The Fed's credibility is perceived to strengthen monetary policy effectiveness on the economy, consistent with its mandate from Congress for price and economic stability. Its response to the financial crisis involved new policy areas and potentially riskier instruments not explicitly endorsed by legislation at the time. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced oversight and disclosure of emergency activities by the Fed, supported by then-Chair Bernanke. Emergency programs have been terminated, loans repaid, and Fed activities shifted back to traditional securities trading. Despite waning rationales for oversight, Fed lending could quickly scale up in another crisis. The policy challenge is to balance Fed independence and accountability, with the Fed opposing legislation to remove remaining audit restrictions. Bernanke opposed removing audit restrictions, fearing it would increase Congress's influence on monetary policy and undermine public confidence in the Fed. He emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability but warned against eliminating the exemption from monetary policy deliberations, which could lead to political interference in Fed decisions. The nightmare scenario is if the GAO could review and influence Fed decisions in real time, which Chair Yellen opposed due to the risk of political interference in monetary policy. The bill to allow GAO audit of Fed decisions in real time was opposed by Chair Yellen, who argued it would politicize monetary policy and bring short-term political pressures into FOMC deliberations. Yellen emphasized the Fed's transparency and accountability in monetary policy decisions compared to other central banks."
