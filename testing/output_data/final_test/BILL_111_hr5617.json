    "content": "The \"Home Energy Conservation Act of 2010\" may be cited as the Act. It introduces Home Energy Conservation Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Home Energy Conservation Act of 2010\" introduces Home Energy Conservation Bonds, defined as bonds used for residential energy efficiency assistance grants and loans, with specific allocations for low-income and very low-income households. Repayments must be utilized within three months. The Home Energy Conservation Act of 2010 allows for the redemption of bonds within a 3-month period for energy efficiency grants and loans. There is a national limit of $2.4 billion for these bonds, with allocations made by the Secretary among the States. The Secretary allocates funds among States based on their populations. Large local governments within a State receive a portion of the allocation proportional to their population. Unused funds can be reallocated to the State. For purposes of this section, a large local government is defined as a municipality or county with a population of 500,000 or more. Qualified residential energy efficiency assistance grants and loans include grants or low-interest loans for acquiring Energy Star program compliant property for installation in dwelling units. For qualified residential energy efficiency assistance grants and loans, Energy Star program compliant property can be installed in a dwelling unit. Additionally, improvements to a dwelling unit can be made based on a plan certified by an energy efficiency expert resulting in a 20 percent reduction in total household energy consumption. Improvements to a dwelling unit for basic health and safety may be considered for a grant or loan, not exceeding 10 percent of the value, if required by State or local law. Dollar limitations apply to dwelling unit improvements, excluding grants or loans for certain improvements. The grant or loan for dwelling unit improvements is limited to $5,000, but can be increased to $12,000 for principal residences. The grant or loan for dwelling unit improvements can be increased to $8,000 or $12,000 for principal residences, based on specific requirements. The grant or loan for dwelling unit improvements can be increased to $12,000 for principal residences if reduced energy costs exceed loan payments. The term 'low-interest loan' refers to a loan with interest rates not exceeding the applicable Federal rate. Certain property like equipment for swimming pools, TVs, digital signal converters, DVD players, and VCRs are excluded from grant or loan calculations. Qualified low-income residential energy efficiency assistance grants and loans are available for dwelling units occupied by individuals with income at or below 100 percent of the area median gross income. These grants and loans are restricted to grants and very low-interest loans. For qualified very low-income residential energy efficiency assistance grants, the income of individuals must be 50 percent or less of the area median gross income. Loan interest rates must not exceed the applicable Federal rate by more than 100 basis points. The term 'applicable interest' refers to interest on a loan that exceeds 1 percentage point. Investments in qualified residential energy efficiency assistance loans do not affect meeting requirements. The amount used for grants or loans cannot exceed the grant or loan amount. Population determination for State or local governments follows section 146(j). The government determines the applicable interest for home energy conservation bonds. Issuers must report on the loans, grants, and energy efficiency improvements annually to the Secretary. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on loans, grants, and energy efficiency improvements, including projected energy savings for installed property and improvements. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, must submit a report to Congress on the bond program, including information on projected energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The bond program is treated as a Specified Tax Credit Bond for direct payment provisions. The code is amended to include a new clause for a home energy conservation bond. Conforming amendments are made to include the bond in specified tax credit provisions. The code is amended to include a new clause for a home energy conservation bond in specified tax credit provisions. The code is amended to include a new clause for home energy conservation bonds in specified tax credit provisions, with the amendments applying to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act."
