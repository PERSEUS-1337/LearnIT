FINDINGS.\" Congress found that in order to eliminate the US stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions, maximum protection for the environment, public, and personnel involved is required. The Secretary of Defense was mandated to ensure this protection during the destruction process. The Secretary of the Army established the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP) to enhance local communities' ability to respond to emergencies from chemical munitions stockpile sites. The program received federal emergency response funds and assistance through an agreement with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Comptroller General reported slow progress in achieving results in a 1994 report to Congress. The GAO report on the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program highlighted delays in acquiring essential equipment and communities not being prepared for a chemical emergency despite years of effort and significant funding. Weaknesses in program management have led to delays in acquiring essential equipment for communities to plan for evacuations and sheltering-in-place in the event of a chemical emergency. Officials in various states and counties lack guidance and standards to complete their emergency response plans, contributing to further delays in preparedness efforts. Weaknesses in program management have caused delays in acquiring warning sirens and tone alert radios for emergency preparedness. Disputes between counties and agencies have hindered the installation process. The Federal Emergency Management Agency could not accurately track how funds for the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program were spent, raising concerns about program funding allocation. The Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program is not allocating funds to provide maximum public protection as required by law. SEC. 2. REPORT ON EXPENDITURES. The Secretary of the Army must submit a report to Congress detailing expenditures for the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program since 1986, including a breakdown of expenses for administration, personnel, travel, contract work, and emergency operations centers, along with a justification for all expenditures. The Secretary of the Army must submit a report to Congress detailing expenditures for the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program since 1986, including a detailed plan for reducing administrative costs to maximize protection for the general public near chemical stockpile sites. The Secretary of Defense must ensure the placement of additional warning sirens in counties within designated zones covered by the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program to enhance public protection. The Army Secretary will approve the placement of at least three outdoor sirens in each county at the discretion of the Emergency Management Agency director, with funding from the program."
