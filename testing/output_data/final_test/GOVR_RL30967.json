    "content": "During the latter years of the Clinton presidency, the United States focused on deploying defenses against long-range ballistic missiles due to concerns about \"rogue\" nations acquiring such missiles. The Clinton Administration sought to negotiate amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia to allow for a limited National Missile Defense system. Russian officials strongly emphasized the importance of the ABM Treaty. During talks with the Clinton Administration, Russian officials insisted that any changes to the 1972 ABM Treaty allowing defenses against long-range ballistic missiles would undermine international strategic stability and interfere with Russia's nuclear deterrent capabilities. Russia opposed modifications to the Treaty for national missile defenses, proposing diplomacy and arms control measures instead. The report reviews Russia's reaction to U.S. missile defense policy and proposals to modify the ABM Treaty. It outlines Russia's objections, possible military responses, and diplomatic alternatives. The U.S. response to Russia's objections and congressional issues are also discussed. The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972 between the United States and Soviet Union, prohibits the deployment of ABM systems for defense of territories. It allows each side to have limited ABM systems at two locations, with a 1974 Protocol further limiting to one site per nation. Each site can have up to 100 ABM launchers and interceptor missiles. Radar for early warning of missile attacks must be located on the periphery of national territory. The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972 between the United States and Soviet Union, prohibits the deployment of ABM systems for defense of territories. It allows limited ABM systems at two locations with up to 100 launchers and interceptor missiles each. Radar for early warning of missile attacks must be on the periphery. Parties can propose amendments and withdraw with notice. In 1997, a Memorandum of Understanding on Succession named successors to the Soviet Union for the Treaty. The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972 between the United States and Soviet Union, prohibits the deployment of ABM systems for defense of territories. In 1997, a Memorandum of Understanding named Russia as the successor to the Soviet Union for the Treaty. The Clinton Administration did not submit the agreement to the Senate for fear of rejection. The Bush Administration did not explicitly accept that the ABM Treaty was no longer in force. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld referred to the Treaty as \"ancient history.\" The ABM Treaty, signed in 1972 between the United States and Soviet Union, is considered outdated by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Powell. President Bush announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Treaty on December 13, 2001, which took effect on June 13, 2002. The Clinton Administration had plans for a National Missile Defense system, which included deploying interceptor missiles in Alaska to defend against a limited threat. The Clinton Administration considered modifying the ABM Treaty to allow limited deployment of a National Missile Defense system. However, President Clinton decided not to authorize deployment due to concerns about technology and operational effectiveness. Despite this, research and development on NMD technologies would continue, along with discussions with Russia about the ABM Treaty. The Clinton Administration considered modifying the ABM Treaty for NMD technologies but decided against deployment. Discussions with Russia continued. President Bush prioritized defenses against ballistic missile attacks, outlining a plan involving land, sea, and space-based capabilities. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz detailed a robust research program for missile defense technologies. The Bush Administration aimed to develop an integrated missile defense system using various technologies on land, at sea, or in space. They sought to defend the US, its forces, and allies from missiles of all ranges. The Administration acknowledged that parts of its program would not comply with the ABM Treaty and advocated for a new deterrence framework combining offensive and defensive capabilities. Despite consultations with Russia, they were unable to convince Russia to withdraw from the Treaty. The United States announced its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after failing to convince Russia to do so. Russia views the Treaty as crucial for strategic stability, believing that missile defenses would disrupt the balance of deterrence established during the Cold War. The deployment of such defenses could protect all U.S. territory, posing a threat to this balance. The ABM Treaty is seen as crucial for strategic stability by Russia, as it limits ballistic missile defenses to maintain deterrence. Russian officials argue that the Treaty is essential for reducing offensive nuclear weapons. The Treaty's limits on defenses allowed the US and Soviet Union to accept reductions in their offensive forces. Russia may abrogate agreements on offensive forces if the US deploys ballistic missile defenses, to maintain a sufficient arsenal for penetrating US defenses. Critics argue that this could upset international strategic stability, leading other nations like China to expand their arsenals for effective retaliation. The deployment of missile defenses and U.S. abrogation of the ABM Treaty could trigger an international arms race, as critics argue that it may make the United States less secure in the long run. The Clinton Administration tried to reassure Russia about strategic stability by acknowledging the importance of the ABM Treaty in meetings with Russian leaders. In June 2000, Presidents Clinton and Putin signed a Joint Statement On Principles of Strategic Stability, affirming the importance of the ABM Treaty. The United States proposed modifications to allow for a limited NMD system to address threats from \"rogue\" nations, reassuring Russia that it would not pose a significant threat to their missile capabilities. Russian officials agree with the U.S. on the threat of ballistic missile proliferation and the need for strategic stability. They proposed cooperation on a boost-phase missile defense system near rogue nations. However, they disagree with the U.S. on missile defense views. Russian officials, including President Putin, do not see missile proliferation and potential threats from \"rogue\" nations as an immediate danger to the United States. They do not support U.S. proposals for changes to the ABM Treaty or the deployment of an NMD system, believing that the U.S.'s offensive forces would deter any potential attacks. Former Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, believes that the development of ICBMs by Third World states without a strong economy or relevant technologies is unlikely. He argues that the nuclear deterrence factor from the Cold War still applies to these countries. Russian officials, including President Putin, do not view missile proliferation from \"rogue\" nations as an immediate threat to the U.S. and oppose U.S. proposals for changes to the ABM Treaty or the deployment of an NMD system. They believe that the U.S.'s offensive forces would deter any potential attacks. The Russian government believes that the US missile defense system is aimed at global domination rather than protection from \"problem\" states. They are skeptical about the US's intentions and see it as a threat primarily directed against Russia. The United States planned to limit its missile defense system, with some arguing it would not spend more than $100 billion to develop a system capable of intercepting only 10-20 missiles. The Clinton Administration's proposed modifications to the ABM Treaty raised suspicions among Russians that the U.S. would gradually loosen the Treaty to deploy more extensive defenses. The Bush Administration plans to deploy a robust missile defense system limited to rogue nations, unlike the Clinton Administration's limited land-based system. Russian analysts fear the US could expand its capabilities by upgrading early warning systems and adding more interceptors. Former Defense Minister Sergeyev emphasized that the effectiveness of a missile defense system depends on its information. The United States' NMD system relies on information components for target acquisition and tracking, with potential for expansion through space-based sensors. Russian officials remained unconvinced of the system's capabilities despite detailed briefings from Pentagon officials. The Bush Administration provided Russian officials with detailed briefings on the new U.S. missile defense program in August 2001. Many Russian officials and analysts believed that the U.S. NMD system was just a first step towards a comprehensive global defense system. Former Defense Minister Sergeyev stated that the limited NMD would eventually evolve into a multifunctional system targeting various types of threats. The Russian Federation and China are the main targets of the US missile defense system, posing a threat to Russia's nuclear deterrent capabilities. Russia's arsenal is expected to decrease while the US maintains a larger nuclear force. NATO enlargement and US advantages in warfare technologies further contribute to the threat. The US advantage in precision-guided conventional weapons, like the Tomahawk cruise missile, allows for potential first strikes on strategic targets in Russia. A limited missile defense system could disrupt strategic stability and prompt China to enhance its military capabilities in response. One Russian analyst, Alexander Pikayev, believes that China's $10 billion nuclear buildup in response to US NMD plans could threaten Russia's position in the Far East. This imbalance may lead Russia to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate Forces Treaty. Many Russian officials and analysts believe that U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and deployment of a nationwide missile defense system would undermine arms control agreements, upset strategic stability, and threaten Russia's nuclear deterrent. Russia may withdraw from arms control agreements and deploy military forces to offset the U.S. threat, including changes in the deployment of nuclear weapons. The potential impact of the unratified treaty on Russia's ICBM force is significant. It would require Russia to eliminate multiple warhead missiles and reduce the number of warheads on others. The aging SS-18 missiles, crucial to Russia's nuclear force, are likely to be phased out due to production challenges. Russia may struggle to maintain its ICBM forces without the treaty's implementation. Russia lacks economic resources to build a new plant for ICBMs. If not bound by START II ban, Russia could deploy SS-25 and SS-27 ICBMs with multiple warheads. Russia currently has 360 SS-25 and 30 SS-27 missiles, with plans to produce up to 30 SS-27 missiles per year. Production rates are low, so the expected number of SS-27 missiles is likely to be lower than initially anticipated. Russia's ICBM force is expected to have fewer than 1000 warheads by the end of the decade, down from over 3,500 currently. Russia may deploy new intermediate-range missiles and potentially abrogate the 1987 INF Treaty to offset China's nuclear expansion and oppose US NMD plans. Russia could potentially produce new intermediate-range missiles in a short time frame, with the Moscow Institute of Heat and Engineering having blueprints ready for production at the Votkinsk missile assembly facility. This move is seen as a response to the United States' plans to maintain a large military presence in Europe, which Russia views as a significant target for its missiles. Russia is unlikely to produce large numbers of intermediate-range missiles quickly due to economic constraints at the Votkinsk Missile Assembly facility. The production of these missiles could impact the already low production rate of SS-27 missiles. In the early 1990s, the US and Soviet Union withdrew shorter-range nuclear delivery systems without formal agreements or monitoring. Russia redeployed these weapons from former Soviet republics. Russia redeployed weapons from former Soviet republics to storage areas within Russia. Concerns exist that Russia may move these weapons closer to its western borders in response to U.S. deployment of NMD. This response aligns with Russia's new national security strategy, allowing for the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons in retaliation to conventional military attacks. Russia's change in military strategy is seen as a response to its degraded conventional capabilities and concerns about NATO enlargement. The threat of new nuclear deployments near Europe is believed to be a tactic to gain support from US allies in Europe against missile defense. Despite threats to redeploy nuclear forces, experts doubt Russia will win European support. The shift in strategy is likely due to Russia's diminished conventional capabilities. Russian officials have proposed relying on diplomacy rather than missile defense to address the threat of missile proliferation. The Clinton Administration did not dismiss this approach but emphasized the need for both diplomatic efforts and defensive systems. In 1999, Russia suggested establishing international measures to combat missile proliferation. In June 1999, Russia proposed a Global Missile and Missile Technology Non-proliferation Control System under U.N. auspices to regulate nations seeking ballistic missile technologies and incentivize disarmament. Russia proposed a Global Missile and Missile Technology Non-proliferation Control System under U.N. auspices to create a launch-monitoring regime for transparency in ballistic missile developments. Nations participating would gain understanding of neighboring countries' missile developments, potentially reducing the need for their own missiles. The regime includes a global monitoring system for missile launch detection and offers security guarantees for nations forgoing ballistic missile development. The Russian proposal for a Global Missile and Missile Technology Non-proliferation Control System aimed to create a launch-monitoring regime for transparency in ballistic missile developments. The Clinton Administration responded cautiously, expressing concerns about potential criticism of U.S. NMD plans. Russia held two organizational meetings outlining the plan for the regime and discussing an international code of conduct. The participants discussed an international code of conduct on missile technology transfers at the MTCR meetings in 2000. The United States did not actively participate in the GCS forum, with the Clinton Administration considering integrating the GCS proposal into the existing MTCR framework. Russia's President Putin proposed cooperation with European nations on developing defenses against theater ballistic missiles in 2000. Putin proposed a regionally-based missile defense system that would not violate the ABM Treaty. Meetings between NATO officials and Russia's Minister of Defense outlined possible areas of cooperation, including joint assessment of missile threats, development of a pan-European missile defense system, creation of a missile launch warning center, joint exercises, research, and development of defense systems. Russia proposed the creation of nonstrategic missile defense formations for joint actions to protect peacekeeping forces or civilians. A nine-page paper titled \"Phases of European Missile Defense\" detailed the defensive system relying on conventional terminal defenses in transportable units. Cooperation between Russia and European nations would involve reviewing emerging ballistic missile threats. Russia proposed the creation of nonstrategic missile defense formations for joint actions to protect peacekeeping forces or civilians. They suggested establishing a joint early warning center to share information on missile launches and developing a non-strategic anti-ballistic missile system using Russian technology. However, the plan lacked specifics and technical evaluation, serving as a theoretical basis for a mobile European-based system. Russian officials emphasized their capability to develop and produce such a system. Russia proposed creating nonstrategic missile defense formations for joint actions, including a joint early warning center. The plan lacked specifics but mentioned using Russian S-300 and S-400 air-defense systems. These systems have capabilities similar to the U.S. Patriot system and can intercept multiple missiles or aircraft simultaneously. The S-400 version of the missile defense system, similar to the U.S. Patriot system, can intercept missiles with ranges up to 3,500 kilometers. The system entered production in mid-2000 and may become operational in 2001. The U.S. expressed concerns that the Russian proposal for a European missile defense system would not protect against long-range threats from countries like Iran and North Korea. The Russian proposal for a cooperative missile defense system with Europe was seen as a way to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States. Analysts viewed it as a clumsy attempt by Moscow to pressure the Clinton Administration to defer missile defense deployment. However, the reaction to Russia's more detailed February 2001 proposal focusing on theater missile defenses for Europe was less critical. Both the Bush Administration and NATO officials noted that Russia seemed to agree with the need for theater missile defenses in Europe. Russia's second proposal on theater missile defenses for Europe indicated a shift in tone, suggesting that Russia recognized the Bush Administration's commitment to missile defense deployment. The Clinton Administration aimed to address Russian concerns by assuring that the ABM Treaty would remain largely intact and missile defenses would be limited. Russia's detailed alternative proposal may indicate a desire to maintain dialogue with the United States on missile defenses. The Clinton Administration proposed modest changes to the ABM Treaty to deploy a limited ground-based site in Alaska and upgrade radar capabilities, while acknowledging the possibility of future modifications. Despite futile discussions with Russian officials, the US never suggested deploying a robust, layered defense including sea-based or space-based interceptors. The Bush Administration has shifted the U.S. approach towards Russia's concerns regarding the ABM Treaty, stating that it is not relevant in the current strategic framework. President Bush emphasized the need to move away from the Treaty in a speech on May 1, 2001. President Bush announced on May 1, 2001, that the United States would abandon the ABM Treaty and replace it with a new framework for missile defense. The Bush Administration's approach includes a layered defense system with components on land, at sea, and in space, in contrast to the limited approach of the Clinton Administration. The Administration has not yet finalized its missile defense architecture and has not sought Russia's approval for the technologies involved. The Bush Administration has not convinced Russia that U.S. missile defense plans would not intercept a deliberate Russian attack or undermine Russia's deterrent. Verbal assurances have been given that the U.S. does not view Russia as an adversary and would not direct missile defense efforts against Russian forces. Discussions between Presidents Bush and Putin in July 2001 aimed to reach agreement on a new strategic framework, but the U.S. did not see these talks as the start of formal negotiations for a new treaty. Instead, the U.S. wanted Russia to agree to their missile defense plans. Russia preferred to maintain some form of Treaty regime in place, valuing predictability and formality in arms control agreements. Reports suggest Russia may have been willing to allow more extensive testing of missile defense systems and relax definitions in the Agreed Statements on Demarcation. It sought details on how the U.S. missile defense program would be constrained by the ABM Treaty to devise amendments. In essence, Russia approached the issue differently from the United States. The Bush Administration did not offer any proposals for amendments to relax constraints on U.S. missile defense plans, unlike during the Clinton Administration. Congress has expressed varying opinions on missile defense and arms control, with debates dominated by questions about the ABM Treaty. The debates on U.S. missile defense plans in the authorization and appropriations process also address implications for the U.S.-Russia relationship and arms control. Critics fear Russia's threat to withdraw from arms control agreements, while others argue that the benefits of arms control may not outweigh the vulnerability to missile attacks. The United States and Russia have signed a new Treaty to reduce their offensive nuclear forces, despite concerns about Russia's potential withdrawal from older Treaties. Critics worry that Russia may cease cooperation in various policy areas if the U.S. withdraws from the ABM Treaty. Some fear that Russia could harm U.S. national security by expanding nuclear cooperation with Iran if the U.S. withdraws from the ABM Treaty. Concerns include the potential for Russia to withdraw from the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, leading to the risk of Russian nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. This threat is seen as potentially greater than emerging missile threats targeted by U.S. missile defenses. However, some doubt that Russian policies in these areas would be directly linked to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Russia has been cooperating with Iran in nuclear developments and military sales for years driven by its interest in earning hard currency. It is unlikely to cut off cooperation under the Nunn-Lugar programs due to recognizing threats posed by potential loss of nuclear weapons. Russia conducted a global public relations campaign to gain support from other countries in opposing U.S. missile defense policies, aligning with China to criticize them as a threat to international stability. Russia has aligned with China to oppose U.S. missile defense plans, seeking support from U.S. allies in Europe. Critics warn of international isolation if the U.S. pursues missile defenses and withdraws from the ABM Treaty. The Bush Administration promised consultation with allies to ease concerns and reduce resistance. Supporters of missile defense deployments generally support consultation with U.S. allies to ease concerns and reduce resistance. They argue that U.S. missile defenses will enhance international security and that objections from other nations will not affect U.S. policy objectives. The international reaction to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was relatively quiet, with Russia's mild response being a key factor. During the early months of the Bush Administration, there was debate on how Russia would react to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. Some believed Russia would cooperate once they saw the U.S. commitment to withdrawal, easing concerns about U.S. intentions. Others argued that Russia had well-reasoned objections to U.S. missile defense policies and the ABM Treaty, and was unlikely to change its views.

Russia's President Putin supported the U.S. war on terrorism after the September 2001 attacks, allowing U.S. forces to use bases in former Soviet republics and sharing intelligence about Afghanistan. President Putin supported the U.S. war on terrorism after the September 2001 attacks, allowing U.S. forces to use bases in former Soviet republics and sharing intelligence about Afghanistan. When the U.S. announced its intent to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, Russia's reaction differed from expectations, with President Putin calling the decision \"mistaken\" but emphasizing efforts to preserve the Treaty. President Putin supported the U.S. war on terrorism post-9/11 and allowed U.S. forces to use bases in former Soviet republics. When the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, Putin called it a mistake but emphasized preserving the Treaty. The White House welcomed Putin's statement, agreeing that the withdrawal posed no threat to Russia's security. Russia pledged to work with the U.S. to formalize reductions in offensive forces, with officials and analysts in Russia responding with a mild tone. Andrey Kokoshin, a former Deputy Defense Minister, stated that Russia's security wouldn't be undermined as they had weapons capable of overcoming U.S. defenses, and there was no need to enhance their strategic nuclear forces. Russia's response to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty varied. Some officials, like former Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, believed it wouldn't impact Russia's security for 10-15 years and supported negotiating a new strategic framework. However, the Duma approved a resolution calling the withdrawal \"mistaken and destabilizing.\" By the time the withdrawal took effect, the U.S. and Russia had negotiated a new Treaty limiting strategic offensive weapons and signed a Joint Declaration for cooperation. Russia's response to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty varied. Foreign Minister Ivanov noted the event but aimed to minimize negative consequences. Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov stated Russia had no reason to retaliate as the U.S. missile defense system did not exist yet. The Russian Duma criticized the withdrawal as a political mistake and proposed declaring Russia free from its commitments. The Russian government declared itself free from its commitments under the START II Treaty in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. However, this action was largely symbolic as officials from both countries acknowledged the absence of the Treaty. Despite initial criticism of U.S. missile defense plans, the Russian reaction was less aggressive due to changes in the international security environment and improving U.S.-Russian relations."
