    "content": "The Transition-to-Success Mentoring Act authorizes appropriations for a mentoring program to support students' transition to success. $50,000,000 is allocated for fiscal year 2012, with additional funding for future years. The Secretary will award grants to establish school-based mentoring programs for eligible students transitioning from middle school to high school. Eligible entities must submit an application to receive a grant and use the funds to assign each eligible student to a success coach in all middle schools served. Each eligible student in middle schools is assigned a success coach who creates a personalized plan for academic, personal, and career goals, involving students, teachers, and parents. The coach also enters into a written agreement with parents and meets with the student regularly. The success coach meets with the student monthly to assist in achieving goals, identify academic weaknesses, provide tools for academic excellence, and ensure a successful transition to high school. Quarterly meetings involve the student, parents, teachers, or counselors to address behavioral issues and provide support. The success coach works with the student, parents, teachers, or counselors to evaluate progress, set new goals, and advocate for the student. Funds can be used for training programs and materials for success coaches. The grant under the mentoring program lasts for 5 years and requires eligible entities to report on student participation, academic achievement, contact hours with success coaches, and any other relevant information to the Secretary. The Secretary may require additional information to evaluate the success of school-based mentoring programs funded under this section. An interim report on program success is due after the third fiscal year, and a final report after the fifth fiscal year. In this section, mentoring programs funded may include information on at-risk students, defined as those with below a 2.0 GPA who may face academic challenges, dropout risk, substance abuse, pregnancy, juvenile justice involvement, limited English proficiency, gang affiliation, past dropout history, or high absenteeism. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"eligible entity\" and \"eligible student\" in the context of a mentoring program for at-risk students in middle schools. Eligible entities include local educational agencies receiving funds under Title I or identified as high-need, while eligible students are those enrolled in a middle school served by an eligible entity and considered at-risk. The curr_chunk defines \"high-need local educational agency\" as per section 2102(3)(A), \"middle school\" as a school providing education for grades 6-9, and \"school-based mentoring\" as mentoring activities coordinated with schools to assist at-risk students academically. A success coach is an individual who assists at-risk students in improving academic achievement, reducing disciplinary referrals, and increasing positive regard for school. They can be an employee of a local educational agency or a volunteer from a nonprofit organization, and must receive training and support in mentoring before becoming a success coach. Success coaches must undergo screening by an eligible entity, including job reference, child and domestic abuse, and criminal background checks."
