    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2002\" and includes findings. The Congress recognizes the importance of the Harold Rogers Prescription Monitoring Program in providing valuable information on prescription drug monitoring practices. Controlled substances have legitimate medical purposes but also carry a risk of misuse, leading to detrimental effects on public health. The absence of a national databank for health information is a current issue. A national electronic databank is needed for health care practitioners and pharmacists to access information on schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances to prevent misuse and unnecessary prescriptions, especially for substances involved in interstate and foreign commerce. III, and IV controlled substances dispensed interstate with significant interstate effects. SEC. 399O. ELECTRONIC MONITORING SYSTEM FOR DISPENSING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. The Secretary will establish an electronic system for practitioner monitoring of dispensing controlled substances. Practitioners will not be charged a fee for this system. Dispensers must report required information to the Secretary, with exceptions for certain drugs. The Secretary will determine the information to be reported. The Secretary will determine the information to be reported for each schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance, including patient identifier, drug dispensed, date of dispensing, quantity dispensed, number of refills ordered, practitioner who signed the prescription, and dispenser. The reporting will be in electronic format specified by the Secretary, with the possibility of waiving the requirement for individual dispensers. The Secretary may provide information from the system upon request. The curr_chunk provides guidelines for accessing patient information from a controlled substance reporting system. Practitioners can request information for medical treatment purposes, while law enforcement authorities can request information for investigations related to unlawful substance diversion or misuse. The curr_chunk outlines restrictions on accessing patient information for research purposes by specific agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services, State Medicaid programs, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. It also emphasizes the need to limit the information provided to the minimum necessary. The Secretary must limit the information provided under subsection (f) to the minimum necessary and make efforts to implement a real-time electronic system. Reports must be submitted within 1 week of the request. Information received from the Secretary cannot be shared without proper authorization. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 allows for the disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities for criminal investigations. Dispensers who fail to transmit required information may face a civil monetary penalty of $100 per violation. Any person who knowingly discloses transmitted information to unauthorized individuals or obtains information not related to a current patient may face a civil monetary penalty of up to $25,000 per violation. States have the option to establish their own prescription monitoring systems, following their own regulations, instead of using the Federal program. The Harold Rogers Prescription Monitoring Program allows States to access funding for developing systems to provide additional information for refining Federal and State programs. Definitions for administering controlled substances directly to patients are provided in this section. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to the administration and dispensing of controlled substances, including terms like 'agent', 'dispense', and 'dispenser'. It also defines the term 'local, State, or Federal law enforcement, narcotics control, licensure, disciplinary, or program authority'. The curr_chunk outlines the entities authorized to access information relevant to licensees of various healthcare-related boards, including State and local narcotics control agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration, State boards of podiatry, dentistry, pharmacy, and other healthcare disciplines, the Department of Health and Human Services, State Medicaid programs, and judicial authorities with proper subpoenas. The curr_chunk defines the term 'patient identifier' as including the patient's full name, address, date of birth, and social security number or alternative identification number. It also defines 'practitioner' as various healthcare professionals licensed to distribute controlled substances. The curr_chunk defines schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances as those included in the Controlled Substances Act."
