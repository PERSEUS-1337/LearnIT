The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts health insurance premiums will increase by $2,100 for millions of families by 2016 due to the Democrats' health overhaul. The Obama Administration's own actuaries predict national health expenditures will increase by $311 billion from 2010-2019. CMS actuaries also predict 14 million Americans will lose their employer-sponsored insurance due to the Democrats' health overhaul. The Democrats' health overhaul penalizes Americans who save money for health care and threatens to reduce the value of health benefits for millions with Flexible Spending Arrangements and Health Savings Accounts. CBO estimates the overhaul slashes Medicare by over half a trillion dollars to fund a new Government entitlement program. Medicare actuaries warn that the cuts could make it difficult for providers to remain profitable and may jeopardize access to care for beneficiaries. CMS actuaries predict 7 million Medicare beneficiaries will be affected. The Democrats' health law includes $569.2 billion in tax increases, breaking Obama's pledge. Unemployment rate remains near 10%. CBO predicts tax hikes for employers not offering approved health insurance. The Democrats' health law includes $52 billion in fees for employers not offering approved health insurance. CBO states that employees bear the cost through lower wages. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warns that the health overhaul may lead to outsourcing and higher costs for consumers. The Democrats' health law imposes fees on employers not providing approved health insurance, leading to lower wages for employees. The National Federation of Independent Business warns that employees bear the cost through reduced employment opportunities and productivity. CBO predicts that millions of Americans will pay billions in taxes for not purchasing government-approved health insurance, with a significant burden on low-income families. The IRS may need to hire thousands of additional workers to enforce the new taxes and penalties. The Democrats' health overhaul imposes new taxes and penalties, expanding government reach into Americans' lives. CMS actuaries predict $110 billion in health care industry taxes will lead to higher premiums. Subsidies in the overhaul financially penalize married couples, with an example showing a marriage penalty of $9,640 for a couple earning $32,000 each. The rapid phase-out of premium tax credits, combined with high tax rates, can result in effective marginal tax rates over 100%, discouraging individuals from working harder. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may lead to government-sanctioned rationing of life-saving treatments based on cost. CMS actuaries predict inadequate funding for a program to cover the sickest Americans, potentially leading to substantial premium increases for solvency. The CMS actuaries estimate that premiums will need to increase substantially for solvency. Democrats' health overhaul will push 18,000,000 Americans into Medicaid, straining the system. States will have to spend an extra $20 billion on Medicaid amidst budget crises. The national debt is at $12 trillion, with a $1.4 trillion budget deficit. Democrats' budget gimmicks were exposed by CMS actuaries regarding a new long-term care program. The House Republican health reform bill is estimated to reduce premiums by up to $1,050 annually and the Federal deficit by $68 billion over the next 10 years. Additionally, the bill does not cut Medicare or increase taxes. Democrats' new health care law is facing challenges to its constitutionality by 21 State attorneys general. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 are repealed, restoring previous laws. The Common Sense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act is enacted into law as H.R. 4038."
