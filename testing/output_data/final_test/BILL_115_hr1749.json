The VET CARE Act of 2017 includes a pilot program to provide outpatient dental services and treatment, including related appliances, to eligible veterans aged 40-70 with type 2 diabetes, enrolled in the VA system, at no cost. The program aims to determine if dental care reduces complications of chronic ailments, leading to lower healthcare costs. The pilot program under the VET CARE Act of 2017 provides outpatient dental services to eligible veterans aged 40-70 with type 2 diabetes. Eligible veterans can apply for the program, undergo a periodontal evaluation, and those diagnosed with periodontal disease requiring surgery are disqualified. The Secretary will enroll at least 1,500 eligible veterans, prioritizing those with service-connected disabilities. The pilot program under the VET CARE Act of 2017 focuses on disability ratings for veterans with periodontal disease. One-third of eligible veterans must have no or mild periodontitis, while two-thirds must have moderate to severe periodontitis. The program will run for four years in five Veterans Health Administration facilities across different networks. The pilot program under the VET CARE Act of 2017 focuses on providing periodontal therapy to veterans enrolled in the program. Each facility will serve a specific proportion of veterans categorized under subsection (c)(3), with timely therapy available to those in need. Treated veterans will receive annual dental evaluations to assess their periodontal health outcomes. During the pilot program, the Secretary will collect health data on treated veterans for analysis. Standardized instructions will be provided to healthcare providers for consistent care. Enrolled veterans will receive orientation, pre-care information, and an exit interview on obtaining dental services. The Secretary will notify institutions of higher education offering degrees in periodontology about the pilot program for veterans' dental care. A report of findings will be submitted to Congress 18 months after the program ends. The program will be administered under specific regulations including informed consent and study registration."
