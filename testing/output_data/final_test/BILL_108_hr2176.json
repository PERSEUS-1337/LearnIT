    "content": "The Act titled \"National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003\" provides TRICARE coverage for members of the Ready Reserve. TRICARE program now covers members of the Ready Reserve, allowing them to enroll in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Standard. Eligible members can choose self alone or self and family coverage, including dependents described in specific sections of the title. The Secretary of Defense provides open enrollment periods for TRICARE program enrollment or changes. Members and dependents receive benefits equivalent to active duty personnel. Premiums are charged for coverage options. The Secretary of Defense sets premiums for self alone and self and family coverage under the TRICARE program options. Premium amounts are calculated as 28 percent of the total actuarial value determined by the Secretary. Members can have premiums deducted from their basic pay or compensation. Collected premiums are credited to the Defense Health Program appropriation. The collected premiums for TRICARE program options are credited to the Defense Health Program appropriation and merged with available sums for the fiscal year. Enrollees are subject to deductibles, copayments, and other charges for health care. Enrollment in the TRICARE program can only be terminated during an open enrollment period. During an open enrollment period, enrollment in the TRICARE program can be terminated for failure to pay premiums or upon ceasing to be eligible. Members cannot enroll while entitled to transitional health care or within 90 days of termination. Enrollment in the TRICARE program can be terminated within one year after enrollment if entitlement to health care under certain sections is terminated. The Secretary of Defense will prescribe regulations for this section. The TRICARE program offers coverage for members of the Ready Reserve through TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard options. Implementation of the program will begin 180 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. ALLOWANCE FOR CONTINUATION OF NON-TRICARE HEALTH BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN MOBILIZED RESERVES. The Secretary concerned will pay the premium to continue qualified health benefits plan coverage for eligible reserve component members called to active duty. For eligible reserve component members called to active duty during a war or national emergency, the Secretary concerned will pay the premium to maintain qualified health benefits plan coverage. This coverage must be in force at the time of notification or order, apply to the member and dependents, and not have lapsed. The applicable premium for continuation of health benefits plan coverage for a member is based on the member's premium amount for themselves and dependents. The maximum amount that can be paid for the premium in a fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the number of dependents covered by the plan by the per capita cost of providing TRICARE coverage. The benefits coverage continuation period for qualified health benefits is also specified. The continuation period for qualified health benefits plan coverage for a member called to active duty begins on the date of the call and ends when the member's eligibility for transitional health care terminates or when the member elects to terminate coverage for dependents. Additionally, any COBRA coverage period for a member under this section can be extended. The Revenue Code of 1986 states that benefits coverage continuation period for a member under this section is deemed equal to the COBRA continuation provision. Dependents of a member receiving benefits under a qualified health benefits plan are not eligible for TRICARE benefits during the coverage period. Members can revoke their election under subsection (a) allowing their dependents to become eligible for benefits. The TRICARE program benefits extend to members' dependents as outlined in this chapter, with regulations set by the Secretary of Defense. Section 1078b of title 10, United States Code allows for the continuation of non-TRICARE health benefits plan coverage for certain Reserves called to active duty and their dependents. This applies to calls or orders issued by the Secretary of a military department after the enactment of this Act."
