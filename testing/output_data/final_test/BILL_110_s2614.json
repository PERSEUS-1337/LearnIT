    "content": "The \"Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Act\" or the \"GEAR Act\" aims to incentivize the development of technology to permanently remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on a large scale. The \"GEAR Act\" defines key terms such as Commission, greenhouse gas, and intellectual property. The Commission is responsible for overseeing greenhouse gas removal efforts, which include gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and others deemed necessary. Intellectual property refers to patentable inventions related to the Act. The term \"Secretary\" in the GEAR Act refers to the Secretary of Energy. The GEAR Act establishes a program for greenhouse gas emission atmospheric removal, providing financial awards for technology that can capture or sequester gases without harmful effects. A Commission will oversee this program. The GEAR Act establishes the \"Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Commission\" within the Department of Energy, composed of 11 members with expertise in various disciplines appointed by the President for a 6-year term. The Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Commission, composed of 11 members appointed by the President for a 6-year term, will hold an initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. The Commission will meet at the call of the Chairperson, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. The Commission will select a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson from among its members. The Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Commission, consisting of 11 members appointed by the President, will develop requirements for the competition process, performance standards, monitoring procedures, and award scales. They will set minimum levels for greenhouse gas capture/sequestration and offer financial awards to entities meeting these criteria. Members will be compensated at level III of the Executive Schedule. The Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Commission will provide financial awards to entities that demonstrate successful technology design, bench scale demonstration, operational technology achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions, and commercially viable scale operation. Recipients must submit an annual progress report to Congress. The Greenhouse Gas Emission Atmospheric Removal Commission will provide financial awards to entities that demonstrate successful technology design, bench scale demonstration, operational technology achieving significant greenhouse gas reductions, and commercially viable scale operation. Recipients must submit an annual progress report to Congress. The Commission must establish demonstration goals and provide a report on necessary funding within a year of the Act's enactment. Public participation and peer review are required before any financial awards are provided. The Commission will establish peer review standards for financial awards. SEC. 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONSIDERATIONS. Title to intellectual property from financial awards under this Act vests in US entities. The US may reserve a license for intellectual property but cannot disclose proprietary information. Title can only be transferred to US entities after the first patent expires. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act, while the Commission's authority under the Act will terminate on December 31, 2020."
