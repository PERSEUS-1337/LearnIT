Revitalizing these institutions is crucial for attracting families back to the region and ensuring economic recovery, as well as providing a skilled workforce for the Gulf Coast economy. The return of academic professionals and administrators is crucial for revitalizing higher education institutions in the Gulf Coast region. Students and their families attending these institutions contribute significantly to the local economy. Many industries in the region rely on these institutions.

The application must include required information and be in accordance with the Secretary's guidelines. The institution seeking a grant must demonstrate being an affected institution, specify the grant amount, and show the need due to economic impact and enrollment decline from a Gulf hurricane disaster. The institution must provide an assessment of damage, information on additional needs, and a plan to carry out the purposes of the grant. Priority is given to affected institutions most in need, as determined by the Secretary. Reporting requirements include submitting reports annually for the duration of the grant. The grant is awarded for institutions affected by disasters, with reporting requirements on populations served, use of funds, financial statements, and impact on enrollment and retention. Periodic reviews are conducted to ensure proper fund management. The Secretary has $3 billion available for fiscal year 2006 to ensure proper management of grant funds and program outcomes. SEC. 4. LOAN FORGIVENESS. The purpose of this section is to encourage students to continue attending and earning degrees from affected institutions of higher education. The Secretary shall carry out a program to assume the obligation to repay qualified loan amounts for loans made under specific parts of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and cancel the obligation for borrowers who meet certain criteria. This includes returning to or enrolling in an affected institution, obtaining an associate's or bachelor's degree, and not being in default on a loan. The Secretary will repay qualified loan amounts for students completing degrees at affected institutions. For an associate's degree, full-time students receive $2,500 per academic year, while part-time students receive $2,500 for one academic year equivalent to full-time enrollment, not exceeding $5,000. For a bachelor's degree, full-time students receive $2,500. The Secretary will repay up to $10,000 for full-time students and the equivalent for part-time students at affected institutions. The total repayment cannot exceed the student's federal loan obligation or $10,000, whichever is less. Regulations will prevent excessive repayment for prolonged enrollment periods. The Secretary will prioritize grants for students in need and will not refund any loan repayments. $1.6 billion is available for fiscal year 2006 to 2013 to carry out this section. The Secretary can issue regulations to implement the Act, emergency designations are made for certain sections, and definitions are provided.
