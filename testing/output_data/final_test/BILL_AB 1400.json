    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25200.24 of the Health and Safety Code requires new or renewed hazardous waste facilities permits to include monitoring devices at the facility's fence line to detect potential releases into the surrounding community. Section 25200.25 of the Health and Safety Code states that if a local air pollution control district imposes a similar requirement to Section 25200.24 on hazardous waste facilities applying for a new permit or renewal, the facility must comply with the district's requirement instead. A member of the public can request a technical assistance grant for help with a pending hazardous waste facilities permit application. The grant must be requested within one year of the permit application submission, but may be granted later at the department's discretion. The permit applicant funds the grant, and the department sets criteria for entities providing assistance. Upon receipt of a new hazardous waste facilities permit application or renewal, the department will post on its website the application status and information on applying for a technical assistance grant. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act, as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Section 4629.8 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 4629.8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines \"administrative costs\" as all non-direct service expenditures, including compensation, benefits, payroll taxes, and other related expenses for managerial personnel. Administrative costs include compensation, benefits, payroll taxes, workers' compensation, facility costs, maintenance, data processing, training, travel, licenses, taxes, interest, insurance, depreciation, and procurement activities. Administrative costs also include personal liability insurance, general expenses, consultants, distributions to shareholders, advertising, conference costs, facility and office equipment costs, transfers to a corporate parent or franchisor, and other general operating and overhead costs. Direct service expenditures for in-home respite care include wages, benefits, payroll taxes, and financial management services such as payroll duties and processing payments. Service agencies providing in-home respite services must spend at least 85% of regional center funds on direct service expenditures, excluding administrative costs. Annual revenue of at least $7 million from in-home respite services is required for this provision. The contracting service agency must have annual revenue of at least $7 million from in-home respite services provided to regional center consumers. The parent organization of the contracting entity must also meet this revenue requirement. Service providers and contractors must provide regional centers with access to records related to their rates upon request."
