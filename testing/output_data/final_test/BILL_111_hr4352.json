    "content": "The Act titled \"Small and Rural Communities Wastewater Infrastructure Act\" is introduced to amend Title VI of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by adding a new section 607 regarding publicly owned treatment works serving small and disadvantaged communities. The Act allocates funds from capitalization grants to assist publicly owned treatment works serving different population sizes, with a minimum percentage designated for works serving 5,000 or fewer persons. The Act allocates funds to assist treatment works serving between 20,001 and 50,000 persons, with funds to be used for other purposes if applications are insufficient. The State can use funds from capitalization grants for preconstruction assistance for small treatment works, including preloans for eligible recipients for various project costs. The Administrator determines appropriate costs for preloans under this subsection. Preloans cannot be used for land acquisition costs. The maximum individual preloan amount is 10% of the project cost, and the maximum aggregate preloan amount is 15% of funds received by a State in capitalization grants. Repayment of preloans is required for eligible recipients. Preloans made to eligible recipients for eligible projects are considered part of the primary loan amount. Repayment of preloan amounts is not required until payments begin for the primary loan, and interest on preloan amounts does not accrue until interest begins on the primary loan. If an eligible recipient does not apply for a primary loan within 3 years, certain conditions apply. The State may require repayment of the preloan with interest if the eligible recipient does not comply with the 3-year deadline, except in cases of delays in environmental reviews by Federal or State agencies. The term 'eligible project' refers to a project eligible for assistance under section 603(c)(1) for construction of a public owned treatment works serving 50,000 or fewer persons. The term 'eligible recipient' refers to a municipality or agency seeking assistance for such a project. The terms 'preloan' and 'primary loan' refer to financial assistance provided by a State for an eligible project before and after approval of a loan. Additionally, Governors can designate disadvantaged communities for additional assistance. The Governor of a State can establish criteria to designate disadvantaged communities with a population of 50,000 or fewer that would struggle to raise revenue for eligible projects without assistance. States can provide additional assistance for projects receiving loan assistance. The Governor of a State can designate disadvantaged communities for additional assistance in connection with loans for projects benefiting those communities. This assistance may include forgiveness of loan principal, reduced interest, extended repayment periods up to 30 years, or a combination of these options. The application process for loans benefiting designated disadvantaged communities will undergo reform. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must consult with various stakeholders to improve the process for obtaining financing from State water pollution control revolving loan funds. A report with recommendations for further improvements must be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment.
