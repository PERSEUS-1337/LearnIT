    "content": "The \"End Radon in Schools Act\" establishes a grant program for radon testing in public schools. The Environmental Protection Agency will award grants to States for short-term radon testing to identify and mitigate unsafe levels. Guidelines for radon testing in schools will be updated and published within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will provide grant awards to States for radon testing and mitigation under the \"End Radon in Schools Act\". Grants will be given for initial testing, additional testing if needed, and mitigation measures as required by the Act. The \"End Radon in Schools Act\" provides grant awards to States for radon testing and mitigation. States required to conduct reevaluation under section 5(d) will receive an additional grant award to complete the reevaluation. SEC. 4. APPLICATION; PRIORITY. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State must submit an application to the Administrator, certifying the use of funds for testing and mitigating radon levels in public schools. Grant priority is determined by ranking States in relation to each other based on their applications. Priority for grant allocation under this Act is determined based on the percentage of a State's landmass in Radon Zone 1. States with 100% landmass in Zone 1 are given highest priority, followed by States with less than 100% at the Secretary's discretion. The use of funds is outlined in Section 5 of the Act. The State receiving a grant must follow guidelines for radon measurements in schools, test radon levels, mitigate unsafe levels, and reevaluate mitigation if necessary. Testing involves conducting short-term tests in each public school and submitting a report to the Administrator. In the case of a public school with radon levels at or above 4 picocuries per liter, additional short-term tests must be conducted in accordance with the Administrator's guidelines. If the average radon levels are at least 4 picocuries per liter, the State must mitigate the radon levels by providing funds for mitigation. The State must seek certification from local educational agencies serving public schools with high radon levels to complete mitigation actions if provided funding. If certification is not obtained, the Administrator will directly carry out mitigation measures. The Administrator or a local educational agency must submit a report describing test results and estimating funds needed for radon mitigation at public schools. Mitigation actions will be carried out by working with licensed radon mitigation professionals. The public school must work with a licensed radon mitigation professional to create and implement a mitigation plan within specific timeframes. They must conduct annual tests and reevaluate if necessary. If a radon level at or above 4 picocuries per liter is found at a public school after implementing the mitigation plan, the school must reevaluate the plan with a licensed professional, create an alternative plan, submit a report to the Administrator, and implement the alternative plan within 6 months. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA, \"licensed radon mitigation professional\" is someone approved to mitigate radon, \"local educational agency\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and \"mitigation plan\" is the radon mitigation strategy developed by the professional in consultation with the agency. The term \"mitigation unit\" refers to individuals designated by the local educational agency to implement the mitigation plan. \"Public school\" is defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \"Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines\" is a report providing information on radon testing in public schools. \"Radon Zone 1\" includes areas with indoor radon levels greater than 4 picocuries per liter. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States and the District of Columbia. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. A \"short-term test\" is a test approved by the Administrator to determine the acceptable amount of radon in the air for human inhalation, lasting between 2 to 90 days."
