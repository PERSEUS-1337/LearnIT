    "content": "The \"Excellence in Education Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title. Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Excellence in Education Act of 1999\" defines core curriculum as subjects like reading, writing, math, social sciences, and science. It also defines terms like elementary school, local educational agency, secondary school, and Secretary. The Act also defines the practice of social promotion as promoting a student to the next grade despite not meeting state achievement standards. The term \"construction\" in the context of school facilities includes preparing drawings, building new facilities, remodeling, and supervising construction. The term \"school facility\" refers to a public structure suitable for educational purposes, excluding athletic stadiums or facilities primarily for sports events with admission fees. Labor standards must be applied for construction activities related to school facilities. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $5 billion annually from 2000 to 2004. The Secretary can grant funds to local educational agencies for constructing new public schools. Certain conditions must be met to receive the funds. Local educational agencies must meet specific requirements to receive funds under this Act, including reducing class and school sizes. Class size limits are set at a 20 to 1 student-to-teacher ratio for kindergarten through grade 6, and 28 to 1 for grade 7 through 12. Additionally, public schools served by the agency must have no more than 500 students. The Act requires schools to have specific student limits based on grade levels: up to 500 students for kindergarten through grade 6, up to 750 students for grade 6 through grade 8, and up to 1,500 students for grade 9 through grade 12. It also mandates the end of social promotion, implementation of State achievement standards, and the use of various assessments to evaluate student performance. The Act mandates teacher evaluations to assess student performance in meeting State achievement standards. It also requires providing remedial education for students who fail to meet these standards, including tutoring, mentoring, summer programs, before-school programs, and after-school programs. Additionally, matching funds from non-Federal sources equal to the Federal funds provided under the grant must be provided for carrying out the activities. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, including details on how the funds will be used, construction plans, cost estimates, and available non-Federal matching funds."
