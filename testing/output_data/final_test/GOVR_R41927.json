Policy makers face challenges in designing effective policies to combat evolving criminal threats. Criminals thrive on crossing borders to provide illegal products and services. Criminals exploit borders to smuggle illegal goods and establish territorial control, leading to violence between rival groups. The Southwest border is a battleground for rival DTOs fighting for territorial control, crossing national, state, and local borders. Criminals also operate in a borderless virtual environment to conduct illicit business, using cyber means to evade traditional boundaries. U.S. law enforcement is hindered by geographic and legal constraints, as well as internal turf wars between agencies. Law enforcement agencies face challenges in keeping pace with evolving criminals who operate across borders and in virtual environments. Interagency disagreements over jurisdictional boundaries and policy changes can impact criminal activity and law enforcement countermeasures. Policymakers are concerned about ensuring that law enforcement is equipped to combat 21st-century threats. Law enforcement agencies must adapt to combat 21st-century criminals who operate across borders and in cyberspace. Policymakers are questioning how to best enable law enforcement to target these criminals, including examining coordination between agencies, legal authorities, technology, and resources. The report analyzes the operational realities within which law enforcement and crime operate. The report examines operational realities for law enforcement and crime, addressing challenges and adaptations to combat present-day criminals. It raises questions on how Congress can support law enforcement in protecting U.S. interests. Physical and virtual boundaries play significant roles in criminal activity and police work, delineating authority and sovereignty. Law enforcement presence at border crossings helps distinguish nations, while borders outline the sovereignty of entities. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces presence at the Southwest border to impede illegal entry. Borders, turf, cyberspace, and jurisdiction shape modern criminal activity and law enforcement efforts. Physical borders are easily recognized, with signals like road signs indicating entry into different geographic areas. Physical boundaries such as road signs and fences delineate geographic areas and signal entry into different jurisdictions. Nations have sovereign control over their territories and enforce laws within their borders. In the United States, the federal government enforces federal laws nationwide, while each state enforces its own laws within its borders. Laws can vary between states, for example, the threshold for felony theft differs between New Mexico and Arizona. Globalization and technological advancements have blurred traditional borders, leading to challenges in enforcing laws and protecting against criminal activities. The tension between border protection and free market ideals has intensified since 9/11, with open border policies promoting efficient trade but also creating opportunities for criminals to exploit weaknesses in security systems. Criminal enterprises have become increasingly borderless, capitalizing on demand for black market goods and services. Criminal networks exploit inefficiencies in market systems created by border protection efforts. They establish turf boundaries for illegal operations, such as drug cartels and street gangs in the United States. In some cases, criminal networks use various means to establish operational turf, as seen in a 2011 indictment of a fraudulent document-trafficking organization. The organization's U.S. operations manager and others were indicted for using brutal violence to eliminate rivals and protect their turf. The organization, based in Mexico, sells counterfeit identification cards in 19 U.S. cities. Suspects posed as customers to attack competitors, binding and beating them. Turf can be established physically or in the cyber world. In 2010, two Trojans, ZeuS and SpyEye, engaged in a cyber turf battle over stealing online banking information. SpyEye challenged ZeuS by stealing its information and removing its toolkit from infected computers. The turf war ended when ZeuS Trojan was no longer maintained and its code merged with SpyEye. The virtual realm lacks clear borders like the physical world, with tools like keyboards and passwords mediating between the two realms. In cyberspace, borders are nebulous as geographic borders do not exist. High-speed Internet has facilitated legitimate business growth but also criminals' activities. Internet users increased from 361 million to 2.4 billion between 2000 and 2012, leading to a rise in cybercrime. Criminals can now exploit victims remotely across the world. U.S. policy makers, officials, and law enforcement are increasingly concerned about cyber threats posed by criminals in the virtual world. Cyberspace has boundaries, including country-specific web addresses and legal parameters governing online activities. Despite these barriers, cybercriminals have quickly evolved from mischievous cyber-vandals to profit-making enterprises. The virtual world offers enhanced anonymity, leading to an increase in cybercrimes like fraud and identity theft. These crimes, although committed online, could be considered traditional crimes if not for the virtual venue. Cyberspace provides criminals with relative anonymity and a borderless space to operate, impacting victims across multiple jurisdictions due to the global nature of the Internet. The Internet's aid impacts victims across state and national jurisdictions. Most cybersecurity incidents are transnational. In a 2010 case, fraudsters from the US, Ukraine, and Sweden scammed users with fake malware, resulting in over $100 million in losses. Transnational cases raise questions about investigation and prosecution. The jurisdictional boundaries between nations, states, and localities raise questions about case investigation and prosecution. When crimes cross state boundaries violating federal law, the federal government may claim jurisdiction. Criminals exploit these boundaries, such as organized retail crime rings targeting multiple locations across states. Criminals exploit jurisdictional boundaries by targeting multiple locations across states to avoid prosecution for felony theft. International boundaries also pose challenges, as perpetrators can flee to countries where the US lacks legal jurisdiction. In 2005, a New Jersey man was convicted for conspiring to bring heroin from Colombia to the US. After fleeing to Colombia, he was extradited back to the US in 2009. Jurisdictional battles exist between federal law enforcement agencies, leading to turf disputes over cases involving cigarette smuggling, explosives, firearms trafficking, and unauthorized immigrants. Jurisdictional battles exist between federal law enforcement agencies over cases involving firearms trafficking, unauthorized immigrants, and drug trafficking. Criminals exploit borders and cyberspace for illicit activities, leading to turf disputes between law enforcement agencies. Criminals operate alone or in networks, crossing borders and jurisdictions to carry out illicit activities using advanced technology. Law enforcement faces challenges due to jurisdictional boundaries and disagreements over case leadership. Criminals operate across borders and jurisdictions, taking advantage of opportunities and challenges in law enforcement. They are not limited by geographic lines or jurisdictional boundaries, moving illicit products and proceeds with ease. Mexican drug traffickers use underground tunnels to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the United States, bypassing geographic borders and law enforcement jurisdictions. Sophisticated tunnels utilize existing infrastructure like storm drains, allowing smugglers to transport drugs further distances. Sophisticated drug smuggling methods include underground tunnels with rail, ventilation, and electrical systems. In January 2006, extensive tunnels were found in Otay Mesa, CA, stretching nearly three-quarters of a mile in length and traveling over 85 feet below the surface. In July 2012, three more tunnels were uncovered along the Southwest border in less than a week. Traffickers also use semi-submersible vessels made of fiberglass to transport drugs, primarily Colombian cocaine, over long distances. Mexican drug traffickers are using ultralight aircraft to smuggle drugs across the Southwest border, flying low to avoid detection. They land on the U.S. side to pass off drugs or use drop baskets to release packages. Border authorities reported 228 ultralight incursions in FY2010, double from FY2009. Traffickers constantly innovate to circumvent borders and supply drugs where there is demand. In January 2010, smugglers in Mexico were intercepted preparing a catapult to fling marijuana over the border. Another instance in April 2010 involved a truck-mounted ramp used to drive over the fence, leading to a seizure of 1,000 pounds of marijuana. In December 2012, smugglers used a pneumatic cannon to propel cans of marijuana over the Southwest border. These incidents demonstrate criminals' determination to overcome barriers for profit. Criminals smuggled 85 pounds of marijuana worth $42,500 over the Southwest border using a tank of carbon dioxide. Scholars believe borders offer opportunities for criminals due to demand for criminal protection in new territories. Criminal organizations may expand into new territories by force to escape infighting, turf battles, or effective law enforcement. Federal law enforcement in the United States has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute federal crimes within the country's borders. However, with the rise of transnational crimes, such as cybercrimes, law enforcement faces challenges when criminals operate across international boundaries. Despite Congress granting extraterritorial jurisdiction for certain crimes, pursuing investigations outside the U.S. can be complex, especially if a criminal commits a crime in the U.S. and then flees the country to avoid prosecution. The United States may need assistance from other countries in criminal investigations or extraditions when criminals target U.S. interests from abroad. Extradition can be complicated due to differences in laws between countries, leading to reluctance to cooperate. For example, actions like child pornography may be illegal in the U.S. but not in other countries. The disparity in cybercrime laws among countries poses challenges for investigations. For example, the \"Love Bug\" virus case in the Philippines highlighted the lack of laws to address computer crimes. This hinders law enforcement efforts, especially in combating transnational criminals. The federal government's role in combating domestic crime has expanded, with federal law enforcement agencies taking on more responsibilities previously held by state and local governments. This shift has led to an increase in the federalization of crimes, but many crimes are still primarily investigated by state and local law enforcement. Organized retail crime, for example, often involves criminals operating across state lines. Organized retail crime operates across state lines, stealing just enough merchandise to stay under the major theft limit. While there is no federal law specifically prohibiting ORC, federal law enforcement can use existing provisions to prosecute ORC rings. Congress has debated amending laws to criminalize ORC, with proponents arguing it would help law enforcement by highlighting the issue and providing a framework for tracking ORC cases. Opponents argue against criminalizing ORC. Opponents of legislation criminalizing ORC argue that existing statutes are sufficient for investigation and prosecution, as federal law enforcement agencies have testified to having the necessary tools. The federal debate on whether offenses like ORC should be criminalized at the state or federal level is ongoing, with a key factor being the capabilities of state and local law enforcement agencies to combat evolving criminal tactics. One option to federalizing offenses is to provide state and local law enforcement with assistance through funding grant programs like the COPS and JAG programs. Another approach is to incentivize coordination and information sharing among federal, state, and local law enforcement through task forces and fusion centers. Globalization and technological advancements have facilitated the expansion of criminal activities across borders and cyberspace. Criminal organizations have evolved to be more networked and cellular, operating across physical borders and cyberspace. Advanced communication systems allow criminals to work remotely, forming specialized roles and outsourcing operations globally. Opportunistic networks may form around specific schemes, according to the U.S. Secret Service. According to the U.S. Secret Service, online criminal groups consist of experienced professionals with global membership, particularly from Eastern Europe. CarderPlanet, a forum founded by Vladislav Horohorin, was a sophisticated network of financial criminals. Despite law enforcement actions, Horohorin's criminal network remains active, with limited knowledge of each other's activities. Criminal networks operate with limited knowledge of each other's activities, allowing them to shield other components if one is disrupted by law enforcement. This loose organizational structure can hinder information sharing within the organization, stunting communication necessary for growth. Compartmentalization also exists in law enforcement agencies, despite a trend towards increased information sharing since 9/11. Despite efforts to increase intelligence-led investigations post-9/11, agencies still compartmentalize operations and restrict information. This hinders organizational growth and learning. Criminals and police both compartmentalize information, but criminals share and process information faster. Criminals operate across borders and target victims without regard for boundaries. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a minority of reported scams and frauds from 2010 involved victims and perpetrators in the same state. Anonymity in the cyber world allows criminals to operate freely and use multiple identities to confuse victims and law enforcement. Criminals can easily target victims across borders using technology like botnets. The Coreflood botnet, a malicious keylogging program, has infected over 2.3 million computers worldwide, with 1.9 million in the United States. Cyber thieves use the stolen data to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. The FBI has filed a complaint against 13 \"John Doe\" defendants, believed to be foreign nationals, in connection with the botnet. Authorities in the US and Estonia seized servers linked to the Coreflood botnet. In December 2012, 10 individuals from various countries were arrested for their involvement in the Butterfly Botnet cybercrime ring. Advance fee fraud schemes have been accelerated by the internet, allowing scammers to target more victims through spam emails. In February 2011, a Nigerian national was sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in an advance fee fraud scheme that targeted individuals in the US, Europe, and Australia. The fraudsters posed as lawyers, bankers, and government officials, collecting fees to secure the transfer of large sums of money to victims. However, at least 18 people were duped out of over $9.5 million, and the promised riches were never received. The perpetrators were eventually arrested in the Netherlands and extradited to the United States. Counterfeit and pirated goods harm legitimate businesses and consumers by threatening competition, innovation, and posing health risks. In June 2011, a Chinese national was sentenced for trafficking counterfeit versions of the weight-loss drug \"Alli\" from China to the US for distribution. The FDA issued warnings about these counterfeit drugs imported from China. Law enforcement traced counterfeit drugs imported from China containing sibutramine instead of orlistat. A consumer suffered a stroke from the counterfeit product. The defendant was located in China, arrested in Hawaii after a face-to-face meeting. Police face challenges in identifying cyber criminals with multiple identities. Cyber criminals can operate under various identities, change accounts frequently, and target victims globally. They exploit the anonymity of the internet and can route crimes through servers in different countries. Perpetrators exploit internet anonymity to carry out cyber crimes, such as the Rustock botnet which sent massive amounts of spam. Microsoft, along with law enforcement agencies, dismantled the command-and-control structure of the botnet. Another case involved a Russian national known as \"AKILL\" who led the Mega-D botnet capable of sending 10 billion e-mails daily. AKILL was the ringleader of the Mega-D botnet, sending 10 billion e-mails daily by falsifying e-mail header information. Botnet leaders use traffic laundering to enhance anonymity, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace malicious activity. Internet technology facilitates both cybercrimes and traditional crimes, according to Europol's 2011 Organized Crime Threat Assessment. The Internet is now used for various criminal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal immigration, counterfeit goods, and money laundering. Criminals are constantly evolving their techniques while law enforcement is reacting to their activities, such as the movement of illegal drug profits across the U.S.-Mexico border. Criminals are using stored-value cards to move illegal profits from the United States to Mexico, bypassing the $10,000 reporting requirement for cash crossing the border. Current federal regulations do not consider stored-value cards as monetary instruments under the Bank Secrecy Act. Transporting currency or monetary instruments exceeding $10,000 from the United States is subject to regulations. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued a final rule defining \"stored value\" as \"prepaid access\" and implementing regulations for prepaid access products and services. It does not directly address whether stored value or prepaid access cards are subject to regulations on international transportation of monetary instruments. A proposed rule would amend the definition of \"monetary instrument\" under the Bank Secrecy Act. The proposed rule would amend the definition of \"monetary instrument\" to include prepaid access devices for BSA international monetary transport regulations. Challenges remain in detecting legitimate stored value on cards, travelers remembering amounts, and law enforcement freezing illegitimate assets. Traffickers also use digital currency accounts and e-businesses for money laundering. In the digital age, criminals use various methods like online gaming, mobile banking, and encrypted communication to evade law enforcement. Law enforcement struggles to keep up with evolving technology, especially in decrypting data for investigations. The FBI faces challenges in accessing encrypted data for investigations due to a gap between their investigative authority and technological capabilities. This has led to a situation where large amounts of data are collected but not analyzed, hindering law enforcement efforts. The \"Going Dark\" initiative has been created to address this issue. The National Electronic Surveillance Strategy focuses on law enforcement's struggle to keep up with criminals' use of technology. Criminals have a cost advantage in leveraging technology, while law enforcement faces higher costs in investigating these crimes. Criminals also face challenges in establishing and defending their operational turf, leading to increased exposure. Criminals generally avoid publicizing their activities, distinguishing them from terrorists. Criminals operate illicit activities for profit, maintaining anonymity to avoid detection. They have cross-border connections and partnerships with various gangs for drug distribution. Law enforcement lacks partnerships in all areas, allowing criminals to evade prosecution in jurisdictions with weaker police cooperation. Researchers in Camden, NJ, found that street corners with multiple gangs involved in drug distribution have significantly higher crime rates. This aligns with the pattern of violence in areas where territory disputes occur, such as the drug-related violence in Mexico caused by clashes between drug trafficking organizations over territory and smuggling routes. The drug-related violence in Mexico, driven by clashes between drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) over territory and smuggling routes, has resulted in over 34,500 deaths since 2006. This violence targets rival DTOs and affiliated gang members, drawing increased attention and resources from both Mexican and U.S. governments. Turf disputes can hinder criminals' profits by limiting their activities to specific areas, as gangs fiercely defend their operating spaces. Criminal gangs have evolved from turf-oriented entities to profit-driven, organized criminal enterprises, expanding their activities beyond their turf boundaries. The cyber world may provide new platforms for criminals to operate on, with the increasing number of Windows-alternative operating systems. The increasing number of Windows-alternative operating systems may lead to diversification in malicious code used by criminals, creating various platforms for cyber turf. This could result in turf wars between cyber gangs. Law enforcement operations are also influenced by turf, with different agencies investigating crimes like identity theft. Multiple agencies like the Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and ICE are investigating identity theft, leading to potential investigative overlaps and data challenges. Lack of coordination among agencies can result in confusion, wasted resources, and risks to law enforcement personnel. Jurisdictional battles between federal law enforcement agencies have hindered efficient information sharing, as seen in ATF's Project Gunrunner aimed at reducing illegal weapon flow into Mexico through intelligence sharing. Project Gunrunner is an intelligence information sharing initiative between various law enforcement partners to disrupt the illegal flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico. Despite a Memorandum of Understanding between ATF and ICE to enhance information sharing, criticism arose due to a lack of coordination and intelligence exchange with Mexican and some U.S. partner agencies like DEA and ICE. This issue was highlighted in a report by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General in November 2010. The criticized lack of coordination in Project Gunrunner may have stemmed from jurisdictional conflicts or inefficient project planning. This highlights the challenges of sharing investigative information across agencies. The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) was created by the FBI in 2008 to coordinate information from 18 intelligence and law enforcement agencies for domestic cyber threat investigations. However, a 2011 DOJ OIG report found that the NCIJTF was not always sharing information effectively among its partner agencies. The report highlighted issues with sharing information effectively among agencies, leading to disagreements and impacting investigations. Members shared information on a need-to-know basis, with some agencies being asked to leave NCIJTF threat focus cell meetings. Disagreements over roles and responsibilities within DOJ agencies were reported by over one-third of agents, affecting investigations. The GAO study found that 28% of agents reported disagreements due to a lack of information sharing among agencies conducting similar investigations. Multiple agencies sharing jurisdiction can lead to unclear roles and turf battles, hindering investigations. However, not all overlaps result in disputes, and agencies can benefit from cooperation and information sharing to enhance law enforcement efforts. The lack of comprehensive data hampers agencies' abilities to measure the true scope of crimes, share information, and coordinate investigations. Various federal agencies investigate bulk cash smuggling separately, with distinct databases that do not automatically share information. Increased information sharing among federal agencies, as well as between federal, state, and local law enforcement, is recommended to aid investigations. Multiple agencies also gather information on cybercrime and specific subsets. The FBI, National White Collar Crime Center, Federal Trade Commission, ICE, and USPIS maintain databases on cybercrime, including identity theft. The multitude of agencies and databases pose challenges for law enforcement in combating identity theft effectively. Coordination barriers exist due to information residing in multiple databases, hindering comprehensive efforts. The inefficient \"stove-piping\" of relevant data and intelligence due to identity theft information residing in multiple databases across various agencies hinders comprehensive efforts in combating cybercrime. Inter-agency coordination and sharing issues further complicate the situation, even when centralized databases and information sharing mechanisms are available. The 2004 and 2008 MOUs between DOJ, FBI, and ATF had ambiguous language and did not clarify investigative jurisdiction in explosives investigations. Despite instructions to coordinate and consolidate databases, FBI and ATF continue to dispute lead agency roles. This lack of coordination extends to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Such discrepancies may exist between federal and state or local law enforcement, as well as between federal law enforcement and foreign counterparts. EPIC, a multi-agency tactical intelligence center, facilitates the sharing of information on drug, alien, and weapon smuggling through various databases. However, a lack of up-to-date agreements between EPIC and member agencies has led to coordination issues and a lack of information sharing among agencies. The National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) has been criticized for not creating a gang information database as directed by Congress. It is perceived as primarily an FBI organization and lacks the capability to effectively share gang intelligence with other law enforcement agencies. Coordination flaws may be due to jurisdictional struggles or a lack of information-sharing mechanisms. Congress may wish to explore existing MOUs and inter-agency agreements on information sharing, their formulation, and oversight. Modern-day criminals exploit borders, turf, and cyberspace, prompting law enforcement to enhance collaboration, information sharing, and technology use. Federal law enforcement relies on interagency cooperation and technology to combat 21st-century crime, especially cybercrimes. Crimes, especially cybercrimes, are increasingly transnational, requiring law enforcement to be more networked and nimble. Criminal organizations are becoming less hierarchical, posing challenges for hierarchical law enforcement agencies. Experts suggest that adopting networked practices can better equip law enforcement to combat 21st-century criminals. Federal law enforcement has established interagency coordination to combat 21st-century criminals, including cybercriminals. The FBI has embedded agents with international partners in countries like Romania, Estonia, Ukraine, and the Netherlands to investigate and prosecute transnational criminals. Five hackers indicted for hacking RBS WorldPay network, withdrawing over $9 million in under 12 hours using counterfeit payroll debit cards from ATMs in multiple countries. Estonia extradited one leader of the hacking ring to the United States for wire fraud charges. In a separate case, U.S., Colombian, and Italian authorities collaborated to investigate \"La Oficina de Envigado,\" a Colombian drug trafficking and money laundering network linked to the Medell\u00edn Cartel. The organization, based in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, but operating globally, had 48 seized bank accounts in the U.S. During \"Operation Fire and Ice,\" over $200 million in cash, 1,100 kilograms of cocaine, and 46 kilograms of heroin were confiscated worldwide. Federal law enforcement agencies cooperate internationally to combat transnational crimes. The United States collaborates with other countries through various agreements to combat transnational crimes, including traditional and cybercrimes. The United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime is a key tool for this, requiring signatories to criminalize offenses like participation in organized crime and money laundering. The United States collaborates with other countries through agreements to combat transnational crimes, including participation in organized crime, money laundering, corruption, and obstruction of justice. Ratifying the convention in 2005, Congress worked with foreign governments and law enforcement agencies to combat multi-national organized crime. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime, developed in 2001, aims to protect society against cybercrime through international cooperation and appropriate legislation. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime, signed by 47 countries including the United States, requires signatories to define and prosecute computer-related crimes such as hacking, fraud, child pornography, and copyright infringements. Domestic laws must establish procedures for detecting, investigating, and collecting electronic evidence of these offenses. The G8 Subgroup on High Tech Crime, established in 1996, focuses on combating transnational organized crime through international cooperation. It has developed Forty Recommendations and created various subgroups, including one for high tech crime, which has produced best practices documents for securing computer networks and tracing networked communications across borders. The G8 Subgroup on High Tech Crime focuses on combating transnational organized crime through international cooperation. It has developed recommendations and subgroups, including one for high tech crime, which assesses threats from new technology and sponsors training conferences for cybercrime agencies. Federal law enforcement agencies use interagency agreements and MOUs to coordinate work, such as the one signed by ATF and ICE in 2009. Despite this MOU, the DOJ OIG found that ATF and ICE do not effectively work together on investigations. The DOJ OIG found that despite the MOU signed in 2009, ATF and ICE do not effectively collaborate on investigations of firearms trafficking to Mexico. This lack of coordination is attributed to a lack of awareness of the MOU's existence and its purpose. ICE also has an interagency cooperation agreement with the DEA for sharing information and cross-designating agents. The agreement between ICE and DEA allows ICE agents to investigate narcotics smuggling with a nexus to the U.S. border. MOUs were signed to enhance information sharing at fusion centers and task forces. It is unclear if these agreements have reduced turf battles in overlapping jurisdictions. Fusion centers and task forces play complementary roles in intelligence-led law enforcement operations. Fusion centers and law enforcement task forces, such as Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), have distinct but complementary roles. Fusion centers combine resources and information from various government agencies to detect and prevent criminal or terrorist activity. They serve as focal points for sharing threat-related information among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners. Fusion centers produce actionable intelligence for dissemination to aid law enforcement organizations like JTTFs in their investigative operations. Law enforcement task forces are generally operational in nature. Fusion centers and law enforcement task forces, like Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), work together to detect and prevent criminal or terrorist activity. Fusion centers, located nationwide, share threat-related information among various government agencies. One precursor to fusion centers is the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, established in 1988 to combat drug trafficking in heavily impacted regions. Each HIDTA is governed by a board of federal, state, and local agencies with the goal of assessing regional drug threats. The HIDTA program, established in 1988, assesses regional drug threats and combats drug trafficking in heavily impacted regions. The program designates areas as HIDTAs, currently 28 in the US and its territories, with the Southwest Border Region HIDTA targeting drug-trafficking operations along the border through intelligence sharing and task force coordination. Several law enforcement fusion centers, including the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Fusion Center (OFC), target criminal networks by consolidating and disseminating intelligence on organized crime matters. In one case from June 2011, the Milwaukee, WI, HIDTA was involved in indicting 24 individuals in a drug trafficking and illegal gambling ring, transporting marijuana from Seattle, WA, and Vancouver, BC, to Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, and moving $1.3 million in proceeds back to the Pacific Northwest. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Fusion Center (OFC) gathers information for the OCDETF Program, targeting drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. The IOC-2, created in 2009, resolves information conflicts on various organized crime cases. Despite successes, not all fusion centers are funded, with the IOC-2 lacking funding. Congress may consider the importance of funding intelligence-sharing centers for federal law enforcement. Congress may debate increasing resources for existing intelligence-sharing centers to enhance law enforcement operations. This includes balancing investigative resources with prosecutorial resources and enforcing oversight over fusion centers. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General reviewed EPIC in June 2010, suggesting improvements in coordinating with intelligence organizations, maintaining current information, and creating performance measures. Policy makers may debate funding for fusion centers based on their effectiveness in achieving goals like analyzing information and pursuing CPOT targets. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program targets major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations with the intent to disrupt and dismantle them. Federal agencies participating in the program collaborate with state and local law enforcement to target organizations on the Consolidated Priority Organization Targets (CPOT) List. The OCDETF program targets drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, filing cases with U.S. Attorneys Offices. Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BESTs) operate along the northern and southern borders to disrupt criminal organizations. ICE leads multi-agency task forces with CBP, DEA, ATF, FBI, USCG, and others, partnering with Mexican and Canadian law enforcement agencies. The Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BESTs) operate along the northern and southern borders to disrupt criminal organizations. Currently, there are 21 BESTs with locations around the United States and in Mexico, focusing on prevalent threats in their respective areas. President Obama established a Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to address concerns about financial fraud as the nation emerges from economic downturn. President Obama established a Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force in November 2009, chaired by the Attorney General and involving over 20 federal agencies, U.S. Attorneys Offices, and state and local partners. The task force targets various financial crimes, including mortgage fraud, identity theft, credit card fraud, and Ponzi schemes. One case involved a husband and wife team defrauding over 250 individuals of $1.5 million through an Internet fraud scheme. Another task force focused on cyber threats is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), led by the FBI. The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), led by the FBI, collaborates with 18 agencies to counter cyber threats like national security intrusions, online child pornography, and Internet fraud. The FBI's Botnet Focus Cell played a key role in dismantling the Mariposa botnet, which stole sensitive information from millions of computers worldwide. The FBI worked with Spanish and Slovenian police to arrest the botnet's users and creator. The FBI, along with Spanish and Slovenian police, arrested users and the creator of the botnet. Turf battles between agencies can hinder investigations, with disagreements over leadership and information sharing. Congress may debate the level of information sharing within task forces and inter-agency forums. The 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act mandated the creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing terrorism information among federal, state, local, tribal entities, and the private sector. Congress has not mandated a similar environment for traditional crime investigations. The creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) was mandated by the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act for sharing terrorism information. However, there is no similar mandate for traditional crime investigations. Various databases exist for sharing information on traditional criminal investigations, including the FBI's Law Enforcement Online and National Crime Information Center, ATF's Arson & Explosives National Repository, and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Deconfliction. The Justice Statistics and Research Association identified 266 information sharing systems across 35 states and Canada for sharing crime information at different levels. Systems share crime information at national, regional, state, and county levels. 10% of systems share national-level data. Recommendations for system improvements include involving more agencies. The National Identity Crimes Law Enforcement (NICLE) coordinates information on identity theft. NICLE, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, consolidates data from local, state, and federal agencies. Nearly 100 law enforcement agencies access NICLE data through RISSNET. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended a national database for law enforcement. The Theft Task Force recommended a national database for law enforcement to consolidate information on identity theft. Law enforcement partners with private entities like InfraGard, a FBI partnership, to gather and share information on cybercrimes and other threats. InfraGard has over 35,000 members in 85 U.S. cities and focuses on sharing information on various crimes, including those involving critical infrastructure. Another similar partnership is the Domestic Security Alliance Council (DSAC). The Domestic Security Alliance Council (DSAC) is a security and intelligence-sharing initiative between the FBI, DHS, and the private sector, focusing on crimes impacting interstate commerce such as computer intrusions, fraud, and workplace violence. DSAC had nearly 200 U.S. private sector companies and organizations as of March 2011. Another partnership, the Law Enforcement Retail Partnership Network (LERPnet), was established to combat organized retail crime through information sharing between retailers and law enforcement. LERPnet is a partnership between the FBI, ICE, local police departments, retailers, and retail organizations like FMI, NRF, and RILA. It provides a direct link to retail industry crime reports for law enforcement. Criminals constantly evolve their methods to evade detection, utilizing advanced technology. Law enforcement uses various methods to investigate, including human intelligence. Mexican drug traffickers have used subterranean tunnels to smuggle drugs into the US, prompting the use of tunnel detection technologies. The United States employs tunnel detection technologies like ground penetrating radar (GPR) to locate tunnels used by Mexican drug traffickers to smuggle drugs. However, current technology is limited by factors like soil condition and tunnel characteristics. Law enforcement also uses sonic and seismic equipment, but sophisticated tunnels are often detected through human intelligence rather than technology. The CIA, Department of State, DoD, and FBI rely on HUMINT for intelligence gathering, as it can provide information that is hard to obtain through technical means. Law enforcement, including the FBI, values human intelligence and confidential sources, with over 15,000 maintained by the FBI. In cyber investigations, federal agencies heavily rely on confidential sources, with an estimated 25% of hackers in the US recruited by authorities. The FBI and USSS have successfully infiltrated the underground world of hackers with the help of informants like Adrian Lamo, who assisted in catching Bradley Manning for leaking classified information to Wikileaks in 2010. Despite challenges like outdated laws and lack of resources, human intelligence remains crucial in cyber investigations. The FBI's \"Going Dark\" initiative addresses the challenge of technology hindering electronic surveillance. Congress debates enabling law enforcement to leverage their authorities while protecting privacy. Privacy advocates are concerned about potential privacy violations. Policy makers face challenges in balancing the use of encryption-breaking technologies and enhancing law enforcement training and resources to combat cybercrimes without infringing on natural rights. The interplay between borders, criminal turf, cyberspace, and law enforcement jurisdiction complicates efforts to counter crime effectively. In response to the challenges of combating cybercrimes and balancing natural rights, Congress may debate legislative options to empower law enforcement in countering 21st century criminals. This includes considering the need for existing authorities, technology, resources, and potential expansion of federal law enforcement's statutory authorities. Policymakers may also discuss directing resources towards enhancing federal law enforcement agents' skills to address modern threats. Congress may debate directing resources to enhance federal law enforcement agents' skills in countering modern threats, including financial fraud and cybercrimes. This may involve providing support to state and local law enforcement agencies and ensuring effective coordination of investigations and information sharing. Intelligence-led policing has become increasingly important since 9/11. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, law enforcement has increasingly relied on intelligence-led policing, interagency cooperation, and technology to combat modern crime. However, challenges remain in implementing effective information sharing systems and utilizing up-to-date technology. Policy makers should consider the level of interagency information sharing and whether law enforcement is meeting this goal. Congress should also assess the formulation, implementation, and oversight of existing inter-agency agreements."
