    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Muhammad Ali Commemorative Coin Act\". Muhammad Ali, a celebrated athlete and advocate, was a philanthropist, champion of peace, and icon of freedom of conscience. He used his fame to support humanitarian causes and was a role model for people of all races, ethnicities, and religions in the United States. Muhammad Ali inspired audiences worldwide, including world leaders and religious figures, with his vibrant character and dedication despite physical ailments. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury shall mint and issue commemorative coins in honor of Muhammad Ali, including $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items under the law. According to title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this Act are considered numismatic items. The design of coins minted under this Act shall reflect Muhammad Ali's life and legacy, with specific inscriptions and values. The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Muhammad Ali Center and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single United States Mint facility. The Secretary is authorized to issue these coins only during a one-year period starting on January 1, 2020. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act will include a surcharge of $35 per coin for the $5 coin and $10 per coin for the $1 coin. The surcharges received will be distributed with 80% going to the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, and 10% to the Muhammad Ali Institute for Peace and Justice at the University of Louisville. The surcharges from the sales of coins will support peacebuilding, social justice, and violence prevention programs. Ten percent of the surcharges will go to the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center for Parkinson's disease research and education. The Comptroller General of the United States has the right to audit the organizations receiving the surcharges. No surcharge can be included for issuing coins if the issuance has already occurred in a calendar year. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to avoid exceeding the annual issuance limitation."
