    "content": "The report provides background information on the Coast Guard's Deepwater acquisition programs and the proposed FY2012 budget. Congress's decisions on these programs could impact Coast Guard capabilities and funding. The Coast Guard conducts various missions in deepwater environments, including search and rescue and drug interdiction. The Coast Guard conducts various missions in deepwater environments, including search and rescue, drug interdiction, alien migrant interdiction, fisheries enforcement, marine pollution law enforcement, and enforcement of lightering zones. The Deepwater acquisition effort was initiated in the late 1990s to replace aging cutters, patrol boats, and aircraft. The Coast Guard's Deepwater acquisition effort aimed to replace aging cutters, patrol boats, and aircraft with new and modernized assets in a single, integrated system-of-systems acquisition program. This approach was chosen to address the high operating costs, maintenance challenges, and technological obsolescence of the current fleet. The Coast Guard's Deepwater acquisition program aimed to replace aging assets with a single, integrated system-of-systems approach. A private-sector lead system integrator was used to optimize the acquisition process and meet operational requirements at the lowest cost. The Coast Guard pursued the Deepwater program as a performance-based acquisition, awarding the role to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS) led by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in 2002. An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract was awarded for the program. The Coast Guard awarded ICGS a 43-month additional term in May 2006, extending the contract to January 2011. In 2007, the Coast Guard implemented reforms in response to criticism of the Deepwater program, shifting from a single system-of-systems approach to individual acquisitions. The Coast Guard shifted from a single system-of-systems approach to pursuing Deepwater acquisition as individual programs, with the Coast Guard taking the lead role as systems integrator for each program. The focus is now on optimizing acquisition programs for the Coast Guard as a whole, rather than just the Deepwater subset. The Coast Guard is phasing out reliance on ICGS as a private-sector LSI for Deepwater acquisition and is increasing its in-house system-integration capabilities. They are shifting from performance-based acquisition to defined-based acquisition with more detailed specifications for Deepwater assets. This new approach does not involve minutely detailed specifications like the MilSpec system used in DOD acquisition programs. The Coast Guard is transitioning from performance-based acquisition to defined-based acquisition, eliminating the use of \"Deepwater\" as a collective term for acquisition programs. This change aims to enhance acquisition management and accountability by aligning appropriations with project management and specific asset acquisition projects. The Coast Guard is realigning acquisition projects to match the authorized appropriation structure, following the dissolution of Integrated CG Systems and the disaggregation of the Deepwater Acquisition. This change aims to improve acquisition management and oversight by aligning projects with specific asset acquisition categories. The total acquisition cost of Deepwater assets was estimated at $24.23 billion in then-year dollars, with funding scheduled to be completed by FY2025. The funding for Deepwater assets was scheduled to be completed by FY2025, with the buildout expected to be finished by 2027. The Coast Guard's Request for Proposals included options for building up to 34 FRC-Bs, potentially reducing the number of FRC-As to 24. If the FRC-Bs meet requirements, all 58 FRCs might be built to the FRC-B design. Changes in quantities were approved by DHS in May 2007, including 20 patrol boats upgraded with a MEP, a figure to be determined for UAS, and no modernized Island class patrol boats. The management and execution of the Deepwater program was strongly criticized in 2007 by various entities, including the DHS Inspector General, Government Accountability Office, and Members of Congress. Criticism focused on overall program management and issues with cutter acquisition efforts. In 2007, the Coast Guard reformed its approach to Deepwater acquisition by transitioning from a single integrated program to separate acquisition programs. Deliveries and milestones included commissioning NSCs Bertholf and Waesche in 2008 and 2010, with the third Stratton delivered in 2011. Fabrication of the fourth NSC, Hamilton, began in 2011. The Coast Guard awarded a contract for the construction of the fifth NSC in 2011. The draft specification for the OPC was released in May 2011. The first FRC was launched in April 2011, with builder's trials completed in November 2011. The HC-144A achieved Initial Operational Capability in April 2009, with the 12th HC-144A delivered in July 2011. The Coast Guard received its first MH-65C Multi-Mission Cutter Helicopter on April 22, 2009. The 12th HC-144A was delivered on July 29, 2011, and the remaining three were under contract as of December 19, 2011. The first missionized HC-130J LRS aircraft was accepted on February 29, 2008, with the sixth and final missionized aircraft accepted on May 18, 2010. New surface search radars were installed on all HC-130H aircraft by May 31, 2011. The first production MH-60T Jayhawk Medium Range Recovery Helicopter was delivered on June 3, 2009, achieving Initial Operational Capability on October 1, 2009. Upgrades were made to 24 of 42 MH-60Ts with new avionics suites and Airborne Use of Force equipment kits by January 20, 2012. The Coast Guard received its first MH-65C Multi-Mission Cutter Helicopter in October 2007 and has configured 91 MH-65Cs and delivered 23 MH-65Ds as of December 2011. Congressional oversight has focused on these acquisition programs, with GAO providing reports and recommendations for Coast Guard management. The Coast Guard has made significant changes to its acquisition enterprise to increase efficiency and efficacy of programs. The Acquisition Directorate now leads systems integration for all major and non-major acquisition projects. The Acquisition Directorate of the Coast Guard, established four years ago, has made progress in implementing effective processes and improving project management capabilities. They are committed to sound management and oversight of the acquisition process, leveraging expertise from within and outside the organization. Acquisition reform measures in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 provide the necessary tools and authorities to enhance acquisition efforts. The Coast Guard is focused on enhancing acquisition programs and ensuring compliance with the Act's requirements. They are adapting to meet national needs, including saving lives, enforcing laws, and protecting the environment. Recapitalization of assets is crucial for current and future missions. The Subcommittee's efforts have been instrumental in these endeavors. The Acquisition Directorate, with support from mission partners, is improving logistics and maintenance support for assets in the field. Organizational changes and updates to acquisition processes have been made with input from the Department of Homeland Security and the Subcommittee to enhance cost management, schedules, and contractor performance. The Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate, now the Systems Integrator, is responsible for all phases of asset lifecycle management. Collaboration with technical authorities and project sponsors ensures adherence to standards and requirements. The Asset Project Office facilitates smooth transition from acquisition to sustainment for new surface assets. The Acquisition Directorate ensures smooth transition from acquisition to sustainment for new surface assets by integrating life cycle support early in the process and aligning with acquisition management policies. The Major Systems Acquisition Manual (MSAM) provides guidelines for project managers to execute major systems acquisition projects in alignment with Coast Guard and DHS policies. The Coast Guard has made progress in ensuring acquisition projects comply with MSAM policies and released a strategic plan for continuous improvement. The acquisition organization has been supported by the Subcommittee, DHS, and the Government Accountability Office for effective oversight. The Coast Guard has improved transparency and oversight in its acquisition program with support from the Subcommittee, DHS, and the Government Accountability Office. Reforms enacted in 2010 have been implemented, guided by DHS's Acquisition Lifecycle Framework, ensuring a disciplined approach and governance through Acquisition Review Boards. The Coast Guard's acquisition programs are overseen according to consistent criteria, ensuring sound conceptualization and management. The Department's Office of the Chief Procurement Officer and Acquisition Program Management Division provide support and guidance, contributing to the Coast Guard's maturation as a cost-conscious organization. Strong relationships have been forged with technical authorities in mission support areas like Human Resources, Engineering, Logistics, and C4IT. The Coast Guard has established collaborative partnerships with technical authorities in Human Resources, Engineering, Logistics, and Information Technology (C4IT) for acquisition programs. They leverage expertise from the U.S. Navy in acquisition processes and testing, while seeking independent validation from third-party experts for asset and system certification. This approach enhances decision-making for designs and operational capabilities. The Coast Guard's acquisition workforce has achieved significant accomplishments in the past year, attributed to their quality and dedication. The Acquisition Directorate has achieved significant accomplishments in workforce quality and professional development over the past year. Project managers have attained DHS Level III program manager certification, enhancing leadership continuity. The expedited hiring authority provided in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 was vital for filling critical civilian positions. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 was crucial for filling civilian positions with acquisition experience. The Acquisition Directorate focuses on mission execution and readiness, with support from DHS, the Administration, and Congress. Processes are in place for successful program management and oversight. The Coast Guard has strengthened its acquisition management capabilities and updated its Major Systems Acquisition Manual to align with best practices and DHS policies. They have 81 interagency agreements in place to leverage DOD expertise for successful program management and oversight. The Coast Guard has improved its acquisition management capabilities by increasing the involvement of the Executive Oversight Council and reducing its relationship with ICGS. They have awarded fixed-price contracts directly to prime contractors for projects like the fourth NSC. The Coast Guard awarded fixed-price contracts for the fourth NSC and long lead materials for the fifth NSC to Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Systems, exercised options for additional FRCs with Bollinger Shipyards, and awarded a contract to EADS for MPAs. They are implementing acquisition strategies to introduce competition in future procurements, such as purchasing a data licensing package from Bollinger Shipyards to enable open competition for future FRCs. The Coast Guard plans to award multiple preliminary design contracts for the OPC, with the option for a data and licensing package. They released a draft of the OPC specifications for industry review and are holding a competition for the over-the-horizon cutter small boat. The Coast Guard is gaining a better understanding of each asset's cost, schedule, and technical risks. The Coast Guard maintains two quarterly reports to track information on major acquisitions, including cost, schedule, and technical risks. One report is internal for program managers, while the other, the Quarterly Acquisition Report to Congress (QARC), ranks risks for each project. The statutory requirement for the QARC is no longer in effect, but it is still submitted to Congress based on committee and conference reports. The Coast Guard's QARC submission is based on committee and conference reports, with an expectation to submit by the 15th day of the fiscal quarter. However, in fiscal year 2010, over 50% of medium and high risks identified in internal Quarterly Project Reports were not included in the QARC. This discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy and completeness of risk reporting to Congress. The Coast Guard's QARC submission to Congress in fiscal year 2010 did not include several identified risks, such as concerns about affordability and spare parts for the MPA project. Risks are not included if they contradict the Coast Guard's budget request, raising concerns about the accuracy of risk reporting. The Coast Guard's QARC submission to Congress in fiscal year 2010 did not include identified risks for spare parts. DHS officials do not remove medium and high risks from the report. The Office of Management and Budget does not direct the Coast Guard to remove risks before transmission. QARC submissions for all four quarters of fiscal year 2010 were consistently late. As of May 2011, the first quarter fiscal year 2011 report to Congress was delayed by at least 4 months. The report highlighted the need for the Coast Guard to include top risks in the Quarterly Acquisition Report to Congress for major acquisition projects, including spare parts, to provide timely and complete information. It also recommended submitting the report by the 15th day of each fiscal quarter. The report recommended that Congress enact a permanent provision for the Coast Guard to submit quarterly reports on major acquisition projects within 15 days of each fiscal quarter, ranking the top five risks for each project. Congress should also consider restricting funding availability after the 15th day of any quarter until the report is submitted. The Coast Guard testified in April 2011 about estimated costs for various acquisition programs. The Coast Guard's Capital Investment Plan (CIP) estimates funding levels for acquisition projects from FY 2012 to FY 2016, including Total Acquisition Costs and completion dates based on project-specific Acquisition Program Baselines. Funding levels in the CIP are subject to change based on fiscal guidance and congressional actions. The Coast Guard's funding levels in the Capital Investment Plan are subject to change based on fiscal guidance, congressional actions, and direction from DHS leadership. The Coast Guard must carefully manage resources to prioritize funding for its aging assets and infrastructure. The Executive Oversight Council provides guidance to ensure resources are allocated towards the Service's highest priority needs. Admiral Robert Papp acknowledged challenges in acquiring Deepwater assets within budgeted costs. Admiral Robert Papp acknowledged challenges in acquiring Deepwater assets within budgeted costs, citing factors like economic fluctuations and funding delays. The July 2011 GAO report highlighted that the Deepwater Program exceeds cost and schedule baselines approved by DHS, with uncertainties in true costs and schedules. The Coast Guard aims to bring costs within the original advertised budget by managing resources effectively. The Coast Guard's Deepwater Program faces cost growth challenges, with estimated total acquisition costs potentially reaching $29.3 billion, exceeding the $24.2 billion baseline. Revised baselines for assets like the Offshore Patrol Cutter are still pending, leading to further cost and schedule changes. The reliability of cost estimates is questioned due to the lack of best practices followed. Annual funding needed exceeds current and expected levels, as per Coast Guard and DHS officials. The Coast Guard's Deepwater Program is facing challenges with cost growth, as the estimated total acquisition cost could reach $29.3 billion, exceeding the approved baseline of $24.2 billion. The program's funding needs surpass current levels, leading to program baselines being disrupted when schedules cannot be met. The Coast Guard has developed action items to address the funding mismatch, but these have not been fully implemented. The Deepwater Program is experiencing cost growth issues, with acquisition costs potentially reaching $29.3 billion, exceeding the approved baseline of $24.2 billion. The Coast Guard and DHS are working to understand the drivers of cost growth for individual assets, such as the NSC, MPA, and FRC. Revised baselines reflect actual contract costs and additional expenses not included in the original baseline. The C4ISR program's revised baseline was approved by DHS in 2011, two years after submission by the Coast Guard. The revised baseline for the Deepwater Program, approved in 2011, includes over $1 billion in additional acquisition costs to address post-September 11 requirements and the need for a common core system design beyond the original end date of fiscal year 2014. Cost growth is expected due to the lack of revised baselines for all assets, including the OPC and UAS projects. The uncertainty surrounding the OPC's cost estimate is a significant challenge in determining the overall program cost. The Coast Guard's fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan cites a planned $640 million in fiscal year 2015 for the lead cutter, which is a point estimate including design work and project management. The approved acquisition program baselines fall short of funding needs, leading to uncertainty in the total cost of the Deepwater acquisition. The NSC program's approved baseline reflects a total acquisition cost of approximately $4.7 billion, with Congress already appropriating $3.1 billion for the program. The Coast Guard's fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan indicates a total of $5.6 billion is needed to complete the acquisition of eight NSCs, representing a 19% increase over the approved acquisition cost estimate. The Commandant must report to Congress if there is a likely cost overrun exceeding 15%, with a certification required for overruns greater than 20%. Senior Coast Guard acquisition officials cannot confirm the total cost of $5.6 billion for the NSC program. Acquisition officials cannot confirm the total cost of $5.6 billion for the NSC program or a 19% cost increase due to a lack of completed life-cycle cost analysis. Schedule delays have been reported for assets, with revised baselines showing improved insight into final delivery dates. The MPA program faces a 4-year delay in final asset delivery according to the capital investment plan. The Coast Guard's capital investment plan indicates a 5-year delay in final asset delivery from the 2007 baseline. Officials acknowledge that most revised baselines do not reflect current delivery dates. Funding needed for Deepwater acquisition programs exceeds current levels, with up to $1.9 billion per year required to support approved baselines. The Coast Guard's capital investment plan shows a 5-year delay in asset delivery from the 2007 baseline. Funding for Deepwater acquisition programs exceeds current levels, with up to $1.9 billion per year required. The Coast Guard expects funding levels to be around $1.2 billion annually, creating potential funding competition and inefficiencies. The Coast Guard reported potential baseline breaches to DHS for the C4ISR, HC-130H, and HH-60 programs due to reduced funding profiles in the fiscal years 2011-2015 capital investment plan. In the fiscal year 2011 budget request, the Coast Guard only allocated about 9 percent of the $1.1 billion to aviation projects, leading to an increase in dollars allocated to surface projects. The need to develop and implement effective measures was identified in the October 2010 Blueprint for Continuous Improvement. The Guard's Assistant Commandant for Acquisition identified the need to develop effective decision-making processes to maximize results and manage risk within resource constraints. The Blueprint outlines action items to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2011, including promoting stability in the Coast Guard's capital investment plan, ensuring alignment with acquisition program baselines, and establishing project priorities. Successful implementation requires buy-in from leadership. Senior resource directorate officials responsible for capital investment planning noted that while the Blueprint's action items are considered noble endeavors, directorates outside of the acquisition directorate are not held accountable for their completion. The Component Acquisition Executive is responsible for establishing acquisition processes to ensure project managers receive necessary resources and support. The Coast Guard's Executive Oversight Council tasked a team to recommend strategies for aligning acquisition program baselines with priorities. The Coast Guard is planning for funding levels above expected levels, which may not be realistic given fiscal pressures. In fiscal year 2015, they plan to request funding for construction of three major Deepwater surface assets, a first for the agency. The Commandant of the Coast Guard stated that the fiscal year 2015 funding plan reflects the actual needs of the Coast Guard. If programs are tied to this plan and it is not executable, there may be schedule and cost breaches. Recommendations were made to address budgeting churn and ensure projects receive predictable funding. The Coast Guard must adhere to best practices for cost estimates and contractor schedules, updating acquisition program baselines with input from all directorates. A fleet mix analysis was planned to enhance mission performance and establish a baseline for the Deepwater acquisition. The Coast Guard conducted a fleet mix analysis to determine future capability requirements and fleet composition. The analysis, completed in December 2009, aimed to identify an \"objective fleet mix\" that would meet long-term strategic goals. The results were received in December 2010, but as of May 2011, phase 1 had not been released to Congress. The analysis involved assessing asset capabilities and mission demands in an unconstrained fiscal environment to double the quantity of assets in the fleet. The Coast Guard conducted a fleet mix analysis to determine future capability requirements and fleet composition. The objective fleet mix aimed to double the assets in the program of record, costing potentially $65 billion, much higher than the approved $24.2 billion baseline. The analysis provided insight on larger fleets but was not cost-constrained. The Coast Guard conducted a fleet mix analysis to determine future capability requirements and fleet composition. Officials stated that the results were not feasible due to cost and do not plan to use it for fleet mix decisions. Phase 1 supports continuing the program of record, but a cost-constrained analysis, fleet mix analysis phase 2, is being undertaken. The Coast Guard is conducting a phase 2 analysis to assess the acquisition of the Deepwater program within cost constraints. This analysis will not consider options lower than the current program of record, limiting the ability to make necessary trade-offs in the current fiscal climate. The Coast Guard is conducting a phase 2 analysis for the Deepwater program within cost constraints. There is confusion about the methodology used for establishing funding constraints, with different offices providing varying bounds. The Program Analysis & Evaluation office suggested using historical funding levels of $1.2 billion, but there was a lack of clarity on how this number was used in the study. The acquisition directorate agreed on using $1.2 billion as the lower constraint and verbally suggested $1.7 billion as the upper bound for the Deepwater program. However, $1.7 billion exceeds historical funding levels for the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio. The Coast Guard views the upper bound as an absolute limit, not necessarily realistic. Cost constraints were verbally communicated to the contractor without documentation. The DHS's Program Analysis & Evaluation office is studying alternatives to the Deepwater surface program at the request of the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget recommended that DHS conduct a study on alternatives to the Deepwater surface program. The study will evaluate performance trade-offs between different cutter options and is expected to be completed in the summer of 2011. The analysis will focus on cost constraints and align with the Department's investment priorities. The Office of Management and Budget recommended a study on alternatives to the Deepwater surface program. The study will inform decisions about the fiscal year 2013 budget and potential changes to the program of record. It is suggested that a working group be developed to provide Congress with necessary information for budget decisions and asset requirements. The working group, including DHS and Coast Guard, is reviewing studies to identify cost-effective program options within budget parameters. The Coast Guard's 418-foot Legend-class National Security Cutter is crucial for homeland security and law enforcement missions, replacing aging cutters. The group's findings will be reported to Congress before the fiscal year 2013 budget submission. The BERTHOLF (NSC #1) achieved \"Ready for Operations\" status in May 2010 and seized 12,400 kilograms of cocaine worth nearly $400 million during a 90-day patrol. The WAESCHE (NSC #2) was commissioned in May 2010, while the STRATTON (NSC #3) is 75% complete and scheduled for delivery later this year. NSC 4 production contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman after negotiations. The production and delivery contract for NSC 4 was awarded to Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding in November 2010, valued at $480 million. A firm fixed price contract option was awarded in January 2011 for Long Lead Time Material for the fifth NSC. Negotiations for NSC 5 production and delivery are ongoing. The July 2011 GAO report highlighted key issues with the second NSC, including problems with the crane and an unsafe ammunition hoist. The July 2011 GAO report identified issues with the second NSC, including problems with the crane, an unsafe ammunition hoist, instability with the side davit for small boat launch, insufficient power to a key docking system, and an impractical requirement for using the side rescue door in difficult sea conditions. Workarounds exist for some issues, but funding and design changes are needed for corrections, which may require costly retrofits. The ASIST system, intended to automate helicopter procedures on the NSC, was canceled in January 2011 due to significant deficiencies found during testing. The ASIST system on the NSC was canceled in January 2011 due to significant deficiencies found during testing by the U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center. Issues included increased pilot workload during landing, stress on helicopter components, failure to reduce manpower needed to secure the helicopter, communication delays between landing operator and pilot, and unpredictable failures to locate the aircraft while hovering over the flight deck. Coast Guard officials were aware of potential problems with ASIST as early as 2007 but proceeded with testing until completion. The Coast Guard invested $27 million in the ASIST system for NSCs, but it was canceled in 2011 due to significant deficiencies found during testing. They are now exploring Navy solutions to replace the system and are continuing work on the Offshore Patrol Cutter to replace aging Medium Endurance Cutters. Industry engagement has been ongoing for the design process. The design process for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) has been ongoing, with industry engagement and a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) expected soon. The July 2011 GAO report highlighted unresolved concerns about key performance parameters for the OPC, such as seakeeping, speed, and range. Despite approval of the OPC's requirements document, questions remain about its ability to operate in difficult sea conditions, impacting its design and cost. Limiting operations in challenging sea conditions could restrict key mission areas for the Coast Guard. The DHS approved the OPC requirements document but commissioned a study to further examine key performance parameters. The study found the parameters reasonable and accurate. However, by approving the document before resolving these factors, DHS did not ensure the cutter's affordability, feasibility, and clarity, leading to potential cost overruns and schedule delays. The Coast Guard's OPC requirements document has been approved, but key decisions regarding C4ISR system, classified information processing, and air search capabilities remain unresolved. These decisions must be made before the acquisition program baseline is approved in the fall of 2011. A ship design team has been formed to consider the affordability and feasibility of the OPC. The Coast Guard's ship design team is focusing on the affordability and feasibility of the OPC cutter, discussing key issues such as living quarters size, aviation fuel storage, and range. Affordability is crucial, and the request for proposal process will help balance affordability and capability. Recommendations include thorough DHS review of decisions on design feasibility, capability, and affordability. The Coast Guard's 154-foot Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter (FRC) project aims to close a patrol boat operational gap and replace aging patrol boats. The project uses a proven design modified to meet Coast Guard specifications, minimizing cost and schedule risks for quick delivery to the fleet. The first of a new series of patrol boats for the Coast Guard, the Fast Response Cutter (FRC), is facing delays in delivery due to structural issues in the design. Rear Adm. John Korn mentioned the need for additional structure on the main and first decks, causing a nine-month delay in delivery. Design changes are being made for future FRCs to address these issues. The Coast Guard's delivery of the first Fast Response Cutter (FRC) has been delayed to December due to structural issues. Rear Adm. John Korn stated that while the FRC meets contract standards, there are concerns about its safety in certain sea states. The Coast Guard plans to conduct tests before awarding a contract for the next batch of FRCs to reduce program risk. The first Fast Response Cutter (FRC) delivery has been delayed to December 2011 due to a design change to enhance its structure. An early operational assessment identified and corrected 69 design issues. Officials are confident in the FRC's reliability and do not anticipate major operational issues during testing. The Coast Guard plans to use the lead FRC for initial operational testing and evaluation to reduce risk. The U.S. Coast Guard's first Fast Response Cutter (FRC) delivery has been delayed to December 2011 due to structural modifications. An operational assessment identified and corrected design issues, with officials confident in the FRC's reliability. The Navy's concerns about using the first cutter for testing include operator unfamiliarity, incomplete logistics support, and insufficient data collection time. Acquisition costs for the FRC are not expected to rise despite the delays. The U.S. Coast Guard's first Fast Response Cutter (FRC) delivery has been delayed to December 2011 due to structural modifications. The changes were made to ensure a 20-year service life of the hull, not due to construction problems. The total acquisition cost of the FRC is not expected to increase, with funds set aside for this purpose. The Coast Guard is making structural modifications to the Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) to increase safety margins. The changes involve adding girders and bars to specific areas of the ships. The modifications will be implemented from the seventh ship onwards. The FRCs are based on the Damen 4708 design with several modifications, including a stern ramp. Delivery of the first FRC, the Bernard C. Webber, has been delayed to December 2011. The Coast Guard is making structural modifications to the Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) for increased safety. Changes include adding girders and bars to specific areas of the ships. The FRCs are based on the Damen 4708 design with a stern ramp. Congress has options to track, modify reporting requirements, prohibit funding, or pass legislation for acquisition programs. In final action, H.R. 2055 / P.L. 112-74 of December 23, 2011, provides funds for the Coast Guard's Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements (AC&I) account, including long lead time materials for the sixth National Security Cutter. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit reports to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees. The Secretary of Homeland Security must provide a future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees annually. This plan should detail proposed appropriations, total estimated costs, funding levels for the next 5 years, completion dates, and acquisition program baselines for each capital asset. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must include the total acquisition cost of each asset by fiscal year, a detailed project schedule, and explanations for any deviations in cost, performance, or schedule from the original baseline. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must include the total acquisition cost of each asset by fiscal year, a detailed project schedule, explanations for deviations in cost, performance, or schedule from the original baseline, and align the acquisition of assets to mission requirements by defining capabilities and addressing known capability gaps. Life-cycle costs, earned value management system summary, and phase-out schedule must also be included. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard includes a phase-out and decommissioning schedule for existing legacy assets, ensuring consistency with proposed appropriations in the President's budget. Any inconsistencies between the capital investment plan and proposed appropriations will be identified and justified. Section 517 of the bill addresses funds appropriated to the Coast Guard. Section 517 of the bill states that funds recovered from the 110-123 foot patrol boat conversion will be available for the Fast Response Cutter program. The conference report on H.R. 2055 / P.L. 112-74 requires comprehensive and quarterly acquisition status reports for Departmental acquisition programs. The Department-wide comprehensive report will cover Coast Guard acquisition data, eliminating the need for separate quarterly reports. The Coast Guard Capital Investment Plan (CIP) will provide detailed oversight, with GAO reviewing and briefing the Committees on the results. Instead of individual briefings, the Coast Guard will now brief the Committees quarterly on all major acquisitions, including operational objectives, capability gaps, and how specific assets address those gaps. The Coast Guard is directed to provide information on operational hours calculation, risks to mission performance, and operational strategy at required briefings. $77,000,000 is allocated for long-lead time materials for the sixth National Security Cutter, with immediate availability of funds specified. This funding is intended to support the acquisition of necessary materials for production. The funding of long-lead time materials in fiscal year 2012 will accelerate NSC production, resulting in direct savings and expedited completion of the NSC acquisition program baseline. This approach is in contrast to the Administration's current acquisition policy, which would lead to higher costs, engineering inefficiencies, and strain on Coast Guard assets. The goal is to acquire eight NSCs in a cost-effective manner. The Coast Guard is directed to provide updated information on the acquisition of the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Fast Response Cutter. $358,000,000 is allocated for six Fast Response Cutters to maximize production capabilities and save $30,000,000. Funding for the re-procurement data and licensing rights package should sustain the acquisition program baseline. The Coast Guard is allocated additional funds for the installation of modernized communications systems on legacy cutters. They are also directed to develop a long-term plan for in-service cutter sustainment and provided funding for a replacement HH-60 helicopter. A new PPA is established for long-range surveillance aircraft to leverage limited funding effectively. The Coast Guard is directed to brief the Committees on the evaluation of options for long-range surveillance aircraft funding. $26,000,000 is provided for Program Oversight and Management, with a reduction of $9,000,000 due to budget constraints. The Coast Guard will provide a detailed budget justification for the fiscal year 2013 budget materials, including $8,000,000 for cutter-based unmanned aircraft systems. Additional funding is allocated for shipboard integration equipment and advanced technology demonstration. Final action on the FY2012 DHS appropriations bill can be found in H.R. 2055 / P.L. 112-74. The Committee allocates funds for the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses and AC&I accounts, with specific conditions for the release of $75,000,000 for Coast Guard Headquarters Directorates. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit various reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives require a future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard to be submitted annually with the President's budget. This plan must detail proposed appropriations, total estimated costs, funding levels for the next five years, completion dates, and acquisition program baselines for each capital asset. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must include detailed funding levels, project schedules, quantities planned, major acquisition events, and explanations for any deviations from the original acquisition program baseline. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must align asset acquisition with mission requirements, define life-cycle costs, and include earned value management system summaries. It should also outline phase-out and decommissioning schedules for existing legacy assets. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard includes a phase-out and decommissioning schedule for existing legacy assets. Section 517 of the bill addresses funds appropriated for the 110-123 foot patrol boat conversion for fiscal years 2002-2006. The House Appropriations Committee withholds $75 million from Coast Guard's Headquarters Directorates until certain reports are submitted. The Coast Guard has not updated its mission requirements. The Coast Guard has not updated its mission requirements since 2004, causing a delay in effective budget planning. The Committee directs the Coast Guard to submit the most current Fleet Mix Analysis. The Coast Guard is directed to submit the most current Fleet Mix Analysis to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives and to brief the Committees on its process for formulating updated mission requirements within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The Committee removes the annual requirement for a Revised Deepwater Implementation Plan and strengthens the requirements for the annual capital investment plan. The Commandant is directed to continue submitting quarterly reports on acquisition projects and mission emphasis. The Coast Guard is directed to submit mission emphasis reports in a specified format, detailing operational objectives, gaps, and acquisition strategies. The Commandant is also directed to revise and resubmit the Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2012-2016 as specified in the bill. The Coast Guard is directed to revise the Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2012-2016 as specified in the bill. The Committee has revised the budget structure for the Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements account due to the dissolution of the Deepwater program. The Committee appreciates the Coast Guard's cooperation in aligning previously appropriated funds with the new PPA structure and directs them to submit future CIPs accordingly. The request for $77,000,000 for closeout costs of the fifth National Security Cutter is denied as funds were provided in fiscal year 2011 for full production costs. The Coast Guard has not proposed repurposing these funds for the sixth NSC. The Committee is concerned about the potential increase in costs for the acquisition of the sixth National Security Cutter due to the application of the full funding policy by the Office of Management and Budget. This policy could extend the program baseline and raise the unit cost by $45-60 million per cutter. The Committee criticizes the Administration's management of the NSC acquisition program, citing higher costs, delays in operational capabilities, and escalating maintenance costs of the Coast Guard's fleet. They demand a revised acquisition strategy to address these issues within 30 days. The Committee recommends $240,000,000 for the acquisition of four Fast Response Cutters (FRCs), $118,000,000 below the amount requested. Funding for two additional FRCs is denied due to structural deficiencies found during production of the first FRC. The Coast Guard is using funds reserved for FRC antecedent liabilities to address costs of structural modifications, raising concerns about future unfunded liabilities. The Committee recommends $240,000,000 for the acquisition of four Fast Response Cutters (FRCs) but denies funding for two additional FRCs due to structural deficiencies. They are cautious about accelerating the acquisition of FRCs from four to six per year until empirical OT&E results are examined. The request for the re-procurement package and data rights (RDLP) is also denied at this time. The Committee remains committed to replacing the Coast Guard's aging patrol boat fleet with FRCs and will reconsider funding for an increase in production rate and RDLP purchase once outstanding issues are resolved. The Committee recommends $66,000,000 for major acquisition systems infrastructure, $28,500,000 below the amount requested and $10,000,000 above the amount provided in fiscal year 2011. The request for two FRC port upgrades is denied due to budget justification issues, projected delays in FRC deliveries, and concerns about significant cost increases. The Coast Guard is directed to include infrastructure costs with each capital asset and to brief the Committee within 45 days of the Act's enactment. The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for government program management, $5,000,000 below the amount requested and $15,000,000 below the amount provided in fiscal year 2011. The reduction is due to the lack of detail in the Coast Guard's budget justification for this function. The Coast Guard is directed to provide a detailed breakdown of funding for government program management. The Committee recommends an additional $10,000,000 for communication upgrades on legacy cutters to enhance surveillance and operational coordination. Additionally, $37,000,000 is recommended for the acquisition of two replacement HH-65 helicopters lost in duty. The Coast Guard is directed to brief the Committee on reset plans for irrecoverable assets lost in the line of duty. An additional $2,000,000 is recommended for pre-acquisition activities for cutter-based unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to enhance surveillance capabilities. The Coast Guard is urged to outline its plans for further investment in cutter-based UAS deployment. The Committee advises further investment in cutter-based UAS, aligning with the Coast Guard's CIP. They request a report on the impact of the absence of deployed UAS on NSC capability. The Committee commends CBP and the Coast Guard for collaboration on land-based maritime UAS but expresses concern over lack of progress in interagency coordination and acquisition of additional systems. The Coast Guard is urged to invest in land-based UAS for maritime surveillance in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean basin. The Committee requests a clear plan for acquisition and deployment, including costs and delivery schedule alignment with the Coast Guard's Capital Investment Plan. The Committee has combined funding for HC\u2013130J introduction and HC\u2013130H refurbishment to optimize budgeting for Long Range Surveillance (LRS) Aircraft. The Coast Guard is directed to provide a briefing on their evaluation of options for refurbished HC\u2013130Hs and new HC\u2013130Js. Additionally, funds are allocated for the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account, with $75,000,000 withheld for Headquarters Directorates pending a briefing. Funds are provided for the Coast Guard's Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements account. $75,000,000 shall be withheld for Headquarters Directorates pending the receipt of specified reports. The funds are immediately available for long lead time materials for the sixth National Security Cutter. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit reports to the Committees on Appropriations. Homeland Security must provide a future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees annually. The plan should detail proposed appropriations, total estimated costs, funding levels for the next 5 years, completion dates, and acquisition program baselines for each capital asset. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must include the total acquisition cost of each asset, detailed project schedule, quantities planned for each fiscal year, major acquisition events, and explanations for any deviations from the original acquisition program baseline. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard must include the total acquisition cost of each asset, detailed project schedule, quantities planned for each fiscal year, major acquisition events, and explanations for any deviations from the original acquisition program baseline. Additionally, the plan aligns asset acquisition with mission requirements, defines life-cycle costs, includes earned value management system summaries, and outlines phase-out and decommissioning schedules. The future-years capital investment plan for the Coast Guard includes acquisition costs, project schedules, quantities per fiscal year, major events, and explanations for deviations. It aligns asset acquisition with mission requirements, defines life-cycle costs, and outlines phase-out schedules. Section 517 of the bill addresses funds appropriated for patrol boat conversion from 2002 to 2006. Section 565 of the bill allocates $18.3 million for aircraft replacement for the Coast Guard, with rescinded amounts from unobligated balances for various agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $4 million in fiscal year 2010 for the Coast Guard to assess the High Endurance Cutter fleet. However, minimal work has been done with less than $500,000 of the funding being used since October 2009. Delays in delivering the final National Security Cutters have also been noted, with the final delivery now expected in 2018 instead of 2016. The Coast Guard is urged to accelerate its work on the National Security Cutter fleet, with a focus on bridging operational gaps. The committee withholds $75 million until required reports are submitted. The Coast Guard has submitted a 5-year Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2013\u20132017. The report highlights the need to replace aging high endurance cutters with National Security Cutters. Over $3.1 billion has been allocated for five NSCs, with two already delivered and more in the pipeline. Funding for NSC\u20135 in fiscal year 2012 has been superseded. The Committee redirects funds from NSC-5 to acquire long lead time materials for NSC-6, accelerating production and saving $45-60 million. It strongly supports procuring one National Security Cutter per year to ensure timely delivery at the lowest cost. The current acquisition policy for Coast Guard vessels requires total cost estimation before production contract award, leading to inefficiencies and delayed funding. The Committee includes language in the bill to allow funds for long lead time materials regardless of production or post-production costs, aiming for efficient acquisition of National Security Cutters. The Committee recommends $358,000,000 for the Coast Guard's Fast Response Cutter [FRC], allowing the acquisition of six FRC hulls. This will result in cost savings and improved operational capabilities, including decommissioning aging patrol boats. The Coast Guard's due diligence in improving the structural design for the FRC hull is commended. The Coast Guard worked with the Naval Engineering Technical Authority to enhance the FRC hull's structural design, preventing costly repairs during its 20-year service life. Funding for a Re-procurement Package and Data Rights is recommended to support future FRC procurement and avoid production gaps and increased costs. The recommendation includes $47,000,000 for the Medium Endurance Cutter Sustainment Project to improve mission effectiveness of five 270-foot cutters. $25,000,000 is allocated for the Offshore Patrol Cutter for pre-acquisition activities. The Coast Guard is expected to provide quarterly briefings on procurement status. The Coast Guard is recommended to provide quarterly briefings on procurement status. Funding is recommended for the replacement of two helicopters and two Maritime Patrol Aircraft to address operational asset losses and flight-hour gaps. The Committee recommends additional funding to address the Coast Guard's MPA flight-hour gap and highlights the importance of the mission system pallet. However, funding for pallets is not included in the recommendation for fiscal year 2012. The Coast Guard is exploring ship-based and land-based Unmanned Aircraft Systems to enhance its maritime capabilities. The Committee is concerned about the lack of funding for acquiring UAS for Coast Guard cutters. They recommend $8,000,000 for shipboard ground control equipment and mention $3,200,000 from prior year appropriations. The report also discusses the Fleet Mix Analysis and the recommendation from the Government Accountability Office in 2010. The Coast Guard is conducting a Fleet Mix Analysis to determine the best asset mix for operational missions. Phase 1 was completed without cost considerations, leading to unrealistic conclusions. Phase 2 is now underway, considering fiscal constraints, with completion expected in fiscal year 2011. The Coast Guard is conducting a Fleet Mix Analysis to determine the best asset mix for operational missions. Phase 1 was completed without cost considerations, leading to unrealistic conclusions. Phase 2 is now underway, considering fiscal constraints, with completion expected in fiscal year 2011. The Committee is aware of a separate Departmental study called the \"Cutter Fleet Mix Analysis\" that will be submitted to the Committee and GAO once completed. Additionally, the bill includes language providing an additional $18,300,000 for the Coast Guard to replace a rotary wing airframe due to accidents. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported on H.R. 2838, stating that the Commandant cannot start production of a sixth national security cutter until certain conditions are met, including acquiring specific small boats for the first three cutters. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported on H.R. 2838, stating that the Commandant cannot begin production of a seventh national security cutter until specific conditions are met, including selecting an offshore patrol cutter that meets minimum operational requirements. The plan also includes increasing aerial coverage to support national security cutter operations. Amendment- The analysis at the beginning of the chapter is amended by adding at the end the following: `569a. National security cutters.'. Section 304 states: SEC. 304. MAJOR ACQUISITIONS REPORT. Subchapter I of chapter 15 of title 14, United States Code, is further amended by adding at the end the following: `Sec. 569b. Major acquisitions report `(a) Major Acquisition Programs Implementation Report- The Secretary shall submit a report on the status of all major acquisition programs every two fiscal years to specific committees. The Coast Guard's major acquisitions report includes a statement of mission needs and performance goals for each program, justification for changes, projected assets capabilities, mission hour gaps, timeline and cost changes, and how changes fulfill mission needs and goals. The Coast Guard's major acquisitions report includes a description of how new assets will be integrated, allocation of funds, lifecycle costs of legacy assets, cost accounting, performance comparison, and anticipated acquisitions workload for the next fiscal year. The Coast Guard's major acquisitions report includes details on the acquisition workforce, staffing adequacy, cutters maintenance status, and definition of major acquisition programs. The Coast Guard is undergoing a long-term program to modernize its aging vessels, aircraft, and outdated systems despite acquisition reforms. The major acquisitions report details workforce, staffing, cutters maintenance, and major acquisition programs. The Coast Guard's recapitalization program is facing significant delays, cost overruns, and capability gaps despite acquisition reforms. The total acquisition costs for 17 major acquisitions are expected to exceed $28 billion, with 10 of the 12 approved baselines behind schedule. The program is projected to end in the early 2030s due to inconsistent and insufficient funding for capital acquisitions. The Coast Guard's recapitalization program is facing delays and cost overruns in capital acquisitions. Hundreds of millions were spent on assets that failed in design or testing. Ongoing capability rebaselining started in 2004 to meet post-September 11 mission requirements. A revised Fleet Mix Analysis may lead to further rebaselining of capabilities for all assets in the program. The Coast Guard's recapitalization program is experiencing delays and cost overruns in capital acquisitions. The Service's Capital Investment Plan includes estimates of higher funding levels for acquisitions over the next five years, leading to concerns about unrealistic budget planning. The Committee expects the Commandant to provide a cost-constrained Fleet Mix Analysis promptly. The Coast Guard is facing challenges in implementing the National Security Cutter (NSC) acquisition program, leading to delays in meeting operational parameters. The NSC was designed to operate more efficiently with new technologies, including vertical take-off Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (VUAVs) to enhance its range and capability. However, two NSCs have been delivered without VUAVs, causing concerns about the cutter's full potential. The Service is working with the Navy to develop a VUAV, but a timeline for implementation is uncertain.

The NSC was designed to operate more efficiently with new technologies, including vertical take-off Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (VUAVs) to enhance its range and capability. However, two NSCs have been delivered without VUAVs, causing concerns about the cutter's full potential. The Service is working with the Navy to develop a VUAV, but a timeline for implementation is uncertain. No funds are included in the CIP to acquire VUAVs over the next five years. Cutter boats on the NSC are being replaced due to performance issues, and a multi-crewing strategy is proposed to meet mission hour baselines. The Coast Guard has spent over $3 billion on the National Security Cutter (NSC) program, but challenges remain in meeting operational parameters. The NSCs lack planned capabilities like VUAVs, leading to concerns about their effectiveness compared to older cutters. The Committee emphasizes the need for the NSC to meet stated goals, especially given its significant cost in the overall recapitalization effort. The report prohibits the Commandant from proceeding with a sixth NSC production until certain criteria are met. The report prohibits the Commandant from starting production on a sixth national security cutter until specific criteria are met, including acquiring necessary small boats, achieving operational goals, and submitting a plan for aerial surveillance support. Production of the seventh cutter is also on hold until an Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) is selected to replace aging medium endurance cutters. The OPC program is behind schedule with no approved cost estimate. The House considered H.R. 2838 on October 4, 2011, with an amendment to strike Section 303 withdrawn by unanimous consent. S. 1665 was introduced on October 6, 2011, and ordered to be reported favorably from the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on November 2, 2011. The bill did not include provisions specific to Deepwater acquisition programs. Critics in 2007 believed issues in Deepwater cutter acquisition were due to broader Coast Guard management problems. The Coast Guard's management of the Deepwater program raised serious concerns in reports and testimony from the DHS IG, GAO, and a DAU study in 2007. Using a private-sector LSI was criticized for making the program more complex and potentially leading to waste, fraud, and abuse. While some believed the private-sector approach was valid, the contract used by the Coast Guard was flawed, hindering their ability to assess contractor performance and control costs. Observers raised concerns about the Deepwater contract, citing issues with the indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract type and the transfer of too much authority to the private-sector LSI. Critics argued that self-certification by the LSI could lead to inadequate oversight by the Coast Guard. The Deepwater contract raised concerns due to vague operational requirements, limited competition between suppliers, and scoring that didn't reflect recent problems. Award and incentive fees were based on \"attitude and effort\" rather than performance. The Deepwater program's management was criticized for lacking penalties, in-house expertise, and reliance on meeting schedules over performance. Coast Guard and industry officials acknowledged issues but defended the program. The National Security Cutter (NSC) program faced criticism for design flaws and cost overruns, with the Coast Guard accused of not reporting problems to Congress in a timely manner and resisting investigations. The Coast Guard's cooperation with the DHS IG improved, but Deepwater contractors hindered interviews. The 110/123-Foot Patrol Boat Modernization program aimed to enhance capabilities and extend boat lives. Eight boats were modernized at a cost of $96 million, with the first delivered in March 2004. The Coast Guard spent about $96 million on modernizing eight boats, but structural problems were soon discovered. The modernization effort was halted in June 2005 due to lacking capabilities for post-9/11 operational requirements. Additional issues were raised by a former Lockheed engineer in August 2006, leading to the suspension of operations in November 2006 due to more structural damage. The Coast Guard decommissioned eight boats due to operational gaps and acknowledged the failure of the program in 2007. The Fast Response Cutter (FRC) design and construction effort was accelerated by 10 years, but problems were discovered, leading to the suspension of work on the design in February 2006. The Coast Guard accelerated the Fast Response Cutter (FRC) design and construction effort by 10 years, with plans for 12 FRCs and 46 FRC-Bs. The RFP for the FRC-B program includes options for up to 34 FRC-Bs, potentially reducing the number of FRC-As to 24. If the FRC-Bs meet FRC requirements, all 58 FRCs could be built to the FRC-B design. In April 2007, the Coast Guard announced six reform actions for the Deepwater program. The Coast Guard announced six fundamental changes in the management of the Deepwater program, including assuming the lead role as systems integrator, taking responsibility for life cycle logistics, expanding the role of third-parties for vessel design, and working collaboratively to resolve outstanding issues. The Coast Guard is working on resolving issues with national security cutters by considering direct contracts with prime vendors and meeting regularly with industry counterparts. These changes aim to improve program management and oversight for the Deepwater program. The Deepwater program is undergoing significant organizational changes to improve government and industry management and performance. These changes are aimed at making the Coast Guard more adaptive, responsive, and accountable in addressing a broad range of threats to America's maritime interests. The Coast Guard is making organizational changes to improve management and performance in the Deepwater program. These enhancements will better equip them to handle large acquisitions in the future. The focus is on moving forward and not dwelling on past challenges. The federal government struggles with balancing innovation and technology from the private sector with the need for robust competition. Both industry and government have failed to understand each other's needs, resulting in counterproductive operations. There is a need to anticipate challenges and develop solutions with transparency and accountability. The government and businesses need to operate with transparency and accountability. Changes in management, oversight, and contracts are being implemented to improve the Deepwater program. The Coast Guard has a history of stewardship and care for its assets, ensuring maritime safety and security. The program is expected to exceed expectations and improve in the future. The Coast Guard is committed to ensuring that new ships, aircraft, and systems acquired through the Deepwater program meet mission requirements for years to come. Changes in management and oversight reflect a significant shift in the program to maintain a capable fleet for maritime safety and security. In 2007, the Coast Guard announced a reorganization of commands to strengthen acquisition management, altered terms of the Deepwater contract, planned to procure FRC-B cutters directly from the manufacturer, hired more acquisition personnel, and concurred with concerns raised about the current contract. The Coast Guard initiated a program to modernize its 110-foot Island class patrol boats, increasing their length to 123 feet to remain in service until replacement Deepwater craft are delivered. The program, known as the 110/123-foot modernization program, faced structural problems with the initial eight boats. The Coast Guard's 110/123-foot modernization program faced significant structural problems with the initial eight boats, leading to their removal from service and the program's cancellation after spending close to $100 million. The Justice Department launched an investigation into the program, focusing on Deepwater communications systems and the National Security Cutter. The Coast Guard revoked its acceptance of the modernized boats to recover funds from the involved firms. The Coast Guard sought repayment of $96.1 million from ICGS for patrol boats, with ongoing investigations and legal actions. The Coast Guard continues to support investigations by the DOJ and DHS-OIG regarding false statements made by Bollinger Shipyards. An independent engineering analysis is being conducted through the Navy, with plans to salvage valuable equipment from patrol boats. Three cutters are being preserved as evidence for ongoing investigations. The United States has filed a lawsuit against Bollinger Shipyards for making false statements to the Coast Guard under the Deepwater Program. Bollinger proposed converting 110-Ft Patrol Boats into 123-Ft WPBs, leading to hull failure on the first converted cutter, Matagorda. An investigation found misrepresentations about hull strength. The United States has filed a lawsuit against Bollinger Shipyards for providing false information to the Coast Guard during the Deepwater Program. The investigation revealed that the hull strength calculations reported by Bollinger were inaccurate, leading to the failure of the first converted cutter, Matagorda. The unseaworthy cutters have been taken out of service, and the government is seeking damages under the False Claims Act. Tony West, Assistant Attorney General, emphasized the importance of integrity in public contracting and stated that action will be taken against those who provide substandard equipment to armed services personnel. Bollinger Shipyards has a spotless record for quality work with the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. They are disappointed with the Department of Justice's complaint related to work completed in 2006. They have been cooperative with the government and remain committed to providing quality service. Bollinger Shipyards has been open and cooperative with the government, committed to providing necessary information and assistance. They are prepared to defend their good name in court if needed. The revolving door between government and industry can have benefits but also raises concerns about conflicts of interest. The revolving door between government and industry has raised concerns about conflicts of interest, with top U.S. Coast Guard officers taking positions with private firms involved in a troubled fleet replacement program. This included officials with ties to industry giants Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. The Deepwater contract awarded in 2002 involved former Lockheed executives and raised concerns about conflicts of interest in the government-industry revolving door. Federal ethics rules have loopholes allowing senior policymakers to oversee decisions that may benefit former or prospective employers. The Deepwater contract awarded in 2002 involved former Lockheed executives and raised concerns about conflicts of interest in the government-industry revolving door. Federal ethics rules have loopholes allowing senior policymakers to oversee decisions that may benefit former or prospective employers, including outsourcing strategies where taxpayers bear most of the risks for failure. The connections between agencies and contractors have drawn the attention of the DHS inspector general, who stated that it is something they are very sensitive to."
