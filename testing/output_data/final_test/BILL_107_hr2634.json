    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Care for All Veterans Act\" revises the medical care funding allocation formula for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \"Equitable Care for All Veterans Act\" revises the VERA formula for VA medical care funding allocation to incorporate regional cost differences and evaluate the effects after two fiscal years. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must determine if modifications to the VERA formula have shifted funding allocations among service regions. If no substantive shift is found, the use of VERA for fund allocation will be terminated. SEC. 3. STANDBY ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. Development of Replacement Formula.--If the Secretary of Veterans Affairs terminates the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system, a new formula for fund allocation to VISNs must be developed. The formula must ensure funding levels are maintained or increased from the previous year and consider additional costs incurred by VISNs. The funding allocation formula for veterans medical care is based on factors such as the number of veterans moving into a VISN, median age of veterans, veterans requiring complex care, and age of VA health care facilities. Until a new formula is implemented, the previous formula before the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system will be used. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization for Replacement Allocation Formula: $10,000,000 is authorized for the Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2002. An additional $100,000,000 is authorized for \"Medical Care\" for the Department of Veterans Affairs, allocated based on need to Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The allocation formula for Department of Veterans Affairs funding in fiscal year 2002 includes provisions for reductions in funding levels from 1997, prioritizing VISNs with five-year funding decreases, and equal allocation among remaining VISNs if funds are left after initial allocations."
