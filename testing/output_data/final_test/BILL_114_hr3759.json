The \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2015\" mandates the use of ignition interlock devices to prevent repeat intoxicated driving. Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a new section (Sec. 160) defining terms like alcohol concentration, driving while intoxicated, and ignition interlock device. The \"Drunk Driving Repeat Offender Prevention Act of 2015\" requires ignition interlock devices to prevent intoxicated driving by mandating breath samples before starting a motor vehicle if the driver's alcohol concentration is above the legal limit. The term \"motor vehicle\" excludes vehicles operated on rail lines or commercial vehicles. States must enforce laws requiring ignition interlock devices throughout the state to meet the Act's requirements. The law mandates the installation of ignition interlock devices for 180 days on vehicles driven by individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The installation period can be reduced to 90 days if the driver's license is suspended for 180 days. Noncompliance may result in the withholding of funds. The Secretary will withhold a percentage of funds from states that do not meet the requirements for installing ignition interlock devices on vehicles driven by individuals convicted of driving while intoxicated. The percentage withheld increases each fiscal year, starting at 1% in 2018, 3% in 2019, and 5% in 2020 and beyond. The Secretary will withhold funds from states not meeting ignition interlock device requirements. Withheld funds remain available for apportionment for three fiscal years. If a state complies before the deadline, funds will be apportioned on the first day of compliance. On the first day a State meets requirements, funds withheld will be apportioned. The apportioned funds remain available for three fiscal years. If the State does not comply, the funds will lapse.
