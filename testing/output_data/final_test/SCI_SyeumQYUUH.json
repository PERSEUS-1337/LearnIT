    "content": "Predictive coding and variational autoencoders involve latent Gaussian models and variational inference. They have evolved independently but share connections in machine learning and neuroscience. Perception is framed differently in these areas, with predictive coding and VAEs modeling data observations to learn about the external environment through latent variables. This intersection also explores backpropagation, normalizing flows, and attention, offering mutual benefits for both fields. Both predictive coding and variational autoencoders model observations using latent variables through a probabilistic model. They both use variational inference to infer the latent variables and learn model parameters. These similarities stem from a common origin in neuroscience and machine learning, with opportunities for the transfer of ideas between the two fields. Variational inference is used in predictive coding models to estimate state using neural projections. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are Bayesian machine learning models that combine latent variables. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are Bayesian machine learning models that combine latent Gaussian models with deep neural networks. They consist of an encoder network with parameters \u03c6 and a decoder network with parameters \u03b8. VAEs amortize inference optimization with a learned network, improving computational efficiency. Gradients are obtained by reparameterizing stochastic samples, enabling differentiation through sampling. The parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 are learned using gradient-based optimization with backpropagation. Predictive coding and VAEs are hierarchical latent Gaussian models. Predictive coding uses polynomials for conditional dependencies, while VAEs utilize deep networks with linear and non-linear operations. Gaussian covariance matrices are separate parameters in predictive coding, implemented as lateral weights. VAEs employ normalizing flows for a similar mechanism. Predictive coding models dynamics explicitly in sequential models, while VAEs rely on less rigid forms of dynamics with recurrent networks. In contrast to predictive coding, VAEs use amortized inference to avoid the \"weight transport\" problem, learning a separate set of inference weights. Both models employ variational inference with Gaussian latent variables, but VAEs extensively use gradient-based learning for large datasets. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of attention mechanisms using precision in predictions and the adjustment of error neuron gain based on neuromodulation strength. It also mentions the proposed biological correspondences of predictive coding in neural activity representation within cortical columns. Deep networks in cortical columns parameterize relationships between variables, potentially corresponding to dendrites rather than entire networks of neurons. The biological correspondence of backpropagation remains uncertain, as it requires global information unlike the local reliance of biology. Recent formulations of learning in latent variable models offer an alternative perspective, suggesting that prediction errors at each level of the latent hierarchy provide a local signal for driving learning. This implies that learning across the cortical hierarchy is handled via local errors at each level, while learning within the neurons at each level is mediated through a mechanism similar to backpropagation. Recent formulations suggest that learning in latent variable models involves prediction errors at each level of the hierarchy driving learning. This implies that learning within neurons is mediated through a mechanism similar to backpropagation, with segmented dendrites enabling separate inference computations for errors at different levels. Normalizing flows provide added complexity while maintaining tractable evaluation and sampling. Normalizing flows involve a base distribution and invertible transforms, allowing sampling from complex distributions by applying local affine transforms. Local inhibition in neural systems is linked to normalization, enabling evaluation in a simpler space. Normalizing flows (NFs) are prevalent in neural systems, implementing normalization through subtractive and divisive operations. These circuits lead to decorrelation in the retina, LGN, and cortex. NFs align with predictive coding, such as whitening observations to remove spatial correlations. NFs also resemble temporal derivatives and are linked to Friston's generalized coordinates. Friston's proposal of prior covariance matrices in cortex corresponds to a linear NF. Local inhibition in central pattern generator circuits results in muscle activation correlations. NFs are explored in action selection for reinforcement. NFs improve action selection and learning by providing correlated motor outputs in a less correlated space. Predictive coding suggests that attention can be implemented through prior covariance matrices, biasing models towards task-relevant information. Gain modulation of error-encoding neurons, mediated by neurotransmitters and gamma oscillations, may implement this attentional control mechanism. Deep latent variable models have largely ignored task-dependent perceptual modulation, which could be essential for complex tasks. Commonalities between predictive coding and VAEs may strengthen the connection between neuroscience and machine learning, leading to mutual benefits. If predictive coding and related theories are to be validated descriptions of the brain, they may require further refinement. To validate descriptions of the brain, modern machine learning tools are needed to compare design choices."
