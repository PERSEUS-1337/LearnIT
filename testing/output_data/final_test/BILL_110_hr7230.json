    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Save America's Utility Infrastructure and Secure America Now Act of 2008\". The blackout of August 2003 in the Northeast, Midwest, and parts of Canada, Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Iowa flooding in 2008, and Hurricane Katrina's devastation still visible on the Gulf Coast highlight the need for infrastructure improvements and disaster preparedness. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ike caused significant damage and loss of life across the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina resulted in over 1,800 deaths and $43 billion in damages, while Hurricane Ike's insured damages were estimated at $9.8 billion. Cedric Delane, a 5th grade student, passed away in 2008 due to a lack of electricity and delayed assistance. Cedric, a 5th grade student at Blackshear Elementary in Houston, Texas, died during Hurricane Ike due to a severe asthma attack exacerbated by the lack of electrical power for his breathing machine. Despite paramedics' efforts, Cedric did not survive. The aftermath of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Houston-Galveston area saw significant relief efforts, including shelter stays, meals served, and distribution of clean-up kits. The Texas Public Utility Commissioners did not enforce reliability measures for electric companies against hurricanes, despite staff recommendations for aggressive tree-trimming. Utility Commission staff recommended aggressive tree-trimming programs and major upgrades, including replacing wooden electric polls with metal or concrete polls in 2005 after Hurricane Rita. Texas Public utility companies opposed the recommendations, but the Texas Public Utility Commission ordered a cost-benefit analysis of moving electric substations out of flood zones. Hurricane Ike resulted in 28 deaths in the Houston area and left over half a million people without power for more than a week, including vulnerable populations. Criminal enforcement of reliability standards and cost-benefit studies are needed for better disaster preparedness. Cost-benefit studies using Census and FEMA data show that penalties by FERC and improved disaster preparedness are crucial to prevent greater loss of property and life during disasters. SEC. 3. FERC enforcement authority is amended to allow the Commission to impose fines or imprisonment for violating approved standards. Paragraph (4) is repealed, and civil penalties are specified. SEC. 4 addresses disturbances lasting longer than 5 days. SEC. 4 of the Act requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to amend reliability standards to prohibit disturbances lasting longer than 5 days at substations. SEC. 5 mandates a study and report on emergency planning for vulnerable populations. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a study on emergency planning for vulnerable populations, including individuals with disabilities, elderly individuals, children, and those with pets or service animals. A report must be submitted to the Committee on Homeland Security within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a report to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with the results of a study on emergency planning for vulnerable populations, including individuals with disabilities, elderly individuals, children, and those with pets or service animals."
