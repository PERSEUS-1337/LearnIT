    "content": "The federal Lifeline program, established in 1985 by the FCC, helps low-income consumers access and stay connected to the telecommunications network by assisting with monthly service charges. It was expanded in 2005 to include wireless options and in 2016 to cover broadband services. The program is available to eligible individuals in all states, territories, commonwealths, and tribal lands, with USAC as the administrator. The Lifeline Program, administered by USAC on behalf of the FCC, provides a monthly discount of up to $9.25 for eligible households to offset telecommunication network costs. It offers subsidies for network access but not for devices. The 2016 Order expanded the program to include subsidies for broadband adoption, supporting stand-alone mobile or fixed broadband and voice and broadband bundles, with minimum standards set for broadband and mobile voice. The Lifeline Program offers discounts for voice and broadband bundles, with minimum standards set for service offerings. Support for stand-alone voice services is phased out, and providers often offer a free wireless phone to subscribers. There are differences in the program for those living on tribal lands. The Lifeline Program provides subsidies for eligible consumers on tribal lands, including a $34.25 monthly subsidy and additional assistance programs like BIA general assistance. Subscribers on tribal lands can also access the FCC's Link Up Program, offering up to $100 discount on initial installation/activation of service for their primary residence. The Link Up Program offers a one-time initiation discount of up to $100 for eligible subscribers on tribal lands, in addition to a monthly subsidy of up to $34.25 in Lifeline support. To qualify, consumers must meet income requirements or be enrolled in certain needs-based programs. USAC provides an eligibility pre-screening tool to help determine eligibility. Once enrolled in the Lifeline program, participants must verify their eligibility annually. If a recipient becomes ineligible (e.g., due to increased income), they must contact the provider to de-enroll to avoid penalties or disbarment. Consumers can apply by contacting a state-designated provider or USAC for assistance. The provider will provide an application form with required information like name and address. The Lifeline application form requires information such as name, address, date of birth, and the last four digits of the enrollee's social security or tribal identification number. Proof of income documentation is needed for household income eligibility, while documentation proving program participation is required for program eligibility. The provider processes the application form and enters enrollee information into a nationwide USAC database for verification. The 2016 Order establishes a National Lifeline Eligibility Verifier (National Verifier) to determine subscriber eligibility. The National Verifier, established by USAC, will determine Lifeline subscriber eligibility. It will launch in six states in December 2017 and expand to all states and territories by December 31, 2019. Participants must be recertified annually, which can be done by the provider or USAC. Providers can verify eligibility through databases or send yearly recertification letters. Participants must recertify annually to maintain Lifeline benefits. If eligibility is not confirmed, they may be removed from the program. Benefits cannot be transferred, and failure to meet recertification deadlines results in loss of discount. Non-usage of pre-paid wireless options may lead to automatic de-enrollment after 30 days. Enrollment is limited to one per individual. Enrollment in the Lifeline program is limited to one discount for either a landline or wireless connection per household. A household is defined as individuals living together at the same address, sharing income and expenses. If one person in the household is enrolled in Lifeline, no other member is eligible. Multiple households can reside in a single dwelling if they are separate economic units. Violation of the one-per-household rule will result in consequences. Providers must be certified as \"eligible telecommunications carriers\" to participate in the Lifeline program, with certification given by the state or FCC. State public utility regulators establish certification criteria and approve providers, except for service on tribal lands or where state regulators lack jurisdiction, where FCC handles certification. A third certification path exists for federal Lifeline Broadband Providers, allowing them to offer broadband Lifeline services exclusively. LBP's may receive a federal designation to provide broadband Lifeline services and receive subsidies. Recipients can transfer the discount to another provider every 60 days for voice services and 12 months for data services by contacting a participating provider and providing necessary information. The Universal Service Fund (USF) requires certain telecommunications providers to contribute based on their revenues. This fund, including Lifeline, is funded by these contributions, not federal money. Some companies may pass on the USF charge to subscribers, but it is not mandatory. The Lifeline program does not require companies to pass on charges directly to subscribers. The program's funding can vary based on quarterly assessments by USAC, with a nonbinding yearly funding ceiling of $2.25 billion. Steps have been taken to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the program. The FCC has implemented measures to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the Lifeline program, including annual recertification for participants, a National Lifeline Accountability Database, an independent National Eligibility Verifier, refined federal program validation, and revised documentation retention requirements for providers. The FCC has implemented measures to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in the Lifeline program, including requirements for providers to retain documentation demonstrating subscriber eligibility, minimum service standards for subsidized providers, increased data publication, and enforcement actions against rule violators."
