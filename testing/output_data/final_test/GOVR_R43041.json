    "content": "The recent fiscal crisis and recession have highlighted debt collection issues, leading to increased federal regulatory and enforcement actions on the debt collection industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have identified debt buying, litigation as a collection strategy, and the impact of technology on debt collection as major developments. They have analyzed consumer complaints, studied the debt buying industry, and assessed how technology affects communication and information gathering by debt collectors. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) regulates how debt collectors communicate with consumers and handle consumer debts. Approximately 30 million Americans, nearly 10% of the population, are currently dealing with debt collection for an average amount of $1,500 per person. The FDCPA, enacted on September 29, 1977, aims to prevent abusive debt collection practices by prohibiting threats or harassment towards debtors. It mainly applies to third-party debt collectors defined as individuals or businesses engaged in debt collection activities. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) applies to debt collectors, except for certain exceptions like creditors collecting their own debts, government employees collecting debts as part of their duties, and non-profit credit counseling organizations assisting consumers with debt payments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Act, transferring administrative and enforcement functions from other federal agencies like the FTC. The CFPB coordinates with the FTC on enforcement activities. The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from contacting consumers at unusual times or places without consent. Contacts are limited to 8:00 am to 9:00 pm, and collectors cannot contact consumers at their place of employment if prohibited by the employer. If represented by an attorney, collectors must contact the attorney unless consent is given for direct communication with the consumer. Harassment or abuse of consumers is prohibited under the FDCPA. Debt collectors are prohibited from harassing or abusing consumers under the FDCPA. This includes threats of violence, the use of obscene language, and repeated calls to annoy or harass. Collectors must identify themselves when contacting consumers and cannot communicate with third parties about the debt, except to locate the consumer. If a consumer refuses to pay or requests communication to cease, the collector must comply, except to notify of further action. Debt collectors must follow strict guidelines when contacting consumers, including identifying themselves, not disclosing debt information to third parties, and refraining from using false or deceptive means to collect debts. Harassment or abuse towards consumers is prohibited, and collectors are limited to contacting third parties only once. Additionally, collectors cannot publish lists of consumers who refuse to pay debts or advertise the sale of debts to coerce payment. Debt collectors must adhere to strict guidelines when contacting consumers, including providing written notice within five days of initial communication. The notice must include the amount of debt, creditor's name, and consumer's right to dispute the debt within 30 days. Verification of the debt will be provided upon request. The debt collector must provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor upon request. Any formal pleading or notice unrelated to debt collection is not considered an initial communication. If the consumer disputes the debt or requests verification of the debt within 30 days, the debt collector must cease collection until verification is obtained. Payments made by the consumer must be applied as directed and cannot be applied to disputed debts. Debt collectors must apply consumer payments as directed and cannot apply them to disputed debts. Violations of the FDCPA can result in civil liability, with consumers able to take legal action within one year of the violation. They can seek actual damages, up to $1,000 in additional damages, court costs, and attorney's fees. The CFPB enforces the FDCPA under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB, under the Dodd-Frank Act, has regulatory authority for the FDCPA and oversees consumer financial protection laws for nonbank covered persons offering certain financial products. It defines larger participants in the consumer debt collection market as those with annual receipts exceeding $10 million. The CFPB oversees consumer financial protection laws for nonbank covered persons in the consumer debt collection market with annual receipts over $10 million. Approximately 175 firms, 4% of the market, account for 63% of the annual receipts. The rule does not specify the scope of federal laws on debt collection, and nonbank covered persons are subject to the Bureau's regulatory authority regardless of supervisory status. The CFPB has authority to supervise first-party debt collection activities of covered persons like banks and credit unions. The rule defines a debt collector as a person whose main business is debt collection or regularly engages in it. Attorneys who occasionally file claims against consumers may not be considered debt collectors under the rule. In October 2012, the CFPB issued guidelines for auditing bank and nonbank debt collection activities. The CFPB and FTC are evaluating compliance management systems in debt collection markets to identify risks to consumers. The FTC published a study in 2013 on debt markets, covering 76% of the industry and evaluating over 5,000 portfolios with a face value of $143 billion. Credit-card debt accounted for 71% of the debt portfolios. Debt buyers paid an average of 4 cents on the dollar for credit-card debt, which made up 62% of their portfolios. Consumers disputed over 1 million debts annually, with only about half being verified by debt buyers. Limited information on debts at the time of purchase could be linked to disputes. The report highlighted that debt buyers lacked key information on debts purchased, such as consumer disputes and debt verification. Creditors did not guarantee the accuracy of information provided to buyers. Some debts sold were past the statute of limitations for collection. Questions were raised on why debt buyers did not disclose more information to consumers, seek additional information post-purchase, or verify disputed debts. The report did not evaluate debt buyer practices comprehensively. The report did not verify nearly half of the disputed debts and did not evaluate debt buyer practices comprehensively. It also did not include data from smaller debt buyers, but noted that this information would be useful for further studies. Additionally, the FTC and CFPB sought information from various industry stakeholders, including debt collectors, lenders, consumer advocacy groups, state regulators, and technology experts. The FTC particularly highlighted a workshop in 2011 discussing the role of technology in the debt collection market. The workshop discussed the use of technology in debt collection, including collection software, mobile phones, voicemail, texting, and social media. Participants also talked about the impact of litigation on technology use and potential legislation to regulate it. The CFPB and FTC enforce FDCPA compliance, with the FTC treating violations as FTCA violations. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the Bureau to prohibit unfair practices in consumer financial products. The FTC and CFPB enforce laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts in consumer finance. The FTC reported on debt collection complaints, noting that many violations may go unreported. The FTC and CFPB enforce laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts in consumer finance. The FTC uses complaints to monitor debt-collector conduct, while the CFPB responds to individual consumer complaints and has started bringing enforcement actions for violations. In October 2012, the CFPB took its first public enforcement action against three American Express affiliates for debt collection practices. The CFPB took enforcement action against American Express affiliates for deceptive debt collection practices, including misleading consumers about credit score improvements and debt forgiveness in exchange for payments. American Express paid full restitution plus interest to affected consumers. American Express was penalized by the FTC for deceptive debt collection practices, including misleading consumers about credit score improvements and debt forgiveness. They were required to refund payments, provide $100 and a pre-approved card to affected consumers, disclose time-barred debt, and stop collecting debt without proper documentation. The FTC has increased enforcement actions against debt collectors to improve deterrence. In 2012, the FTC brought or resolved seven debt collection cases involving false threats, harassment, attempts to collect phantom debts, collectors falsely claiming to be law enforcement, and time-barred debt. Remedies included monetary redress, civil penalties, asset freezes, and injunctions. One case involved criminal proceedings for wire and mail fraud. The CFPB and FTC advocate for consumers by filing amicus briefs in debt collection cases. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Marx v. General Revenue Corporation that consumer plaintiffs who lose a lawsuit under the FDCPA may have to pay the defendant's court costs, even if the lawsuit was brought in good faith. The CFPB, FTC, and DOJ argued against this, stating that it could discourage consumers from bringing valid lawsuits and undermine congressional intent. Consumer advocates have raised concerns about various issues with the FDCPA, including inadequate debt verification, arbitration clauses limiting consumer rights, and arrests of debtors. Critics also point to limitations on bona-fide errors as a defense for debt collectors. In recent years, proposed legislation has addressed issues with the FDCPA, such as limits on voicemail/autodialing for debt collection. One bill in the 113th Congress, S. 508, defines child support as a debt. H.R. 2361 in the 112th Congress aimed to prohibit lawsuits for time-barred debts and required disclosure to consumers. S. 3350 proposed prohibiting debt collectors from requesting arrest warrants for debtors, improving debt information disclosure, verifying disputed debts thoroughly, and banning threats to withhold medical treatment for unpaid medical debts. H.R. 1783 / S. 824 aimed to expand FDCPA coverage to securitized residential mortgages and their servicers, increasing civil liability for debt collectors violating the law. H.R. 4101 / H.R. 5794 aimed to address debt collector issues by limiting liability for good faith compliance with regulations, allowing messages on answering machines, and prohibiting arbitration for debt collection disputes without consumer agreement. The consumer must agree to arbitration in writing after debt collection activities have begun and a lawsuit or dispute has arisen."
