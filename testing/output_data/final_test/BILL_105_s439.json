    "content": "Alaska state jurisdiction over small hydroelectric projects is added to Part I of the Federal Power Act. The Commission will discontinue regulating qualifying project works in Alaska once the state has a regulatory program that meets federal standards for water-power development. This program must protect public interest, the environment, and consider energy conservation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will require licensees to protect fish and wildlife habitats, recreational opportunities, environmental quality, Alaska Native interests, and public uses like irrigation and navigation. Licensees must also install lights and signals as directed by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard operates in various departments and oversees fishways prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce. Navigation facilities are controlled by rules set by the Secretary of the Army, and conditions for protecting fish and wildlife are based on recommendations from relevant agencies. The term \"qualifying project works\" refers to project works that meet specific criteria, including not being part of a licensed project, having a power production capacity of 5,000 kilowatts or less, and being located within the boundaries of the State of Alaska. The State of Alaska specifies that qualifying project works must not be located on Indian reservations, conservation system units, or designated Wild and Scenic Rivers. Nonqualifying project works that were previously licensed by the Commission can choose to be regulated by the State of Alaska. Projects on federal lands have separate considerations. The State of Alaska's regulatory program for projects located on reservations, conservation units, or public lands requires approval from the Secretary and consultation with relevant agencies. Federal laws on environmental and cultural resource protection still apply, and the state must notify the Commission of any significant regulatory program modifications. The Commission will periodically review Alaska's regulatory program for water-power development to ensure compliance. If the state fails to comply, the Commission will reassert its licensing and regulatory authority. Upon the Governor's application, the Commission will review the state's program within 30 days to determine compliance with requirements. The review must be completed within one year of initiation. The Commission will review Alaska's water-power development program to ensure compliance. If no final order is issued within 30 days, the state's program will be deemed compliant with requirements. SEC. 2 amends the Federal Power Act regarding licensing of hydroelectric projects in Hawaii. SEC. 3 provides a limited exemption for transmission facilities related to the El Vado hydroelectric project. SEC. 3 provides an exemption for the El Vado Hydroelectric project's transmission line facilities in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, described as a 12-mile long 69 kV power line connecting to the Northern Arriba Electric Cooperative Inc. switching station. The Federal Power Act is amended to allow for extensions of construction periods for up to ten years from the license issuance date, as long as it is not against the public interest. Licenses can only be revoked or altered with mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission after thirty days' public notice.
