The \"Advance Directives Improvement and Education Act of 2007\" highlights findings on end-of-life care, including the high number of deaths in institutions due to chronic illnesses and the importance of advance directives in upholding the right to refuse medical treatment. The prevalence of advance directives is 29 percent despite the Patient Self-Determination Act. Competent adults should complete advance care plans to protect their right to express their wishes. The purposes of this section are to improve access to information about individuals' health care options and legal rights for care near the end of life. Medicare coverage of end-of-life planning and consultations is aimed at promoting advance care planning and decision-making for individuals' wishes in case they are unable to communicate. This includes disseminating information about advance directives like living wills and durable powers of attorney for healthcare. Medicare covers end-of-life planning consultations to facilitate discussions between physicians and individuals regarding advance directives, the importance of comprehensive end-of-life plans, and available resources for determining state requirements. Improvement of Policies Related to the Use and Portability of Advance Directives includes amendments to Medicare regulations regarding the designation of a surrogate decision maker and the willingness of physicians to follow an individual's wishes as expressed in an advance directive. Effective from January 1, 2008, these changes aim to enhance end-of-life planning consultations and ensure the proper execution of advance directives.

The amendments to provider agreements and contracts under Medicare and State plans must be implemented within 1 year of the enactment of the Act, with a possible extension for State law amendments under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments made by paragraph (2), but failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session does not mean non-compliance with the title. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature. Increasing Awareness of the Importance of End-of-Life Planning is added to Title III of the Public Health Service Act by the State legislature. \"Part R introduces programs to raise awareness of advance directive planning issues, including education campaigns and information clearinghouses.\" The Secretary will conduct a national public education campaign to raise awareness about planning for care near the end of life, understanding health care wishes, the importance of advance directives, and the availability of hospice and palliative care. The Secretary will use funds to establish national and state-specific information clearinghouses on advance directives and end-of-life decisions through grants awarded to public or nonprofit entities for education campaigns and clearinghouse establishment. Grants will be awarded for a 3-year period. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $25,000,000 for this section. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on a national advance directive registry's feasibility, considering privacy constraints from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General will determine appropriate legislation and administrative action. Effective date of this section and its amendments will be upon enactment of the Act."
