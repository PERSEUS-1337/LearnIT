    "content": "The Act titled \"U.S. Agricultural Sector Relief Act of 2012\" ensures the availability of methyl bromide for critical uses. The Clean Air Act is amended to allow for critical use exemptions and emergency events related to the Montreal Protocol starting in 2013. The Clean Air Act amendment allows for critical use exemptions under the Montreal Protocol for the production, importation, and consumption of methyl bromide for approved critical uses determined by the Administrator. The amount necessary for the approved use must be provided in applications without denial or reduction by the Administrator. The Administrator can only reduce requested amounts of methyl bromide if there is evidence of feasible alternatives and this evidence is provided to the applicant in writing. When evaluating alternatives, technical and economic feasibility must be considered. When evaluating alternatives to methyl bromide, the Administrator considers cost, commercial availability, demonstrated effectiveness for the intended use, geographic effectiveness, and relevant regulations. In emergency events, the evaluation process is crucial. For emergency events, the Administrator allows the production, importation, and consumption of methyl bromide in the US in response to an emergency event, limited to the amount necessary for such use. The Administrator allows up to 20 metric tons of methyl bromide for use per emergency event at a specific location. The total amount allowed for use in the United States in a calendar year cannot exceed the amount authorized by the parties to the Montreal Protocol for critical uses in 2011. The Administrator must fulfill international obligations in accordance with the Montreal Protocol. The Administrator ensures availability of methyl bromide for research on alternatives in the agricultural sector and may adjust critical use nominations submitted to the Montreal Protocol if a suitable alternative is found. The Administrator may deny or reduce methyl bromide applications if a suitable alternative is available, as defined by approved critical use. The term 'critical use' refers to situations where there are no feasible alternatives to methyl bromide that are environmentally and economically acceptable for the crops involved. The term 'emergency event' refers to situations at farms, nurseries, food processing facilities, or commodities storage facilities where there is no critical use exemption for methyl bromide or insufficient quantities available. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must issue final regulations within 180 days of the enactment of this Act to allow the use of methyl bromide when no feasible alternative is available for pest or disease control. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must issue final regulations within 180 days to implement the amendment allowing the use of methyl bromide in response to emergency events. The regulations will include criteria for identifying emergency events and provisions to ensure timely approval or disapproval of applications for methyl bromide use."
