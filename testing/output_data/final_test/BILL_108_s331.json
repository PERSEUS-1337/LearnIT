Children placed in tribal custody are now eligible for foster care funding under the Social Security Act through programs operated by Indian Tribal Organizations. SEC. 479B outlines the programs operated by Indian Tribal Organizations. Indian tribes can operate programs under this part similar to how states do, with modifications to plan requirements including identifying service areas and approving foster homes based on tribal standards for child safety and accountability. The Indian tribe's per capita income is used to determine the Federal medical assistance percentage, based on the service population defined in its plan. The tribe can submit relevant information for consideration in the calculation. The Secretary considers relevant information for calculating the per capita income of Indian tribes. Regulations determine payment proportions, ensuring tribes receive no less than states. Tribes can use Federal or State funds to match payments under section 474. Upon request, other requirements can be modified. Upon request, the Secretary may modify requirements for Indian tribes to benefit children's safety. Intertribal consortiums can submit a joint plan. Cooperative agreements between tribes and states can be made for fund administration. Cooperative agreements between Indian tribes or intertribal consortiums and states incorporating specific provisions are valid and enforceable. Existing agreements remain in effect with the option to modify or revoke. The Secretary must establish regulations within a year in consultation with tribes. Definitions of 'Indian tribe' and 'tribal organization' align with the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act is amended by this section, with the changes taking effect immediately upon enactment of the Act."
