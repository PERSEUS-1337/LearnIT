    "content": "The Act titled \"International Peacekeeping Reform Act of 1997\" limits the use of funds for United Nations peacekeeping activities. The International Peacekeeping Reform Act of 1997 restricts the use of funds for United Nations peacekeeping operations unless the President certifies and notifies the appropriate congressional committees. The International Peacekeeping Reform Act of 1997 requires notification at least 15 days before any Security Council vote to establish, expand, or modify a peacekeeping operation. The notification must include a cost assessment and funding source for the United States share of the costs. If an emergency prevents the 15-day advance notification, the President can make a determination. The President must certify to Congress that a United Nations Peacekeeping operation meets specific requirements, including agreement from all parties involved in the conflict and seeking an enduring solution. The notification to Congress must be provided within 48 hours after the Security Council vote if it is in the direct national security interests of the United States. United Nations peacekeeping operations require the United States to contribute a share of the total cost in line with its regular budget share. Adequate measures must be taken to protect sensitive intelligence information provided to the UN. Participation of US Armed Forces in combat missions must directly advance national security interests. The participation of US Armed Forces in United Nations peacekeeping operations is crucial for success. These units will be under the operational command of the US Armed Forces and will have access to Geneva Convention protections if captured. Definitions include the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" referring to specific Senate and House committees. The term \"adequate measures\" in the context of protecting intelligence sources and methods must be as stringent as procedures maintained by nations the US regularly shares intelligence with. \"Direct combat\" is defined as engaging an enemy with weapons while being exposed to enemy fire and a high risk of capture."
