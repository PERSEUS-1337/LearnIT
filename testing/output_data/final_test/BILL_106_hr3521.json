    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Accountability for Regulatory Information Act of 2000\". Congress acknowledges the importance of Federal regulations in improving the quality of life for Americans but emphasizes the need to control regulatory costs and ensure proper implementation of laws by the executive branch. To fulfill its responsibilities, Congress requires accurate information for decision-making and highlights the ambiguity surrounding the legal impact of many Federal agency guidance documents not published in the Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 3. REPORTS ON REGULATORY ACTIONS BY THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE. After an agency publishes a regulatory action, a congressional committee may request the Comptroller General to review the action. The Comptroller General must provide a report on each selected regulatory action to the requesting committee within 180 days. The Comptroller General must provide an independent analysis of a regulatory action requested by a congressional committee within 60 days of the request or the end of the comment period. This analysis includes assessing the potential benefits of the action and identifying beneficiaries. The Comptroller General must analyze the potential costs and adverse effects of a regulatory action, identify those likely to bear the costs, assess alternative cost-effective approaches, consider the impact on State or local governments, and compare the results with the agency's analysis. The Comptroller General analyzes the agency's regulatory action, prioritizing requests for review on major rules. Federal agencies must cooperate by providing necessary records and information. Definitions in title 5, United States Code, are amended. The definitions in title 5, United States Code, are amended to include new terms such as 'independent analysis' and 'regulatory action'. The term 'regulatory action' now encompasses notice of proposed rule making, final rule making, and a rule. SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE OF NONBINDING EFFECT OF GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.\n\n    Agencies must include a notice on non-rule statements stating they have no general applicability or future effect and are not binding on the public.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    The General Accounting Office is authorized $5,200,000 annually from 2000 to 2003 for implementing chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment."
