    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Digital Coast Act of 2010\". The Congress finds that over half of the US population lives near a coast, with coastal counties having a higher population density. There is a significant amount of construction in these areas, but many coastal regions lack accurate mapping data. The Federal Government should develop innovative remote sensing techniques for coastal management, emergency preparedness, and homeland security. Accurate geospatial data is crucial for flood prediction, risk assessments, emergency response plans, and landscape change detection in coastal zones. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other agencies, can demonstrate the use of commercial remote sensing and geospatial capabilities for emergency preparedness, homeland security, and other applications like agriculture and weather forecasting. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"digital coast\" as a constituent-driven effort by NOAA for coastal and emergency management. It also defines \"remote sensing and other geospatial\" as collecting, storing, and disseminating data depicting Earth's features. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of the Coastal Services Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The term \"State\" includes states bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, Long Island Sound, the Great Lakes, as well as Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and other territories. The term \"State\" includes areas within 100 kilometers of the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, or Great Lakes. SEC. 4. COASTAL SERVICES CENTERS. The Secretary may establish coastal services centers to facilitate products and services for coastal and ocean decision-making. The purpose of these centers is to support the well-being of the coast, collaborate with various agencies, and address region-specific needs. The Secretary may enter into financial agreements to provide program support for non-Federal entities implementing the Act at local, State, and regional levels. This includes grants, cooperative agreements, interagency agreements, and contracts with Federal, tribal, State, and local entities. SEC. 5. REMOTE SENSING AND OTHER GEOSPATIAL DATA LAYERS. The Secretary will collect coastal data integrating various types such as bathymetric, elevation, land use maps, habitat mapping, parcel data, and socioeconomic data. Coordination with other federal efforts will be done to avoid duplication. The curr_chunk discusses the participation of various entities in establishing standards for remote sensing and geospatial data interoperability. This includes coastal States, local governments, federal agencies, and the private sector. The focus is on coordination and cooperation to ensure the effective use of such information. The curr_chunk involves coordinating with the Federal Geographic Data Committee and utilizing contracts with the private sector for collecting remote sensing and geospatial data. Authorization of appropriations of $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2016 is granted to the Secretary to carry out the Act."
