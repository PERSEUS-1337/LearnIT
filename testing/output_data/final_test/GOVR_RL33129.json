    "content": "Recent major flooding events have sparked debates on improving flood risk management and the roles of individuals, communities, and government levels. The federal system shares flood damage reduction functions among all levels of government, with local governments responsible for land use decisions. Federal, state, and local entities build and maintain levees, with the federal government funding flood and storm damage reduction measures, managing insurance programs, and providing disaster assistance. The federal government shares flood damage reduction functions with local governments. Levees are typically maintained by local levee districts, which are responsible for monitoring conditions during flooding and emergency response. If resources are exhausted, the state and then the Corps may provide assistance. Federal involvement in flood control began in the late 19th century after devastating floods in the Mississippi River basin. The Flood Control Act of 1936 declared federal flood control a national interest, recognizing the destructive impact of floods on the US rivers and the need for cooperation between the Federal Government, states, and localities for flood control on navigational waters. The Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries, including watersheds, for flood-control purposes if benefits exceed costs and lives are adversely affected. Local entities share construction costs of federal flood control projects and are responsible for operation and maintenance. Local entities control land use and zoning decisions in floodplains and coastal areas independently from the federal government. Federal and state actions aim to alter behavior to address flooding risks. Many local decision makers do not prioritize environmental hazards like flooding. The Corps and FEMA are key federal agencies involved in flood damage reduction. The Corps and FEMA are principal federal agencies involved in flood damage reduction and emergency response. Other federal agencies, such as the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the DOI's Bureau of Reclamation, also participate in flood damage reduction projects. The Corps is authorized by Congress to build levees and floodwalls to reduce damages from coastal and riverine flood hazards. They have constructed nearly 9,000 miles of the nation's levees and are responsible for much of the federal construction investment in flood control infrastructure. The Corps and FEMA are key federal agencies involved in flood damage reduction and emergency response. The Corps is authorized to build levees and floodwalls to reduce damages from coastal and riverine flood hazards. After construction, the infrastructure is typically handed over to local entities for operation and maintenance. FEMA has programs like the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to promote flood mitigation actions. The Corps retains responsibility for levees along the Mississippi River and multi-purpose dams. FEMA and the Corps conduct federal inspections of levees for participation in various programs. The Corps conducts annual or semi-annual inspections of levees for federal programs like the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program and FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. They also have emergency response authority for disaster assistance. The Corps conducts inspections of levees for federal programs and has emergency response authority for disaster assistance, including rehabilitation of flood control works, protection of shore protection works, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. FEMA can direct agencies to respond to flooding and other national emergencies as part of the National Response Framework. Flood risk includes vulnerability, levee and dam protection levels, reliability, and location. The 100-year flood standard is commonly used in the United States to identify and manage flood hazards based on the level of protection provided by levees and dams, threat of an event (e.g., Category 5 hurricane storm surge), and consequence of an event (e.g., property damage, loss of life). This standard was established in the late 1960s and is used by the NFIP and state/local governments for various requirements. The 100-year flood standard is a vulnerability standard used by agencies to protect against floods of reasonable probability. It guides perceptions of vulnerability and drives local floodplain management and infrastructure investments. The question of whether this standard results in an acceptable level of risk, especially for low probability, high consequence events like a Category 4 hurricane, remains largely unaddressed. The 100-year flood standard drives local floodplain management and infrastructure investments, creating equity in vulnerability across communities. However, this results in uneven levels of risk due to differences in consequences like loss of life, social disruption, and economic impact. The National Flood Insurance Program does not differentiate between flood protection from structures and natural topography, leading to exemptions for areas protected by levees and dams. While levees, dams, and flood control structures reduce flood risk, they do not eliminate vulnerability entirely. The residual flood risk behind these structures is often not considered in decision-making processes. This remaining risk exists due to the potential for structures to be overwhelmed by intense floods or to fail, leading to catastrophic consequences as seen during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Development behind levees and below dams can increase the damaging effects of floods. Development occurs behind levees and below dams, potentially due to the flood protection they provide. Overconfidence in structural flood protection increases the nation's risk in terms of lives lost, economic disruption, and property damage. Investments in flood control measures have led to a decreasing trend in lives lost to flooding since the 1920s, but property damage has been increasing. The federal government aims to promote flood-hazard awareness and damage-reducing practices through the NFIP. However, some stakeholders are concerned that structural flood control measures and the NFIP may contribute to a false sense of security. The 2008 midwestern floods and Hurricane Katrina have sparked a reevaluation of flood management approaches, questioning if current policies and investments effectively reduce national flood risk. Local governments play a significant role in managing floodplains and coastal development, making some aspects of national flood risk management challenging. Concerns exist that structural flood control measures and the NFIP may create a false sense of security, leading to increased vulnerability to flood losses. The challenges of national flood risk management include concerns about inequitable distribution of protection, potential lower levels of protection in some areas due to risk analysis, and insufficient information for adequate analysis. The federal government may prioritize reducing risks with national consequences, despite complications from changing conditions. Factors complicating the determination of the nation's flood risk include outdated flood control projects, changing risk factors over time, and incomplete information on consequences of failure for existing dams. Federal flood-related investments may involve structural and nonstructural flood management measures, such as shifting federal policy towards wise use of flood-prone areas, incorporating residual risk into federal programs, creating a national levee inventory program, promoting flood mitigation investments, re-evaluating flood control reservoir operations, and investing in technology for better understanding of flooding threats. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the importance of levee and flood wall reliability. Hurricane Katrina brought attention to levee and flood wall reliability, with a focus on protection levels for urban areas. A 1982 report noted that levee failures were common in flood disasters, indicating many locally built levees are poorly designed. The issue of addressing levee reliability and protection levels remains unresolved, with many levees built decades ago by landowners to reclaim land for agriculture. Many levees are operated by levee districts or local governments, with urban areas typically managed by municipalities and rural areas by special districts. Liability for flood damages may limit government interest in levee construction and maintenance. The uncertainty surrounding the implications of Paterno v. State of California, which held the state liable for a levee it did not build, is a major concern. Federal liability for flood damages related to Army Corps of Engineers projects is discussed in CRS Report RL34131. WRDA 2007 addressed policy changes and authorized flood and storm damage reduction projects, including provisions related to flood-related policies. The provision requires a national water resources planning policy to avoid unwise use of floodplains and update guidelines for Corps water projects by 2010. It also mandates a report on flood vulnerability and recommendations for improvements by 2010. Changes to Corps planning activities include economic analysis of flood projects, consideration of remaining risks, upstream and downstream impacts, and equitable analysis of alternatives. Safety Assurance Review is required for the design and construction of Corps flood and storm damage projects. The provision (\u00a72034) mandates independent expert review of Corps flood and storm damage reduction projects for public safety. The National Levee Safety Program (Title IV) establishes a Committee on Levee Safety to recommend a national levee safety program to Congress by mid-2008. The program requires the Corps to create a database of the nation's levees by 2009 and inspect federally constructed and other levees. Implementation of these changes may impact federal investment in flood and storm damage infrastructure and mitigation measures. The 2005 hurricane season and 2008 midwestern floods have reignited public concerns about flood issues. The devastation of recent events has sparked a national debate on the reliability of aging flood control infrastructure. Concerns include the acceptable level of risk, who should bear the costs, protection for urban populations, economic infrastructure, investing in natural buffers, equity for low-income populations, flood insurance, and federal, state, and local investment in flood damage reduction measures. The response to recent major flood events includes discussions on expanding mitigation activities, investing in natural flood and storm surge attenuation, and maintaining existing flood control structures. The 110th Congress faces challenges in consensus on incremental policy changes due to the diverse constituencies affected by federal flood policy and the division of congressional committee jurisdictions over flood mitigation programs. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina raised questions about flood mitigation, protection, and response. More information is needed to evaluate flood risk, understand structural flood protection reliability, and incorporate all flood consequences into decision-making at local, state, and federal levels."
