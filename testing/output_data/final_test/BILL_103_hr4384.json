    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Educational Quality Index Act of 1994\". The Congress acknowledges that cohort default rates do not fully reflect the quality of an educational institution. It is important to consider the population served by the institution, especially those from less affluent backgrounds who may struggle with default rate standards. The use of cohort default rates has hindered technical and vocational schools from opening in impoverished areas, denying individuals in these areas access to higher education opportunities. The performance of technical or vocational higher education institutions can be evaluated based on objective student outcome data. SEC. 3. USE OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IN INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR GUARANTEED STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. Section 435(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new paragraph (4) regarding ineligibility based on educational quality index for proprietary institutions of higher education. This new provision replaces the cohort default rate with an educational quality index for determining eligibility. The Secretary of Education will prescribe an educational quality index to evaluate proprietary institutions of higher education, consisting of a placement rate index and a Pell grant eligibility index. The Secretary of Education will define regulations for evaluating proprietary institutions of higher education based on various indices including Pell grant eligibility, cohort default rate, and successful completion rates. The Secretary of Education will establish criteria for proprietary institutions of higher education to maintain eligibility for federal programs, based on 4 indexes with specific weight allocations. The Secretary of Education will allocate specific weights to different subparagraphs for proprietary institutions of higher education to maintain eligibility for federal programs and establish procedures for score determination and dispute resolution. The Secretary of Education will assign weights to different criteria for proprietary institutions of higher education to qualify for federal programs. An educational quality index score below the minimum set by the Secretary will trigger program integrity reviews."
