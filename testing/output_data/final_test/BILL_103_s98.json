    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Link-up for Learning Grant Act\". Growing numbers of children live in conditions that increase the risk of academic failure, with over 20% living in poverty. The social support infrastructure for these children has eroded, leading to issues like lack of free meals, health insurance, and public housing. Many at-risk students suffer from inadequate nutrition, health care, unsafe living conditions, and various forms of abuse. Children facing various challenges such as substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, involuntary migration, and limited English proficiency encounter barriers to learning. Factors like single-parent households, disadvantaged backgrounds, and fragmented services for at-risk students contribute to reduced parental involvement and limited resources for education. Additionally, a significant number of children are recent immigrants or children of immigrants with unmet educational needs. Services for at-risk students are fragmented, expensive, overregulated, often ineffective, and duplicative. School personnel and support service providers lack knowledge and access to available services, face bureaucratic obstacles, and have few resources to coordinate services. Service providers are trained in separate institutions and practice in separate agencies, hindering coordination and integration of services. The coordination and integration of services for at-risk students can help break the cycle of poverty and academic failure. It is cost-effective for schools and support agencies, reducing duplication and improving service quality. The purposes of the coordination and integration of services for at-risk students are outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to provide demonstration grants to improve the educational performance of at-risk students by removing barriers to learning, enhancing support services, increasing parental involvement, and focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies. The Act aims to foster planning, coordination, and collaboration among various agencies and levels of government to improve the educational performance of at-risk students by removing obstacles, improving communication, creating joint funding pools, providing cross-training, and increasing parental and community involvement in education.
