SEC. 205. INDIRECT COSTS. SEC. 205. INDIRECT COSTS. Matching funds required by the Academic Research Facilities Modernization Act of 1988 are not considered facilities costs for indirect cost rate purposes. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will prepare a report on reducing federal assistance for indirect costs to institutions of higher education by 10% and minimizing variance among indirect cost rates by December 31, 1995. The Foundation will follow guidelines from Important Notice No. 91 regarding research instrumentation. Financial disclosure rules apply to temporary employees.

The student has the option to credit tuition and fees to the next semester after termination of educational military leave. Prohibition of lobbying activities is also enforced. The Act prohibits the use of funds for activities influencing legislation, but allows communication with Congress for necessary legislation or appropriations. Additionally, the Science Studies Institute is established. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 1991 is amended to change the name of the Critical Technologies Institute to the Science Studies Institute and make other revisions to subsections. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 1991 is amended to rename the Critical Technologies Institute to the Science Studies Institute and revise subsections by emphasizing the development and maintenance of informational and analytical tools, focusing on the Federal science and technology research portfolio, and initiating studies for ensuring the long-term strength of the United States in science and technology. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 1991 is amended to rename the Critical Technologies Institute to the Science Studies Institute and revise subsections related to the development and application of science and technology, emphasizing appropriate roles for different entities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 1991 renames the Critical Technologies Institute to the Science Studies Institute and assigns the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy as the sponsor of the Institute. All references to the Critical Technologies Institute in Federal law or regulations are now considered references to the Science Studies Institute. The Congress finds that federal research funds to higher education institutions may prioritize research over teaching and narrow graduate programs. National Science Foundation funds should enhance the quality of education. Grants from NSF should consider the impact on undergraduate and graduate education.
