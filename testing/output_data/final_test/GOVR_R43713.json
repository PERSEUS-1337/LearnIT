    "content": "The NLRA establishes labor-management relations in the private sector, granting workers the right to join unions and bargain collectively. Employers must negotiate in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. Certain activities are deemed unfair labor practices. The NLRA does not cover all private sector workers, excluding agricultural, domestic, supervisory, and independent contractor roles. It also does not apply to railroad or airline employees, who fall under the Railway Labor Act, or government employees, who are covered by other statutes. Most federal employees are covered by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), while state and local government employees are covered by state or local laws. Public employees in most states have the right to engage in collective bargaining, which may be limited to certain employees. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is enforced by the NLRB, consisting of a five-member Board and a General Counsel who handle objections to elections, bargaining unit composition, and unfair labor practices. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) oversees regional offices, appoints Board members, and conducts secret ballot elections for union representation. Unions can be certified through majority employee support in elections or voluntary recognition by employers. Petitions for elections can be filed by unions, workers, or employers, with a minimum requirement of 30% worker support. The NLRB oversees elections for union representation. A union can be certified if a majority of employees vote for representation. If an agreement on the election is not reached, a hearing may be held. The NLRB conducts elections for union representation. If a union is certified after winning a secret ballot election, it is protected for a year from decertification or another union's election petition. A decertification petition requires at least 30% of employees' signatures in the bargaining unit. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain in good faith for a year, but reaching an agreement on a contract is not mandatory. The NLRB conducts elections for union representation and protects a certified union for a year. If no contract agreement is reached after a reasonable period, an employer may withdraw recognition based on objective information. Bargaining subjects are categorized as mandatory, permissive, and illegal. Employers and unions must bargain in good faith over wages, hours, and working conditions, including benefits like health insurance and pensions. Other conditions of employment include work schedules, layoffs, discipline procedures, promotions, and grievance processes. An employer's code of ethics is also a mandatory bargaining subject. Mandatory subjects of bargaining include employer code of ethics and drug/alcohol testing of current employees. Permissive subjects are those that either party may propose, such as bargaining unit definition and selection of representatives. Illegal subjects, like discrimination based on race, cannot be bargained over. The NLRA prohibits unfair labor practices, such as employers interfering with employees' right to form or join a union. This includes threats of job loss, plant closure, wage increases to discourage unionization, and discrimination based on union activities. Employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively, but unions cannot coerce or threaten employees to join. Unions are also prohibited from causing discrimination or boycotting employers. Unfair labor practice charges can be filed by various parties, and the NLRB investigates to determine violations. When a union and employer cannot agree on a collective bargaining agreement, it is called an impasse. This may lead to a strike or lockout. A neutral third party can help them reach an agreement. If they cannot agree on a mandatory bargaining subject, the union may strike or the employer may lock out employees. The NLRA prohibits employers from locking out employees or unions from striking if they cannot agree on a permissive bargaining subject. Changes in mandatory subjects require consent from both parties, with notification and bargaining necessary. If an agreement is reached on a permissive subject, it becomes binding. After a contract expires, unilateral changes can be made on permissive subjects. The purpose of the NLRA is to remedy violations, not punish parties. The Board can issue orders in representation and unfair labor practice cases. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can issue orders in representation and unfair labor practice cases, but lacks the authority to enforce compliance. If an employer or union fails to comply, the Board can seek enforcement through a U.S. court of appeals. Judicial review of Board decisions is limited in representation cases, but can be appealed in unfair labor practice cases, with potential review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Only final orders of the Board are subject to judicial review. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can issue orders in representation and unfair labor practice cases, including cease and desist orders and reinstatement of fired employees. The President may take emergency action in cases affecting national health or safety. In January 2014, Northwestern University football players filed a petition seeking representation by CAPA, arguing that college athletes are essentially employees due to their time commitment, revenue generation, and receipt of compensation. The organizing effort by Northwestern University football players, supported by a majority of players, aims to establish their employee status for collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. The NLRB evaluates employment status based on control by the employer and economic dependence. Congressional intent was also considered in a 2004 case involving graduate student assistants. The NLRB evaluated whether graduate student assistants should be considered employees under the NLRA, citing the Brown University case. Northwestern University football players sought employee status for collective bargaining rights, with the regional director ruling in their favor based on the common law definition of an employee. The regional director ruled in favor of Northwestern University football players, stating that they met the common law definition of an employee based on their recruitment, treatment, and control exercised by the school and coaches. The \"tender\" signed by players before each scholarship period was considered an employment contract, outlining compensation details and daily itineraries for football-related activities. The regional director ruled in favor of Northwestern University football players, stating that they are considered employees due to their recruitment, treatment, and control by the school and coaches. The players' scholarships are seen as payment for their athletic services, with football-related duties not related to their academic studies. Northwestern requested a review of the decision, citing unique issues and misapplication of Board precedent. The Board agreed to review the regional director's decision in favor of Northwestern University football players being considered employees. If CAPA becomes the players' exclusive representative, they plan to bargain over health and safety issues, financial support, and health insurance within NCAA rules. Northwestern believes CAPA may negotiate pay and economic benefits if certified. The university may face unfair labor practice charges if it refuses to negotiate mandatory subjects of bargaining. However, negotiating economic benefits could result in NCAA sanctions. Northwestern cannot offer scholarships exceeding NCAA limits, as it could lead to football ineligibility. The university argues that NCAA rules restrict bargaining on player image rights, off-campus housing leases, outside employment, and drug testing. If players are deemed employees, it could impact unionization efforts at private colleges. The NCAA rules limit financial aid for Division I student-athletes at private colleges and universities. A full grant-in-aid covers tuition, fees, room and board, and required books, but the cost of attendance may include additional expenses. Student-athletes can receive financial assistance up to the cost of attendance. In 2014, a court decision allowed NCAA Division I FBS and basketball schools to use revenue from certain activities. Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Division I basketball schools can use player's names, images, or likenesses revenue for financial aid up to cost of attendance. They can also provide up to $5,000 annually for licensing. NCAA will appeal the ruling. NCAA Division I Board of Directors adopted new governing structure for colleges. Five conferences can adopt new rules affecting student athletes. The five conferences in the NCAA can now increase grant-in-aid up to full cost of attendance for student athletes. They can also offer multi-year scholarships, health insurance, disability insurance, transportation for campus visits, adjust time limits for sports, increase academic support, and allow athletes to earn money from non-sports activities. Each of the 65 schools will have one vote on rule changes, with 15 student-athlete representatives also able to vote. The first votes on rule changes could occur in January. The NCAA rule changes allow for votes by Division I schools, with a possibility of reconsideration if requested by a certain number of schools. Revenue sports like football and men's basketball support non-revenue sports. Division I football is split into FBS and FCS, with Northwestern University being one of the private colleges in FBS. Division I men's basketball has 346 teams, with 115 of them being private four-year colleges or universities. FBS schools must have at least 16 varsity sports teams and can provide financial aid to 85 football players. FCS schools must sponsor at least 14 varsity sports teams and can award up to 63 full football scholarships. FBS schools participate in bowl games, while the FCS uses a playoff system to determine a champion. There are 115 private four-year colleges in Division I men's basketball and 46 in FCS football."
