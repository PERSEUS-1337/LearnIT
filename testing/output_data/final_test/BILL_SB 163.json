    "title": "SB 163",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1271.5 of the Penal Code mandates that a person charged with a criminal offense must appear before a court or magistrate for a hearing. The court can then decide to release the person on their own recognizance, impose conditions for release, temporarily detain them for various reasons, or detain them as necessary. The court can order pretrial release on recognizance or an unsecured bond with conditions to not commit crimes. The person must seek employment, attend educational programs, and follow restrictions if necessary for public safety. The court may impose various conditions on pretrial release, including restrictions on personal associations, contact with victims or witnesses, reporting to law enforcement agencies, complying with curfew, refraining from possessing weapons or drugs, and undergoing necessary treatment for public safety. Upon failing to appear as required, the court may require the person to forfeit property or execute a bail bond with sureties. Other conditions may include returning to custody for specified hours and satisfying any necessary conditions for safety and appearance. In cases involving sexual assault of a minor or failure to register as a sex offender, release conditions may include electronic monitoring and specific safety measures. Financial conditions for pretrial detention are only allowed to ensure the person's appearance. The court can modify release conditions as needed. The court can order detention for up to 10 days if a person on release pending trial, sentencing, or parole is deemed a flight risk or a danger to others. If a person is deemed a flight risk or poses a danger to others, they may be detained before trial if no conditions can ensure their appearance and the safety of others. Bail may be set in certain cases as per California Constitution. The court or magistrate must hold a hearing to determine the appropriate release conditions for a person, considering their appearance and the safety of others. The hearing should happen promptly unless a continuance is requested, with the person having the right to legal representation. The court must state the facts supporting their decision on the record. The court or magistrate may reopen a hearing before or after a determination if new information is found that has a material impact on the conditions for the person's appearance and safety. The court must consider all available information when determining these conditions. The court considers various factors when determining conditions for a person's appearance and safety, including the nature of the offense, weight of evidence, and the person's history and characteristics. This includes their character, physical and mental condition, criminal history, and whether they were on probation or parole at the time of the offense. The court issues orders with specific conditions for a person's release, including penalties for violations and consequences for non-compliance. Advisements also cover penalties for intimidating witnesses, obstructing investigations, and retaliating against informants. A detention order issued under subdivision (e) must include written findings and reasons for detention, direct the person to a separate county jail, and allow for private consultation with counsel. An \"unsecured appearance bond\" releases a person with a promise to appear in court and pay a specified amount if they fail to appear. Section 13557.5 is added to the Water Code. Section 13557.5 of the Water Code declares it wasteful to discharge treated wastewater into the ocean or bay without beneficial reuse. By January 1, 2020, regulations will be in place for NPDES permit holders to submit plans for beneficial reuse of treated wastewater by January 1, 2023. By January 1, 2033, NPDES permit holders must beneficially reuse at least 50% of treated wastewater instead of discharging it through ocean or bay outfalls. Regulations will allow flexibility for emergencies, maintenance, extreme weather, and other factors. An advisory group may provide recommendations for implementing this section. The state board may adopt reasonable fees for NPDES permit holders to cover administrative costs, in accordance with the California Constitution."
