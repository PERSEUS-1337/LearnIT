It is the only procedure by which a majority of House Members can secure consideration of a measure against committee opposition. The House of Representatives' \"discharge rule\" allows measures to be brought to the floor for consideration without committee approval, providing a way to bypass the gatekeeping function of committees in shaping the congressional agenda. Special rules can also direct unreported measures to be taken up on the floor, allowing for consideration even over opposition. The discharge procedure in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. A discharge motion requires support from a majority of the House membership, and can only be initiated after a measure has been in committee for at least 30 legislative days without action. Members typically wait to file a petition until it is clear the committee will not act. Private bills are excluded from the discharge rule. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. Members can obtain a petition form at the Clerk's desk in the House chamber to gather signatures. Once 218 signatures are obtained, the motion is entered on the Discharge Calendar. The process usually takes months, but on rare occasions, the necessary signatures were gathered in one day. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. Once 218 signatures are obtained on a petition, the motion is entered on the Discharge Calendar. The motion can only be offered on a \"discharge day\" and is debatable for 20 minutes before a simple majority vote can discharge the committee. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. Once 218 signatures are obtained on a petition, the motion is entered on the Discharge Calendar. Any further action under the discharge rule is precluded for any measure on the same subject during the same session of Congress. A discharge motion that never comes to the floor may still serve proponents' purposes, as a committee may sometimes respond by reporting the measure on its own initiative. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. Once 218 signatures are obtained on a petition, the motion is entered on the Discharge Calendar. The petition may be filed directly on the unreported measure or on a special rule for its consideration. The committee of referral can nullify the discharge attempt by reporting the measure before all signatures are obtained. If the measure is referred to more than one committee, it remains unlikely to reach the floor unless the reporting committee takes action. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. If a measure is referred to multiple committees, it remains eligible for action under the discharge rule until all committees report it. Once 218 signatures are obtained, the House may adopt the discharge motion to bring up the measure for consideration. The discharge rule in the House of Representatives allows measures to be brought to the floor without committee approval. If a measure is referred to multiple committees, it remains eligible for action under the discharge rule until all committees report it. Once 218 signatures are obtained, the House may adopt the discharge motion to bring up the measure for consideration. House Rules mandate that money bills be considered in the Committee of the Whole, allowing open rule for amendments. Non-money bills can be considered by the House if discharged. The House considers measures not classified as \"money bills\" under the \"one-hour rule,\" allowing for debate and potential amendments. If the House orders the previous question, a vote is taken on the measure without amendments. If the previous question is defeated, a Member can offer an amendment and move the previous question on both the amendment and the measure. This method of discharge does not allow for flexibility in terms of consideration and amendment. Another method of discharge was added in 1931 to address these limitations. In 1931, a method of discharge was added to House Rules to address limitations in the one-hour rule. This method became more common in the mid-1990s. A Member must draft a special rule as a House resolution to consider a specified measure even if unreported. The special rule cannot allow non-germane amendments or consider more than one measure. If the Rules Committee does not report the resolution after seven legislative days, a petition can be filed to discharge the committee. If the petition gets 218 signatures, the motion on a discharge day is to discharge the Rules Committee from the resolution. The discharge process allows a Member to bring a specified measure to the House floor if the Rules Committee does not report the resolution after seven legislative days. If the motion to discharge is adopted, the House can proceed to consider the resolution under the one-hour rule. This method enables supporters of a measure to propose terms for its consideration and amendment. The discharge process allows a Member to bring a specified measure to the House floor if the Rules Committee does not report the resolution after seven legislative days. A special rule for such purposes normally provides that consideration continue on subsequent days, if necessary, until a final vote, preventing the leadership from regaining control of the agenda. This approach also prevents the committee of jurisdiction from nullifying the discharge effort by reporting the measure and then taking no steps to call it up. The House Rules protect against attempts to block a discharge effort by the Rules Committee. If a special rule is reported but not called up within seven days, any member can request its consideration. If the special rule is reported adversely, a Member can still call it up on a discharge day. This process may require Members to draft the special rule early. Members may need to draft flexible terms for consideration early in the process to accommodate unforeseen circumstances when seeking to discharge the Rules Committee from a special rule. The Rules Committee can become an obstacle to consideration if it declines to report a special rule for a measure already reported by the committee of jurisdiction. This was more common before the mid-1960s. Before the mid-1960s, the Rules Committee was not always an organ of leadership in managing the agenda, leading to the need for alternative methods of discharge. In some cases, Members have used a special rule to seek discharge, as seen in the 107th Congress with campaign finance legislation. The Rules Committee cannot nullify a discharge attempt but has taken actions to regain control of the floor agenda after a discharge petition receives the required signatures. The Rules Committee has sometimes reported its own special rule instead of the requested discharge rule, allowing the House to consider a measure under terms preferred by the committee rather than the discharge supporters. This approach ensures House consideration of the subject while maintaining leadership control. The Rules Committee may report a special rule identical to the discharge rule sought by proponents, allowing the leadership to maintain control over the schedule and terms of action on the floor. However, discharge proponents still have the option to defeat the committee's special rule and call up their discharge motion on a subsequent discharge day. This process can sometimes lead to a negotiated agreement on the terms of consideration by unanimous consent. The House Committee on Rules may discharge a special rule similar to the discharge rule requested by proponents, allowing the leadership to control the schedule and terms of action on the floor. Proponents can still defeat the committee's special rule and bring up their discharge motion on a subsequent discharge day, sometimes leading to a negotiated agreement on consideration by unanimous consent."
