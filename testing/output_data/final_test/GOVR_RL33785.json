    "content": "Runaway and homeless youth face numerous challenges, including high-risk behaviors, victimization, untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. They also struggle with poor health and lack of basic provisions. Concerns about the vulnerabilities of this population were raised in the 1970s by Congress due to increased awareness about these issues. The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 was enacted to assist runaway youth through specific services. It has since been updated to provide support for homeless youth as well. The Act authorizes federal funding for three programs: the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program, collectively known as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP) consists of three programs funded by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Basic Center Program offers crisis intervention, temporary shelter, counseling, and aftercare services to runaway and homeless youth under 18. The Transitional Living Program provides stable residential services for homeless youth aged 16-22, focusing on life skills, education, job attainment, and interpersonal skills. The Street Outreach Program provides funding for outreach, education, counseling, and referrals for runaway, homeless, and street youth at risk of exploitation. The report discusses challenges in defining the homeless youth population and federal efforts to support them. The report discusses federal policies and programs for runaway and homeless youth, focusing on the period from the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 to the present. It includes information on the Basic Center, Transitional Living, and Street Outreach programs created from the act, as well as funding details. The appendixes cover funding for the BCP program and other federal programs that can assist homeless youth. The Transitional Living Program (TLP) serves homeless youth aged 16-22 who cannot live safely with relatives and lack alternative arrangements. Runaway youth are under 18 and leave home without permission. The McKinney-Vento Act provides federal programs for homeless individuals, including unaccompanied youth. HUD defines unaccompanied youth for selected programs. The HUD regulation defines \"unaccompanied youth\" as individuals under 25 who meet the criteria of being homeless. Research suggests that there is overlap between categories of runaway, homeless, and street youth, and that typologies based on mental health or age cohort may be more accurate. Further research is needed in this area. Further research is needed to ensure accurate typologies for homeless and runaway youth, as their exact numbers are unknown due to their mobility and reluctance to report their status. The lack of standardized methodology and inconsistent definitions of homelessness further complicate counting this population, with differences in data collection methods impacting reported characteristics. According to researchers, prevalence estimates of youth homelessness may be biased towards those experiencing longer periods of homelessness. HUD requires annual point-in-time counts of homeless individuals, including youth in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and on the streets. In the 2018 count, 36,361 unaccompanied youth under 25 were identified, along with 8,724 homeless youth parents. PIT counts do not provide a precise estimate of youth homelessness. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act authorized funding for studies on youth homelessness, including a national study conducted by HUD using $2 million. The study, known as Voices of Youth Count, used a phone survey to derive national estimates. Voices of Youth Count conducted a phone survey to estimate youth homelessness, finding that approximately 700,000 youth ages 13 to 17 and 3.5 million young adults ages 18 to 25 had experienced homelessness within a one-year period. The study included individuals sleeping in places not meant for human habitation, staying in shelters, or temporarily staying with others without a safe living arrangement. Youth homelessness affected both rural and urban areas at similar levels. The study on the lifetime prevalence of running away among young people aged 12 to 18 found that 19% ran away before turning 18, with females more likely than males to run away. Black youth had the highest rate of running away compared to white and Hispanic youth. On average, youth who ran away did so about three times, with half of runaways only doing so once. Approximately half of the youth ran away before age 14. In FY2017, over 500 children in the United States ran away from foster care or other placements, with older youth being more prone to running away. A study of 50,000 youth aged 13-17 in 21 states showed that 17% ran away during their first time in foster care, with females, black, and Hispanic youth being more likely to run away. Youth were more prone to running away from congregate care settings and from socioeconomically disadvantaged counties. Among youth surveyed in FY2015 at age 21, about 43% reported experiencing homelessness, often due to family conflict. Poor family dynamics, sexual activity, pregnancy, school problems, and substance use are predictors of family discord. One-third of callers to the National Runaway Safeline in 2017 cited family issues. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program found that family dynamics were a key reason for youth running away. Family instability, including child maltreatment and lack of parental warmth, increased the likelihood of youth running away. Other factors like school engagement and neighborhood cohesiveness were not strong predictors of youth running away. The Voices of Youth Count study identified reasons why youth ran away from foster care, including reconnecting with biological families, asserting autonomy, and maintaining relationships. Certain youth aged 18 to 25, such as those with lower education levels, Hispanic or black youth, and LGBTQ youth, were at higher risk of homelessness. LGBTQ young adults had more than double the risk of homelessness compared to their peers. LGBTQ young adults aged 18 to 25 have over twice the risk of homelessness compared to heterosexual peers. LGBTQ youth account for 20% of homeless young adults, often due to being kicked out of their homes. A study in seven cities found that the most common reason for LGBTQ youth homelessness was being asked to leave their home. Under an HHS grant, 18 grantees evaluated various risk factors for homelessness among child welfare-involved populations, including multiple foster care placements, running away from foster care, mental health diagnoses, substance abuse history, and juvenile justice involvement. Homeless youth, especially those with a history of substance abuse and foster care, are vulnerable to mental health disorders, drug use, and exploitation. Studies show they are more likely to experience these issues compared to the general population. High prevalence of depression, trauma, and substance abuse is reported among homeless youth. Runaway and homeless youth, particularly those living on the streets, face a higher risk of substance abuse and violence. They are vulnerable to sexual exploitation, trafficking, and other forms of victimization. Some resort to illegal activities for survival, such as stealing and selling drugs. These youth also report challenges like poor health and lack of basic provisions. Federal policy prior to the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 provided limited services to this population. The 1970s saw a shift in policy towards assisting runaway and homeless youth, with a focus on a rehabilitative model. The Runaway Youth Act of 1974 decriminalized runaway youth and funded programs for shelter and counseling. Congress and the President have since expanded services for runaway and homeless youth. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, part of federal efforts to end youth homelessness, is coordinated through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). Established under the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, USICH includes federal agencies like HHS and HUD. The HEARTH Act of 2009 charged USICH with developing a National Strategic Plan to End Homelessness, released in June 2010 as \"Opening Doors.\" The USICH released the plan \"Opening Doors\" in June 2010, with goals to end homelessness by specific deadlines. In 2012, the plan was amended to focus on improving educational outcomes for children and youth, including unaccompanied homeless youth. A guiding document called the \"Framework to End Youth Homelessness\" was developed in 2013 to collect better data on youth experiencing homelessness. The data strategy aims to improve data collection on youth homelessness by coordinating RHYMIS with HMIS. Grantees now report basic demographics, services received, and youth status to HMIS instead of RHYMIS. The data strategy aims to improve data collection on youth homelessness by coordinating RHYMIS with HMIS. Some grantees have encountered issues with software programming and data extraction for reporting to HHS. Funding permitting, a national study may be designed to estimate the number and needs of homeless youth, aligning with the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act's directive. HHS has supported research on homeless youth, including the Voices of Youth Count study funded by FY2016 HUD appropriations. USICH identified gaps in data on homeless youth in 2018. The USICH issued a brief outlining gaps in data on homeless youth and a strategy to end youth homelessness. They provided guidance to communities and called for more evidence on the impact of interventions. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau within HHS. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorizes $127.4 million for the Basic Center Program and Transitional Living program in FY2019 and FY2020. 90% of funds must be used for these programs, with 45% for BCP and up to 55% for TLP. The remaining funds support a national communication system, training, evaluations, federal coordination efforts, and other related activities. The Street Outreach program is authorized $25 million for FY2019 and FY2020. Funding for the periodic estimate of youth homelessness is as needed for the same years. Funding levels for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program have increased three times from FY2006 to FY2019, with Congress providing guidance on spending the additional funds. In FY2019, Congress allocated additional funds for the Basic Center Program to support current grantees until new awards are made or until the end of the fiscal year. The program offers short-term shelter and services for at-risk youth and their families through public and private community-based organizations. Eligible youth include those at risk of homelessness or who have already left home. The Basic Center Program provides short-term shelter and services for at-risk youth under age 18, or older if permitted by state law. Services include family connection, counseling, healthcare, education, and employment assistance. The program aims to prevent involvement in law enforcement, juvenile justice, child welfare, and mental health systems. In FY2018, 280 BCP shelters served 23,288 youth. The Basic Center Program (BCP) funded 280 shelters in FY2018 for at-risk youth, providing services and coordinating with various systems. Grantees must contact parents, establish relationships with different agencies, maintain records, and submit annual reports to HHS. Funding is allocated directly to grantees for a three-year period. Funding for the Basic Center Program is distributed directly to grantees for a three-year period based on the proportion of youth in each jurisdiction. States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico receive a minimum of $200,000 each, while territories like American Samoa and Guam receive a minimum of $70,000. Priority is given to applicants with experience in serving runaway and homeless youth, and any unobligated funds are reallocated to other states. In FY2008, HHS funded a three-year Rural Host Homes Demonstration Project to expand BCP shelter and support services to rural runaway and homeless youth. Grantees provided shelter and preventive services to 781 youth, with 411 receiving shelter and 370 receiving preventive services without shelter. The project aimed to help youth become self-sufficient adults. The Transitional Living Program provides longer-term shelter and assistance for youth ages 16 through 22 who may have family conflict or have left their homes. Pregnant and/or parenting youth are eligible for TLP services. In FY2017, the program served 3,517 youth, and in FY2018, it funded 229 organizations. Each grantee can shelter up to 20 youth in various sites for up to 540 days. Youth ages 16 through 22 can stay in the program for up to 635 days. The Transitional Living Program allows youth ages 16 through 22 to stay in the program for up to 635 days under exceptional circumstances. Services provided include life-skills training, parenting support, educational opportunities, job preparation, and health care services. Grantees must develop a plan to help youth transition to independent living. The Transitional Living Program helps youth transition to independent living by providing services such as life-skills training, parenting support, and educational opportunities. Grantees refer youth to other systems for additional support and submit annual reports to HHS. The Bush Administration proposed funding maternity group homes for pregnant and parenting teens as part of the program. Increased funds were allocated to serve this population, enabling them to access TLP services. The 2003 amendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act allowed TLP funds to be used for adult-supervised transitional living arrangements for pregnant or parenting women aged 16 to 21 and their children. Organizations receiving TLP grants provide parenting skills, child development education, family budgeting, and health and nutrition education. HHS distributes TLP grants competitively to public and private organizations for a five-year period, with grantees required to contribute at least 10% of the program's total cost. HHS is conducting a study on the long-term outcomes of 1,250 youth who have utilized TLP services. The study aims to describe outcomes and identify factors contributing to the success or challenges of Transitional Living Program (TLP) services for homeless youth. It includes process and impact evaluations, with youth randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Key questions include program operations, types of services delivered, long-term housing outcomes, and interventions leading to positive outcomes for TLP participants. The pilot study by HHS faced challenges in collecting data from a large sample size of youth for the Transitional Living Program (TLP). In FY2016, HHS initiated the Transitional Living Program Special Population Demonstration project, funding nine grantees to test approaches for LGBTQ runaway and homeless youth, and young adults leaving foster care. Grantees were expected to provide strategies to help youth build protective factors like connections with schools, employment, and supportive adults. A process evaluation will assess how grantees are implementing the program. In FY2009, HHS started the Support Systems for Rural Homeless Youth Demonstration Project, providing grants to six states to support Transitional Living Programs (TLPs) for youth. HHS separately funded the 3/40 Blueprint project from FY2012 to FY2014 to enhance TLPs in serving LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The project aimed to develop innovative intervention strategies, culturally appropriate tools, and better understand the needs of LGBTQ youth served by RHY providers. The University of Illinois at Chicago created a website to share promising practices and challenges faced by LGBTQ homeless youth. The Systems for Rural Homeless Youth Demonstration Project provided grants to six states to support Transitional Living Programs for young adults in rural communities. The project aimed to offer survival support, community engagement, and education/employment services. Each state received annual grants of $200,000 and engaged youth in positive activities while raising awareness about rural homelessness. The Street Outreach Program provides services for runaway and homeless youth, focusing on treatment, counseling, crisis intervention, and education activities to help them transition to safe living arrangements. The program addresses the lack of housing and transportation as critical barriers for these youth. The Family and Youth Services Bureau's Street Outreach Program provides education, referrals, and support for homeless and runaway youth. Grantees must contribute 10% of funds for the program. In FY2018, 96 grantees were funded, and in FY2017, they made contact with 24,366 youth. A data collection project in 2012 aimed to understand the needs of these youth better. Findings showed that participants faced challenges with substance abuse, mental health, and trauma, with a strong need for job training and transportation assistance. The study found that youth in need of job training, transportation assistance, and clothing faced barriers to obtaining shelter, such as shelters being full and lack of transportation. Researchers suggested more emergency shelters and intensive case management for youth on the streets. HHS funds the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center to provide support to grantees. RHYTTAC is a national youth outreach program that educates young people about the dangers of running away. It provides training, resources, and assistance to RHYP grantees, including a national communications system called the National Runaway Safeline. The Safeline, formerly known as the National Runaway Switchboard, provides counseling, referrals, and communication services to homeless and runaway youth. Funded through grants, it operates in Chicago and offers 24-hour referrals to resources like shelters and legal assistance. In 2017, it handled nearly 30,000 contacts with youth. The Safeline, previously known as the National Runaway Switchboard, offers counseling and communication services to homeless and runaway youth. It handles contacts with youth via phone, computer, emails, and postings, with most calls from youth themselves. The \"Home Free\" program provides bus tickets for youth ages 12 to 21 to return home or to an alternative placement near their home. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 mandated evaluations of RHYP grantees through the Runaway and Homeless Youth Monitoring System. The Youth Act of 2008 mandated HHS to issue rules specifying performance standards for BCP, TLP, and SOP grant recipients. HHS implemented final rules in December 2016 to monitor grantee performance. The Senate HELP and House Education and Labor Committees oversee the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, with HHS submitting biennial reports on grantee activities and evaluations. The most recent report was submitted in January 2018. The 2003 and 2008 reauthorization laws mandated HHS to submit reports to Congress on strategies to end youth homelessness and conduct studies on runaway and homeless youth. The Voices of Youth Count study, funded by HUD, provides insights into this population. The 2008 law mandated the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the process for organizations applying for BCP, TLP, and SOP grants. GAO found weaknesses in grant review procedures, including lack of expertise in peer reviewers and delays in notifying successful grantees. HHS has implemented the report's recommendations. Other federal initiatives, like the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP), also provide services for runaway and homeless youth. The Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) was established to reduce homelessness for youth through age 24 by providing funding to communities. HUD allocated $33 million for FY2016 and $43 million for FY2017 to selected communities. HUD is also evaluating grantee communities to prevent and end youth homelessness. A coordinated community approach to prevent and end youth homelessness has been implemented through 100-Day Challenges since 2016. Cities partner with public and private entities, supported by A Way Home America and Rapid Results Institute. HHS provides training and assistance to cities like Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Austin. Grants have been awarded to prevent homelessness among youth with child welfare involvement. The Department of Education administers the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Grants are provided to ensure homeless children have equal access to education. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 administers the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, providing grants to ensure equal access to education for homeless children and youth. Program funds support activities like tutoring, medical services, and coordination with other agencies. States receiving funds must not segregate homeless students from others, except for emergencies or temporary services. FY2019 funding for the program is $93.5 million. The Higher Education Act authorizes financial aid programs for homeless and vulnerable college students. A survey found that 9% of four-year university students and 12% of community college students were homeless in the past year. Additionally, 37% of university students and 46% of community college students were housing insecure. Expected family contribution (EFC) is the amount expected from students and their families for education costs. Certain students are considered \"independent\" for financial aid purposes. The Higher Education Act provides financial aid programs for homeless and vulnerable college students, including those who are verified as unaccompanied and homeless or at risk of homelessness. Homeless children and youth are also eligible for federal TRIO programs. The TRIO programs under the Higher Education Act provide support services for disadvantaged postsecondary students, including mentoring, tutoring, and temporary housing for homeless youth. TRIO funds are awarded competitively by the Department of Education, with appropriations totaling $1.1 billion in FY2019. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) receives $5 million in FY2019 appropriations to establish demonstration projects providing support services for homeless students. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports foster youth aged 14 to 21, with nearly 20,000 youth \"aging out\" of foster care in FY2017. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides funding to support children and youth in foster care and former foster youth. States receive funds based on the number of children in foster care nationwide, with a minimum amount guaranteed. The program includes funding for transitional living services, with up to 30% allocated for room and board. The program is funded through mandatory spending, with $140 million provided annually. The Family Violence Prevention and Service grants, authorized by 1984 (P.L. 98-457), focus on preventing family violence and improving service delivery. One project addressed dating violence among runaway and homeless youth through the Domestic Violence/Runaway and Homeless Youth Collaboration initiative. This initiative funded activities such as curriculum on dating violence and small groups for teens to reduce sexual assault and dating violence. The initiative funded activities to address dating violence among runaway and homeless youth, resulting in an online toolkit for advocates in the domestic and sexual assault fields to better address relationship violence with this population."
