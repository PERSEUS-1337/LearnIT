    "content": "Contextualized representation models like ELMo and BERT have shown impressive results in various NLP tasks. A new edge probing task design is introduced to analyze word-level contextual representations from different models. While these models excel in syntactic tasks, their performance in semantic tasks is only marginally better than non-contextual baselines. Pretrained word embeddings are essential tools in NLP, providing continuous representations for word types. Contextualized word embeddings are generated by running a pretrained encoder network over a sentence to produce embeddings for each token. These embeddings can replace traditional word embeddings in models, leading to improved performance on various tasks. The goal of this work is to understand how contextual representations improve over conventional word embeddings. Recent research has explored token-level properties of these representations, such as capturing part-of-speech tags, morphology, and word-sense disambiguation. The model architecture for probing contextual representations is shown for semantic role labeling, where span pooling and MLP classifiers are trained to extract information from contextual vectors. The study aims to investigate how contextual embeddings enhance traditional word embeddings by introducing a probing model that examines the information encoded in each position, focusing on syntactic and semantic relationships, local and long-range structures. The model utilizes contextual embeddings from a pretrained encoder to analyze structural information, such as predicate-argument pairs. The study introduces a probing model called \"edge probing\" that analyzes contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. This model decomposes structured NLP tasks into graph edges to predict properties like semantic roles. The focus is on utilizing pretrained weights and code from these models for high-level language understanding. The study introduces the \"edge probing\" model to analyze contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. This model breaks down NLP tasks into graph edges to predict properties such as semantic roles. The focus is on leveraging pretrained weights and code for advanced language understanding. The study introduces the \"edge probing\" model to analyze contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. It focuses on labeling versions of tasks to predict targets from a task-specific label set. The experiments concentrate on eight core NLP labeling tasks. The study introduces the \"edge probing\" model to analyze contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. It focuses on labeling versions of tasks to predict targets from a task-specific label set, including constituents, dependencies, named entities, semantic roles, coreference, semantic proto-roles, and relation classification. Part-of-speech tagging (POS) assigns tags like noun, verb, adjective to tokens, while constituent labeling assigns non-terminal labels to token spans within the phrase-structure parse. Dependency labeling predicts functional relationships between tokens. The study introduces the \"edge probing\" model to analyze contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. It focuses on labeling tasks to predict targets from a task-specific label set, including constituents, dependencies, named entities, semantic roles, coreference, semantic proto-roles, and relation classification. Named entity labeling predicts the category of an entity, while semantic role labeling imposes predicate-argument structure onto a sentence. The study introduces the \"edge probing\" model to analyze contextual embeddings from models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. It focuses on labeling tasks to predict targets from a task-specific label set, including constituents, dependencies, named entities, semantic roles, coreference, semantic proto-roles, and relation classification. Coreference involves determining if two mentions refer to the same entity, while semantic proto-role labeling annotates fine-grained semantic attributes over predicate-argument pairs. Relation Classification (Rel.) involves predicting real-world relations between entities using a multi-label classification approach. Annotations from the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus are used for tasks like POS tagging, constituents, named entities, semantic roles, and coreference, which are converted into an edge probing format for analysis. The OntoNotes corpus is utilized for various tasks like POS tagging, coreference, and relation classification. Different datasets are used for dependencies, SPR, and relation classification tasks. The SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset is employed for relation classification, consisting of sentences labeled with directional relation types. The curr_chunk introduces a \"challenge\" coreference dataset based on the Winograd schema BID26, focusing on pronoun resolution cases requiring semantic inference. The Definite Pronoun Resolution (DPR) dataset BID39 is used, with a probing architecture designed to extract information from contextual embeddings. The model utilizes a projection layer and self-attention pooling operator to compute fixed-length span representations. The model utilizes fixed-length span representations computed by a projection layer and self-attention pooling operator. The span representations are concatenated and fed into a two-layer MLP followed by a sigmoid output layer for training with binary cross-entropy. Different contextual encoder models like CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT are explored, each producing contextual vectors from input tokens. The source data for the model includes 7 million sentences from various sources. Different contextual encoder models like ELMo, GPT, and BERT are used, each trained on different datasets. The models are not fine-tuned before probing. The study compares contextual encoder models like ELMo, GPT, and BERT, without fine-tuning the encoder weights. Different methods for obtaining contextual vectors for tokens are compared, including concatenation and mixing of layer activations. A heuristic alignment algorithm is used to map spans from source data to tokenizations expected by the models. The goal is to understand what contextual representations encode that conventional word embeddings do not. The experimental comparisons aim to ablate aspects of contextualized encoders to reveal how they capture linguistic information. Lexical baselines are used to measure performance based on word representations alone. Different models like CoVe, ELMo, GPT, and BERT are compared, with variations in contextual vectors and embeddings. Randomized ELMo shows strong performance in recent studies. Randomized neural networks, such as ELMo, have shown strong performance on various tasks, indicating the importance of architecture in learning feature functions. Comparisons were made with a modified ELMo model replacing weights above the lexical layer with random matrices. Fine-tuning LSTM weights may reveal additional information. The study found no performance difference between cased and uncased BERT models for named entity recognition tasks. Further details can be found in the appendix. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a fixed-width convolutional layer on top of word representations to analyze the contribution of long-range context to encoder performance. This experimental design aims to answer questions regarding syntactic and semantic factors. The curr_chunk compares the performance of ELMo, CoVe, GPT, and BERT models, noting that ELMo and GPT have similar performance, outperforming CoVe. The models differ in architecture, training objective, and training data. The comparison of ELMo, CoVe, GPT, and BERT models shows that ELMo and GPT outperform CoVe in various tasks. The lexical representations of ELMo and GPT models perform better than GloVe vectors, especially in constituent and semantic role labeling. Using ELMo-style scalar mixing instead of concatenation improves performance on deep Transformer models like BERT and GPT. This improvement is attributed to the most relevant information being in intermediate layers. The BERT models outperform GPT and ELMo in various tasks, with BERT-large showing the best performance. The improvements of the BERT models are not consistent across tasks, with significant gains seen in coreference tasks. Genre effects are also considered, with the probing suite matching well with the Billion Word Benchmark. The Billion Word Benchmark is a good match for the ELMo model but weaker for the GPT model. To address this, a clone of the GPT model was trained on the BWB, showing slight improvement in performance compared to the Books Corpus-trained model. However, it still underperforms ELMo. The comparison of representation models shows how contextual information improves performance on various tasks. The comparison of representation models demonstrates that ELMo, CoVe, and GPT show similar performance trends across various tasks, with the largest gains seen in syntactic tasks like dependency and constituent labeling. The contextual representation proves to be more expressive, providing access to lexical representations through concatenation or scalar mixing. ELMo shows small absolute improvements on part-of-speech tagging and entity labeling tasks, likely due to word-level priors. However, there is a significant relative reduction in error, indicating that ELMo encodes local type information. Semantic role labeling benefits greatly from contextual encoders, particularly in better labeling of core roles tied to syntax. Non-core role labels see a smaller improvement from encoded context. The SemEval relation classification task shows a large improvement from contextual encoders like ELMo and BERT-large, with ELMo improving by 22 F1 points on the lexical baseline. This improvement is attributed to the poor performance of lexical priors on this task and the fact that many easy relations can be resolved simply by observing key words in the sentence. The study compares the performance of an orthonormal encoder to the full ELMo model for relation classification, finding that the learned weights account for over 70% of the improvements. The orthonormal encoder improves significantly on the lexical baseline, showing how the architecture itself can encode useful contextual information. The study compares the performance of an orthonormal encoder to the full ELMo model for relation classification. Adding a CNN of width 3 or 5 closes 72-79% of the gap between the lexical baseline and ELMo. The CNN \u00b12 model matches ELMo performance on nonterminal constituents, suggesting most information is local. On syntactic tasks, 80-90% of ELMo performance is captured by CNN \u00b12, while a larger gap exists on semantic tasks. The study compares the performance of an orthonormal encoder to the full ELMo model for relation classification. The gap between ELMo and CNN baselines is larger, suggesting ELMo brings improvements due to long-range information. The probing model performs better with distant spans, showing ELMo encodes useful long-distance dependencies. Recent work has shown strong empirical performance of contextualized word representations like CoVe, ULMFit, and ELMo. The study compares the performance of orthonormal encoder to full ELMo model for relation classification. Probing tasks aim to isolate specific phenomena for analysis rather than application, focusing on fixed-length sentence encoders like InferSent. The properties of sentences, including length, word content, and word order, as well as syntactic features like tree depth and tense, are analyzed in probing tasks. These tasks use challenge sets to isolate linguistic phenomena, such as compositional reasoning. The Diverse Natural Language Collection (DNC) introduces 11 tasks targeting different semantic phenomena, all recast into natural language inference (NLI) format. The text discusses the challenges of analyzing sentence encodings in natural language inference tasks. It mentions the use of minimally-differing sentence pairs and probing token representations for word-and phrase-level properties as strategies to understand how neural machine translation systems encode information. The text discusses how neural machine translation systems encode token-level properties like part-of-speech, semantic tags, and morphology, as well as pairwise dependency relations. It explores how different pretraining objectives and layers of the model encode part-of-speech and hierarchical constituent structure. The approach extends sub-sentence probing to a broader range of syntactic and semantic tasks, including long-range and high-level relations. It can incorporate annotated datasets without templated data generation and allows fine-grained analysis by label and metadata. The focus is on probing token-level representations directly to analyze contextualized vs. conventional word embeddings. \"Edge probing\" tasks are introduced to explore sub-sentential structure. Contextual embeddings show improvement on syntactic tasks compared to semantic tasks. The study focuses on CoVe, ELMo, OpenAI GPT, and BERT models. The study focuses on probing token-level representations of contextualized word embeddings like ELMo and BERT. Results show that these embeddings excel in syntactic tasks over semantic tasks, indicating a stronger focus on syntax than higher-level semantics. The performance of ELMo suggests encoding of distant linguistic information, aiding in disambiguating longer-range dependencies and higher-level syntactic structures. The paper includes probing results on BERT models and additional tasks in Table 2. The study includes probing results on BERT models and additional tasks in Table 2, exploring how pre-trained encoders capture semantic information. Experiments with ELMo-style scalar mixing on the OpenAI GPT model show slight performance improvements, leading to the conclusion that ELMo and GPT are approximately equal on average. The study also reports the use of self-attentional pooling operator from BID24 to improve span representations for coreference tasks. The study trains a probing classifier using a two-layer MLP with a sigmoid output layer to estimate labels independently. The weights of the sentence encoder are held fixed during training. The Adam optimizer is used with specific parameters, and evaluation is done periodically with adjustments to the learning rate based on performance. The CoVe model is a two-layer biLSTM used for English-German machine translation, trained on the WMT2017 dataset. It concatenates activations of top-layer LSTMs with GloVe embeddings. The ELMo model is a two-layer LSTM built over a character CNN layer, used for language modeling. The ELMo model, implemented using the AllenNLP toolkit, utilizes three vectors for each token to generate 1024-dimensional representations. In contrast, the GPT model, a 12-layer Transformer trained as a left-to-right language model, has shown superior performance on various tasks and holds the highest score on the GLUE benchmark. The GPT model uses boolean adjacency matrices to create token-to-token alignments. The GPT model uses boolean adjacency matrices to create token-to-token alignments, representing source spans as boolean vectors and projecting through the alignment to the target side to recover target-side spans."
