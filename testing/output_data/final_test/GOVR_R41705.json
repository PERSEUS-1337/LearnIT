    "content": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary federal agency for biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information. Its mission is to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. As of FY2018, NIH was the largest public funder of biomedical research globally, funding researchers in every state. Congress maintains a high level of interest in NIH due to its significant role in federal biomedical research funding. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a major federal agency for research and development, with the largest budget among health-related agencies. It accounts for a significant portion of federal R&D funding and has led to numerous medical innovations. Some question whether NIH priorities are too focused on treatments rather than disease prevention. The allocation of NIH research dollars is a major source of debate, with funding experiencing periods of both low and high growth. Congress doubled the NIH budget from $13.7 billion to $27.1 billion from FY1998 to FY2003. Funding then saw cuts from FY2004 to FY2015, but increased from $30.3 billion in FY2015 to $39.3 billion in FY2019. President Trump's FY2020 budget request proposes a 12.6% reduction to $34.3 billion, causing concern in the scientific community for steady and predictable funding growth. The debate over NIH funding growth and diversification continues, with concerns about allocation across disease types, congressional priorities, and supporting new investigators. Maintaining the US's leadership in biomedical research and balancing public and private sector roles are also key issues. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a rich history dating back to 1887 when it was established as a one-room Laboratory of Hygiene. Over the years, it has evolved into a major research agency with various institutes and centers. Congress has played a key role in shaping NIH's growth, including the establishment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in 2011. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has evolved into a large and complex organization with a main campus in Bethesda, MD, and off-campus sites in various locations. It consists of the Office of the Director and 27 components, including research institutes, centers, and support centers. The Office of the Director sets overall policy and coordinates programs, while individual institutes and centers focus on specific diseases or areas of human health and development. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of 27 components, including research institutes, centers, and support centers. Each component focuses on specific diseases, areas of human health, scientific fields, or biomedical professions and technology. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 components, including institutes, the National Library of Medicine (NLM), and three research centers. The institutes, NLM, and three research centers have the authority to award research grants. Under President Trump's FY2020 budget request, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) would be consolidated into NIH as the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ), forming a 28th component. The creation of a new NIH institute, NIRSQ, would require an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. President Trump's budget requests proposed consolidating AHRQ and other HHS institutes into NIH, but Congress did not adopt these proposals. NIH's large and decentralized organizational structure with 27 ICs has raised concerns about costs, complexities, research duplication, and gaps. The 2003 NAS report highlighted the congressional mandate as the main origin of NIH institutes, with the NCI being the first established in 1937. Health advocates successfully influenced Congress to create additional institutes from the 1940s to 1974. Health advocacy groups have been successful in persuading Congress to establish additional institutes at the NIH, often against the wishes of administrations. This has led to the creation of named entities to focus on specific diseases and secure more research funding. The 2003 NAS report highlighted challenges with NIH's organizational structure and recommended public evaluation for any changes in the number of institutes or program offices. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 incorporated many of these recommendations, enhancing the authority of the NIH Director's Office. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-482) enhanced the authority of the NIH Director's Office, established the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), and created the Council of Councils to advise on trans-NIH research. It required biennial reports to Congress on biomedical research activities and strategic planning. The Reform Act of 2006 established the Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) system to catalog research activities across different disease areas and assist in planning trans-NIH research initiatives. It also granted authorities to HHS and NIH officials for organizational changes within NIH. The Reform Act of 2006 granted authorities to HHS and NIH officials for organizational changes within NIH, including the creation of the Scientific Management Review Board (SMRB) to review the organizational structure every seven years. SMRB can recommend restructuring but the number of ICs is capped at 27. SMRB has proposed a framework for evaluating potential organizational changes at NIH. The 21st Century Cures Act introduced administrative reforms at NIH, including the requirement for an NIH-wide Strategic Plan every six years. This plan aims to guide biomedical investments, promote collaboration among Institutes, and advance biomedicine. The 21st Century Cures Act introduced reforms at NIH, including changing the NIH Director's report to Congress to a triennial requirement, reducing administrative burden, introducing accountability measures for IC Directors, and preventing duplicative research. NIH's statutory authority comes from the Public Health Service Act. The 21st Century Cures Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for NIH in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 authorized funding levels for FY2007 through FY2009. The current authorization of appropriations for NIH is set to expire at the end of FY2020. NIH conducts biomedical and behavioral research through extramural and intramural programs, supporting research training programs for young investigators. NIH conducts and supports biomedical and behavioral research to understand disease causes and mechanisms, translating knowledge into clinical practice. Funding for research is a significant part of NIH spending, with a focus on individual investigator-led research and contracted projects. Basic research involves studying fundamental biology and behavior mechanisms. Preclinical translational research focuses on developing and testing new diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventive measures using various methods. Clinical research involves human subjects and includes clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and outcomes research. Postclinical translational research aims to enhance access to new biomedical interventions. Clinical and community practice involves translating research discoveries into widespread practice. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on translating biomedical research into clinical and community practice. NIH emphasizes the importance of communicating scientific findings rapidly. About half of NIH's funding is for basic research, with progress in research not following a linear path. Extramural research funding, which makes up over 80% of the NIH budget, supports scientists and research personnel worldwide. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides various types of research funding, including research grants, contracts, and training awards. The majority of funding goes towards research project grants (RPGs) for individual investigators and small teams at universities and medical centers. Data on awards and recipients are available on the NIH website. Scientists submit detailed plans in grant applications to compete for NIH extramural research funding. The NIH grant applications undergo a two-tiered peer review process to evaluate scientific merit and research priorities. Grant applications can be investigator-initiated or in response to specific Funding Opportunity Announcements. The NIH grant applications undergo a two-tiered peer review process to evaluate scientific merit and research priorities. Applications are submitted in response to solicitations by ICs for research areas they wish to target, called Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs). The applications are received by the NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR) and assigned to a potential awarding IC and a Scientific Review Group (SRG) of the IC for review. SRGs are peer-review committees composed of experts in relevant research fields. In the second stage of the NIH grant review process, the Scientific Review Group (SRG) evaluates grant proposals for scientific merit and impact. Each member gives a final score, which is used to determine an overall impact score and percentile ranking. Funding decisions are further refined by the National Advisory Councils or Boards of the potential awarding Institutes/Centers (ICs). The National Advisory Councils or Boards, composed of scientific and lay representatives, evaluate grant applications recommended for funding. They assign impact scores and percentile rankings based on the IC's research priorities and make recommendations for final funding decisions. ICs may establish a \"payline\" for funded applications, but can also prioritize applications outside the payline. The IC director makes the final funding decisions, weighing the Advisory Board or Council's advice against the IC's mission, research priorities, NIH-Wide Strategic Plan, and projects funded by other ICs on similar topics. The NIH awards various research grants, with the R01 Research Project Grant being the most common. Grantees may be in \"noncompeting\" status for multiyear grants, where they do not have to compete for funding in subsequent years. They can choose to renew the project before the award expires. In FY2018, NIH made over 39,000 research project grants, including new, competing renewal, noncompeting, and small business awards. The average annual cost of an RPG award was $519,000, with direct costs covering project-specific expenses and indirect costs paying for facility and administration costs. Critics argue that the NIH peer review and grant award process is cumbersome and biased, while others defend it as effective. The NIH requested an SMRB report on the peer review and award process, with recommendations to fast-track high-scoring applications, increase peer reviewers, improve administrative processes, and pilot new review methods. The NIH Strategic Plan 2016-20 aims to enhance peer review through innovative approaches like electronic reviews and editorial board models. Congress has imposed requirements on NIH-funded research, including human subjects protections and animal use. NIH maintains a \"Grants Policy Statement\" outlining grant terms. Grant awards go to institutions, not individual researchers. Both NIH and recipient institutions share responsibility for compliance. Institutional Review Boards and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ensure ethical research practices. The NIH Division of Grants Compliance and Oversight provides training and conducts site visits. The NIH intramural research program accounts for 11% of funding. The NIH's Intramural Research Program (IRP) receives about $4.0 billion in FY2018, making up 11% of the total NIH budget. It involves 1,100 principal investigators, 6,000 trainees, administrative staff, guest researchers, and contractors. The research takes place at the main campus in Bethesda, MD, and off-campus sites in Maryland, North Carolina, Montana, and Arizona. The size, structure, and activities of the programs vary among the different Institutes and Centers (ICs). The direction of the IRP is set by hiring scientists with targeted expertise, allocating resources, and external reviews. The NIH's Intramural Research Program (IRP) is evaluated through external reviews every four years for scientists and every 10 years for research programs. Some scientists work in the Clinical Center, the nation's largest hospital for clinical research, which employs over 1,000 nurses and allied health professionals. Most ICs fund research at the center to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and clinical application of new knowledge. The NIH's research training activities support every stage of a biomedical research career, from high school internships to mentoring programs for independent investigators. The largest program, the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA), offers pre- and postdoctoral research training awards. NIH supports research training awards for institutions and individuals, with over 15,600 graduate and postdoctoral students funded in 2015. They play a crucial role in translating biomedical research into medical practice and health information for the public. The individual ICs conduct various activities like seminars, conferences, and information campaigns on diseases, as well as providing education materials and databases. NIH's budget for FY2019 is $39 billion. NIH's budget for FY2019 is $39 billion, making it much larger than other PHS agencies. About 40% of all discretionary HHS funding is provided to NIH, representing half of federal spending for non-Department of Defense R&D. Congress had doubled the NIH program level over a five-year period prior to 2004, but the agency then experienced a decade of stagnant growth in its budget. From FY2004 to FY2015, Congress provided budget increases generally around 1%-3.2% for NIH, often lower than the rate of inflation for biomedical research. Funding for the agency decreased in nominal dollars in some years. Starting in FY2016, NIH received funding increases of over 5% each year, reaching $39.3 billion in FY2019. However, the program level remains 9% below the 2003 level in inflation-adjusted dollars. President Trump's FY2020 budget request proposed a 12.6% reduction to $34.3 billion, which would be 22.6% below the peak 2003 level in inflation-adjusted dollars. NIH receives funding from discretionary and mandatory budget authorities. The total NIH budget, known as the \"program level,\" includes funds from the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill and the Interior-Environment appropriations bill. In FY2019, NIH also received mandatory funds for Special Diabetes Programs. NIH received $150 million in FY2019 for the Special Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes under PHSA Section 330B. The program was reauthorized by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, providing funding for NIH. Additionally, NIH receives funds from a \"program evaluation\" transfer authorized by PHSA Section 241, which redistributes funds among PHS agencies. The PHSA provision allows for redistributing appropriated funds among PHS agencies, with recent LHHS appropriations bills specifying a higher amount (2.5% for FY2019). NIH, the largest PHS agency, historically donates the most funds through the evaluation tap but has recently become a minor recipient. In FY2019, NIH received $1.15 billion subject to the tap, and President Trump's FY2020 budget request includes $741 million for NIH. The NIH budget request to Congress reflects past funding trends and future research priorities. The process involves input from IC leaders and the scientific community to determine research areas and new initiatives for the upcoming fiscal year. Congress ultimately makes decisions based on these recommendations. The annual budget retreat in May brings together IC leaders and NIH management to discuss policies and priorities under various budget scenarios. Presentations and discussions help develop the budget request submitted to HHS, considering funding for continuing awards, new research proposals, Director's initiatives, and department guidance. NIH's request is reviewed at the HHS level in the context of the overall department budget. The NIH's budget request is reviewed by HHS in the context of the department's overall budget. Appeals and adjustments are made before the final HHS budget goes to OMB. The process is repeated as OMB considers the federal budget and informs HHS of approved amounts and policy approaches for the President's final budget. FNIH, a charitable organization, supports NIH's mission through private funding and public-private partnerships. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) supports NIH's mission through projects, education, conferences, and other activities. FNIH has raised over $1 billion in its history, with $555 million in funding commitments by 2017. NIH funds research on various health areas, with a competitive grant application process. Funding decisions for NIH research projects are challenging due to the balance needed between scientific merit and meeting diverse health needs. Historic tensions include designating funding for specific diseases, balancing basic and applied research, funding ethically contentious areas like embryonic stem cell research, and allocating funds among established and new scientists. Congress historically allowed NIH ICs to make funding decisions. In recent years, Congress has provided more direction to NIH funding in both appropriations report language and legislation. Congressional involvement in NIH research priorities has increased, including recent major efforts, legislation, and research restrictions. NIH is not the only federal agency supporting biomedical research, with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also funding medical research programs. In FY2019, the NIH program level was $39.3 billion, the VA appropriation for medical research was $779 million, and the DOD's Defense Health Program also contributed to research funding. In FY2019, the VA appropriation for medical research was $779 million, and the DOD's Defense Health Program's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) account received $2.18 billion, including $1.47 billion for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research program (CDMRP). A 2016 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report highlighted challenges in coordinating research funded by NIH, DOD, and VA, citing limited information sharing between agencies. Other agencies like the CDC and AHRQ also support health-related research. Congress plays a significant role in prioritizing and coordinating funding for medical and health-related research across the federal government, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Appropriators typically do not specify dollar amounts for specific disease areas or research fields, instead allocating funds to individual Institutes and Centers (ICs) for competitive grants, contracts, or intramural research. This funding process is influenced by legislation such as the 21st Century Cures Act and other congressional requirements. Funding for medical and health-related research at NIH is awarded through competitive grants, contracts, or to intramural researchers. Recent legislation like the 21st Century Cures Act has specified funding amounts for research areas such as Alzheimer's disease, antibiotic resistant bacteria, universal flu vaccine development, opioids-related research, and the Institutional Development Awards program. Other laws, like the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, have also directed funding to specific research areas. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act authorizes funding for pediatric research and type 1 diabetes. Changes in congressional practice have occurred, notably with Alzheimer's disease research funding. Congress has provided directives to prioritize Alzheimer's disease research through the National Institute on Aging. The agreement expects a significant portion of the recommended increase for NIA to be directed to research on Alzheimer's disease, without specifying a total dollar amount. This departure from past precedent aims to prioritize Alzheimer's research based on scientific opportunity and grant application quality. The explanatory statements for appropriations measures from FY2016 to FY2019 directed NIH to reserve a specific amount for Alzheimer's disease research, driven by the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. NIH began publishing annual bypass budgets starting in FY2015 to estimate funding needs for Alzheimer's research. The NIH submits a bypass budget proposal directly to Congress for Alzheimer's research funding, based on scientific opportunity. This process was mandated by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015. Research summits have been held since 2012 to determine funding needs, and targeted FOAs are used to solicit research proposals. The large increase in funding for Alzheimer's disease research has had a significant impact on the NIH and the scientific community. This surge in funding is unprecedented since the War on Cancer in 1971 and the AIDS funding boom in the late 1980s. The NIH staff is overwhelmed with processing grant proposals, including a $414 million allocation for FY2018. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is not only expanding existing Alzheimer's labs but also attracting new investigators. The surge in funding for Alzheimer's disease research has led to the expansion of labs and the recruitment of new investigators. Despite the increased funding, skepticism remains about meeting the goal to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025, as many potential cures have failed in recent clinical trials. Only a few drug candidates in the pipeline may meet the deadline. Some in the scientific community worry that the focus on Alzheimer's research may detract from other diseases like cancer. Congress has placed restrictions on NIH research for FY2019, including limitations on certain types of studies. Some in mental health and human sexuality research are concerned about restrictions on NIH funding for certain studies, such as the Dickey-Wicker amendment limiting research on human embryonic stem cells. Researchers argue that these studies were funded based on technical merit and important research questions, and view the restrictions as an assault on the peer review system. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) allows NIH to award large grants for high-need cures and reduce barriers between research and clinical trials. CAN grant recipients can be public or private entities, including institutions of higher education, pharmaceutical companies, and disease advocacy organizations. ACA authorized $500 million for CAN in FY2010 and subsequent funding is through specific appropriations. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) is funded through specific appropriations designated by Congress, with varying amounts allocated each fiscal year. The NIH Director determines which medical products are \"high need cures\" based on their ability to diagnose, prevent, or treat diseases, and the lack of market incentives for their development. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) is funded through specific appropriations designated by Congress to accelerate the development of high-need cures. NIH awards grants to research entities to facilitate the development of these cures. A CAN Review Board advises the Director on barriers to translating basic science into clinical applications, with advocacy groups supporting CAN's creation. Some have concerns about providing federal funds to industry. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) is supported by federal funds to accelerate the development of cures. The network is actively involved in programs like tissue chip for drug screening, biomedical data translator, and 3-D tissue bioprinting. The 21st Century Cures Act authorizes $4.8 billion for NIH over a 10-year period. Title I of the Cures Act authorizes funding for new programs at NIH, including the NIH Innovation Account for projects like the Precision Medicine Initiative and the BRAIN Initiative. The Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot and Regenerative Medicine projects aim to accelerate progress in cancer research and support clinical research using adult stem cells. Funding for these projects has been fully appropriated, with the first round provided by the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 and the second round by the FY2018 omnibus. The Cures Act provided funding for NIH programs, including the Next Generation Initiative to recruit new researchers. Title II of the Act also includes reforms for inclusion in biomedical research. Title II of the Cures Act extends NCATS's authority to support clinical trial activities, consolidates existing NIH intramural loan repayment programs, specifies administrative requirements for PMI and ClinicalTrials.gov, and establishes a working group to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded scientific research. Each NIH IC has separate research priorities determined through strategic planning and advisory council recommendations. The NIH seeks advice from various groups, including scientific researchers, patient organizations, IC Advisory Councils, Congress, and the Administration, to set research priorities and funding decisions. Each IC undergoes strategic planning processes to determine funding priorities aligned with its mission, as mandated by PHSA Section 402(b)(5). The NIH implements strategic planning to support research priorities determined by its agencies. The Cures Act amended PHSA Section 402 to require an NIH-Wide Strategic Plan to facilitate collaboration and coordination among ICs. The NIH's Strategic Plan emphasizes setting research priorities based on the best science, public health needs, and NIH's unique ability to address health challenges. The plan reaffirms a commitment to transparent and evidence-based funding decisions prioritizing nimbleness to meet public health needs. The NIH-Wide Strategic Plan aims to enhance nimbleness in meeting public health needs and capitalizing on scientific opportunities. It incorporates burden of disease as a factor, takes advantage of rare disease opportunities, and considers permanently eradicating diseases. The plan complements individual ICs' strategic plans, identifies research overlap and gaps, and focuses on evaluating scientific investments. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 enhanced the authority of the NIH Director's Office for strategic planning and created the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) to accelerate research investments in emerging scientific opportunities. The Office of Strategic Coordination within DPCPSI manages the NIH Common Fund to support large research efforts involving collaboration across institutes. The Office of Strategic Coordination within the NIH works to identify and promote NIH-wide scientific opportunities supported by the Common Fund. Funding variations impact the number of research projects supported each year, with increases leading to more awards and cuts limiting grants. Most grants are multiyear and committed before final appropriations. Reductions in purchasing power may decrease new research grants, creating a more competitive environment for NIH awards. The NIH has supported a consistent number of research project grants (RPGs) annually from FY2003 to FY2008, but fewer RPGs were awarded after FY2008. The average cost of an RPG has increased from $337.8 thousand in 2003 to $518.0 thousand in 2018. To maintain funding commitments, NIH maintained noncompeting grants while reducing competing project grants from FY2009 to FY2015. Success rates for grant applications have varied due to decreased purchasing power and an increasing pool of applicants. The success rate for new grant applications at NIH fluctuated from 30% in FY2003 to 17% in FY2013, then rose to 21% in FY2018. The decrease in purchasing power and increase in the number of applicants led to a lower success rate for applicants in FY2016-FY2018 compared to prior years. The number of RPG applications increased by 58% between FY2003 and FY2018, reflecting a growing pool of investigators competing for funding. The success rates for grant applications to different ICs at NIH vary, ranging from 10.3% to 34.8% in FY2018. Fluctuations in funding from year to year can impact scientific progress, leading to missed opportunities for groundbreaking research. Low success rates result in scientists spending more time on proposals rather than research, particularly affecting investigators at vulnerable career stages. Members of the scientific community are calling for steady, predictable annual growth in NIH funding to support biomedical research. Universities have become heavily reliant on NIH funding, with federal dollars making up a significant portion of funding for research in biological and health sciences. This reliance has led to rapid expansion of laboratory space and increased hiring of scientists during periods of increased NIH funding. The growth in laboratory space and hiring of scientists has intensified competition for NIH grants. Universities now primarily fund researchers' salaries with grant money, with researchers spending more time on grant applications than actual research. The author suggests universities should allocate more institutional funds for research to ensure biomedical research sustainability. NIH Director Francis Collins highlighted universities' overreliance on NIH funding, leading to faculty members focusing more on grant writing than actual research. President Trump's budget proposals aim to stretch grant dollars, including capping indirect costs covered by NIH grants at 10% of the total award. This could disrupt universities and faculty members, requiring a phased implementation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected the proposal to cap F&A costs at 10% of the total grant award. The Trump Administration's proposed cap on indirect costs was deemed \"misguided\" and would negatively impact biomedical research. The FY2019 budget request suggested capping investigator salaries at $152,000, a 19% reduction from the current limit of $187,000. The House Appropriations Committee did not include a provision to limit the percentage of a researcher's salary paid for using NIH grants in H.R. 6470. The FY2020 budget request included a proposal to cap the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%. NIH requested an analysis of the impact of this policy change on the number and average cost of NIH grants in the FY2020 Congressional Justification. Previous research on salary cap reductions in FY2011 did not decrease the average cost of NIH grants, and the number of grants awarded also decreased. NIH expressed concerns about the unintended consequences of capping the percentage of an investigator's salary that can be paid with grant funds at 90%, noting potential limitations on researchers' participation in Federally-funded research. The agency is worried about the declining support for early-stage scientists in obtaining NIH grants and traditional faculty positions in biomedical research, leading to a competitive and pessimistic outlook for research careers. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report highlighted obstacles in research careers, such as pay, duration, culture, and job prospects. NIH funding favors older researchers, with an increase in investigators over 65 and a decline in those under 50. The average age for obtaining grants has also risen significantly. The percentage of new and early-stage investigators at NIH declined from 2009 to 2016. Success rate for new investigators dropped from 40% in 1962 to 27% in 2013. Extramural investigators who received large NIH grants were more likely to get future grants. Top 10% of grant winners received 37% of funding in 2015, while bottom 40% received 12%. In 2015, the top 10% of grant winners received 37% of funding, while the bottom 40% received 12%. Researchers at the top tend to remain there, with more publications and citations, leading to grant success. The Next Generation of Researchers Initiative aims to enhance workforce diversity and provide opportunities for earlier independence. The NIH implemented new policies to promote workforce diversity and support early-stage investigators. This included a proposal to cap funding for highly funded researchers, which was met with opposition from some in the scientific community. Ultimately, the proposal was cancelled after facing criticism. NIH implemented new policies to support early-stage investigators by prioritizing funding for them. The proposal to cap funding for highly funded researchers was cancelled after facing criticism. The new policy, called NGRI, aimed to free up substantial funds to support early stage and early established investigators. Starting with $210 million in FY2017, the program was set to increase to $1.1 billion in five years. NIH implemented the NGRI policy to prioritize funding for early-stage investigators, aiming to support ESIs and EEIs. Despite facing criticism, NIH revised the policy to eliminate the EEI category and prioritize investigators at risk of losing funding. NIH expects to fund 1,100 early-stage investigators with their first grant in 2018 as a result of NGRI. In 2018, NIH implemented the Next Generation Researchers Initiative (NGRI) to support early-stage investigators. The FY2020 budget request included $100 million for NGRI, creating a new application pathway without preliminary data requirements and extending eligibility to 11 years with flexibility for life events. This initiative was in response to recommendations from an advisory committee and a report from the National Academy of Sciences. The NASEM committee identified policy reforms to support the next generation of biomedical researchers, directing NIH to fund the report. The committee found that universities and research institutions have been slower to make reforms for early-stage investigators than NIH, recommending policies to hold them accountable. The NASEM committee recommended policy reforms to support early-stage investigators in biomedical research, including creating a council for ongoing challenges and strengthening NIH programs for ESIs. Inequalities in grant funding persist based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity, with women and minorities underrepresented in awardee pools and faculty positions. Women scientists receive smaller grant sizes compared to men, despite making up half of all PhDs in the biomedical sciences. One-third of first-time NIH research grants in the biomedical sciences were awarded to women investigators, but they drop out of academic research careers at a higher rate than men. Women tend to receive their first grant at a later age than men, but this age difference has narrowed in recent years. From 2002 to 2016, there was a funding gap of 7.5% to 10.5% between scientists from underrepresented minority groups and those from majority groups. Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, and white applicants had varying success rates in receiving large grants from NIH. The percentage of underrepresented minorities in the NIH grant applicant pool increased from 2002 to 2016. While NIH has implemented diversity initiatives, they lack evaluation and adequate performance measures. These initiatives include bias training, targeted training and fellowship opportunities, and career development for scientists from underrepresented groups. In recent years, China and other Asian countries have increased public funding for research, with China nearly quadrupling its investment in medical research. The United States' share of global research funding has declined, but it remains the top supporter of research and development globally. The NIH is the top nonindustry funder, and initiatives are in place to support scientists from underrepresented groups. The United States remains the top supporter of research and development globally, with NIH being the top nonindustry funder of health research. International biomedical research growth brings global benefits but also increases competition for U.S. industries. In 2011, the U.S. led in biomedical research articles published, while China led in life science patent applications. Academic scientists often collaborate with colleagues from other countries to advance their work. Some Members of Congress are concerned about investments in biomedical research by other countries, as the growth in global funding has led to increased collaboration between U.S. and international institutions. China is predicted to outspend the United States in research and development by the end of the decade. A study of biomedical research literature from 2004 to 2013 found an increase in publications funded by non-U.S. government sources, with European and Asian authors publishing at a higher rate than American authors. Collaboration between U.S. and international institutions has also grown, particularly in cardiovascular research. The NIH encourages international collaboration, but concerns about foreign influence in U.S. biomedical research have been raised. NIH Director Francis Collins announced an investigation into undue foreign influence in U.S. biomedical research, focusing on researchers failing to disclose contributions from foreign organizations, diversion of intellectual property, and peer reviewers breaching confidentiality. A working group of university leaders will develop policies to address this issue. NIH Director Francis Collins announced an investigation into foreign influence in U.S. biomedical research, focusing on undisclosed contributions, intellectual property diversion, and breaches of confidentiality. A Chinese research training program was identified for transferring U.S. intellectual property to China, with recommendations to educate institutions on disclosing international ties and enhancing cybersecurity. Other federal agencies are also actively monitoring and issuing guidance on this issue. The federal government is actively monitoring and issuing guidance on foreign theft of intellectual property from U.S. academic and research institutions. NIH basic research is valued for treatment and prevention measures, policy decisions, and economic development. Federal funding for basic research is essential as private firms do not invest enough in such research. There are differing views on the roles of the federal government and private industry in biomedical research and development. Scientific knowledge as a public good may have widespread benefits that are difficult for individual firms to capture. The public sector should fund basic research while private firms focus on applied research and product development. Concerns exist about federal funding possibly crowding out private-sector investment in R&D, but evidence is mixed. Economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the U.S. government has played a directive role in accelerating innovation through research and development. Mazzucato argues that federal efforts have been a driving force behind innovation in pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies. Public and private sector collaboration in pharmaceutical research is essential due to the complexity of medical innovations. The balance between federal and industry contributions to biomedical innovation is a topic of debate. Both NIH and industry have shifted their R&D investments in recent years. The pharmaceutical industry has shifted its funding from basic and translational research to clinical trials, with a 36% increase in spending for phase 3 trials from 2004 to 2011. This shift reflects rising costs and complexity in clinical trials. NIH has also increased spending on applied research compared to basic research in recent years. NIH may be shifting towards spending more on research compared to industry funding. In 2015, industry accounted for 67.4% of US medical research expenditures, followed by the federal government and universities. Federal support of basic research stimulates industry R&D through scientific discoveries and training researchers. NIH funding indirectly affects the number of researchers available for the private sector. The NIH engages in public-private partnerships to boost innovative research and stretch funding dollars. Partnerships like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership and Biomarkers Consortium aim to transform the way diagnostics and therapeutics are developed by identifying promising biological targets for therapeutics and biomarkers for disease and treatment. In March 2018, the New York Times reported on NIH officials seeking funding from the alcohol industry for a clinical trial on moderate alcohol consumption. NIH shut down the study in June 2018. Additionally, in April 2018, NIH cancelled an opioids research partnership with pharmaceutical companies under the HEAL Initiative. The NIH cancelled a research partnership with pharmaceutical companies under the HEAL Initiative due to criticism and ethical concerns. They now fund the initiative with federal dollars only, prompting calls for changes in public-private partnerships practices to ensure transparency and limit industry influence in research. The NIH faces criticism for industry influence in research design and protocols. Calls for transparency and limits on industry involvement in research are made, with suggestions for open science practices. NIH Director defends public-private partnerships for advancing scientific research rapidly. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) receives smaller funding compared to NIH, with total revenues of $64 million in FY2017. Private sector funding in biomedical research has increased, with industry-funded studies in medical journals doubling from 1988 to 2008. NIH may need to carefully navigate its relationship with the private sector in advancing biomedical research. NIH funding indirectly contributes to pharmaceutical drug development through basic research, patenting inventions, and funding clinical trials for FDA approval. It also supports the education and training of biomedical scientists who may work in the pharmaceutical industry. The exact impact of NIH funding on the development of specific drugs is challenging to quantify. NIH funding plays a role in drug development by patenting inventions and funding clinical trials for FDA approval. A small percentage of FDA-approved drugs have patents held by NIH or NIH-funded researchers. According to a 2011 study, 9% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1988 to 2005 were based on patents held by government agencies or institutions receiving government support. The Sampat and Lichtenberg study indicated that many drugs in the US were likely developed with NIH funding, although federal funding can go unreported on patent applications. A study by Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in public sector research institutions. The FDA granted priority review to 348 out of 1,541 drug applications in the United States, with 19% resulting from publicly funded research. Public-sector research institutions had a higher rate of priority reviews compared to private-sector research, indicating a greater clinical impact of drugs discovered by PSRIs. Studies have focused on the public sector's role in developing innovative drugs, particularly transformative ones with groundbreaking effects on patient care. Research found that most transformative drugs originated in academic or publicly funded institutions and were further developed by industry partners for clinical testing. The analysis of case histories of transformative drugs published in 2016 found that only 4 out of 26 drugs were developed solely by either the public or private sector. While the public sector focused on basic science activities, the private sector led drug development for market release. The authors suggested that NIH funding would need to increase significantly without industry support, but did not consider potential revenues if NIH produced the drugs. NIH-funded researchers mainly contribute to drug development indirectly through scientific research and innovations. The Stevens et al. 2011 study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to new drug classes approved by the FDA. Platform technologies like recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, antibody production, glycosylated protein production, and gene silencing were developed with public funds but not used for specific drug candidates. The development of platform technologies like recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, antibody production, glycosylated protein production, and gene silencing with public funds has enabled the creation of new drug classes. Studies have shown that NIH funding has directly or indirectly contributed to every new molecular entity approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The NIH funding was associated with every one of 210 NMEs approved from 2010-2016, with 29% of publications directly linked to NIH-funded projects. The analysis captured both basic and applied research on NMEs, with up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, approximately $100 billion, contributing to NME research. A 2019 study by Azoulay et al. found that NIH investments in research areas increase private sector patenting in those areas. The NIH funding has been linked to the approval of 210 NMEs from 2010-2016, with 29% of publications directly tied to NIH-funded projects. A study by Azoulay et al. revealed that NIH investments in research areas lead to increased private sector patenting, with a $10 million increase resulting in 2.7 additional patents. This suggests that NIH funding plays a significant role in driving innovation and drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. The NIH plays a significant role in drug development through research funding, with over $39 billion allocated in FY2019. Congress may consider funding allocation, reforms, and oversight to maximize benefits in health and medical care. NIH utilizes internal processes for funding allocation through peer review and advisory committees. Congress may also address gaps, duplication, and research portfolio needs. Congress may consider funding allocation, reforms, and oversight to maximize benefits in health and medical care, address gaps, duplication, and needs in the research portfolio, and support new and early-stage scientists while maintaining NIH's global leadership in biomedical research."
