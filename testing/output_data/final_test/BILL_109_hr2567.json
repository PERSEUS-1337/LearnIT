    "content": "The \"Antifreeze Bittering Act of 2006\" requires the addition of a bittering agent in antifreeze as an amendment to the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will evaluate the use of denatonium benzoate as a bittering agent in engine coolant to determine its environmental impact. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will evaluate the environmental impact of using denatonium benzoate as a bittering agent in engine coolant. The evaluation must not involve new animal or human testing and should be completed within 180 days of the enactment of this section. If no unreasonable adverse effects are found, engine coolant or antifreeze manufactured after 180 days from the publication of the findings can use the bittering agent. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will evaluate the environmental impact of using denatonium benzoate as a bittering agent in engine coolant. If engine coolant or antifreeze contains more than 10 percent ethylene glycol, it must include 30-50 parts per million of denatonium benzoate to make it unpalatable. An alternative bittering agent can be used if it is as effective as denatonium benzoate. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may allow the use of an alternative bittering agent in engine coolant if it is proven to be as effective as denatonium benzoate and does not have an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment. The manufacturer of engine coolant or antifreeze must maintain records of the bittering agent used to comply with regulations. Non-compliant products will be considered banned hazardous substances and subject to penalties. Manufacturers of engine coolant or antifreeze must maintain records of the bittering agent used for compliance. These records must be made available to the public upon request. Manufacturers, processors, distributors, recyclers, or sellers of these products are not liable for any harm caused by the bittering agent if it is present in required concentrations. Manufacturers and distributors of engine coolant or antifreeze are not liable for harm caused by the bittering agent if it is required by law. States cannot enforce restrictions on retail containers with less than 55 gallons of coolant or antifreeze. Manufacturers and distributors of engine coolant or antifreeze are exempt from any additional requirements regarding bittering agents in coolant. This exemption does not apply to the sale of motor vehicles containing coolant or antifreeze, or wholesale containers with 55 gallons or more."
