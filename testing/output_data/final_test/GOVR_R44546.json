    "content": "The United States has historically led the global economic order post-World War II, establishing multilateral economic institutions to promote rules-based commercial engagement. Congress plays a crucial role in U.S. trade policy by approving agreements and overseeing trade agencies. In 2015, Congress reauthorized Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) through the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-26), setting trade policy objectives for the President to negotiate in trade agreements and requiring congressional consideration of implementing legislation on an expedited basis. The United States concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and negotiated the U.S.-European Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The United States withdrew from the TPP under President Trump's administration, leading to the creation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) by the remaining 11 partners. The Trump Administration is also renegotiating NAFTA and the U.S.-South Korea FTA, raising questions about the potential economic impact of international trade agreements. The United States' withdrawal from the TPP led to the creation of the CPTPP. The Trump Administration is renegotiating NAFTA and the U.S.-South Korea FTA, raising questions about the economic impact of trade agreements. Congress plays a key role in shaping legislation for U.S. trade agreements, while other countries are also involved in various FTAs. These agreements raise concerns about the impact of globalization on employment, income distribution, and standard of living. Negotiations could potentially open markets, establish new trade rules, and revitalize the WTO. International trade offers the potential for improved economic welfare but also raises concerns about job losses. The report focuses on the role of trade agreements in the economy, including the impact on employment, trade deficit, and income distribution. Economists argue that liberalized trade has both costs and benefits, affecting economic growth and job numbers. Most economists argue that liberalized trade has both costs and benefits, with the long-term net effect being positive. They believe that competition through international trade leads to a more efficient economy, offering consumers a wider variety of goods and services. Trade agreements have been credited with reducing global poverty by half over the past 25 years. The United States International Trade Commission released a study in June 2016 on the economic impact of trade agreements. The United States International Trade Commission released a study in June 2016 on the economic impact of trade agreements, finding that they increased U.S. aggregate trade by about 3% and U.S. real GDP and employment by less than 1%. Representative Sander Levin criticized the report for failing to address the costs of workers losing jobs or factories leaving communities due to trade agreements. Most economists argue that macroeconomic forces shape trade relationships, with trade agreements having little impact on the overall size of the trade deficit. Changes at the microeconomic level, such as new trade agreements, can affect the composition of the trade deficit but not its overall size. Changes in currency exchange rates, productivity, economic policies, and the business cycle can impact the economy more than trade agreements due to the already open nature of the U.S. economy. For example, the decline in the peso in 1994 had a significant effect on U.S.-Mexico trade, surpassing the impact of NAFTA. Global labor markets and other changes have increased international competition for the domestic workforce. The global labor market has quadrupled in the past two decades due to the opening of China, India, and East European countries. China's entry into the global economy has been significant, leading to a shift towards domestic consumption. This internationalization of labor has boosted productivity and increased labor compensation in advanced economies, impacting global commodity markets. Globalization has led to rising labor compensation in advanced economies through increased productivity and output, while emerging markets have benefited from higher wages. However, increased exports from developing economies may lower wages for unskilled workers in developed countries. Despite this, most economists believe that overall, increased trade and productivity have positive effects on the economy. The IMF suggests that globalization, along with technological change, has contributed to reducing the share of income going to labor in advanced economies. The digital revolution and technological advancements have significantly impacted the distribution of income in advanced economies, especially for workers in lower-skilled sectors. Labor-linking technologies are transforming the global job landscape by connecting labor with demand in distant locations and enabling small and medium-sized firms to participate in the global economy. The rise of new technology allows workers from developing economies to connect with corporations in industrialized nations, creating competition that lowers salaries and increases unemployment in rich countries. Labor-saving technology is reducing global labor demand, but labor-linking technologies are helping emerging economies offset this decline. Trade agreements like the TPP also impact economic growth and employment. Trade agreements like the TPP can have significant effects on economic growth and employment. While economic theory suggests that open trade environments benefit the economy in the long run by promoting efficiency, there are short-term adjustment costs for some workers and producers. These costs can lead to dislocations in the labor force, companies, and communities, including closed plants, depressed property values, and lost tax revenues. The impact of trade agreements like the TPP on economic growth and employment can lead to closed plants, depressed property values, and lost tax revenues. Research organizations are analyzing the relationship between trade and employment, with the International Collaborative Initiative on Trade and Employment (ICITE) studying the economic literature on this topic. The study found that higher levels of international trade are linked to economic growth, rising wages, and increased employment. Trade liberalization also leads to higher investment, productivity, and improvements in physical and human capital. Positive correlation between trade and economic growth is dependent on supportive policies like creating a favorable investment climate and labor market, along with social protection systems. The study found that trade liberalization can lead to economic growth, higher wages, and increased employment. It also results in higher investment, productivity, and improvements in capital. Trade can have positive effects on reducing child labor, workplace injuries, and informality, while creating opportunities for female entrepreneurs. However, it may also cause frictional unemployment and income losses for displaced workers in the short run. Policies aiding workers in transitioning to new, higher productivity jobs can mitigate human costs of job changes and economic shocks. Trade liberalization alone may not guarantee rapid growth; supportive policies like stable macroeconomic policies and effective regulation are crucial. Equating job gains or losses with trade agreements is complex. The constant turnover in jobs, known as \"churn,\" is a key aspect of the U.S. economy. Job openings can arise from new businesses, expansions, or increased exports, while job losses can result from various factors like voluntary departures, business closures, or import competition. In a dynamic economy like the United States, jobs are constantly created and replaced as different industries evolve at different speeds due to technological advancements and efficiency. In dynamic economies like the United States, sectors that embrace new technologies attract more capital and labor, while those that lag behind face increased competition. Global advancements in communication and transportation have led to complex supply chains crossing borders, reshaping traditional trade. To remain viable, firms must adapt to these challenges and potentially reallocate resources. In 2016, there were 144.4 million jobs in the U.S. economy, with 10.7 million supported by exports. Job turnover accounted for 16.5% of total jobs, reflecting churning in the labor market. Job churning was more pronounced during the 2008-2010 economic recession. Since 2008-2010, job turnover in the goods-producing sector of the economy was high, ranging between 25% and 30%, reflecting shifts in employment due to the economic recession and decline in global trade. Job gains have been observed since 2011. Since 2011, job gains have exceeded losses, reducing the U.S. unemployment rate. The share of jobs supported by exports has remained steady at 10.7% to 11.2%, with goods-producing employment at 6.3% to 6.7% and services at 4.1% to 4.8%. Trade impacts workers differently across occupations, termed occupational exposure to international trade. Switching industries due to trade agreements can have substantial short-term costs for workers. The impact of trade liberalization on occupations has led to workers shifting from manufacturing to services sectors, resulting in reduced wages for those who switch jobs, especially in routine task occupations exposed to imports from low-income countries. On the other hand, occupations associated with exports have seen a positive relationship between rising incomes and growth in export shares. The approval of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China in 2000 and China's accession to the WTO in 2001 altered U.S. and global trade patterns, increasing U.S. imports from China at the expense of other Asian exporters. This had a significant impact on U.S. manufacturing employment from 2001 to 2007. The impact of Chinese imports on the U.S. economy is complex and disruptive, highlighting challenges in U.S. labor markets that hinder the adjustment process. The U.S. manufacturing sector has been undergoing restructuring for over two decades before China joined the WTO. Manufacturing employment declined by one-third between 1980 and 2014, while output nearly doubled due to increased productivity. During the 2009 recession, both employment and output in the sector decreased. From 2010 to 2017, employment increased by 8% and output by 11%. Imports from China have had a concentrated impact on certain U.S. economic sectors. The economic impact of Chinese imports on certain U.S. economic sectors and localities has been magnified. Increased import competition from China has led to higher unemployment in manufacturing, lower labor force participation, and increased use of transfer payments in some areas. Noncollege-educated workers, who are overrepresented in manufacturing, may experience long-lasting effects on local labor markets. Chinese exports' growth is attributed to various factors, including reform-induced changes, rising productivity, and lower trade barriers. Average U.S. manufacturing wages do not seem to be significantly affected by Chinese imports. Chinese imports had little effect on U.S. manufacturing wages as productive workers kept their jobs and plants innovated. Nonmanufacturing wages fell due to reduced demand for local services. Chinese productivity grew faster than U.S. productivity from 1997 to 2007, but U.S. productivity still grew at a historical pace. The impact of increased U.S. imports from China on import-competing industries is only a partial aspect of the overall economic impact. Lower-priced Chinese goods negatively affect domestic industries as consumers shift towards cheaper imports, reducing firms and workers in these industries. However, the influx of lower-priced imports also boosts real incomes for all consumers, improving overall standards of living. The influx of lower-priced imports from China boosts real incomes for all consumers, improving standards of living and increasing purchasing power. This leads to increased consumption of goods and services, spurring production and employment in other sectors of the economy. Additionally, increased exports by China raise national income, providing more opportunities for U.S. exporters to increase sales in China. Trade theory suggests that trade with China yields aggregate gains for the U.S. economy. Trade liberalization with China has led to increased investment by U.S. firms and technological innovation, boosting productivity growth. Some governments have implemented safeguards and worker retraining programs to address potential adverse effects. For example, the U.S. established the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to support workers and firms affected by trade agreements. The adjustment costs of trade liberalization can be mitigated by income support payments and retraining programs for affected workers. Governments negotiate trade agreements with consideration for these costs, sometimes facing opposition from groups within the economy. Older workers and those with limited education or skills may struggle to transition to new jobs. The United States and its trading partners use trade remedies to protect domestic industries and workers from harmful trade practices, with antidumping measures being commonly applied. The three most frequently applied U.S. trade remedies are antidumping (AD), countervailing duties (CVD), and safeguards. These measures provide relief to domestic industries from unfair trade practices such as selling goods below fair market value, subsidies from foreign governments, and serious injury from imports. The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) estimates the number of jobs in the U.S. economy supported directly and indirectly by exports using historical input-output data. The 2007 benchmark input-output table was revised in February 2014, with revisions made every five years. The ITA's approach is based on economic relationships between the value of goods and services and the number of jobs required to produce them. The International Trade Administration (ITA) estimates the number of jobs supported by U.S. exports based on the average number of jobs required for production, value of inputs, and transportation services. In 2017, ITA estimated that U.S. exports supported 10.7 million jobs, with 6.3 million in the goods producing sector and 4.4 million in the services sector. Adjusting its methodology in 2011, ITA differentiates between export price changes and labor productivity to estimate the real value of U.S. exports. The International Trade Administration (ITA) estimates that $1 billion of merchandise goods exports supports 5,223 jobs, while $1 billion of services exports supports 6,706 jobs. The share of GDP associated with exports has increased since 1990, but the number of jobs supported by exports has not significantly changed, indicating growth in labor productivity in export sectors. According to ITA estimates, jobs in export-intensive manufacturing industries earn 18% more on average than comparable jobs in other manufacturing sectors. This earning differential is attributed to factors such as greater access to international markets, technology investment, and a more highly educated workforce. U.S. labor productivity, especially in the manufacturing sector, has been robust. U.S. labor productivity in the manufacturing sector has been strong, with a doubling from 1993 to 2010. Unit labor costs in the U.S. decreased by 15% from 2002 to 2011, while rising in other countries. Export earnings premiums for blue collar workers in export industries were estimated to be 20% higher than white collar workers. Weekly earnings of workers in industries like leather, computers, and machinery supporting exports were over 30% higher than non-exporting counterparts. ITA estimates that foreign tariffs may reduce U.S. workers' earnings in manufacturing by 12% annually in certain industries. Some economists question the direct relationship between exporting and worker incomes. ITA also provides estimates on job distribution by industry supported by exports in 2013, with manufacturing accounting for 32% of all export-supported jobs. In 2013, manufacturing accounted for 32% of all export-supported jobs, with most jobs in goods-producing activities. Jobs supported by exports in the services sector accounted for 59% of total export-supported jobs, with service-related jobs making up 40.5% of goods-producing sector jobs. Jobs supported by exports in manufacturing have declined from 41.4% in 1993 to 32.4% in 2010 due to increased labor productivity. The ITA published estimates in 2015 of the number of jobs by state supported by exports of goods, including manufactured goods, natural resources, and agricultural commodities. Estimating exports by state and the number of jobs supported is challenging due to a lack of detailed export data, especially for agricultural commodities shipped on the Mississippi River. The ITA used a combination of origin of movement (OM) data and other sources to improve its estimates. The ITA used a combination of OM data and export data from the Department of Agriculture to estimate jobs supported by state-level exports. Care should be taken in interpreting the results as exports from a state may not necessarily be produced in that state. According to ITA estimates, 15 states accounted for over 70% of the jobs supported by exports. According to ITA estimates, 15 states accounted for over 70% of U.S. jobs supported by exports in 2014, with Texas and California contributing a significant portion. The employment effects of FTAs have been estimated using these numbers, with some groups using them to argue about job losses due to imports. Some argue that a trade deficit leads to job losses in the economy, as imports could replace domestic production. However, not all imports can be substituted, and they support various service-sector jobs. Job losses from imports can be concentrated, but they also create jobs in transportation, sales, finance, and other sectors. Many economists argue that equating a trade deficit with job losses is questionable. The trade deficit arises from the imbalance of saving and investment in the economy, affecting capital inflows and outflows, which in turn impact the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of exports and imports. Many economists argue that trade agreements and globalization do not significantly impact overall employment or wages in the U.S. economy. They believe that factors like productivity growth, population growth, and technological innovation play a more significant role in determining the total number of jobs and level of production. The methodology developed by ITA was unique in estimating a static number of jobs. The methodology developed by ITA was unique for estimating a static number of jobs in the U.S. economy supported by exports. ITA did not create a similar methodology for linking imports or trade deficit to jobs. Import composition differs from exports, with some imports serving as inputs for further processing. Import-competing industries have different capital and labor mix compared to export-oriented industries. ITA stated that using export data to estimate the relationship between imports and jobs is a misuse of the data. The ITA methodology estimates the number of jobs supported by exports, not imports. Using export data to estimate the relationship between imports and jobs is considered a misuse of the data. This static relationship should not be used as a multiplier to estimate changes in jobs due to trade agreements. ITA argues that its estimate of the number of jobs supported by exports should not be used to estimate potential employment effects from trade agreements. Averages derived from input-output analysis should not be used as proxies for change in employment due to factors such as prices and resource utilization. The rate of export value varies due to factors like prices, resource utilization, and productivity. Labor and capital inputs differ significantly across types of exports. Data on actual changes in employment due to tariff reductions are not available. ITA cautions against using average job estimates from exports to predict employment effects from trade agreements. According to the ITA, using trade estimates from CGE models to predict job losses may overestimate the actual number of jobs affected by trade changes. Estimates of jobs linked to exports cannot account for fluctuations in manufacturing capacity. The USITC explains that during periods of slack business activity, increased output, including exports, can boost employment and lower unemployment. Conversely, during strong business activity, increased output may have a lesser impact on employment. Increased output, especially for exports, may not significantly increase overall employment but rather shift jobs to higher-paying industries. Economists use various trade models to forecast job impacts of FTAs, with differing estimates due to different assumptions and conditions. Both proponents and opponents of FTAs use these estimates to support their positions, but they only represent a partial view of the total economic effects of FTAs. Trade models are used to estimate changes in employment between sectors of the economy based on assumptions about price changes and GDP. These models have limitations due to data constraints and theoretical issues, making it challenging to provide precise estimates of the impact of trade agreements on the economy. Some groups use alternative methods to assess these impacts. Some groups use various methods to assess the impact of trade agreements on jobs, with estimates ranging widely. While some argue that FTAs can negatively affect employment, worsen the trade deficit, and reduce wages for U.S. workers, most economists believe that the overall net effect is positive, despite acknowledging potential negative effects like job losses and lower wages. The costs and benefits of FTAs do not accrue at the same speed, with job losses felt initially and benefits accruing over time. Many economists believe that trade liberalization has little impact on income distribution. Data on nontariff barriers to trade is limited, while data on trade in goods and tariff rates drives policy discussions. The digitalization of the global economy is reshaping trade patterns, with nontariff activities playing a significant role. Global trade patterns are increasingly influenced by nontariff activities rather than traditional tariff cuts. The digital revolution is causing unpredictable effects on the economy, making it challenging to collect data and forecast its impact accurately. This challenges the relevance of traditional trade models and common measures used to assess trade agreements. Governments may resort to protecting domestic producers or vulnerable workers in response to international trade pressures, but these actions have broader implications for the economy. Firms facing price pressures can respond by upgrading production processes, outsourcing, folding, or altering the trade environment. This can involve negotiating global prices, lobbying for tariffs or subsidies. These actions may impact the economy by affecting capital and labor allocation. Efforts to protect segments of the economy from international competition have dispersed costs on the economy by affecting capital and labor allocation. The USITC provides official estimates of the impact of proposed trade agreements on the economy using the GTAP economic model. This model estimates changes in trade resulting from changes in tariff rates and rate quotas, expressing potential gains and losses as percentage effects. Trade models like computable general equilibrium models (CGE) analyze Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) by estimating gains and losses in various sectors relative to baseline economic projections. These models incorporate data from numerous countries and trade data to provide estimates, although they may lack precision due to the vast amount of data used. Trade models, such as computable general equilibrium models, analyze the effects of trade agreements on trade flows among countries. While these models were originally developed to analyze broad multilateral agreements, their lack of precision may be a drawback when estimating the effects of bilateral agreements with lower trade volumes. Assumptions made in these models, due to phased-in tariff reductions and other provisions, compromise their accuracy in estimating the impacts of trade agreements. Trade agreements aim to balance commitment to implementation schedules with flexibility for governments to adjust due to unforeseen events. Models used to estimate economic impacts of trade agreements include subjective analysis and assumptions. Nontariff measures are increasingly important and offer long-term benefits. Multilateral trade agreements have reduced tariffs, stimulating global trade and increasing economic welfare. Higher tariffs remain on politically sensitive products. The effect of trade agreements on employment is complex due to lower import prices stimulating demand, which can either increase or decrease production and employment depending on the goods. The income effect has a positive impact on demand, but the result of trade agreements on job gains or losses is ambiguous. International trade is not the main creator of jobs in the U.S. economy, with exports accounting for only 13% of GDP. Factors like productivity growth and technological innovation determine the total number of jobs. While trade agreements may have limited overall impact, they can affect specific sectors due to the nature of the trade relationship. Trade agreements can have a limited overall impact on job gains or losses in the U.S. economy. However, they can affect specific sectors due to the nature of the trade relationship. Significant data gaps hinder the ability to model the effects of trade agreements, especially in the services sector, which accounts for a large portion of output and employment in the U.S. economy. Increased trade in services offers the potential for significant gains for the U.S. economy. Trade agreements can serve as catalysts for economic growth and development by encouraging greater economic openness. They include a range of policy issues with cross-border implications, such as trade in goods and services, investment, regulatory barriers, and more. These agreements can have a significant impact on a nation's economy. Trade agreements can be crucial for economic growth and development, especially for developing countries looking to raise their standards and integrate into global economies. They also help standardize dispute resolution procedures and governance issues. Despite limitations, CGM trade models are widely used to estimate the effects of trade liberalization in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Barriers to trade in services and investment are harder to identify and quantify compared to barriers in goods. Trade models like the GTAP model aggregate vast amounts of data into manageable sizes by reducing individual commodities into categories. Tariffs in these models represent weighted averages, masking the importance of specific products within the aggregate. Trade models like the GTAP model aggregate data by reducing individual commodities into categories, masking the importance of specific products with high tariff rates. These models do not account for the speed of tariff changes affecting economies or adjust for economic changes within industries. The basic economic theories linking price changes to demand for labor and capital assume that changes in prices drive changes in the economy's input-output structure. Trade models often overlook specific labor market data needed to estimate job impacts, assuming changes in aggregate demand affect prices rather than quantities like employment. Models also assume full employment and fixed employment levels in countries involved in trade agreements. Trade models assume full employment and fixed employment levels, with gains from trade liberalization reflected in income and industry composition changes, not total employment. Analysts debate full employment assumption, but experts argue it's reasonable given long-term trade agreement implementation. Persistent low unemployment unlikely to significantly impact model results due to various assumptions. Trade models assume full employment and fixed employment levels, with gains from trade liberalization reflected in income and industry composition changes, not total employment. Analysts debate full employment assumption, but experts argue it's reasonable given long-term trade agreement implementation. Persistent low unemployment unlikely to significantly impact model results due to various assumptions. In such cases, the economy would be expected to return to full employment through market forces or government intervention. It is doubtful that populations in democratic societies would accept high levels of unemployment without expecting government action. Trade models also assume consumer indifference to the origin of goods consumed. According to academic research, consumer choices and trade flows are influenced by product variety and quality, not just price. Consumers may prefer imported goods due to perceived differences in quality compared to domestically produced goods. This means consumers consider factors beyond price when making purchasing decisions, which is not accounted for in traditional trade models. Additionally, research suggests that not all firms in the economy operate at the same level of efficiency, challenging the assumption in trade models. Research indicates that firms' productive efficiency varies by country and industry, with some operating at higher levels than others. This difference in productivity means that not all firms will be equally affected by a decline in import prices due to reduced tariff rates. Higher-efficiency firms may adjust their prices to match lower import prices, while foreign firms not part of a trade agreement may lower prices to maintain market share. Some trade models assume firms will adjust prices to match lower import prices, leading to potential job losses for less efficient firms. Other models suggest an increased export response due to assumptions about firms that may choose to participate in exporting as a result of a trade agreement. The impact of changes in tariff rates on bilateral trade, domestic employment, and output may be less than projected by trade models if firms adjust prices to maintain market shares. This adjustment could result in lower negative impacts on employment and output, especially when tariff rate changes are small. Domestic consumers would benefit from lower prices, but foreign suppliers may not see an increase in market shares. Economists note that changes in tariff rates in trade agreements may not always lead to an overall increase in market shares for domestic producers. Trade agreements can result in trade creation, with lower tariffs creating new trade opportunities, or trade diversion, where trade shifts to lower-priced competitors within the agreement. Trade agreements can lead to trade diversion to competitors with lower-priced goods due to reduced tariff rates. Countries may join agreements to prevent trade diversion. China, initially critical of the TPP, now shows interest to avoid exclusion from increased trade. Agreements also include rules for fair treatment, limiting discriminatory industrial policies. Trade agreements negotiated by the United States aim to be comprehensive and high-standard, addressing various issues that could impact trade rules between countries. The long-term effects of these agreements may surpass traditional trade models' estimates based solely on tariff rate changes. For example, the TPP includes 30 chapters covering rules in different industries like government procurement, investment, and services, which current trade models struggle to accurately predict the economic impact of. Trade models traditionally focus on estimating the economic impact of changes in trade rules, treating exports and imports as either domestic or foreign goods. However, the rise of global value chains and intra-industry trade has blurred this distinction by increasing trade in intermediate goods. Foreign value added in exports accounts for about 28% on average globally, varying by country and industry. Developed countries' exports contain about 31% foreign value added on average. The value of foreign value added in exports varies globally, with developed countries averaging about 31%. In developing countries, East and South-East Asia and Central America have high foreign-value-added shares due to processing industries. Trade in intermediate goods can impact exports, and restrictions on imports may harm a country's own exports. Global value chains have changed traditional trade counting methods, highlighting the importance of understanding the sources of goods and services in production. The expanded role of trade in goods and services through value chains has redefined the role of services in trade and increased the number of jobs tied to international trade. International trade and trade deficits may not directly impact the unemployment rate, as competition can result in job gains and losses. The trade deficit and unemployment rates are not directly related. In 2006, the U.S. had a low unemployment rate of 4.0% and a trade deficit of over $800 billion. In 2009, with a negative economic growth rate of 3.0%, unemployment rose to 9.9% but the trade deficit fell to $510 billion. Since 2010, unemployment has decreased to 4.1% while the trade deficit has averaged around $750 billion. Foreign capital inflows play a crucial role in bridging the gap between domestic capital supply and demand. Foreign capital inflows play a crucial role in bridging the gap between domestic capital supply and demand, influencing the international exchange value of the dollar and the nation's trade deficit. The savings-investment balance involves households, businesses, government, and the foreign sector. When the combination of households, businesses, and government creates a net savings deficit, interest rates rise, leading to capital inflows and an increase in the dollar's exchange rate. This results in higher export prices, lower import prices, and an increase in the current account deficit. Trade agreements can change the composition of the deficit but not its overall size. Recent changes in oil prices have impacted the U.S. trade deficit due to energy imports. The U.S. trade deficit did not decline despite the drop in oil prices from 2014 to 2015. The average price of imported crude oil fell sharply, but the quantity only decreased by 1.4%. As a result, crude oil imports accounted for about 10% of the annual U.S. trade deficit in 2015, down from over 40% in 2012. The U.S. merchandise deficit increased in 2015 despite the decline in imported crude oil's role in the trade deficit. Non-petroleum products replaced petroleum products, showing that macroeconomic forces determine the overall trade deficit value. Foreign capital inflows have accommodated the current account deficits due to U.S. demand for capital outstripping domestic sources of funds. The increase in the nation's current account deficit is supported by foreign capital inflows, keeping U.S. interest rates low. As the economy nears full employment, unemployment decreases, credit markets tighten, and capital inflows rise, strengthening the dollar. This leads to a decrease in import prices relative to export prices, worsening the trade deficit. Additionally, national income rises as the economy approaches full employment. When the U.S. economy is below its potential, reduced demands on financial markets lead to lower interest rates, a decrease in the savings-investment imbalance, and a decline in capital inflows. This results in a weaker dollar, making U.S. exports more competitive and reducing the trade deficit. Additionally, underperforming economy leads to lower national income and consumer spending, reducing demand for domestic goods and imports, further contributing to a decline in the trade deficit. The global foreign exchange market is vast, with daily trading totaling $7.7 trillion in traditional and OTC markets, far exceeding U.S. exports. The dollar acts as a \"safe haven\" currency during economic instability, attracting foreign investors and contributing to a decline in the trade deficit. The global foreign exchange market is dominated by the U.S. dollar, accounting for 87.0% of the turnover in April 2013. Opponents and proponents of trade agreements disagree on the impact on employment, with some arguing that agreements lead to job losses in the U.S. by encouraging outsourcing. However, evidence suggests that these instances are isolated rather than a general pattern. Some economists argue that the relationship between domestic production, foreign investment, and trade has become complicated due to global value chains. This involves \"trade in tasks\" rather than traditional \"trade in goods.\" In 2005, all developed economies were involved in offshore manufacturing to varying degrees. The United States ranked fourth from last among OECD countries with 7% of manufacturing activity occurring offshore. Firms have increased investment abroad, but it's unclear if they shifted operations from the US to replace domestic production with foreign production for export or to serve foreign markets. Intra-firm trade accounted for a significant portion of US exports and imports in 2012, but has declined over the past decade due to the rise of global value chains. BEA collects data on US parent companies and their foreign affiliates, but not specifically for this purpose. Since the late 1990s, comprehensive data specifically capturing the closing of US production facilities and the opening of facilities abroad has not been collected by any US government entity. In addition to traditional equity-based direct investment, there is a rise in various types of nonequity investments through global value chains, reflecting a new phase in economic globalization where multinational corporations and workers establish interdependent networks of operations through forms such as partial ownership, joint ventures, contract manufacturing, logistics management, franchising, and licensing. Such forms of control are evident in coordinating and controlling activities of partner firms. Global trade patterns in industries like automotive components, consumer electronics, apparel, hotels, and information technology are being shaped by forms of control over partner firms. Critics of trade agreements argue that globalization has contributed to growing wealth and income inequality within countries by favoring high-skilled workers. While the direct impact of trade agreements on income inequality is debated in academic literature, it is generally agreed that other factors within the economy play a significant role in determining income distribution over the long term. The impact of trade agreements on income inequality is debated in academic literature. In developed economies like the United States, trade is considered less important compared to other factors. However, in developing countries, trade can have a greater effect on income distribution. Factors such as a country's trade protection pattern, the form of liberalization, and market flexibility all play a role in determining the impact of globalization on inequality. The impact of trade agreements on income inequality is debated in academic literature, with factors such as within-country labor and capital mobility, skill-biased technological change, and the effects of globalization being case specific. Opponents of trade agreements argue that international trade can lead to growing income inequality, citing the factor-price equalization theorem and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem as evidence. Countries equalizing prices of traded goods can lead to equalizing factor prices like labor and capital. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem suggests that factors used more in a nation's exports benefit the most, increasing income inequality. Trade may increase income inequality in capital-intensive economies like the US, where capital gains more rewards, while it could promote income equality in labor-intensive developing economies where labor benefits more. Empirical research and experience have not supported the impact of trade on income distribution as predicted by economic theorems. Both developed and developing economies have seen growing income inequality despite trade liberalization. Firm-level data shows that exporting companies pay higher wages, but the usefulness of economic theorems in practical terms is questioned by some economists. Some economists question the practical applicability of economic theorems on income distribution, especially in the context of U.S. trade with countries of similar economic development. Trade involving similar products and complex supply chains challenges traditional concepts of comparative advantage. Some economists challenge traditional economic theorems on income distribution in the context of U.S. trade with similar economies, citing the open nature of the U.S. economy and the limited impact of trade agreements on income distribution. Academic research is ongoing on the relationship between trade and income inequality, with growing support for the idea that factors like technology and foreign investment have a more significant effect on income distribution. The dismantling of trade barriers in developing countries has increased exposure to foreign technologies, but other factors like technology and foreign investment have a more significant impact on income inequality. Trade liberalization and export growth are linked to lower income inequality, while financial openness, mainly through foreign direct investment, is associated with higher inequality. Technological change has been a major driver of rising inequality, especially in developing countries. Technological progress and globalization have led to increased income inequality, with a focus on higher skills and returns to capital. The impact of trade on jobs, wages, and income distribution remains debated. Income inequality is a global issue affecting both developed and developing countries. The OECD suggests that trade liberalization is not the main driver of employment changes. The OECD concludes that globalization contributes to the decline in the share of labor in national income, with at least 10% attributed to pressures from global value chain relocation and competition from imports. Increased international competition reduces rent shared by employers and workers, impacting workers' bargaining power. The role of globalization in income and wage inequality in OECD countries is complex, as it is challenging to separate from technological change. The report highlighted that income inequality has increased in OECD countries over the past few decades, coinciding with a rise in trade with emerging markets like China and India. This global trade growth may have led to downward pressure on wages, contributing to the income gap in both developed and developing economies. The OECD report highlighted that income inequality has increased in several countries during the 2000s, while falling in others. The impact of trade on income inequality is inconclusive, with studies showing varying effects depending on the country, the importance of trade in its economy, and the nature of trade liberalization. The report also concluded that rising trade integration and financial openness do not significantly impact wage inequality or employment trends within OECD countries. The effect of trade on income inequality is inconclusive, with increased import penetration from low-income countries heightening wage dispersion in countries with weak employment protection legislation. Financial flows and technological change primarily affect inequality through foreign direct investment and technological progress, increasing wage dispersion in the upper half of the distribution. Regulatory reforms to strengthen competition and labor market adaptability have a positive impact on employment levels. Institutional reforms such as changes in household structure, self-employment, part-time employment, income tax rates, and worker benefit programs also play a role in income distribution. Changes in income tax rates, reductions in worker benefit programs, and widening wage disparities in part-time employment contribute to the increase in wage disparities between skilled and unskilled workers. The rise in the supply of skilled workers offsets the increase in wage dispersion associated with technological progress and regulatory reforms. The growth in average educational attainment has been crucial in reducing wage dispersion among workers and increasing employment rates. Congress faces challenges in considering the Trump Administration's trade policy approach. The Trump Administration's trade policy includes reconsidering opposition to TPP, potential T-TIP, NAFTA renegotiation, and use of tariffs. TPP and T-TIP could open major markets for U.S. exports and lead to reforms in developing economies. Concerns about job impacts vary due to different trade models' predictions, highlighting limitations. Estimates of the employment effects of trade agreements reveal limitations in current models and data. Congress may seek to enhance predictive capabilities by improving existing models, contracting with private entities for new models, and conducting oversight on U.S. trade data. These efforts could provide greater insights into dynamic adjustments, improved job estimates related to international trade, sector-specific impact assessments, and a more informed evaluation of trade agreement potential. Recent research indicates that adjustment costs from trade agreements can impact workers, firms, and communities, with some local labor markets facing prolonged periods of unemployment or underemployment. Congress may need to review current efforts to assist in adjusting to market changes. Congress may need to review current efforts to assist workers and firms in adjusting to changes in product and labor markets. Trade data by state are often unreliable, making it difficult to assess the impact of FTAs on employment and production within states. Congress could explore improving the way trade data are collected to enhance the reliability of state-level data."
