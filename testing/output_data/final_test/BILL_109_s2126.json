    "content": "The \"Family Entertainment Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to family entertainment. Research shows that exposure to various forms of media can have powerful effects on children and adolescents, with both positive and negative outcomes depending on the content. Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of violence in media can lead to increased violent thoughts, anti-social behavior, fear, anxiety, hostility, and desensitization to the suffering of others, even years after exposure. This evidence has been consistently replicated over decades. New research shows that exposure to violent media, including video games, leads to increased aggression in both the short-term and long-term. Multiple studies have concluded that there is a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior, as supported by major medical and public health organizations. Research shows that the interactive nature of video games can shape children's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Children are more likely to imitate characters they identify with, especially in violent video games where players take on aggressive roles and are rewarded for aggressive actions. The video game industry is highlighted for its impact on behavior. The video game industry, through the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, self-regulates and provides information to parents about game content. Certain games are rated Mature and Adults-Only for intense violence and explicit sexual content. Research shows parental monitoring reduces negative effects of violent media. Parents rely on ratings to protect children, but studies show youth can still access inappropriate games. Legislation is needed to ensure the meaningfulness of the ratings system, as young people can easily access Mature-rated games. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include \"business\" as any lawful activity primarily involving the purchase, sale, lease, or manufacture of goods or services, \"Commission\" as the Federal Trade Commission, and \"Entertainment Software Ratings Board\" as an independent rating system for consumer information. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a video game as an electronic device that stores data and creates interactive games. It is developed to provide information to consumers about video and computer games. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES TO MINORS. No business can sell or rent Mature, Adults-Only, or Ratings Pending video games to individuals under 17 years old. Businesses can defend against prosecution by verifying the buyer's age with a valid ID or having a ratings enforcement policy in place. The requirements for businesses selling or renting video games to minors include cash register prompts for age verification, clear labels indicating game ratings, and signs explaining the ratings enforcement policy. The ratings enforcement policy for businesses selling or renting video games to minors includes age verification systems for online sales. Repeat violators will be prohibited from using certain defenses in prosecution. Managers found in violation may face civil penalties or community service up to $1,000 or 100 hours for the first offense. For violating the ratings enforcement policy, first offense penalties include $1,000 or 100 hours of community service, with subsequent violations resulting in $5,000 or 500 hours of community service. SEC. 5. ANNUAL ANALYSIS TO PREVENT RATINGS SLIPPAGE. The Commission will contract an organization to evaluate video game content annually to ensure Entertainment Software Ratings Board ratings remain consistent and reliable. The analysis will assess a random sample of games, compare ratings over time, and compare them to other rating systems. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT SECRET AUDITS. The Commission will conduct secret audits annually to determine if minors can purchase video games with certain ratings successfully. They will also investigate misleading ratings. The Commission will investigate embedded content in video games accessed through keystroke combinations or pass-codes to determine the proportion of games with inconsistent ratings, known by manufacturers, and their capacity to prevent such content. The Commission will investigate embedded content in video games accessed through keystroke combinations or pass-codes to determine inconsistencies with game ratings. Congress expects the Commission to take appropriate action if discrepancies are found, and a report must be submitted within one year of the Act's enactment. The Bureau of Consumer Protection under the Federal Trade Commission allows consumers to file complaints about misleading video game content descriptions. Complaints will be handled through the same procedure as other deceptive advertising complaints. The Bureau will report annually to Congress on the number of complaints against video game manufacturers. The Act will take effect 120 days after enactment."
