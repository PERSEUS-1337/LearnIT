    "content": "The Act titled \"Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Improvement Act of 2009\" includes special rules for modification or disposition of qualified mortgages or foreclosure property by real estate mortgage investment conduits. The Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Improvement Act of 2009 provides special rules for REMICs modifying or disposing troubled assets under the Troubled Asset Relief Program without being treated as prohibited transactions under the Internal Revenue Code. The REMIC shall cease to be a REMIC if the instruments restrict servicers from modifying or disposing of qualified mortgages or foreclosure property. Proceeds from such actions are treated as amounts received under qualified mortgages. The REMIC will lose its status if it restricts servicers from modifying or disposing of qualified mortgages or foreclosure property. This includes preventing reasonable modifications or dispositions, purchasing defaulted mortgages for modification purposes, and failing to fulfill duties when modifying or disposing of qualified mortgages. The REMIC will lose its status if it restricts servicers from modifying or disposing of qualified mortgages or foreclosure property. Modifications or dispositions must benefit the trust as a whole, not individual investors. Effective dates for these provisions vary, with subsection (a) applying to modifications after enactment and subsection (b) taking effect three months later, with potential waivers by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary may grant a waiver if an entity is unable to comply with the requirements in a timely manner or if the waiver would further the purposes of the Act. Establishment of a home mortgage loan relief program under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and related authorities. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to modify troubled home mortgage loans and dispose of foreclosure properties. Rules will be implemented for the modification and disposition of these loans and properties.

They will use various authorities to implement the relief program, including loan purchases, guarantees, and buying down interest rates. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to pay servicers for home mortgage loan modifications or other dispositions consistent with established rules. Standard home mortgage loan modification and disposition protocols will be developed to ensure servicer actions align with the Secretary's guidelines. The Secretary of the Treasury will develop standard industry practice protocols for home mortgage loan modifications and dispositions."
