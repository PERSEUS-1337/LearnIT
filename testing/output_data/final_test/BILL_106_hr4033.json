    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000\". Congress finds that the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty would significantly decrease with the protection of armor vests. Studies show that wearing an armor vest reduces the risk of fatality by 14 times. Bullet-resistant materials have saved the lives of over 2,000 officers between 1985 and 1994. The Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements reports a sharp rise in violent crime in Indian country, despite a decrease in the national crime rate, concluding a \"public safety crisis in Indian country.\" SEC. 3. MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ARMOR VESTS. Section 2501(f) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to limit matching funds for grants to purchase armor vests for law enforcement. The grant portion may not exceed 50 percent and shall equal 50 percent for units of local government with fewer than 100,000 residents, subject to certain conditions. Section 2501(g) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to allocate funds without regard to population size, prioritizing units of local government with fewer than 100,000 residents. Remaining funds will be awarded to other qualifying applicants. Applications for grants in conjunction with purchases are also addressed in the amendment. The amendment to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 allows for grant applications to be submitted along with purchases of armor vests. Grant funds cannot be used for the purchase unless the applicant acknowledges the uncertainty of receiving the grant and agrees to proceed with the purchase regardless. The definition of armor vests is also expanded to include body armor. The amendment expands the definition of armor vests to include body armor meeting NIJ Standard 0115.00 requirements. It also authorizes appropriations for this purpose. Authorization of Appropriations for body armor meeting NIJ Standard 0115.00 requirements is increased to $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Passed the House of Representatives on July 26, 2000."
