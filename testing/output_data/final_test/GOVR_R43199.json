The energy sector is the second-largest consumer of water at 14%, behind agriculture at 71%. Factors such as biofuels production and expanding oil and gas production contribute to the energy sector's rapid growth in water consumption. Water dependence poses a risk for hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation during low-flow or high-heat events. Thermoelectric cooling water usage is a significant portion of national freshwater withdrawals and consumption. Withdrawal and discharge of cooling water can harm aquatic organisms. Human-induced seismic events related to oil and gas wastewater injection are a concern. Efficiency and conservation measures can help reduce water demand in energy generation. Current water efficiency incentives in fuel production aim to reduce water demand by minimizing costs and operational disruptions. The expansion of U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas production has raised concerns about the water and other resources embedded in energy sources. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for more comprehensive data and research to make effective policy choices regarding the energy-water nexus. The U.S. energy sector faces challenges with data consistency, accuracy, and cost in maintaining high-quality data. Despite these challenges, access to relevant research and data is improving, with the Department of Energy disseminating energy-water related studies. A 2014 report by DOE identified data gaps and technology opportunities to reduce water demands in the energy sector. Reports on the energy-water nexus highlight the impact of climate change on regional water resources. The stresses of climate change on the energy-water nexus are discussed, with a focus on regional water resource challenges for fuel production. Water demand for unconventional fuel production is growing in regions with existing water competition or concerns. The cumulative water needs of multiple drilling and fracturing operations can be significant. Water use for shale gas, tight gas, and tight oil wells is concentrated in the early stages of development, with little to no water required once the well is producing. Groundwater and surface waters are used, with gaps in data availability on source water. Developers may obtain water from municipalities or landowners in cases of limited access. The water intensity of fuel production varies, with natural gas requiring the least water and irrigated biofuels the most. Data gaps exist for oil production techniques. Hydraulic fracturing wells have lower water intensity but high simultaneous water demand in regions with multiple wells. The use of water for stimulating oil production from conventional wells through water flooding and enhanced oil recovery is the largest water use by the oil and gas sector in the United States. The extent to which saline, wastewaters, or freshwater will be used in these techniques is unclear due to limited data on production rates and quantities for many saline aquifers. Each fuel and production technique has its own risks, water quality impacts, and wastewater issues, with data remaining poor on the range of wastewater quantities and qualities derived from conventional and unconventional fuel production. The vulnerability of fuel production to freshwater availability is a concern. The vulnerability of fuel production to freshwater availability is a concern due to increasing water demands and changes to water supplies. Low flow and drought conditions have impacted water availability and increased costs in certain locations. Fossil fuel transport can also be disrupted by water conditions such as floods, storms, and droughts. Analysis is needed on the risk posed by multi-year droughts in areas of intense water use for energy. The largest byproduct of fuel production is produced water, with approximately 2.3 billion gallons generated daily from onshore oil and gas wells in the United States. By 2025, the ratio of produced water to oil is expected to average 12:1 for onshore crude oil. U.S. energy-related wastewaters mainly come from conventional oil, natural gas, and coal bed methane, with shale gas potentially producing less wastewater per unit of recovered gas. Disposal of shale wastewaters is a concern. Management of energy-related wastewaters is rapidly evolving, with different techniques used in various locations to address water quality and seismicity concerns. Producers are increasingly recycling and reusing produced water in fracturing operations to reduce freshwater usage and alleviate stress on disposal sites. However, this may lead to increased transport and handling of saline waters, potentially raising the risk of spills and human-induced seismic events associated with oil and gas activities. The increase in seismicity in the central and eastern United States is linked to the rise in disposal wells for oil and gas wastewater injection. While over 30,000 injection wells are used for wastewater disposal in the US, only a few are connected to seismic events of magnitude greater than 3. The largest seismic events associated with injection appear to involve faulting deeper than the wastewater injection. The injection process involves faulting deeper than wastewater injection, increasing earthquake potential. State and federal actions impact produced water management in Texas, where disposal is through deep-well injection or evaporation ponds. Interest in water reuse is growing due to limited availability and drought conditions. Pennsylvania regulations limit surface water disposal, leading to increased produced water recycling for shale gas production. In Pennsylvania, operators must prepare a wastewater reduction strategy for shale gas fracking. The EPA has proposed discontinuing discharge standards for CBM wastewaters due to economic challenges. Water availability issues can impact hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation. Fuel and power plant choices will determine long-term water use and vulnerability. An assessment of drought vulnerability in electric generation in the western United States found most basins had limited disruption risk, with strategies to mitigate risks. The Pacific Northwest and Texas were identified as regions at greater risk due to heavy reliance on hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation, respectively. No similar assessment has been done for the eastern United States. Assessment of grid drought vulnerability in the eastern United States was conducted. In 2011, Texas faced high temperatures leading to increased electricity demand, while drought reduced water available for cooling generators. The grid operator implemented emergency alerts, urging customer conservation to prevent outages. Peak demand purchases in the electricity market reached the market cap. Only one Texas plant had water-curtailed generation during the drought. During the 2012 drought, some power plants curtailed operations due to water access or temperature issues. Congress mandated the Secretary of Energy to assess climate change risks for water supply to federal hydroelectric generators every five years. The 2013 report highlighted potential impacts on hydropower generation, water quality, critical species habitat, and other water uses. The 2013 report highlighted potential impacts on hydropower generation, water quality, critical species habitat, and other important water uses that indirectly affect hydropower generation. The median decrease in annual generation at federal projects is projected to be less than 2 billion kWh (2% of total), with high climate-model uncertainty. Extreme water years will pose challenges to water managers, especially in systems with limited reservoir storage and operational flexibility. Large reservoirs and reservoir systems are most affected by multi-year droughts, as seen in the summer of 2013 in the Colorado River Basin. More than 80% of U.S. electricity is generated at thermoelectric facilities that depend on cooling water. Thermoelectric power plants heavily rely on cooling water, with 45% of total water withdrawals in 2010 coming from these facilities. Two common cooling methods are once-through cooling and evaporative cooling, with newer plants in arid regions favoring the latter. Proposed power plants are considering using reclaimed wastewater, fresh groundwater, or dry cooling technologies to reduce water consumption. Once-through cooling requires continuous water availability for plant operations, limiting its use for other purposes. Evaporative cooling consumes more water at the facility than once-through cooling. Technologies like dry cooling and hybrid dry-wet cooling can reduce freshwater use in power plant operations. These options may use degraded water supplies and alternative fluids, but they can be less efficient and more costly. Thermoelectric withdrawals decreased by 20% from 2005 to 2010 due to more water-efficient cooling methods. In 2010, thermoelectric withdrawals were 20% lower than in 2005 due to the use of more water-efficient cooling technology by new power plants. Future withdrawals for electric generation may vary depending on factors like reduced generation from facilities using once-through cooling or shifts in electricity generation sources. Water consumption could increase with more water-consumptive cooling methods and the addition of carbon capture technologies to power plants. Power plants also use water for handling solid waste and operating wet flue gas desulfurization scrubbers. In 2013, the EPA proposed revisions to Clean Water Act rules for power plants' wastewater discharges, aiming to reduce water use by 19%-58%. Policy makers are considering how to address the energy sector's water needs, with private entities making many water decisions. The public sector influences private water decisions through various means like tax incentives and permits. Energy choices involve complex tradeoffs, including water use and wastewater byproducts. Policy makers prioritize factors like low-cost reliable energy, energy independence, climate change mitigation, public health, and job creation over water concerns. Evaluating energy-water tradeoffs can be challenging, with options to minimize water use, facilitate access to water, or improve decisions and data. Some energy alternatives like solar photovoltaics and wind turbines have minimal energy-water tradeoffs but may face other challenges like intermittent production. Low-carbon energy tradeoffs include intermittent production, reduced dispatchability, transport, and storage challenges. Some fuels are easier to store and transport, while others require new infrastructure. Low-carbon energy may not always mean low water or environmental impact. Analyzing these complexities for decision-making is often incomplete, influencing future energy and water policies. Policy decisions impacting future energy and water policies are being made."
