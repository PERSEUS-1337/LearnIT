It includes provisions for investigation, source identification, assessment, reduction, removal, and prevention of marine debris. Additionally, it establishes the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee and the Federal marine debris information clearinghouse. The \"Marine Debris Act Reauthorization Amendments of 2010\" addresses the impacts of marine debris on the environment, safety, and economy. It includes provisions for investigation, source identification, assessment, reduction, removal, and prevention of marine debris. Additionally, it establishes the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee and the Federal marine debris information clearinghouse. The Marine Debris Program, established within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, investigates, identifies sources of, assesses, reduces, removes, and prevents marine debris. It aims to address adverse impacts on the marine environment, navigation safety, and the economy, focusing on derelict fishing gear. The Marine Debris Program, under NOAA, focuses on investigating, analyzing, and assessing plastics' impact on the marine environment. It also establishes processes to inventory marine debris types and their impacts in US waters, including measures to identify sources and movement of marine debris using various data sources. The Administrator shall improve efforts to prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris, including addressing land-based sources, developing fishing gear modifications, implementing nonregulatory measures, and strategies for recovery. The Administrator will develop strategies for preventing and removing marine debris in US waters, including protocols for removing derelict fishing gear. National and regional coordination will be undertaken to assist States, tribes, and organizations in addressing area-specific marine debris issues. The Administrator will develop tools and products to improve efforts in addressing marine debris, including best practices, monitoring protocols, technology, and reporting methods. The Administrator, through the Marine Debris Program, may lead international efforts to reduce marine debris by promoting effective prevention and removal measures in international agreements and developing standardized reporting guidelines. The curr_chunk discusses guidelines for improving information collection and monitoring of marine debris, promoting best practices, establishing public-private partnerships for pilot programs, providing assistance to federal agencies in addressing marine debris prevention, and supporting international efforts. The curr_chunk focuses on implementing recommendations from the National Research Council report on tackling marine debris in the 21st century dated 2008. The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act is amended to include a Global Marine Debris Coordination Conference to be held every four years starting in 2015. The conference will involve domestic and international marine debris experts. The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act is amended to redefine certain terms and add a new definition for \"Indian tribe\" as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act is amended to include a new definition for \"marine debris\" as any man-made object discarded or abandoned in the coastal or marine environment. The Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act is amended to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015."
