    "content": "The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" requires states to establish a reserve trust system for child support. This system must meet specific requirements outlined in section 454C of the Social Security Act. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" mandates states to establish a State reserve trust unit to enforce laws requiring procedures for withholding anticipated future child support on real property sales or refinancing. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" requires withholding net proceeds from property sales or refinancing to pay overdue support, determine future child support, and hold funds in trust for the benefit of the child. The \"Child Support Reserve Trust Act\" mandates withholding proceeds to pay overdue child support, holding funds in trust for the child's benefit, and applying withheld amounts to satisfy overdue support if other remedies are insufficient. The State reserve trust unit adjusts support obligations for a child and promptly redistributes any excess funds held in trust to the person if the amounts are insufficient. If the person does not owe overdue child support, the trust unit must terminate the trust and distribute the withheld amounts to the person. The section defines anticipated future child support as the present value of each payment due under the support obligation, assuming it will cease when the child reaches a certain age or due to death. The termination of the support obligation can occur due to a final judicial act or any other circumstance under State law that is permanent and substantial."
