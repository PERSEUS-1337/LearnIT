    "content": "The \"Rural Transportation Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a provision for a Rural Road Safety Program. Congress finds it vital to establish a rural road safety program for enhancing public safety on rural two-lane highways. The Secretary will implement this program by apportioning funds to each State based on the percentage of centerline mileage of two-lane roads in rural areas. The rural road safety program allocates funds based on ownership ratios of eligible two-lane road mileage in rural areas. Funds are only for specific activities, and the Secretary can waive certain provisions for fund obligation. The Secretary can waive provisions deemed inconsistent with the program's purposes. The Federal share for projects is 80%, and State apportionments for rural road safety cannot be transferred. States can use funds for various road improvements like alignment, skid resistance, and guardrails. Each State receiving funding must conduct an engineering survey of two-lane rural roads to identify dangerous areas and prioritize corrections, including installing safety features like guardrails, traffic lights, and signage. Each State must establish an evaluation process to analyze safety improvement project results and prioritize corrections based on cost-benefit data. States are required to report progress on safety improvement projects to the Secretary annually. Each State must assess the cost and safety benefits of safety improvement projects to mitigate dangers and report progress annually to the Secretary for the rural road safety program. The Secretary will then submit a report to the Senate and House Committees on the States' progress. The rural road safety program requires States to assess cost and safety benefits of safety improvement projects, analyze distribution by cost range and methods used, and evaluate compliance with improvement schedules. Definitions include rural area, rural road, and Secretary of Transportation. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the program. Authorization of $1 billion for the Rural Road Safety Program annually from 2005 to 2010. SEC. 3. Division between certain areas amended in title 23, United States Code. SEC. 4. Special rule for areas less than 5,000 population amended in title 23, United States Code. SEC. 5. Highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation. SEC. 5 amends Section 144 of title 23, United States Code regarding highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation. It includes changes in state apportionment of funds and the division of funds between states, cities, towns, and counties. Additionally, subsection (g)(3) increases the percentage of funds allocated and updates the timeframe for authorization of appropriations to 2005 through 2010. \"Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2010 is set at $20,000,000 under Section 504(b) of title 23, United States Code. State planning and research are addressed in Section 7.\" SEC. 7 amends Section 505 of title 23, United States Code by increasing the percentage of funds to be distributed to local governments for transportation planning in nonmetropolitan areas. SEC. 8 addresses the Appalachian Regional Commission. Authorization of $611,800,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for the Appalachian development highway system program for fiscal years 2005 through 2010. Funds to be apportioned among states based on cost estimates, with $11,800,000 allocated to local development districts before state apportionment. The bill authorizes $11,800,000 annually to local development districts for regional transportation planning activities, linking transportation and economic development. Funds can be used for constructing highways and access roads, with the Federal share of project costs determined by section 14501 of title 40, United States Code. Funds available for constructing highways and access roads under section 14501 of title 40, United States Code, remain available until expended."
