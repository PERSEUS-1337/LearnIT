    "content": "This report discusses options for technologies to reduce the Navy's dependence on oil for its ships, including reducing energy use, alternative fuels, nuclear propulsion, and sail/solar power. Legislative activity and a GAO report on Navy studies and efforts for new propulsion technologies are also covered. One strategy for reducing the Navy's dependence on oil is to decrease energy use on Navy ships. The Department of Defense testified that DOD's energy use accounts for 1.2% of total U.S. energy use, with mobility fuels for aircraft, ships, and vehicles making up 74% of total energy use. Jet fuel represents 58% of DOD's consumption, while marine diesel fuel accounts for 13%. The Navy uses about 41 million barrels of oil per year for all purposes, spending $900 million on fuel for ships and aircraft in FY2005. Reducing energy use on fossil-fueled Navy ships can lower fuel costs, increase cruising range, and enhance operational flexibility. This can lead to a decrease in Navy costs for fuel-related force structure and infrastructure. The Navy has been working on improving fuel efficiency since 1977, focusing on legacy systems. The Navy has reduced fuel consumption of ship and aircraft fleet by 15% and 6% respectively through deployment of technologies primarily through low-cost routes. However, fuel efficiency is not a high priority in future system design, leading to undervaluation of fuel saving technologies that promise increased performance. The Navy's DT&E program focuses on improving fuel efficiency of ships, with funding peaking in 1984. Options for power-plant and hull-system improvements could increase fuel efficiency by 3% to 8%. Other enhancements like hull coatings, auxiliary systems, and controls could further improve efficiency. Dr. Amory Lovins, director of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and a member of the DSB task force, estimated in 2001 that up to 30% of the Navy's non-aviation fuel is used for hotel loads. A study by RMI on the Aegis cruiser Princeton (CG-59) found potential for 20 to 50% electric savings in hotel loads, with operational changes requiring minimal investment. Naval Sea Systems Command engineers estimated a 19% savings on similar ships, with Princeton ranking in the top efficiency quartile. The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) team found that retrofitting motors, pumps, fans, chillers, lights, and potable water systems on the Aegis cruiser Princeton could save an estimated 20-50% of the ship's electricity, cutting total fuel use by 10-25%. The team calculated that saving a kilowatt-hour is worth 27 cents due to inefficient fuel usage. The high cost of fuel delivery by \"oiler\" ships makes energy efficiency measures like improving motors and chillers on ships very valuable. For example, a 1% improvement in a 100-horsepower motor is worth $1,000 annually, while each chiller could save about $120,000 every eight months. Automatic activation of backup systems could save around $400,000 per year, with significant savings possible from optimizing fire pumps. In critical facilities like refineries, pressurizing pipes with a 2-hp pump can ensure firefighting water readiness. Princeton's potential electricity savings could cut energy costs by nearly $1 million a year, improving warfighting capability. The bulbous bow, like the Taylor Bow and Inui Bow, can increase fuel efficiency on ships. The bulbous bow, known for increasing fuel efficiency on ships, has been applied to Navy ships like aircraft carriers and destroyers. Studies show that fitting a bow bulb onto a destroyer could reduce fuel use by 3.9%, saving thousands of barrels of fuel per year. The Navy has considered incorporating bulbous bows into more ships to achieve significant fuel savings. The near-surface bow bulb designed for the DDG-51 could save $200 million in fuel costs. A stern flap for a Navy surface combatant in 2000 cost about $170,000 and showed an annual fuel reduction of 6.0% to 7.5%. DOD testified in September 2006 that the savings for DDG-51s would be about 7.5%, resulting in a potential savings of almost $195,000 per ship. The Navy installed stern flaps on 98 ships by November 2004, saving $44 million in fuel costs. By 2005, stern flap installations were projected to save 446,000 barrels of fuel per year. The use of bulbous bows and stern flaps on surface ships resulted in a 15% increase in fuel efficiency. Applying special coatings to Navy ship propellers could reduce fuel use by 4-5% and pay for itself within a year. The U.S. Navy and other navies, along with commercial ship operators, have experimented with coatings to reduce propeller friction and prevent corrosion, leading to higher efficiency and reduced maintenance. The Navy plans to test a coating on scale models of ships. More efficient gas turbines, like the WR-21 engine, could significantly decrease fuel use in Navy ships. The WR-21 engine was developed by the U.S., UK, and French governments for potential use on future warships at a cost of $400 million. The WR-21 gas turbine, developed for potential use on Navy ships, could reduce fuel use by 25%-30%. The Navy considered it for the DD-21 destroyer program, with estimated savings of $1.5 million per year in fuel costs. Improved fuel economy could also lead to a 30% increase in weapons payload. The WR-21 gas turbine, developed for Navy ships, could reduce fuel use by 25%-30% and increase weapons payload by 30% for the DD-21 destroyer program. The Navy ultimately chose the LM-2500 for the DDG-1000 propulsion system, while the UK selected the WR-21 for its Type 45 destroyer. An integrated electric-drive propulsion system can significantly reduce a ship's fuel consumption by 10-25%, with estimates of 15-19% savings for a surface combatant ship. This technology allows for new propeller configurations that can further decrease fuel usage by 4-15%, depending on the ship type. The Navy's integrated electric-drive system can lead to fuel savings ranging from 4-15% depending on the ship type and propeller configuration. The DDG-1000 destroyers will use a more advanced motor type called the advanced induction motor (AIM), while the submarine community is exploring more torque-dense technologies like permanent magnet motors (PMM) and high-temperature superconducting (HTS) synchronous motors. DRS Technologies has proposed expanding the Navy's electric-drive propulsion equipment. DRS Technologies has proposed expanding the Navy's program for modernizing its DDG-51s by adding electric-drive propulsion equipment to the ships' existing mechanical-drive plants. The added equipment, including motor-generators, would improve fuel efficiency by 15%, increase electrical power, reduce maintenance, enhance damage resilience, and decrease susceptibility to attack. The proposal would cost $15.5 million for design and engineering, with additional procurement costs. DRS Technologies proposed adding electric-drive propulsion equipment to Navy's DDG-51s, costing $15.5 million for design and engineering. Installation costs per ship would be recovered in about three years through reduced fuel costs. Installing on 20 ships could save $200 million in life-cycle savings. Fuel cell technology could substantially reduce Navy ship fuel use by generating electricity more efficiently than combustion. Navy's shipboard gas turbine engines operate at 16-18% efficiency, while fuel cell systems offer higher efficiency. The Office of Naval Research is developing a fuel cell system with 37 to 52 percent efficiency, which could save the Navy over $1 million per ship per year in fuel costs. Fuel cell technology offers advantages such as reduced maintenance costs, emissions, acoustic signature, and radar cross section. Fuel cell technology offers advantages such as reduced maintenance costs, emissions, acoustic signature, radar cross section, ship survivability, and design flexibility. There is strong interest in developing shipboard fuel cell technology in Europe, Japan, and the United States for both powering shipboard equipment and propulsion. ONR and NAVSEA have a shipboard fuel cell program for Navy ships with comparable cost, weight, and volume to other options. The Navy is exploring fuel cell technology for shipboard applications, with plans for acquisition consideration in 3 to 5 years. Another strategy involves shifting to alternative hydrocarbon fuels like biodiesel, which has been increasingly used at Navy installations and in non-tactical vehicles. The federal government opened its first alternative-fuel service station in 2000, offering E85 fuel and compressed natural gas, with the services later using B20 fuel for non-tactical vehicles at various bases. The Navy began producing biodiesel fuel in 2003 at the Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center in CA. By 2005, a memorandum required all non-tactical diesel vehicles to operate on B20 fuel. This shift to biodiesel was recognized with an award from the National Biodiesel Board in June 2005. The National Biodiesel Board awarded the Navy for its leadership in using biodiesel fuel. The 2005 NRAC study recommended a long-term commitment to domestically produced liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The 2005 NRAC study recommended that the Department of Defense take action to develop a domestic infrastructure for manufactured liquid hydrocarbon fuels and ensure compatibility with military equipment. The 2005 NRAC study recommended that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition advocate for multiyear procurement authority to finance large-scale FT plants for producing transportation fuels. It also suggested that the Chief of Naval Research monitor the FT plant authorized by P.L. 109-58 and use the fuel for testing vehicles. ONR expressed interest in exploring methods for producing synthetic fuels, potentially at sea, and miniaturizing Germany's World War II fuel processing technology for land- and sea-based platforms. George Solhan, ONR's director of naval expeditionary maneuver warfare and combating terrorism science and technology, discussed the potential for miniaturizing synthetic fuel production for land- and sea-based platforms at a conference in Panama City, FL. The idea originated from recommendations by the Naval Research Advisory Committee, with a focus on investigating energy availability in operational sea bases. Solhan mentioned the possibility of including this program in the Innovative Naval Prototype effort, inspired by Germany's past success in synthetic fuel production. George Solhan, ONR's director of naval expeditionary maneuver warfare and combating terrorism science and technology, discussed the potential for miniaturizing synthetic fuel production for land- and sea-based platforms. The idea is to investigate energy availability in operational sea bases and potentially include this program in the Innovative Naval Prototype effort. Solhan mentioned the scalability of a ship-based processing system for expanded production capacity, with a notional demonstration project starting on land and moving to a sea-based system. Synthetic fuel could be produced from sources like methane and coal in case of disruptions in petroleum supplies or refining capacity. A worldwide infrastructure for coal mining and delivery already exists, making it a viable option for synthetic fuel production. Ships regularly transport 500,000 metric tons of coal globally. A study by the Air Force identified coal conversion into synthetic fuel using the FT process as a near-term option. Other alternative fuels like oil shale and biodiesel were considered for mid to far-term use. FT fuels were highlighted for their significant benefits. The study recommended the Air Force to ramp up development and utilization of FT fuels for a large-scale transition to alternative fuels. It also suggested the use of alternative fuels like ethanol and hydrocarbon blends in the mid- to far-term. Another strategy proposed was a shift to nuclear propulsion to reduce the Navy's dependence on oil. The break-even costs for different types of ships (aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and surface combatants) would equalize when the price of diesel fuel marine (DFM) delivered to the Navy reached $55, $80, and $205 per barrel, respectively. As of February 2006, the price of DFM delivered to the Navy was $84 per barrel, corresponding to crude-oil costs of about $48, $70, and $178 per barrel. The difference in break-even points is due to the varying energy usage over the ships' lifetimes. The study analyzed the break-even costs for different types of ships based on the price of diesel fuel marine (DFM) delivered to the Navy. The results showed that the break-even figure for surface combatants might shift if calculated on a 35-year basis. The study did not quantify the operational advantages of nuclear propulsion, such as the ability to transit long distances at high speeds without refueling. The study suggests that nuclear-powered ships offer operational advantages such as immediate combat readiness and high-speed maneuverability without refueling. Further analysis is needed to determine the feasibility of shifting from fossil-fueled to nuclear-powered large-deck amphibious assault ships and surface combatants, especially considering potential future increases in oil prices. The Navy is considering building nuclear-powered large-deck amphibious assault ships, potentially using a twin reactor plant from aircraft carriers or designing a new plant. Nuclear-powered cruisers were previously built by the Navy but procurement was halted in the 1970s to control costs. The operational advantages of nuclear propulsion are being taken into account for future ship designs. The Navy considered nuclear-powered options for Aegis defense systems, including a large strike cruiser and a derivative of the CGN-38 class design. However, they opted for a smaller, conventionally powered hull from the Spruance class destroyer, resulting in the 9,500-ton Ticonderoga class Aegis cruiser. The first Aegis cruiser was procured in FY1978, and future nuclear-powered cruisers or destroyers may incorporate a new-design reactor plant. Naval Reactors suggests that building a nuclear-powered amphibious assault ship every three years could reduce the procurement cost of nuclear-powered carriers and attack submarines by $65 million and $20 million respectively. Adding nuclear-powered surface combatants to the mix could further reduce costs by $80 million for carriers and $25 million for submarines. This could also help stabilize the nuclear propulsion component industrial base. Building nuclear-powered ships at specific yards like Northrop Grumman Newport News and General Dynamics' Electric Boat division could reduce costs by spreading fixed overhead costs and enabling more efficient workforce rollover. However, this may increase costs for ships being built at other yards like Ingalls and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. Large-deck amphibious assault ships are currently built at Ingalls, while large surface combatants are built at Ingalls and Bath Iron Works. Shifting construction of nuclear-powered ships from Ingalls and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works to certified yards like Northrop Grumman Newport News could impact future shipbuilding. Ingalls or GD/BIW may still be involved in building non-nuclear portions of the ships, while the reactor compartment could be built by NGNN or GD/EB. Final assembly location is uncertain. Shifting large-deck amphibious assault ships or large surface combatants from fossil-fuel propulsion to nuclear-propulsion could impact maintenance work and port access in countries with anti-nuclear sentiments. This shift may involve building nuclear-powered ships entirely at certified yards like Northrop Grumman Newport News, General Dynamics' Electric Boat, or government-operated naval shipyards. The Navy is considering shifting large-deck amphibious assault ships or large surface combatants to nuclear propulsion, which could impact maintenance work and port access in countries with anti-nuclear sentiments. Yokosuka, Japan is being considered as a potential forward homeporting location for nuclear-powered ships. One strategy to reduce the Navy's dependence on oil is to utilize sail and solar power on Navy auxiliaries and DOD sealift ships. Various vessels have been built with wind-assistance technology, including tanker and bulk carrier ships. Research is ongoing for a 50,000dwt Panamax bulker with traditional square rigs for sail power. Sail Log, part of Schwab-Orga GmbH, holds a patent for a modern square-rigged design with automated sails. They claim that automated sail-assisted bulk carriers could have 22% lower running costs compared to fully diesel-powered vessels. Sail Log estimates that sails could be used for two-thirds of a voyage. Cooke Associates, an engineering consulting firm in Cambridge, England, worked with wingsail developers on projects between 1984 and 1993. The Usuki Pioneer and Aqua City ships claimed a fuel reduction of 30%-40% in ideal wind conditions, but projects were terminated due to falling oil prices and high maintenance costs. An 8-ton version of the Walker wingsail was evaluated in 1986-1988 on the MV Ashington, but low fuel costs and limited usable wind in trading routes led to the decision that wingsails did not meet payback criteria. Cooke states that the economic case for wingsails in commercial shipping was destroyed by the collapse of world oil prices. The economic case for wingsails in commercial shipping was destroyed by falling world oil prices. A 1982 study found that a wingsail retrofit on a research ship could save 90 LT of fuel per year. Potential benefits include increased fuel endurance, quiet propulsion, and improved station keeping. In 1995, a study funded by the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy explored sail-assisted commercial ships, leading to the development of the Modern Windship concept. The feasibility study highlighted the impact of fuel prices and speed variations on a 200-meter, 50,000-ton product carrier design. Commercial limitations were identified, showing that WindShips were uneconomical on typical routes with a cost increase of approximately 10%. The study compared WindShips to conventional product carriers, showing a 10% cost increase for WindShips. Lowering the speed of conventional ships by 1 knot reduced fuel consumption by 25%, while WindShips saved an additional three tons of fuel per day in windy areas. Despite reliable results, it was concluded that WindShips were not economically advantageous, costing 10% more to operate with marginal fuel savings. The feasibility study on WindShips showed marginal fuel savings compared to conventional ships, with potential savings of 20.5 to 27% on the Rotterdam to New York route. Decisions on sail area were based on an initial wind speed estimate, but calculations at a lower speed showed a 5% decrease in required freight rate. The study highlighted the potential of modern WindShips concept if speed is reduced. The WindShip concept shows potential for fuel savings and increased productivity with larger volumes carried. Careful routing and consideration of seasonal weather variations could make WindShips environmentally beneficial and economically favorable. Interest in developing high-performance hybrid-sails for commercial ships similar to WindShip design was noted among maritime researchers in Japan in 2003. However, traditional sails on masts have potential disadvantages such as increased drag in unfavorable winds and hindering loading/unloading processes. Engineers designed taller masts to reduce the number needed for cranes lifting containers, but the Panama Canal limits mast height to 60 meters. Retrofitting cargo ships with masts for sails was costly and would take 15 years to recoup costs through fuel savings. Kite-assisted propulsion aims to avoid these issues and take advantage of stronger winds at greater heights. Companies like KiteShip and SkySails have developed kite-assist systems for commercial cargo ships. KiteShip and SkySails have developed kite-assist systems for commercial cargo ships to potentially reduce fuel costs and comply with environmental regulations. The commercial shipping industry may turn to sail power as an assist to petroleum-powered vessels due to increasing fuel costs and stricter environmental restrictions. This shift is driven by the need for cost-effective solutions beyond conventional masted sail options. KiteShip has been developing technology for commercial tethered flight sailing since 1978, focusing on cost-effective solutions for retrofitting existing vessels and designing massive sail power without the need for ballast or fixed masts. Dave Culp, one of the principals of KiteShip, highlighted the high cost of equipment as a barrier to the success of commercial sailing ships in the past. The high cost of equipment has been a barrier to the success of commercial sailing ships. Kites offer a cost-effective solution for retrofitting existing vessels, reducing capital costs and amortization rates. They can be added to ships easily, require minimal retrofitting, and can be used on multiple vessels, making them a practical and efficient option for sailing rigs. KiteShip has signed a Letter of Intent with Adventure Spa Cruises to design and build an 8000 sq ft kite to pull a 200' commercial cruise ship, showcasing environmentally friendly fuel-saving technology. This partnership aims to develop kites for larger applications and demonstrate a proactive stance on potential fuel price spikes and shortages. SkySails partnered with Adventure Spa Cruises to install an 8,000 square foot kite on a commercial cruise ship, aiming to reduce fuel costs by 10-35% and up to 50% under optimal wind conditions. The technology will be available for superyachts in 2006 and cargo vessels in 2007. Series production for both will start in 2007 and 2008 respectively. SkySails technology can be retrofitted on commercial cargo ships for fuel savings, with costs recouped in 3 to 5 years. Beluga Shipping purchased a SkySails kite system for their cargo freighter, expecting savings in fuel costs. The SkySails technology is set for market entry in 2007, offering fuel savings for cargo ships amidst rising oil prices and emission regulations. Beluga Group anticipates a competitive edge with the innovative system in offshore wind energy propulsion. Solar power shows potential for shipboard power augmentation, especially in Navy vessels. The Solar Sailor is a small catamaran ferry with \"solar wing sails\" for sail-assist propulsion and generating electricity. It can operate on wind, solar, battery, or diesel power. Developed by Solar Sailor Holdings Ltd., it operates in Sydney Harbor. The firm also has a concept for a hybrid-powered water-carrying tanker ship called Aquatanker. UOV LLC, a subsidiary, received a US Navy grant for unmanned ocean vehicles for military and coast guard use. The UOV's have military, coast guard, commercial, and oceanographic applications, including tsunami early warning systems. The US Navy is interested in these Unmanned Ocean Vehicles for surveillance purposes. The UOV's use solar & wind power for autonomous operation with unlimited range. The E/S Orcelle is a concept design for a zero-emissions car carrier using renewable energy sources like fuel cells, wind power, solar power, and wave power. The Orcelle concept design includes 12 horizontal fins to capture wave energy for hydrogen production, electricity, or mechanical power. It is believed that a ship with Orcelle's features could be possible by 2010, and with all features by 2025. Congress supports greater use of nuclear-powered propulsion systems in the Navy's future fleet for national security reasons.
