    "content": "The \"Preservation of Federalism in Banking Act\" clarifies state law preemption standards for national banks and subsidiaries. State consumer laws of general application, including those related to unfair or deceptive practices, apply to national banks, which also include Federal branches established under the International Banking Act of 1978. State banking laws enacted in accordance with federal law and consistent with Acts of Congress also apply to State banks. The Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allow States to impose additional requirements on national banks, except if the State law discriminates against national banks or conflicts with Federal law. This section does not affect the applicability of other State laws to national banks. The section clarifies that State laws not described in subsections (a) or (b) still apply to national banks. Preemption of State laws for national banks does not constitute a civil right under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 1 of title LXII of the Revised Statutes. State law preemption standards for national banks and subsidiaries clarified regarding visitorial standards. Section 5136C of the Revised Statutes of the United States is amended to clarify visitorial powers, stating that state attorney generals have the authority to enforce applicable laws against national banks on behalf of residents. State attorney generals can enforce laws against national banks on behalf of residents to recover damages for violations. SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF LAW APPLICABLE TO STATE-CHARTERED NONDEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES. Section 5136C of the Revised Statutes of the United States is amended to clarify that State law applies to State-chartered nondepository institution subsidiaries of national banks, unless preempted by an Act of Congress. Definitions for depository institution and subsidiary are provided. The Deposit Insurance Act defines a nondepository institution as any entity that is not a depository institution. SEC. 5. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING. The Comptroller of the Currency is required to collect and monitor consumer complaints regarding national banks and their subsidiaries. This includes recording the date of the complaint, nature of the complaint, and the resolution process.
