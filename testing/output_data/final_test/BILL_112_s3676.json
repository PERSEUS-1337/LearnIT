The Act defines \"agency\" as a department, agency, or independent establishment in the executive branch handling foreign affairs functions. It also defines \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The International Cooperative Administrative Support Services system manages and funds administrative support services at overseas posts for agencies participating in the system. The International Cooperative Administrative Support Services Executive Board is the top policy-making body overseeing administrative support services for agencies in the system. SEC. 4. PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES SYSTEM. Each agency with operations overseas must participate in the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services system for obtaining various services, unless they provide a detailed explanation for evaluation by the Executive Board. The motor pool services requirement applies to administrative services and does not override any statutory or programmatic requirements related to agency use or procurement of vehicles. SEC. 5. USE OF ALTERNATE SERVICE PROVIDERS. The International Cooperative Administrative Support Services Executive Board may allow an agency to provide administrative services at an overseas post instead of the current provider if they can do so more efficiently and agree to serve all other customer agencies. The Secretary of State must submit a biennial report on the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services system to congressional committees, outlining performance goals for efficient and effective administrative services. The Secretary of State must establish performance indicators, ensure data accuracy, and identify resources to achieve goals for the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services system. The Comptroller General will review the system within 2 years of the Act's enactment.
