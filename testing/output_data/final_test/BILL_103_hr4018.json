    "content": "The \"Habeas Corpus Revision Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a statute of limitations. Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a 1-year deadline for filing a habeas corpus relief application for applicants under a death sentence. The deadline is based on the denial of a writ of certiorari or the issuance of the mandate by the highest court. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus relief application for death sentence applicants are outlined in Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code. The deadline is based on the denial of a writ of certiorari or the issuance of the mandate by the Supreme Court. The time requirements can be tolled under certain circumstances, such as the State failing to provide counsel or during the period of State postconviction relief application. The court has jurisdiction over a habeas corpus application if good cause is shown. SEC. 3. STAYS OF EXECUTION IN CAPITAL CASES. Section 2251 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for staying executions in cases of individuals under sentence of death. The stay is contingent upon the individual's diligence in pursuing relief and expires if certain conditions are not met. The section outlines conditions under which an application for appeals review may be denied, including expiration of time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari, denial of the petition by the Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court disposing of the case in a manner that upholds the capital sentence. Additionally, it mentions the option for an individual to waive the right to pursue relief under this chapter before a court of competent jurisdiction. SEC. 4. LAW APPLICABLE. In an action under this chapter, the court shall not apply a new rule unless it places the claimant's conduct beyond the power of criminal law-making authority or requires procedures essential for an accurate conviction. A \"new rule\" is a clear break from precedent by the Supreme Court that couldn't have been anticipated at the time of the claimant's final sentence in State court. The claimant's sentence became final in State court. A new rule is not simply one that was not dictated by existing precedents or was debatable at the time. SEC. 5. COUNSEL IN CAPITAL CASES; STATE COURT. Chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a provision for counsel in capital cases in State courts. The court shall not presume findings of fact from State court proceedings to be correct, nor decline to consider a claim based on procedural grounds, unless specific criteria are met regarding legal services for indigents in capital cases. The amendment to Chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code, includes provisions for counsel in capital cases in State courts. The State must appoint qualified attorneys to represent indigents charged with offenses seeking capital punishment or sentenced to death. Legal services for indigents in capital cases must meet specific qualification and performance standards. The State must appoint qualified attorneys to represent indigents sentenced to death seeking appellate, collateral, or unitary review in State court, as well as those seeking certiorari review in the United States Supreme Court. The State shall establish a counsel authority, which can be a statewide defender organization, a resource center, or a counsel authority appointed by the highest State court, consisting of experienced members of the bar in capital cases. The counsel authority must publish a roster of qualified attorneys for capital cases, outlining appointment procedures and standards for qualifications and performance. This includes knowledge of legal authorities, negotiation skills, litigation experience, investigation abilities, and understanding of psychiatric evaluations for capital clients. The counsel authority publishes a roster of qualified attorneys for capital cases, appoints a defense team within 30 days of notice, and allows appointment of non-roster attorneys upon client request for quality legal representation. The counsel authority appoints qualified attorneys for capital cases within 30 days of notice to provide quality legal representation. Counsel appointed for postconviction proceedings must not have represented the prisoner previously at trial or on direct appeal, and their ineffectiveness shall not be a ground for relief in future proceedings. Upon receipt of notice from the counsel authority, the court conducts a hearing to determine an individual's competency to decline appointed counsel. Attorneys appointed under this section are compensated on an hourly basis as established by the counsel authority in consultation with the highest State court with jurisdiction over criminal matters. Attorneys appointed under this section are compensated for expenses incurred in representing the client, including support services like law clerks, paralegals, investigators, and experts. Support services for staff attorneys of a defender organization or resource center shall be equal to those listed. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code. \"Attorneys appointed in capital cases are compensated for expenses, including support services. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in title 28, United States Code.\" Section 2244(b) of title 28, United States Code is amended to include provisions for applicants under sentence of death filing second or successive applications. The claim must show that the basis could not have been discovered earlier or that the failure to raise the claim was due to external actions. The amended Section 2244(b) of title 28, United States Code allows for second or successive applications from individuals under a death sentence. The claim must demonstrate that the basis was not previously discoverable or that the failure to raise the claim was due to external actions. SEC. 7 amends the third paragraph of section 2253, title 28, US Code, stating that an appeal in a habeas corpus case from a State court's final order requires a certificate of probable cause, except for death sentence cases. SEC. 8 outlines the duties of the district court. SEC. 8 amends Section 2254(a) of title 28, US Code, requiring the district court to independently assess Federal legal standards in adjudicating grounds for relief. The court must not defer to State court judgments on Federal legal standards and may allow parties to present evidence on undeveloped facts. Relief is granted for meritorious constitutional grounds unless the respondent proves harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapter 153 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a new provision, Sec. 2258, which allows for habeas corpus relief for death row inmates presenting credible newly discovered evidence that could have changed the outcome of their trial to either an acquittal or a non-death sentence. The application must offer substantial evidence to establish these standards, or it may be dismissed. The court may dismiss an application that fails to meet the standards in subsection (a)(1) or (2). If the court finds that the application meets the requirements, it will order the respondent to file an answer, allow reasonable discovery, conduct a hearing to resolve factual disputes, and issue a stay of execution upon request. If the applicant meets the standards, the court will order release unless a new trial or sentencing proceeding is conducted within a reasonable time. The court may suspend consideration of an application if other remedies are available. Applications under this section can be consolidated with other pending applications. SEC. 10. PROCEDURAL DEFAULT IN STATE COURT. Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for a district court to decline consideration of a claim if the applicant failed to raise the claim in State court as required by State law, and cannot show cause for the failure to do so. The court may decline to consider a claim if the applicant failed to raise it in State court and cannot show cause, such as interference by State officials or counsel's neglect."
