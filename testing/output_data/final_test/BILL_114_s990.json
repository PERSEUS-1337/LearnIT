    "content": "The Act titled \"Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015\" is referred to as such. Congress acknowledges the importance of innovation. The Librarian of Congress should ensure that noninfringing uses of copyrighted works are not burdened by section 1201 of title 17, United States Code. The application of this section should balance noninfringing use with intellectual property rights protection, and exemptions to technological protection measures should consider activities unrelated to copyrighted works. The Librarian of Congress should not burden noninfringing uses of copyrighted works under section 1201 of title 17, United States Code. The rulemaking process for exemptions should be responsive to technological changes and not impose undue burdens on proponents. SEC. 3. CIRCUMVENTION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SYSTEMS. Section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to address violations regarding circumvention of technological measures. The amendment includes changes to subparagraphs (A) and (C) related to the examination process by the Librarian every 3 years. Section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to address violations related to circumvention of technological measures, including changes to subparagraphs regarding the availability for use of copyrighted works, fair uses, and access to information not subject to copyright protection. The amendment to Section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United States Code, includes considerations for the impact of prohibiting the circumvention of technological measures on accessibility for persons with disabilities and security research. The Librarian must assess all available evidence when making determinations under this section. The Librarian must consider all evidence available and cannot place the burden of proof on the proponent of an exemption. The Librarian may conduct a rulemaking proceeding outside of the 3-year review process if it is likely that users of a copyrighted work will be adversely affected by the prohibition. The Librarian must renew exemptions every 3 years unless changed circumstances make it unlikely that users will be adversely affected by the prohibition. The Librarian may find that a use of a work is adversely affected if a technological measure inhibits noninfringing uses of a work in a particular class of copyrighted works, especially for improving accessibility for persons with disabilities. The Librarian may determine that a use of a work is noninfringing based on various factors, including supporting judicial precedent, absence of contrary judicial precedent, Congressional intent, and other relevant factors. The Librarian, along with the Register of Copyrights and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, must report on this within a year of the Act's enactment. The Department of Commerce will conduct a study on ways to ease the burden on individuals seeking exemptions under section 1201(a)(1)(C) of title 17, US Code, and how this process can promote security research and enable the sale of circumvention tools. The Department of Commerce will conduct a study on easing burdens for exemptions under section 1201 of title 17, US Code, to promote security research and enable the sale of circumvention tools. Congress will receive a report with proposed legislation and obstacles to expansion.
