    "content": "The federal government increasingly relies on technology for procurement processes, benefiting both the acquisition workforce and government contractors. Web-based systems are crucial for publicizing opportunities, ensuring responsible contracting, capturing subcontracting information, and maintaining contract data. These systems enhance efficiency, access to information, and reduce administrative burdens for federal employees and contractors. The federal government relies on web-based systems for procurement, spending over $500 billion annually and conducting millions of contract actions. Congressional interest in government procurement is driven by its oversight responsibilities and ensuring efficient use of funds. The report discusses the importance of online procurement systems for government oversight and legislative activities. It highlights Congress's interest in promoting transparency in government spending data, including contract award information. The report provides an overview of major online procurement systems and addresses various issues related to government procurements. The report examines issues related to online procurement systems for government oversight and legislative activities. It focuses on major web-based executive branch procurement systems and excludes agency-specific websites or databases. Only executive branch agencies are subject to the statutes, regulations, policies, or guidelines governing the covered procurement systems. The federal government has increasingly utilized technology to enhance the acquisition process over the past two decades. Online systems like FedBizOpps and the System for Award Management have been established to streamline procurement and provide information for government contractors. The federal government utilizes technology to enhance the acquisition process, with online systems like FedBizOpps and the System for Award Management providing a single repository of information for agency personnel. SAM is used to confirm business size, review contractors' certifications, and pay contractors. It also helps in determining if a contractor is suspended or debarred, and querying FAPIIS. Contracting officers use PPIRS for performance information, and FPDS-NG for contract award data. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) mandated the development of a user-friendly system for government spending data, including procurement data. Efforts to enhance transparency include the establishment of FAPIIS, with legislation making its contents accessible to the public. Table 1 shows information on various web-based acquisition systems and the consolidation of procurement websites into the SAM system by the General Services Administration. The Contractor Registration, Excluded Parties List System, and Online Representations and Certifications Application were migrated to SAM in July 2012. Five other procurement systems are scheduled to migrate to SAM at later dates. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of contract award data from FPDS and its successor, FPDS-NG. FPDS was established in February 1978, with reports of deficiencies in data accuracy by federal agencies. The transition from FPDS to FPDS-NG faced challenges with inaccurate and incomplete data, as reported by GAO to the Director of OMB. Concerns were raised about timeliness, accuracy, and ease of use in FPDS-NG. The Acquisition Advisory Panel identified problems such as inaccurate data, unclear instructions, and validation rules that did not work as intended. GAO's review in April 2008 highlighted issues with capturing data in complex service acquisitions. The GAO identified issues with inaccurate and incomplete data in service acquisitions, including difficulties in identifying interagency contracts and incorrect coding of contracts in FPDS-NG. Efforts have been made to ensure accurate and timely reporting of procurement data, with guidance provided by the Administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in 2011. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) provides guidance for agencies to develop and monitor processes for reporting contractual actions to FPDS-NG. The chief acquisition officer must submit an annual certification to GSA on the completeness and accuracy of agency contract action report (CAR) data. OFPP's 2011 memorandum includes instructions and templates for calculating data accuracy. Agencies must assess 25 key data elements for accuracy, with governmentwide averages of 98.3% completeness and 94.0% sample accuracy. Individual agency data was not provided. OFPP's 2011 memorandum outlines guidance for agencies to report contractual actions to FPDS-NG. The data accuracy averages were 98.3% completeness and 94.0% sample accuracy. OFPP plans to improve procurement data quality through various activities with GSA, including interagency working groups and workforce training collaborations. The acquisition process can be affected by policies, system limitations, and regulations leading to inaccurate data or hampering transparency. Examples include delays in DOD procurement data availability and lack of independent verification for business designations in SAM. Data in FPDS-NG are organized as data elements that can be added, deleted, or revised over time. The inclusion of recently added or scheduled to be removed data elements in a user's search could affect results. Transparency may be hindered by regulations allowing the use of a generic DUNS number. An initiative is underway to consolidate eight procurement websites and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance into one system. The history of SAM begins with the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) established by OMB in 2001 to integrate, standardize, and streamline acquisition data systems. SAM aims to consolidate eight procurement websites into one system, referred to as \"legacy systems.\" The Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) aimed to improve government procurement systems by adopting, adapting, and acquiring existing data systems. Despite improvements, questions remained about the efficiency and coherence of the multiple procurement systems. The Federal Chief Information Officer highlighted issues with the eight IAE systems developed independently with different software. The Federal Chief Information Officer highlighted issues with the eight IAE systems, which operated independently with different software and hardware platforms. Problems included separate logins, overlapping data, varying levels of service, and multiple vendors hosting the systems. Consolidating the systems into an integrated platform for procurement was proposed to improve data quality, simplify access to procurement data, and enhance usability. The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded a contract to IBM US Federal in February 2010 to consolidate nine systems into SAM, an integrated platform for procurement data. The first phase of SAM, launched in July 2012, faced performance issues and functionality defects, leading to a temporary shutdown of the system. GSA contacted the contractor responsible for SAM to address the problems encountered by users. The performance issues and defects in SAM Phase 1 have impacted award management processes, leading to reliance on emergency workarounds. Concerns about SAM's operability prompted GSA to temporarily re-establish the Excluded Parties List System website. DOD issued a class deviation in response to SAM's performance issues affecting award processing. GSA has been working to resolve the issues promptly. The Administrator of OFPP stated that GSA needs to think carefully before implementing future phases of SAM. Management responsibility for SAM was shifted to the agency's FAS and the Office of the Chief Information Officer. The Acting FAS Commissioner and Deputy CIO are now in charge of SAM. The Acting Administrator of General Services called for the development, reporting, and monitoring of key metrics for the SAM implementation. In March 2012, GAO reported that the SAM project faced cost increases, funding shortages, and schedule delays. The cost of SAM-related contracts increased from $96.0 million to $181.1 million due to higher hosting costs. GSA responded by modifying the schedule, deferring payments, and revising contract requirements. GAO recommended reassessing the SAM business case to compare costs and benefits of alternatives. The SAM project faced cost increases, funding shortages, and schedule delays. GAO recommended reassessing the SAM business case to compare costs and benefits of alternatives. Public access to procurement information has grown, but comprehension may be lacking. Users may face challenges in government procurement due to lack of knowledge and expertise in using online acquisition systems. Examples include negative or zero dollar amounts in contract actions and irrelevant information in the Federal Awardee Performance Information and Integrity System. Some information in government procurement may not be relevant for determining a contractor's present responsibility, such as expired administrative actions. Certification regarding responsibility matters only covers three years, not five. Self-certification by business owners for certain designations can lead to differing interpretations. The Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) is dynamic, which may result in potentially inaccurate search results. The federal government does not have a database of contracts awarded by federal agencies, leading to potentially inaccurate search results. Executive branch initiatives have explored posting contracts online since 2003, with the goal of increasing transparency. The General Services Administration led the initial effort, seeking comments to implement a pilot program. The General Services Administration (GSA) initiated the Contract Award Documents Online (CADO) project to increase transparency in federal procurement by posting contracts online. A working group was formed to examine the feasibility and challenges of this proposal, considering integration with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process. Challenges identified included the removal of FOIA staff from the process, potentially exposing agencies to legal issues. The challenges of the CADO project include removing FOIA staff from the process, potential legal issues, proactive posting risks, staffing limitations, and lack of federal regulation. Anticipated benefits include increased transparency, reduced FOIA requests, and cost savings. The CADO working group found insufficient data to recommend a centralized federal system for online contract award data. DOD, GSA, and NASA issued a notice about posting contracts online, seeking input on how to do so without compromising contractors' proprietary information. The goal is to establish uniform, fair, cost-effective, and efficient processing methods. The CAAC and DAR Council identified issues to consider before implementing online contract posting, including cost, risks, and resource conservation. DOD, GSA, and NASA advocate for a judicious approach to establish contract-posting requirements. The CAAC and DAR Council, along with DOD, GSA, and NASA, advocate for a cautious approach to contract-posting requirements to conserve resources and protect sensitive information. Key elements include a high dollar threshold, redaction by the successful offeror, and incentives for compliance. Concerns exist about the maturity of protections for unclassified information, necessitating a thorough FOIA analysis before establishing contract-posting requirements. The Government would review contractor-redacted documents before posting them online to protect sensitive information. DOD, GSA, and NASA decided not to amend the FAR due to existing systems providing public access to contract information. Congress is interested in making procurement documents, including contracts, more accessible. During the 110th and 113th Congress, bills were introduced to make procurement documents, including contracts, publicly available online. However, these bills were not enacted. The interpretation of what constitutes public records for government contracts would be crucial if similar legislation were to be implemented. The DATA Act, encompassing bills H.R. 2061 and S. 994, aims to amend the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. If enacted, it would transfer oversight of USAspending.gov from the Director of OMB to the Secretary of the Treasury, requiring various transparency measures for government contracts. The DATA Act would establish governmentwide financial data standards for Federal funds, consolidate financial reporting requirements for recipients of federal awards, and create a pilot program for reporting financial data related to receipt of federal funds. It does not include a procurement database, focusing instead on using spending data to detect fraud, waste, or abuse. The FPDS-NG is a source of prime contracting procurement data available through USAspending.gov. Web-based systems are embedded in the federal government's acquisition process, facilitating data collection, storage, and dissemination. GSA is consolidating nine systems into the System for Award to integrate online procurement systems. GSA is consolidating nine systems into the System for Award Management to integrate online procurement systems and disclose additional procurement information. Access to procurement data may not necessarily confer comprehension without knowledge of government procurement."
