    "title": "AB 1940",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 832.19 of the Penal Code requires law enforcement agencies using body-worn cameras for peace officers to develop a policy. Definitions include body-worn camera, peace officer, and serious use of force. The policy for law enforcement agencies using body-worn cameras allows peace officers to review recordings before reporting or giving statements, but it is not mandatory. Peace officers involved in serious use of force incidents must have an independent investigator or supervisor present when reviewing body-worn camera recordings. The officer can have a legal representative present during the review before making any reports or statements. The policy must be available to all peace officers in written form. The policy for body-worn cameras must be available to all peace officers and the public. It prohibits recording in health facilities and must be developed in accordance with specific government acts. Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to include operational guidelines in the policy. The policy for body-worn cameras includes guidelines on when peace officers should wear them, prohibitions on use in certain circumstances, required training, public notification of recording, documenting citizen refusals, use of recordings in internal affairs and legal cases, and transfer of recordings to other law enforcement agencies. (e) Peace officers cannot use personal devices to make unauthorized recordings from body-worn cameras. This section does not apply to law enforcement agencies with established body-worn camera policies before January 1, 2017. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
