    "content": "Agriculture-based renewable energy, such as biofuels and wind turbines, has been supported by U.S. policymakers through incentives, regulations, and programs since the late 1970s. The most common biofuels, ethanol from corn starch and biodiesel from soybean oil, have received federal support in various forms. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 provided exemptions and tax credits for ethanol. The Bioenergy Program, established in 1999, made payments to ethanol and biodiesel producers. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 directed research for biofuels. The 2002 and 2008 farm bills authorized biofuel programs and extended support. The 2008 farm bill extended and expanded programs promoting biofuels renewable energy, with motivations including energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Federal biofuels subsidies peaked at $7.7 billion in FY2011, mainly due to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) of $0.45/gallon. After the VEETC expired in FY2011, subsidies fell to $1.3 billion in FY2012, primarily consisting of tax credits for biodiesel producers. The 2014 farm bill provides federal support for biofuels production and use in the United States, including tax incentives and the Renewable Fuel Standard. This support continues the long-standing congressional backing for renewable energy from agriculturally sourced materials. The 2014 farm bill supports biofuels production in the U.S. through various provisions. Tables in the report compare budget authority for energy provisions in the 2014 and 2008 farm bills. Renewable energy production is crucial in agricultural, energy, tax, and environmental policies. The USDA does not oversee policies supporting renewable energy production, including agriculture-based energy. Federal biofuels policies like the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) originated outside of farm bills, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) was established in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The ethanol import tariff, set at $0.54 per gallon, expired on December 31, 2011, along with the blending tax credit. Various federal and state programs support biofuels production, with additional tax credits available for biodiesel and ethanol producers. The 2014 farm bill's energy title incentivizes research and development of second-generation biofuels. The 2002 farm bill was the first to include an energy title, promoting renewable energy systems through grants and loans. Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices. During 2002-2007, U.S. ethanol production and corn use for ethanol significantly increased. Concerns arose about the impact of dedicating more corn to ethanol production on grain prices, livestock feed costs, food prices, and agricultural exports. The 2008 farm bill aimed to refocus biofuels policy towards non-corn starch feedstock, particularly cellulosic-based feedstock, to address environmental concerns and reduce reliance on corn for bioenergy production. This bill included provisions to increase the use of \"advanced biofuels\" to 21 billion gallons by 2022, promoting the production and use of bioenergy from nonfood feedstock like biomass. The 2008 farm bill aimed to increase the use of non-corn sources of renewable energy, with provisions expiring in 2013. The 2014 farm bill extended renewable energy programs with new funding, including the Biobased Markets Program and Biorefinery Assistance Program. The Biorefinery Assistance Program was renamed and received new funding under the 2014 farm bill, along with other renewable energy programs such as the Repowering Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, Renewable Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development Initiative. The 2014 farm bill included various provisions related to renewable energy programs, such as extending the sugar-to-ethanol Feedstock Flexibility Program, Biomass Crop Assistance Program, Community Wood Energy Program, and Sun Grant Initiative programs. It also repealed programs like the Forest Biomass for Energy Program, Biofuels Infrastructure Study, and Renewable Fertilizer Study, while adding new reporting requirements on energy use and efficiency at USDA facilities. The 2014 farm bill included provisions for renewable energy programs like the Sun Grant Initiative, which provides funding for biofuels research at universities and labs. Funding in a farm bill can be mandatory or discretionary, with mandatory funds typically provided through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The 2008 farm bill authorized over $1 billion in mandatory funding and $1.1 billion in discretionary appropriations for Title IX energy programs. Mandatory authorizations included funding for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and Rural Energy for America Program. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program had open-ended funding, but limits were later set on outlays starting in FY2010. The 2008 farm bill authorized over $1 billion in mandatory funding and $1.1 billion in discretionary appropriations for Title IX energy programs. Discretionary funding included $600 million for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, $100 million for the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and $100 million for the Rural Energy for America Program. However, actual discretionary appropriations were below authorized levels. Most bioenergy provisions expired on September 30, 2012, except for the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers. The Bioenergy Producers Program expired in 2012, with Congress passing continuing resolutions for FY2013 funding. The Rural Energy for America Program received $3.4 million in FY2013. The 2008 farm bill programs were extended through September 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The 2014 farm bill was reauthorized for FY2014-FY2018. The 2014 farm bill reauthorization period (FY2014-FY2018) included $694 million in new mandatory funding and authorized $765 million for renewable energy programs. Congress has adjusted funding levels for certain programs and not allocated discretionary funding for most. The summary outlines bioenergy-related authorities, program descriptions, funding levels, and implementation status. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) included an energy title (Title IX) with bioenergy programs. Changes were made to bioenergy definitions and provisions, including a new requirement for USDA to report on energy projects at its facilities. The bill also adjusted funding levels for renewable energy programs. The 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) included modifications to expand federal support for renewable energy to forestry products and renewable chemicals. This includes defining \"forest product,\" \"renewable chemical,\" and \"renewable energy system.\" The 2014 farm bill expanded federal support for renewable energy to forestry products and renewable chemicals. The Biobased Markets Program, also known as the BioPreferred\u00ae Program, promotes biobased products through mandatory purchasing requirements for federal agencies and voluntary labeling initiatives. The Biobased Markets Program, part of the 2014 farm bill, requires federal agencies and contractors to purchase biobased products from 97 categories when procurement reaches a certain threshold. The program was extended through FY2018 with added implementation requirements, including reporting on biobased purchases. The 2014 farm bill mandates federal agencies to purchase biobased products, including forest products, with specific requirements. It also requires the designation of biobased products, auditing for compliance, a study on the economic impact of the industry, and expedited approval for forest-related biobased products. USDA issued final rules on product designation and labeling. Funding of $3 million for biobased products testing and labeling was authorized. The Biobased Markets Program received $3 million in CCC funding for FY2014-FY2018 for product testing and labeling. No discretionary funding was ever appropriated for the program through FY2018, despite authorization. The 2008 farm bill authorized $9 million in mandatory funding for biobased products testing and labeling, with additional discretionary funding for FY2009-FY2012. The program went unfunded in FY2013, with no appropriations provided. Administered by Rural Business and Cooperative Service, USDA in consultation with DOE. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) under the Rural Development Agency (RD), USDA, assists in developing advanced biofuels technologies through grants and loan guarantees for biorefineries. Grants cover up to 30% of project costs, while loan guarantees are limited to $250 million or 80% of project cost. Discretionary funds were never appropriated for BAP, leading USDA to focus on the loan guarantee portion. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) under USDA focuses on loan guarantees for advanced biofuels technologies. Renamed in the 2014 Farm Bill, it now includes renewable chemicals and biobased products. Grants were eliminated, and the program assists in developing new technologies. Lenders or borrowers can submit a letter of intent for the loan guarantee. The USDA's Biorefinery Assistance Program, renamed in the 2014 Farm Bill, focuses on loan guarantees for advanced biofuels technologies, renewable chemicals, and biobased products. Funding for loan guarantees is capped at 15% for biobased product manufacturing. Mandatory CCC funding of $100 million in FY2014 and $50 million each for FY2015 and FY2016 was authorized, with no new baseline funding after FY2016. Discretionary funding of $75 million annually is authorized for FY2014-FY2018, but no discretionary funds have been appropriated. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) was established under the 2002 farm bill to provide grants for developing bio-refineries and biofuels production plants. No discretionary funds have been appropriated for the program through FY2018. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) was established in 2002 to convert fossil fuel-burning plants to biomass or renewable fuel sources. It provides payments to eligible biorefineries to encourage the use of renewable biomass as a replacement for fossil fuels. Individual project awards are limited to $5 million or 50% of total eligible project costs. The 2014 Farm Bill extended RAP without changes to program implementation. The 2014 Farm Bill extended the Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) without changes to program implementation. Funding included mandatory CCC funding of $12 million for FY2014, reduced by $8 million in FY2015. Discretionary funding of $10 million annually for FY2014-FY2018 was authorized but not appropriated. No new mandatory funding was included in the ATRA farm bill extension for RAP. The Bioenergy Program was established in 1999 and provided incentive payments to biofuels producers based on production increases. Funding for the program was $150 million annually from FY2002 to FY2006. In 2008, a new Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels was created to support production of advanced biofuels derived from renewable biomass. The Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels incentivizes producers to increase production of eligible biofuels through payments based on actual and incremental production. The program limits funds going to facilities with refining capacity over 150 million gallons per year. The 2014 Farm Bill extended the program through FY2018 with $15 million in mandatory funding per year. Additional discretionary funding of $20 million annually was authorized. The Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels had authorized funding under the 2014 farm bill, but no discretionary funding was allocated through FY2018. The 2008 farm bill initially authorized mandatory funding, which was later limited by the FY2012 agriculture appropriations act. Additionally, discretionary funding was authorized under the 2008 farm bill and the ATRA extension. Administered by NIFA and OEPNU, the program was originally established under the 2002 farm bill and extended by subsequent farm bills. The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, extended by the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, awards grants to educate entities on biodiesel fuel use. Implemented by USDA, the program received $1 million annually from mandatory CCC funds under the 2014 farm bill. No discretionary funding was provided through FY2018. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) was established under the 2008 farm bill, combining elements of two existing programs to provide financial assistance for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency projects. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, USDA, REAP offers grants, guaranteed loans, and combined grants and loans for eligible entities such as rural small businesses and agricultural producers. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) offers grants and assistance for renewable energy development to eligible entities like state, tribe, or local governments, rural electric cooperatives, and small businesses. The government's contribution is limited to 75% of project costs for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. Grantees must pay a minimum of 25% of the cost for energy audits. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) requires grantees to pay at least 25% of the energy audit cost. Renewable energy systems (RES) eligible for funding include bioenergy, anaerobic digesters, geothermal, hydrogen, solar, wind, and hydropower. Energy-efficiency improvement (EEI) projects involve upgrading equipment to reduce energy use. The 2014 Farm Bill extended REAP through FY2018, added new funding, and implemented a three-tiered application process based on project cost. RES was redefined to exclude retail energy dispensing mechanisms like blender pumps. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) funding includes mandatory CCC funds of $50 million annually authorized since 2014, with discretionary funding of $20 million annually for FY2014-FY2018. Under the 2008 farm bill, mandatory CCC funds ranged from $55 million to $70 million annually, with discretionary funding of $25 million annually for FY2009-FY2012. Discretionary funding for the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) was authorized at $25 million annually for FY2009-FY2012. Actual appropriations varied, with $5 million in FY2009, $39.3 million in FY2010, $5 million in FY2011, and $3.4 million in FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2011 appropriations act reduced discretionary funds to $5 million but maintained mandatory funding at $70 million. In FY2012, mandatory spending was limited to $22 million, with $3.4 million in discretionary funds allocated for grants and loan guarantees. No new mandatory funding was included under ATRA, but $25 million in discretionary funding was authorized for FY2013. Administered by NIFA, USDA, and DOE jointly. Program Overview: BRDI\u2014created. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) is a program jointly administered by the Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), USDA, and DOE. It aims to promote commercial production of biofuels, biobased energy innovations, and development of biobased feedstocks and products. Funding is provided through grants, contracts, and financial assistance for research and technology development. Eligible entities include higher education institutions, national laboratories, research agencies, private-sector entities, and nonprofit organizations. Coordination of biomass research and development is facilitated through the Biomass Research and Development Board. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) was established to coordinate government activities in biomass research. The 2008 farm bill expanded the program's technical advisory committee and required funding to be allocated to three critical technical areas: feedstock development, biofuels and biobased products development, and biofuels development analysis. Applicants seeking funding must integrate science and engineering research, with a minimum cost-share requirement for projects. The 2014 Farm Bill increased funding requirements for demonstration projects to 50% and for research projects to 20%. It extended the Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) through FY2018 with new funding levels. Mandatory funding of $3 million was authorized for FY2014-FY2017, with discretionary funding of $20 million annually for FY2014-FY2018. However, no discretionary funding from USDA has been appropriated for BRDI through FY2018. DOE provided up to $3 million in FY2017 but will not contribute in FY2018. Under the 2008 farm bill, the Feedstock Flexibility Program required USDA to establish a sugar-for-ethanol program using surplus sugar intended for food. USDA would subsidize sugar for ethanol production through federal purchases for resale to ethanol producers, ensuring the program operates at no cost to the government. Funding for the program included discretionary amounts for FY2009-FY2013, with no new mandatory funding under ATRA. Administered by the Farm Service Agency, the program aimed to support ethanol production using surplus sugar. The Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP) operates at no cost to the federal government to avoid sugar forfeitures. Domestic sugar processors can borrow from the CCC and repay the loan or forfeit the collateral. If market rates are low, the CCC uses the FFP to purchase sugar and sell it to bioenergy producers to prevent forfeitures. The Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP) was activated in August 2013 to prevent sugar forfeitures by purchasing sugar at low market rates and selling it to bioenergy producers. The program was extended through FY2018 with funding authority under the 2014 Farm Bill. Administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides financial assistance to owners and operators. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) offers financial aid to agricultural and private forest landowners for establishing, producing, and delivering biomass feedstocks to processing plants. Assistance includes establishment and annual payments for perennial crops, as well as matching payments for collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible materials. Annual payments are available to producers who contract with USDA to grow eligible biomass crops on designated BCAP project areas, including agricultural land and private forestland. Federal or state-owned land, native sod, and crops covered under Title I of the farm bill are not eligible. Matching payments are offered to material owners delivering eligible material to biomass conversion facilities. Eligible material must meet specific criteria. Changes in the 2014 Farm Bill extended the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) through FY2018. The bill expanded land eligibility to include land under expiring CRP or ACEP easement contracts and included residue from crops receiving Title I payments as eligible material. One-time establishment payments were limited to 50% of the cost of establishment, not exceeding $500 per acre ($750 per acre for socially disadvantaged farmers). Matching payments for CHST may not exceed $20 per dry ton. Under the 2014 Farm Bill, the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was extended through FY2018. CHST matching payments were reduced to $20 per dry ton. Funding of $25 million was authorized for each of FY2014-FY2018, with limitations in subsequent years. Technical assistance is available under BCAP. USDA is required to submit a report on best practices from participants. BCAP, established under the 2008 farm bill, aimed to expand biofuel feedstock beyond food crops by ensuring a biomass supply for cellulosic biofuel production. Funding for BCAP was initially set at $290 million for FY2008-FY2012, but was later limited by Congress to $552 million in FY2010 and $432 million in FY2011. Further reductions in funding were made in subsequent years, with mandatory spending limited to $17 million in FY2012. No new mandatory funding was included under ATRA. BCAP funding was reduced to $17 million for FY2012 and no new mandatory funding was included for FY2013 under ATRA. Discretionary funding of $20 million was authorized for FY2013, with actual outlays totaling $9 million. The Forest Biomass for Energy program, established under the 2008 farm bill, aimed to promote the use of forest biomass for energy through research and development. Eligible entities included federal agencies, state and local governments, Indian tribes, universities, and private entities. Priority was given to projects utilizing low-value forest biomass for energy production, integrating bioenergy into manufacturing processes, developing new transportation fuels, and enhancing tree growth for renewable energy. Administered by the Forest Service, USDA. The Forest Biomass for Energy program, established under the 2008 farm bill, aimed to promote the use of forest biomass for energy through research and development. The program provided matching grants to state and local governments for community wood energy systems. However, the program was repealed in the 2014 Farm Bill and funding was not appropriated after FY2013. Administered by the Forest Service, USDA. The 2014 Farm Bill extended the Community Wood Energy Program through FY2018, defined Biomass Consumer Cooperatives, and authorized grants up to $50,000 for establishing or expanding biomass consumer cooperatives. Mandatory funding was not provided, but discretionary funding of $5 million annually was authorized for FY2014-FY2018. No funds have been appropriated for the Biofuels Infrastructure Study program authorized under the 2008 farm bill. The program requested a joint report from USDA, DOE, EPA, and DOT on expanding biofuels production, but the report was never completed. The requirement for the study was repealed in the 2014 Farm Bill. The Biofuels Infrastructure Study requirement and the Renewable Fertilizer Study requirement were repealed in the 2014 Farm Bill. No funding was ever authorized for these studies, and they were never undertaken. Under the 2014 Farm Bill, the Renewable Fertilizer Study requirement was repealed, and no specific funding was authorized for the study. The USDA was directed to submit a report on energy use and efficiency projects at USDA facilities, with no specific funding authorized for this initiative. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA. The Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative aimed to reduce conventional energy use and increase renewable energy sources through grants, but no funding was ever appropriated. The program funding authority expired after FY2013, with no provision included in the 2014 Farm Bill. Three provisions from Title VII of the 2014 farm bill focus on renewable energy initiatives administered by USDA. The program provided research grants for innovative methods using animal waste for energy production. Competitive grants were used to support research enhancing biomass energy crops and energy efficiency in agricultural operations. The 2014 farm bill repealed the Nutrient Management Research and Extension Program and the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative. The Sun Grant Initiative is a national network of land-grant universities and federally funded laboratories working together to establish a biobased economy. Grants are available for research, extension, and education programs on technology development and rural economic development through biobased renewable energy feedstocks. Administered by NIFA, USDA, each regional Sun Grant center manages programs through peer and merit review. The Sun Grant Program was established to promote the production of biobased renewable energy feedstocks. It was created under the Sun Grant Research Initiative Act of 2003 and expanded in the 2008 farm bill to include a sixth regional center. The program received funding of $75 million annually through FY2018 under the 2014 farm bill. The Sun Grant Program, established to promote biobased renewable energy feedstocks, received funding of $75 million annually through FY2018. The 2014 farm bill consolidated and amended the program, making it competitive by removing regional center designations and replacing gasification research with bioproducts research. Funding details include appropriations of $2.5 million for FY2014-FY2016, $3 million for FY2017 and FY2018, and previous appropriations under the 2008 farm bill. ATRA did not provide new funding for FY2013."
