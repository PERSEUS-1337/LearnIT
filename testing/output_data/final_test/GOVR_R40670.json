The Obama administration aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 14% from 2005 levels by 2020, while the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 proposes a 17% reduction below 2005 levels by 2020. Other legislative proposals also aim to reduce U.S. carbon emissions to specific levels. The Obama administration and other legislative proposals aim to reduce U.S. carbon emissions through various initiatives, including emissions caps, carbon taxes, and regulatory mechanisms. Analysts are exploring measures to achieve CO2 reduction targets, particularly in the electricity sector, which accounts for 40% of U.S. carbon emissions. These measures include energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, advanced fossil-fuel power generation, carbon capture and sequestration, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and distributed energy resources, with a focus on end-use energy efficiency as a key strategy for reducing CO2 emissions. H.R. 2454 promotes electricity efficiency in buildings to reduce CO2 emissions quickly and at low cost. Congress has recognized the importance of building energy efficiency since 1975. Residential and commercial buildings account for 40% of U.S. energy consumption. Federal initiatives in building energy efficiency, while somewhat effective, have not been sufficient to achieve the steep CO2 reductions anticipated under H.R. 2454. Analysts have identified socio-economic and policy barriers that have limited the impact of federal and state building efficiency programs. This report discusses these barriers, the extent to which federal law has addressed them, and their implications for meeting future U.S. carbon reduction targets. Additionally, there are opportunities for energy efficiency in transportation that could also contribute to significant CO2 reductions. Improved energy efficiency in transportation and buildings, reducing fossil fuel use, and minimizing carbon emissions from building materials are key strategies for CO2 reductions. Energy efficiency involves using less energy while maintaining the same level of service through technical modifications and design changes like better insulation and solar orientation. This is crucial for achieving significant CO2 reductions and meeting future carbon reduction targets in the U.S. Improved energy efficiency in buildings involves better insulation, thermal windows, improved ventilation, and solar orientation. Energy conservation results from efficiency increases over time due to changes in energy prices, technology availability, and other factors. Studies since the 1970s have shown significant potential for energy efficiency, with technical fixes in new buildings capable of saving up to 50% in office buildings and 80% in some new houses. By 1990, improved building design could save a third of national energy use and money. The U.S. could achieve full employment and increase productivity by reducing national energy consumption by 25%. Studies show significant potential for electricity conservation, with a technical savings potential of 23% in 1997 and 33% in 2004. Several regional studies have reported a technical electricity conservation potential of 33%, with an achievable potential of 24% over a 5 to 15 year time horizon. The U.S. Department of State's 2006 Climate Action Report suggests that commercial buildings and homes could save up to 30% on energy bills by using energy-efficient products and technologies. Despite efforts by federal and state agencies over the last 40 years, actual electricity conservation levels have been more modest than the 25%-30% potential. Actual electricity conservation levels achieved since the 1970s have been more modest than the 25%-30% potential suggested in studies. A 2004 analysis found that energy efficiency programs saved up to 4.1 quads of electricity annually, representing about 6% of annual nontransportation energy consumption. California's 2001 energy demand reduction initiative resulted in a 6% decrease in electricity usage compared to the previous year. A 2008 analysis projected a 7% electricity savings potential in the U.S. beyond baseline levels without market intervention. McKinsey Global Institute found over 20% savings potential in residential and commercial sectors, but current policies only capture under 0.5%. Studies suggest a perpetual opportunity for 25% electricity conservation, more than four times the actual realized savings. Moving beyond the 5% to 7% electricity savings range has been a challenge for conservation proponents. A rich literature exists on barriers to adoption of energy efficiency technologies. An advisory committee was established by Congress to address barriers to deploying climate change mitigation technologies. The Lock-in report, published in November 2007, identifies 10 categories of barriers hindering the deployment of greenhouse gas reduction technologies. Table 1 summarizes the findings related to end-uses in buildings, highlighting six critical barriers that may require priority attention for policy interventions. The Lock-in report identifies industry structure as the \"most important\" critical barrier to building efficiency, involving various stakeholders like investors, owners, occupants, builders, and architects. The industry structure involving numerous stakeholders with varying interests in building efficiency poses challenges, as highlighted in studies by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. \"Principal-agent\" problems arise in efficiency investments, where decision-makers are not financially accountable for energy costs. Increasing building efficiency is a challenge due to industry complexity and fragmentation, leading to decision-makers not being financially responsible for energy costs. This lack of accountability results in landlords and home builders opting for less efficient options, ultimately burdening tenants and future homeowners with higher utility bills. Incomplete information about cost-effectiveness and availability of efficient technologies further hinders progress in improving building efficiency. The lack of information and high transaction costs hinder cost-effective energy efficiency measures in both residential and non-residential sectors. Consumers are reluctant to pay more upfront for products with lower life cycle costs, especially when lenders do not credit them for lower utility bills later. In a 2009 survey, 73% of commercial building professionals cited first cost as a significant barrier to adopting high-efficiency lighting systems. Consumers, including low-income households and small businesses, face challenges in accessing credit and evaluating efficiency investments. Capital availability, payback period, and return on investment were identified as top barriers to achieving energy efficiency in a joint survey of facility managers. The Lock-in report highlights challenges in validating the performance of energy efficiency measures, particularly in advanced technologies like adjustable speed motor drives (ASDs). The cost-effectiveness of implementing ASDs can vary greatly due to unique application requirements and advanced features, leading to uncertainty in costs. Technical riskiness and cost uncertainty act as barriers to widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The Lock-in report identifies market risks in implementing new efficiency measures, including uncertainties in lifecycle costs and technology development. Energy price fluctuations and concerns about irreversible investments hinder acceptance of efficient technologies in building efficiency. The Lock-in report highlights fiscal impediments to energy efficiency, particularly in electric utilities' rate structures. Lack of cost-recovery mechanisms, revenue erosion from efficiency improvements, and the tie of fixed costs to electricity sales are identified as critical disincentives to building efficiency. Price cap regulation discourages economical efficiency investments that reduce electricity usage. The Lock-in report identifies financial disincentives for utilities in promoting energy efficiency, such as revenue loss from unsold kilowatt-hours. This hampers efforts to improve building end-use efficiency. There is a need to review federal building efficiency policies in light of these barriers. The Lock-in report categorizes building efficiency provisions in key federal statutes based on critical barriers. The analysis reviewed statutory language and committee reports to determine legislative intent related to energy efficiency in buildings. Provisions addressing multiple barriers were identified. The categorization is subjective, and some provisions address more than one barrier. The analysis categorizes building efficiency provisions in federal statutes based on critical barriers. Provisions for unrestricted grants to state-run programs were excluded. Congress has a history of policy intervention for critical barriers in energy-efficient buildings over the last 35 years. Since 1975, Congress has enacted policies to address efficiency barriers in the building industry, including industry structure, imperfect information, high first costs, and technical risks. Initiatives focus on equipment efficiency standards, building codes, state efforts, energy audits, public education, and financial assistance programs to overcome these barriers. Congress has addressed efficiency barriers in the building industry through various policies since 1975. While technology demonstration measures were enacted under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978, Congress pursued technical risk policies more vigorously in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and subsequent statutes. Congress has periodically revisited these issues in response to changing building sector conditions. However, there is a lack of sustained statutory initiatives addressing unfavorable fiscal policies or market risk. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 included provisions related to electric utilities promoting end-use efficiency, but their effects were limited. Additional statutes related to fiscal policies are discussed later in the report. Congress has not taken significant action to address market risks or fiscal policies related to building efficiency. The Lock-in study identifies energy price uncertainties as a key barrier to building efficiency, which complicates decisions about investments in energy efficiency measures. Energy price uncertainty is a major obstacle that affects both individual end-users and broader social perspectives on cost-effectiveness. This uncertainty could deter building owners from considering energy efficiency investments. Recent U.S. energy price volatility is at historic highs, with natural gas and coal prices experiencing staggering fluctuations. This volatility could deter building owners from considering energy efficiency investments. In the current energy market, consumers face challenges evaluating the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency investments due to volatile energy prices. Retail electricity prices may temporarily shield end-users from wholesale price fluctuations, but long-term rates will need to align with generation fuel costs, impacting efficiency measure cost-effectiveness. An increase in natural gas-fired generation in response to future carbon costs may heighten the impact of natural gas price volatility on retail electricity costs. Uncertain energy prices and electricity load growth can significantly affect the cost-effectiveness of building efficiency measures, as shown in an analysis by Exelon Corporation. Increasing end-use energy efficiency can reduce the utility's cost of avoided carbon emissions. Energy efficiency investments are more cost-effective under high natural gas prices, but may cost over $25 per metric ton of avoided CO2 with low natural gas prices. Uncertainty in carbon costs can impact energy price uncertainty, but a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program can encourage efficiency investments by raising their cost-effectiveness. Uncertainty about carbon costs adds variability to future energy prices, making it harder for building owners to commit to efficiency measures. This uncertainty leads to delays in implementing cost-effective efficiency measures as business leaders hold back on investments due to energy price uncertainties. The uncertainty in energy prices, driven by global market forces, poses a challenge for policymakers and can hinder building efficiency investments in the private sector. Congress may have limited options to control energy price volatility, despite potential national interests. Some policies have been considered to protect energy producers or consumers from price swings, such as federal price guarantees in the proposed Coal Liquid Fuel Act. The proposed Coal Liquid Fuel Act included federal price guarantees to support coal liquefaction projects and attract private capital. The Energy Security Act of 1980 also offered federal loan guarantees and price guarantees to promote investment in synthetic fuels and biomass energy infrastructure. These policies aimed to mitigate price uncertainties and encourage investment in specific energy sectors. Energy price uncertainty can complicate government incentives for building energy efficiency investments. Cost-effectiveness estimates may vary due to energy price volatility, leading to inefficient financial incentive programs. Delays in adjusting incentive levels based on changing energy prices can result in economic inefficiency. Although global energy markets are not directly controlled by U.S. agencies, Congress has influence over drivers of electricity prices such as carbon control and federal requirements. Congress can establish rules to reduce investment risk associated with cost uncertainty in building energy efficiency. Current legislative proposals lack provisions to address electricity price uncertainty. The Lock-in report highlights fiscal policy disincentives to building efficiency, such as utility cost-recovery and revenue erosion. Stakeholders argue that decoupling utility profits from electricity sales is crucial for reducing building electricity consumption. Addressing utility rate issues has been a federal challenge due to state or local authority over retail rate design for electric utilities. Starting from the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486), Congress has enacted provisions to address utility rate policy challenges, including requiring state utility regulators to consider setting rates for electric utilities to promote energy conservation and efficiency. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) mandated a study on state policies promoting utility energy efficiency programs, focusing on rate issues and fiscal disincentives. The resulting report recommended state actions to promote utility-run efficiency programs. The Department of Energy released a report in March 2007 recommending state regulators to consider policies removing rate disincentives to utility-run efficiency programs. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded provisions by mandating state utility regulators to consider rate design modifications for energy efficiency investments. However, adoption of these policies has been voluntary and most state utility commissions have not embraced them. Some states have moved away from these policies due to perceived incompatibility with utility deregulation. Opponents of new rate structures argue that they depart too much from traditional regulation, shift sales risks to customers, and complicate other regulatory initiatives. State and local regulators have limited the implementation of rate policy measures, with only 13 states approving decoupled rates or pilots as of March 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions for utility rate policy issues, aiming to align financial incentives with energy efficiency. The impact of these provisions is debatable as they may not be mandatory. State utility commissions are largely independent in implementing these measures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes provisions for utility rate policy issues, aiming to align financial incentives with energy efficiency. State utility commissions may not be legally bound to adopt a governor's regulatory policy, but the provision is designed to encourage states to remove disincentives for utilities to invest in energy efficiency. This may lead to changes in ratemaking practices and consideration of utility rate decoupling to secure federal stimulus funds. The passage discusses the potential impact of P.L. 111-5 on utility rate structures and building efficiency. It highlights the challenges and controversies surrounding the adoption of decoupled rates by states, with varying effects on building efficiency. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners questions whether decoupling alone will lead to increased efficiency. Legal challenges and opposition to alternative rates, such as decoupled rates, are also mentioned. The recent passage of utility rates provisions in P.L. 111-5 is still debated. Congress may wait to see the effectiveness of current policies before taking further action on utility rates. Some stakeholders propose mandatory rate decoupling statutes tied to a new federal cap and trade program for CO2 emissions. The impact of such a policy on building efficiency compared to P.L. 111-5 is uncertain, suggesting that current utility rate policies may not be sufficient. Utility rate policies will likely remain a significant obstacle to building efficiency programs well into the next decade, despite efforts from legislators to improve energy efficiency. Congressional policies since 1975 have been focused on addressing building efficiency, with recent concerns about CO2 emissions adding urgency to the issue. Since 1975, congressional policies have targeted industry structure, imperfect information, and high first costs as barriers to building efficiency. Congress has also addressed technical risk through technology demonstration, although this has been less of a priority recently. Efforts have included tightening efficiency standards, offering financial incentives, and addressing unfavorable fiscal policies among utilities. The focus has been on the aggressiveness of federal actions and program details rather than the need for congressional intervention. Congress has long recognized the significance of rate barriers to building efficiency. Despite multiple attempts to lower these barriers, it has been challenging to develop and enact consensus policies. The regulatory primacy of states on utility retail rate matters and controversial economic implications of decoupled rates have complicated utility rate reform. Congressional treatment of market risks differs from other critical barriers, especially energy price risks. Market risks, particularly energy price risks, have not received much policy attention from Congress. While first cost incentives like efficient equipment rebates may indirectly address energy price volatility, Congress has not explicitly incorporated this perspective into statutory provisions. There are important questions about the linkage between market risks and incentive levels, especially in end-user investment decisions. Commercial building owners and operators consider market risks significant, prompting Congress to consider a more direct examination of these issues in the context of building efficiency investment. The policy options available in response to market risks remain an open question. Some analysts suggest that policies like federal energy efficiency resource standards could mitigate energy market risks. Legislation such as the Save American Energy Act and the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 are examples currently under debate. These policies aim to promote efficiency investments by setting efficiency performance targets for utilities. The federal government may face efficiency barriers similar to utilities if they take on more responsibility for efficiency improvements among customers. Utilities may need new rate structures for efficiency promotion, but state regulators' consent is required. It is uncertain if federal energy efficiency standards would overcome barriers identified in the Lock-in report more effectively than current congressional initiatives. This discussion provides qualitative insights on how congressional building efficiency policies could impact U.S. carbon reduction targets. Achieving efficiency improvements above 5% to 10% over 20 years may require aggressive policies to overcome barriers in building efficiency investment. Significant policy gaps remain in utility fiscal policies and market risks, hindering private investment in building efficiency measures and potentially impacting federal carbon reduction targets. Policymakers may benefit from a complete and integrated approach to address these barriers. Policymakers may benefit from a complete understanding of barriers to building efficiency and their impact on carbon outcomes. See Table A-1 for more details."
