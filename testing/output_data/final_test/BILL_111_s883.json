    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medal of Honor Commemorative Coin Act of 2009\". The Medal of Honor, authorized by Congress, is the highest personal decoration for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. It is presented by the President to members of the Armed Forces who show exceptional bravery in combat. The Medal of Honor is awarded for acts of personal bravery or self-sacrifice in combat, with fewer than 3,500 recipients in the US Armed Forces. The deed must be distinguished above comrades and involve risk of life, with incontestable proof required for consideration. The Congressional Medal of Honor Society, established in 1958, is a non-profit organization for recipients of the Medal of Honor. Members are united in friendship, honor the recipients, and promote service to others and allegiance to the US Constitution. The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded by the Society in 1999, is dedicated to perpetuating the Medal of Honor's legacy through outreach and collaborative efforts, raising funds for initiatives that promote its values, and promoting American values of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism. The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation promotes heroism, selflessness, and distinguished citizenship among American youth through educational programs and outreach efforts. It raises public awareness about the actions of ordinary Americans who have made a profound difference in preserving freedoms. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury shall mint $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins in recognition of the founding of the Medal of Honor in 1861. The $5 gold coins will weigh 8.359 grams and contain 90% gold, while the $1 silver coins will weigh 26.73 grams and contain 90% silver. These coins will be legal tender. The coins minted under this Act will be considered numismatic items for purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code. SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the traditions and legacy of the Medal of Honor and its recipients. Each coin will include the coin's value, the year \"2011\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design must represent the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal of Honor designs and honor past and present recipients. The design of the Medal of Honor coins must reflect the traditions and heritage of the United States Armed Services, as well as the mission and goals of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and Foundation. The Secretary will select the design after consulting with the relevant boards and committees. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at designated US Mint facilities within a 1-year period starting January 1, 2011. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharge, and cost of design and issuance. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. All sales of coins minted under this Act will include a surcharge of $35 per coin for the $5 coin and $10 per coin for the $1 coin. The surcharges received will be promptly paid to the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation to support its programs. The Foundation will be audited for the amounts received. No surcharge may be included for any coin issuance during a calendar year if certain conditions are not met. The Secretary may issue guidance to limit the number of commemorative coin programs issued in a calendar year to avoid exceeding the annual issuance limitation under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code."
