A report on the assessment must be submitted to relevant committees. Additionally, the Act aims to enhance security on Mexico's southern border. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, will collaborate with Mexico to establish a program to secure Mexico's southern border from undocumented aliens, drugs, weapons, and contraband. This includes a comprehensive plan for technology deployment and research collaboration to improve capabilities. The comprehensive plan for the repatriation of migrants to their home countries includes coordinating with international NGOs for humane methods, training, personnel, and equipment needed for the program, and assessing land and transportation screening needs at Mexico's southern border.

SEC. 5. IMPROVING UNITED STATES SHORT TERM DETENTION STANDARDS. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that individuals apprehended by Border Patrol agents have access to adequate facilities, food, water, medical care, and sanitary facilities. Additionally, detainees must be provided with information on their rights while at Border Patrol processing centers. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure that individuals apprehended by Border Patrol agents are promptly provided with information on their rights, including the right to contact their government. This information can be given verbally or in writing and must be posted in the detention holding cell in a language understandable to the individual. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security must establish and maintain a database for repatriated individuals. Customs and Border Protection maintains a database on individuals unlawfully present in the US, including location of apprehension, family separation details, medical conditions during short term detention, and returned personal property. Repatriations are limited to daylight hours and avoid high crime areas. Short term detention is defined as detention in a Border Patrol facility. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report on the procurement process and standards of entities contracted by the Department of Homeland Security for transportation and detention of individuals unlawfully present in the US. The report will also assess the operational efficiency of outsourcing these services."
