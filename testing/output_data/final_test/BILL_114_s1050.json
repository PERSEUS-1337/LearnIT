STEM skills are now required in a wide range of occupations, with over 50% of these jobs not needing a bachelor's degree. There may be up to 26 million jobs in the US that require STEM competency. In recent years, STEM workers have lower unemployment rates and higher wages than non-STEM workers. High-performing education facilities are necessary for high-performing students, but many STEM and technical education facilities are outdated and inefficient. SEC. 3.
