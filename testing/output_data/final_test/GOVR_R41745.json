    "content": "The Department of Defense faces a funding lapse due to Congress not providing funding for FY2014. Agencies are required to shut down, except for activities related to national security. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter issued guidance to continue essential activities, including the war in Afghanistan. The Department of Defense faces a funding lapse, with activities related to national security being excepted from shutdown. Secretary of the Treasury warns of running out of borrowing authority by October 17, 2013, impacting government obligations like Social Security and military benefits. If the debt ceiling is not raised, programs for military retirement and concurrent receipt could be delayed. There is controversy over whether Treasury could prioritize payments to avoid default, with some arguing it could pay interest on debt first. Treasury argues it does not have the authority to make such distinctions. Some suggest this would violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. If the debt ceiling is not raised, programs for military retirement and concurrent receipt could be delayed. Treasury cannot prioritize payments to avoid default, as it would violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Delaying payments could lead to interest penalties, liquidity problems for contractors, and affect the solvency of trust funds like Tricare for Life and military retirement. The impact on Department of Defense programs or benefits is uncertain. President Obama signed the Pay Our Military Act (POMA) on September 30, 2013, providing appropriations for the pay and allowances of armed forces members and DOD civilians. This ensures timely payment without depending on a full continuing resolution. Additionally, H.J.Res. 91 was signed on October 10, 2013, providing for death gratuities and funeral expenses. The \"Honoring the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act,\" signed as H.J.Res. 91, covers death gratuities and funeral expenses for military personnel, addressing controversy over the interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act (POMA) regarding these payments. Some argue that POMA's language on \"pay and allowances\" could include death gratuities, as stated in a CRS memo. The House Armed Services hearing on October 10, 2013, discussed concerns about the Department's interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act (POMA). H.J.Res. 91, costing $150 million annually, covers death gratuities and funeral expenses for military personnel. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that H.R. 3210 allows DOD to recall most DOD civilians from furlough. The Administration interpreted H.R. 3210 as permitting the recall of DOD civilians contributing to the morale, well-being, and readiness of service members. This revision would increase the number of DOD civilians returning to work to about 95%. They are being recalled if they provide ongoing support to service members and their families, such as health care, family support programs, repair and maintenance of weapon systems, training for readiness, installation support, commissary, payroll activities, and administrative support. The revised guidance allows for the recall of DOD civilians who contribute to service members' morale, well-being, and readiness. Civilians will return to work this week and will be eligible for timely payment under H.R. 3210. However, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel warned that once current inventories run out, DOD civilians may not be able to perform their jobs due to a lack of critical parts and supplies. The Department of Defense civilians may not be able to work if critical parts and supplies run out. Reservists' annual training could be delayed without necessary support. The number of contractor personnel covered under H.R. 3210 is being reviewed, but increasing them could pose challenges in determining pay. Furloughed civilians or contractors will only receive pay if Congress passes legislation. Civilians recalled under POMA will not be paid for furloughed time unless Congress decides otherwise. On October 5, 2013, the House passed H.R. 3223 for retroactive pay for federal employees during the shutdown. The Senate has not addressed the bill yet. H.R. 3230 was also passed to cover pay for inactive-duty reservists in FY2014. However, training costs are not included in the appropriations. The bill H.R. 3223 passed by the House provides retroactive pay for federal employees during the shutdown. H.R. 3230 covers pay for inactive-duty reservists in FY2014, but training costs are not included in the appropriations. Reservists might be confined to training without additional expenses, and DOD could use existing stocks or contracts to address issues in the short-term. The bill is part of a package of five \"mini\" CRs providing funding at the FY2013-enacted level for various agencies and programs, including pay for guard and reservists. The Senate and White House have differing views on partial funding appropriations. DOD civilians, reservists, and contractors supporting Afghanistan war and other military operations would continue working during the shutdown. Roughly half of DOD's civilian workforce would be furloughed. Military personnel would remain on duty, while civilian support for certain operations would be \"excepted.\" Individual commanding officers are making decisions on who is furloughed. During the government shutdown, military personnel remained on duty while a large number of civilian employees were temporarily furloughed. The Department of Defense revised its contingency plan after a delay, ensuring that personnel who were \"excepted\" from furlough would receive pay on time. The Department of Defense revised its contingency plan during the government shutdown to ensure that personnel \"excepted\" from furlough would be paid on time. Secretary of Defense Hagel indicated that the issue of bringing back additional groups of civilians and contractors from furlough was under review. The Department of Defense is considering expanding exempt status to reduce furloughs for civilians. Representative McKeon urged Secretary Hagel to use broad latitude provided by H.R. 3210 to end furloughs for DOD civilians, emphasizing the importance of keeping national security running. The Department of Defense, under H.R. 3210, allowed for the recall of most civilian workforce to ensure essential military operations continue during a funding lapse. The status of contractor employees remains uncertain as the Secretary of Defense has yet to make a decision on revising guidance for them. During a funding lapse, some personnel, including uniformed military personnel on active duty, would be \"excepted\" from furloughs and continue to work. Those who are furloughed may not be paid, but could receive retroactive pay if Congress decides to do so. This report outlines guidance and precedents for DOD operations during a funding lapse and discusses the implications of a shutdown on pay for military personnel and civilians. During a funding lapse, military technicians may be affected; activities to protect persons and property that are \"excepted;\" potential effects on contracting; operation of DOD Dependent Schools or childcare centers; duration of Defense Finance and Accounting Service operations; possible use of the \"Feed and Forage Act\" for flexibility. Pay of Uniformed Military Personnel and DOD Civilians: Active-duty military personnel would be \"excepted\" from furloughs according to current DOD guidance. H.R. 3210, the Pay Our Military Act, signed by President Obama on September 30, 2013, provides appropriations to cover the pay and allowances of active-duty military personnel, DOD civilians, and contractors supporting them during a funding lapse. This authority is in effect until January 1, 2015, or until other appropriations are enacted. Unlike the government shutdown in 1995 and 1996, this bill ensures that military personnel are not affected by furloughs. Reservists activated during this time are also covered under DOD's Contingency Plan. The Contingency Plan specifies that activated reservists will continue their duties, excluding inactive duty training unless it directly supports an excepted activity. Reservists can only be ordered to active duty in support of national security operations. H.R. 3210 covers pay for activated reservists but not for inactive duty training. Military technicians, who are federal civilian employees required to be reservists, will also continue their duties. The 2013 DOD guidance states that reservists will continue civilian duties if necessary for excepted activities related to national security, including military operations in Afghanistan. Excepted military activities include administrative, logistical, and medical support for planned or contingency operations. Other necessary activities include recruiting, command, control, communications, and intelligence. Depot maintenance and base support activities are not listed as excepted activities. Depot maintenance and base support activities, typically carried out by civilians, would be affected by DOD's original furlough plan. However, new guidance allows for contractor activities relying on previously appropriated funds to continue, with limitations on new contracts using FY2014 funds for military operations support. The 2013 and 2001 DOD guidance allows dependent schools and child care to operate during a shutdown due to their direct relation to national security. DFAS operations would likely continue using prior year funds, issuing paychecks for military personnel covered under H.R. 3210. DFAS personnel administering military retired pay and retiree benefits would work during a funding lapse as funds for entitlements like pensions are drawn from multi-year funds. The military retirement and health care fund, separate from annual defense appropriations, finances these entitlements. DFAS can use prior year unobligated balances for adjustments during a funding lapse, indicating some administrative flexibility. DFAS personnel can continue operations during a funding lapse using prior year unobligated balances. Reimbursements from other appropriated accounts support DFAS services for national security-related operations. DOD's 2013 guidance allows activities funded through reimbursements to operate for about two weeks. The Feed and Forage Act authorizes contracts on behalf of the United States under certain conditions. The Feed and Forage Act provides funding for military operations, especially during funding lapses. It allows the Department of Defense to obligate funds in advance for specific purposes. While the Act was used during the Vietnam War for delayed appropriations, it is now mainly used for short-term funding for unplanned military operations. The Act's authority for national security-related activities is broader than that provided by other guidance. The Feed and Forage Act allows the Department of Defense to obligate funds for military operations, but does not directly provide authority for paying military personnel. The Act's authority for national security-related activities is broader than other guidance, but it does not allow for disbursements until funds are appropriated. The Act may be used during a shutdown, but its purpose in that context is unclear. The 2013 DOD guidance includes a wide range of activities for protecting health and safety. The 2013 DOD guidance allows critical military operations to continue, including logistics, intelligence, communications, and personnel support activities. The Administration can adjust these guidelines as needed. A lapse in appropriations could impact ongoing military operations. The 2013 DOD guidance allows critical military operations to continue during a lapse in appropriations. Efforts to distinguish between essential national security activities and non-essential ones involve difficult judgments. Unit training, deployment preparations, and medical services would be selectively continued. During a government shutdown, local commanders have the authority to decide which military activities are essential. H.R. 3210 ensures that active-duty military, activated reservists, and essential DOD personnel will be paid on time. Other DOD civilian and contractor personnel may not receive payment. During a government shutdown, contractor personnel may not be paid, causing financial hardships for some. The Defense Department can still obligate funds for essential goods and services to sustain operations. Individual circumstances will determine the impact of a sudden stop in pay on civilian or contractor personnel. During a government shutdown, the Defense Department can obligate funds for essential goods and services to support military operations. However, payments to contractors may be delayed, leading to financial hardships for some. New contracts for non-essential activities may be postponed until appropriations are enacted in the following fiscal year. During a government shutdown, the Defense Department can obligate funds for essential goods and services to support military operations. Funding for R&D, procurement, and shipbuilding is available for a specific number of years, while contract authority for material inventories is not limited by fiscal year. Unobligated balances for these purposes remain available even without new funding. However, money for operation and maintenance is generally only available for one year, leading to potential lapses in funding for day-to-day operations. Vendors may not be paid promptly depending on the source of obligations, and readiness-related activities may not use funds for immediate payments. During a government shutdown, the Defense Department can sustain important operations but may face difficulties in managing acquisitions. The Department of Defense has broad authority to continue activities that provide for national security, but financial constraints may limit this authority. Funds may be obligated in advance of appropriations to carry on permitted activities. During a government shutdown, the Defense Department can sustain important operations, but expenditures of funds derived from obligations are prohibited. Uniformed military personnel and DOD civilian employees may continue duties, but payments will not be made until appropriations become available. The Antideficiency Act establishes legal authority for DOD operations during a funding lapse. The Antideficiency Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. 1341 and 1342, governs operations during a government shutdown. Legal interpretations and agency plans, based on OMB guidance, determine which activities continue. DOD operations during a shutdown are also governed by financial management procedures. The Antideficiency Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. 1341 and 1342, prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds exceeding amounts appropriated, with exceptions for certain government activities. The Antideficiency Act prohibits the government from entering into contracts or obligations for payment without appropriations, unless authorized by law. Department of Defense operations can continue during a funding lapse to protect human life and property. The Antideficiency Act allows for certain activities to continue during a funding lapse, such as signing contracts and employing personnel, but prohibits payments without appropriations. The Antideficiency Act allows for certain activities to continue during a funding lapse, such as signing contracts and employing personnel, but prohibits payments without appropriations. Attorney General opinions and OMB memoranda provide guidance on activities that DOD and other agencies may continue when appropriations are not provided, including activities necessary for orderly termination of agency functions. The Attorney General found that agencies can obligate funds to shut down operations after a funding lapse under the Antideficiency Act. Activities are expected to be limited, with OMB guidance stating shutdown activities should take no more than three or four hours. Departments are authorized to incur obligations for benefit payments under entitlement programs when funds are not subject to a one-year appropriation. The Social Security Administration and DOD can continue to pay personnel and manage pensions during a funding lapse due to their responsibility to distribute benefits from permanent trust funds. DOD can also use prior year funds for activities and purchases, with R&D funding typically available for two years. During a funding lapse, contract authority remains available for obligations for up to five years, with some funds designated as \"no year\" money. Contracts already signed and obligations made from prior years' appropriations can still lead to expenditures, while payments to vendors depend on the funding source. During a funding lapse, contractors may or may not be paid depending on the funding source. Confusion may arise as to which personnel can continue working to manage contracts. Agencies may need to determine if personnel can be excepted from a shutdown to administer funds from prior year appropriations. The Attorney General found that the President has constitutional authority to obligate funds for activities authorized by the Constitution, not just by statute. This authority cannot be denied by Congress, but does not allow the President to create his own obligational authorities. The Antideficiency Act's policy objective should not solely determine authority. The Attorney General found that the President has constitutional authority to obligate funds for activities authorized by the Constitution, not just by statute, but cannot create his own obligational authorities. OMB memoranda suggest that funding for national security-related activities may be continued independently of activities related to the safety of life or property. The Defense Department relies on Section 1342 for authority to protect life and property during a shutdown. OMB guidance allows agencies to conduct essential activities for life and property protection under Section 1342. The Attorney General's 1981 opinion expanded the scope of activities permitted under Section 1342 to include acquiring materials for emergencies. A government agency can employ personal services and incur obligations in advance of appropriations for emergencies. OMB memoranda list activities allowed to continue for life and property protection, such as medical care, law enforcement, disaster assistance, and power distribution. The \"protection of property\" exception enables a wide range of government activities. The government can continue a wide range of activities for life and property protection during a lapse of appropriations, as outlined in the 2013 DOD Guidance. This includes prosecuting the war in Afghanistan and other essential operations for national security. All other activities would need to be shut down in an orderly fashion. During a government shutdown, all activities except those related to life and property protection will be shut down. Military personnel will continue working without pay, while civilian personnel engaged in essential activities will also work without pay. Non-excepted civilian employees will be furloughed. The determination of which functions are excepted from shutdown rests with Military Department Secretaries and Heads of DOD Components. During a government shutdown, Military Department Secretaries and Heads of DOD Components determine which activities are excepted from shutdown. The attached guidance provides general principles for making these determinations, ensuring support for those engaged in war and protection of citizens' lives and property. Examples of \"Excepted\" Activities are outlined in the 2013 DOD shutdown planning guidance, illustrating types of activities that would and would not be excepted during a lapse of appropriation. During a government shutdown, Military Department Secretaries and Heads of DOD Components determine which activities are excepted from shutdown. The attached guidance provides general principles for making these determinations, ensuring support for those engaged in war and protection of citizens' lives and property. Military personnel, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, are not subject to furlough and will continue to report for duty. They may be assigned to carry out non-excepted activities in place of furloughed civilian personnel. Reserve component personnel on active duty may be assigned to perform non-excepted activities in place of furloughed civilian personnel, as long as the activity can be done without incurring new obligations. Reserve component personnel performing Active Guard Reserve (AGR) duty will continue reporting for duty. Inactive duty training that incurs funds is not allowed, unless it directly supports an excepted activity. National Guard members' orders under 32 U.S.C. 502(f) will be terminated unless supporting excepted activities approved by the Secretary of Defense. Following the expiration of appropriations, a minimum number of civilian employees may be retained as needed to execute an orderly suspension of non-excepted activities within a reasonable timeframe. Determinations regarding the status of civilian positions will be made on a position by position basis, using the guidance in this document. Only the minimum number of civilian employees necessary to carry out excepted activities will be exempt from furlough. Positions that provide direct support to excepted positions may also be deemed excepted if they are critical to performing the excepted activity. Civilian personnel paid from expired appropriations may not be exempt from furlough. Personnel paid from sufficient DOD funding are not subject to furlough. Heads of activities can recall personnel in emergencies. Contractors with fully obligated contracts can continue services. New contracts may be affected by funding expiration. New contracts cannot be executed unless supporting an excepted activity. No funds available for new contractors until Congress appropriates additional funds. Contracts funded by expired appropriations may not require termination unless new funds are needed and not for excepted activities. Stop work orders or contract termination may be necessary in such cases. Department can still enter into new contracts for necessary supplies and services for excepted activities. The authority to enter into contracts for necessary supplies and services for excepted activities is emphasized, to be exercised only when delay would endanger national security or human life. Contracts for covered items can be entered into under the Feed and Forage Act when authorized by the Secretary of Defense. Military operations and activities necessary for national security, including logistical, medical, and training activities, are supported. Activities of forces assigned to combatant commands to execute planned operations for national security, including administrative, logistical, medical support, training, and exercises. This also includes activities for recruiting into the Armed Forces during contingency operations, command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities necessary for national security. Activities necessary for national security include telecommunications centers, secure conference capability at military command centers, intelligence data collection, treaty enforcement, emergency response (fire protection, security, law enforcement), terrorist threat warnings, explosive ordnance disposal, nuclear safety and security, air traffic control, search and rescue, utilities, and housing for military personnel. Emergency repair and maintenance services are provided for utilities, power distribution systems, buildings, and military housing. This includes repair of equipment for essential activities such as fire trucks, medical vehicles, and police vehicles. Monitoring and maintenance of alarms, control systems, utilities, and emergency services are also conducted. Additionally, hazardous material control, environmental remediation, oil spill cleanup, and pest control are carried out to prevent imminent danger to life or property. Safe storage and transportation of hazardous materials, including ammunition, are also managed. Activities include safe storage and transportation of hazardous materials, emergency reporting and response, coordination with EPA and other agencies for fire, safety, and environmental concerns, defense support to civil authorities during disasters, and foreign humanitarian assistance in response to crises. The curr_chunk discusses various humanitarian assistance activities in response to disasters or crises, including emergency counseling, suicide and substance abuse counseling, counterdrug activities, mortuary affairs, medical and dental care, veterinary services, and acquisition and logistic support. These activities are authorized by the Secretary of Defense to ensure the safety of life and protection of property. Activities such as contract administration, logistics operations, distribution of authorized items, central receiving points for supplies, education and training, legal support for ongoing legal actions, and assistance for deployed military and civilian employees are considered essential during the shutdown. Legal assistance for military and civilian employees deployed in support of military operations, addressing external deadlines from non-DOD agencies, criminal investigations related to national security, counterterrorism, and morale, welfare, and recreation activities necessary for readiness. Financial management activities to control funds and record obligations. Activities necessary to control funds, record obligations, and manage working capital funds for Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF)/Revolving Fund (RF) activities in support of excepted activities. DWCF/RF activities with positive cash balances can operate until reserves are depleted, accepting orders financed with prior-year appropriations or unfunded orders. Unfunded orders are posted as accounts receivable and billed when appropriations are enacted. The Pay Our Military Act, signed in October 2013, provides appropriations for active duty Armed Forces members during a funding gap. The Act ensures pay and allowances for military personnel while awaiting full-year appropriations for fiscal year 2014. The Pay Our Military Act, signed in October 2013, provides funds for military members on active duty, including Reserve Component members, contractors, and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense who support the Armed Forces during active service. This includes pay, allowances, annual leave, and sick leave. The Memorandum provides guidance for identifying civilian personnel supporting the Armed Forces under the Pay Our Military Act. The responsibility lies with Military Department Secretaries and Heads of DoD Components, with guidance emphasizing consistency and prudence in determining eligible employees. The Department of Defense consulted with the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with the law. The law requires a focus on employees whose activities support the morale, well-being, and readiness of military members. All employees performing \"excepted\" activities are included in this standard. It is important to recognize that every DoD employee contributes to the Department's mission, but only those who directly support active service members are eligible under the Act. The statutory provision provides support to civilian employees who directly support service members in active service and their families. There are two categories of employees covered: those who provide ongoing support to service members and their families, and those whose responsibilities contribute to sustaining capabilities and Force Readiness. The latter category requires a causal connection between the failure to perform activities during an appropriations lapse and a negative impact on military members in the future. Activities that provide ongoing support to service members include Health Care, SAPRO, Behavioral Health, Transition Assistance, Family Support, Weapons Systems Maintenance, Training, Supply Chain Management, and Human Resources. These activities are crucial for military readiness and future impact on military members must be considered during appropriations lapses. Activities in support of near term Force Readiness, Human Resource Activities, Installation Support, Commissary operations, Payroll activities, provision of guidance to military members, and necessary support for all listed activities including legal, human resources, engineering, and administrative support. Examples of activities that contribute to capabilities and sustaining force readiness include Acquisition Program oversight, financial management, contract, logistics, and engineering activities. Activities in support of long-term force readiness, including repair and maintenance of weapons systems, supply chain management, intelligence, information technology, and necessary support functions. Employees within the scope of the Act are those whose activities impact future readiness of the Armed Forces, such as delays in equipment availability. The Department of Defense employees engaged in critical functions, including CIO, DCMO, Legislative Affairs, Public Affairs, Auditor functions, non-DoD support, and Civil works. All DoD employees play a vital role in the long-term strength of the Armed Forces and the nation. The Department of Defense employees engaged in critical functions are vital for the long-term strength of the Armed Forces and the nation. The Act provides appropriations for personnel but not for equipment and supplies needed for efficient operation. If the lapse of appropriations continues, many workers will not be able to do their jobs, leading to critical shortages. If the lapse of appropriations continues, workers may cease to do their jobs due to critical shortages. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) will oversee the implementation of guidance, with limited authority to purchase supplies. Strong leadership is appreciated during this difficult time."
