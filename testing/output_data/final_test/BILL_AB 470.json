    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Pool Safety Act is enacted in California to address the leading cause of death for children aged one to four, drowning. Swimming pools offer recreation and exercise opportunities for families, but safety measures are crucial to prevent accidents. Additional children who survive near-drowning incidents may suffer irreversible brain injuries, leading to lifelong learning deficiencies. Close parental supervision and barriers around pools are essential for child safety. Swimming lessons are encouraged to teach water safety. Installing residential pool barriers is a key strategy to reduce drowning incidents during water sports activities in California. This amendment aims to define specific terms related to water safety regulations. For the purpose of this chapter, a home inspection is a noninvasive examination of the mechanical, electrical, plumbing systems, and structural components of a residential dwelling to identify material defects. A home inspection for real property with a swimming pool or spa includes examining drowning prevention safety features. Energy efficiency inspection may cover insulation, windows, heating/cooling systems, appliances, fans, and thermostats. The home inspection includes examining the exhaust and cooling fans, thermostat type, integrity of walls and windows, and solar control efficiency of existing windows. A \"material defect\" significantly affects the value, habitability, or safety of the dwelling. Style or aesthetics are not considered in determining defects. A \"home inspection report\" is a written report issued after a home inspection, describing inspected systems, structures, material defects, and recommendations. For dwellings with pools or spas, the report must identify drowning prevention safety features. A \"home inspector\" is an individual who performs home inspections. A home inspector is an individual who performs home inspections. A transfer refers to the sale, exchange, or lease of real property with one to four dwelling units. Section 115922 of the Health and Safety Code requires new swimming pools or spas at single-family homes to have at least two drowning prevention safety features. The Health and Safety Code requires new swimming pools or spas at single-family homes to have at least two drowning prevention safety features: removable mesh fencing meeting ASTM standards with a self-closing gate, an approved safety pool cover, exit alarms on doors leading to the pool, and self-closing, self-latching devices on those doors placed at least 54 inches above the floor. An alarm for swimming pools or spas must meet ASTM Standard F 2208 and sound upon unauthorized entry into the water. A swimming protection alarm for individual use is not considered a qualifying drowning prevention safety feature. Other protection measures must provide equal or greater protection and be independently verified by an approved testing laboratory. Before final approval for construction or remodeling work, the local building code official must inspect drowning safety prevention features. The requirements of this article do not apply to public swimming pools, hot tubs with locking safety covers, or residential settings other than single-family homes. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
