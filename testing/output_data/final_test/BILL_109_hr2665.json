The Congress finds that secure access to energy is crucial for national security, especially in the transportation sector heavily reliant on oil. The 1973 OPEC oil embargo led to severe shortages and economic impact in the US. President Carter's \"Carter Doctrine\" in 1980 emphasized the importance of protecting the Persian Gulf region. The United States considers control of the Persian Gulf region as an assault on its vital interests and will use military force if necessary. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the US sent troops to expel Iraqi forces, liberate Kuwait, and protect Saudi Arabia. Many oil-producing nations do not share US values, and during conflicts like Afghanistan and the war on terrorism, some did not openly support US campaigns. Many terrorists involved in September 11 came from major OPEC nations. The United States aims to reduce its dependence on oil from OPEC nations to enhance national security. This involves increasing fuel efficiency in the transportation sector to secure access to oil supplies and lessen reliance on countries with conflicting interests.
