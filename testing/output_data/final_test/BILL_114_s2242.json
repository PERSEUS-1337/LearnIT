    "content": "The \"Save Oak Flat Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 authorizes the transfer of approximately 2422 acres of Forest Service land known as \"Oak Flat\" in the Tonto National Forest in Southeastern Arizona to a mining company called Resolution Copper. This transfer would result in the destruction of tribal sacred areas, prevent American Indians from practicing their religions and ceremonies, and have significant negative environmental impacts such as depleting and contaminating water resources. Resolution Copper plans to use block cave mining to extract ore from beneath Oak Flat, causing surface subsidence and collapse. The Tonto National Forest, where Oak Flat is located, was established in 1905 from ancestral homelands of the Tonto Apache forcibly removed by the United States Army in the 1880s. Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was included without proper legislative process, bypassing the will of the majority of House members. It was originally introduced as H.R. 687 and S. 339 in the 113th Congress but faced obstacles in the House and Senate. American Indian tribes have ceded millions of acres of land and suffered under Federal assimilationist policies. Despite this, they continue to practice their religions in land-based sacred areas. Many sacred areas of American Indian tribes are now located on Federal lands due to past land policies. The United States has a trust responsibility to protect tribal sacred areas on Federal lands, requiring consultations with tribes before making decisions. However, section 3003 mandates the conveyance of tribal sacred areas on Federal lands without considering tribal input, leading to opposition from Indian tribes nationwide. Section 3003 mandates the conveyance of Federal lands with significant religious, cultural, historic, and anthropological significance for Indian tribes to a private company, circumventing environmental review procedures and potentially causing water pollution in the Oak Flat area. The inclusion of section 3003 in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 sets a negative precedent for legislative process and Federal Indian policy by mandating the conveyance of Federal lands to a private company, potentially causing water pollution in the Oak Flat area. The Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which mandated the conveyance of Federal lands to a private company, is repealed."
