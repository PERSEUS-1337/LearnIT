    "content": "At the height of Soviet military power in 1985-1986, there were 4.9 million servicemen and women in the active duty forces, and about another 1 million belonged to the Warsaw Treaty Organization. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, severe budgetary problems in Russia led to deep cuts in troop numbers and weapons acquisition. Despite reductions, the Russian military remains the fifth largest in the world with 1 million active personnel in 2011, behind China, India, North Korea, and the United States. Russia has decreased defense spending but still maintains one of the highest in the world. They rely on nuclear forces as a deterrent and response to attacks due to weakened conventional forces. Reforms were initiated in 2007 to combat corruption and improve military capabilities, with further reforms launched after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. The military reforms launched by Serdyukov in 2008 have significantly altered the force structure and operations of Russia's armed forces inherited from the Soviet Union. The impact of these reforms on conventional armed forces capabilities is a subject of debate, with questions raised about whether they aim to recreate a Soviet-era \"superpower\" armed forces or create smaller, professional armed forces. The reforms include changes in military leadership, structure, arms industry modernization, power projection efforts, and the military budget. Russia's military reforms launched in 2008 have altered the force structure and operations of the armed forces. There are contradictory intentions among Russia's leaders, with some seeking global reach for vast wars and others focusing on tailored forces for modern missions. Despite efforts to support modern missions, there are economic, technological, and demographic impediments to Russia's ability to recreate \"superpower\" armed forces. The National Security Strategy of Russia through 2020 outlines current threats and security priorities, praising former President Putin for leading the country out of crisis. It emphasizes Russia's resource potential and multi-vector diplomacy, aiming to consolidate its influence as a leading power in the world. The strategy was developed by the Russian Security Council. The Russian Security Council, led by Nikolay Patrushev and Yuriy Baluyevskiy, developed a strategy advocating for bolstering Russia's international status. The strategy highlights new threats from globalization, criticizes NATO as obsolete, and calls for a greater regional security role for the CSTO. The Russian Security Council's strategy criticizes NATO's enlargement and out-of-area missions, warning of potential military conflicts near Russia's borders. It also criticizes the United States for seeking military supremacy, stating Russia will maintain parity in strategic weapons at a low cost. The Russian Security Council's strategy emphasizes national defense and internal control priorities, including preserving strategic nuclear capabilities and enhancing counter-intelligence efforts. It also aims to establish a strategic partnership with the United States while emphasizing the military's responsibility to protect Russian citizens in nearby states. The strategy reflects concerns about NATO's enlargement and criticizes the United States for seeking military supremacy. The release of the Russian Security Council's strategy led to the removal of explicit references to the United States as a threat. The strategy remains conservative and opposes military reforms. Different views on the strategy's threat perceptions are presented, with no clear indication of which will determine future politics. President Medvedev approved the new military strategy. President Medvedev approved a new military doctrine on February 5, 2010, which addresses increasing dangers that could develop into threats. The doctrine mentions NATO as a danger due to its enlargement and out of area missions. It also highlights concerns about strategic missile defenses and conventional precision strike weapons. The doctrine allows for Russian troops to be used abroad to protect Russian interests and international security. The 2009 military doctrine authorized the use of troops abroad to protect Russian citizens and combat piracy at sea. It emphasized forward-basing in former Soviet republics and reiterated language from the 2000 doctrine regarding nuclear retaliation. Speculation about preemptive nuclear strikes was not included in the new doctrine. The 2009 military doctrine authorized the use of troops abroad to protect Russian citizens and combat piracy at sea. It emphasized forward-basing in former Soviet republics and reiterated language from the 2000 doctrine regarding nuclear retaliation. The new doctrine may narrow the circumstances for the use of conventional weapons, particularly when the \"very existence\" of the Russian state is threatened. It continues to allow for the possible first use of nuclear weapons during a conflict. The national security strategy hints at improved U.S.-Russian ties, contrasting with the more militaristic tone of the military doctrine. Some observers suggest that the military doctrine fails to reflect recent military reforms and combat experience in the North Caucasus. It emphasizes the projection of great power status worldwide and preparing for major land battles in Europe and Asia. Anatoly Serdyukov was appointed defense minister in 2007 and retained the position after Medvedev became president. Anatoly Serdyukov, appointed defense minister in 2007, implemented reforms in the armed forces. He clashed with Army General Yuriy Baluyevskiy over reducing the military size. Baluyevskiy was replaced by Nikolay Makarov in 2008. The conflict with Georgia in August 2008 highlighted the need for military capability upgrades. The conflict with Georgia in August 2008 exposed the Russian military's lack of modern war capabilities, including deficiencies in command, control, communications, intelligence, and tactical communications. This highlighted the need for military capability upgrades. President Medvedev and Defense Minister Serdyukov discussed a radical military reform plan in September-October 2008 to address the Russian military's lack of modern war capabilities. The reform aimed to create permanent combat-ready units, improve command and control, enhance personnel training, equip the armed forces with new weapons, and increase salaries and benefits. Medvedev decreed the launch of these reforms, directing military officials to implement the plan by the end of the year. President Medvedev and Defense Minister Serdyukov discussed a radical military reform plan in September-October 2008 to address the Russian military's lack of modern war capabilities. The reform aimed to create permanent combat-ready units, improve command and control, enhance personnel training, equip the armed forces with new weapons, and increase salaries and benefits. Serdyukov announced details of the reform plan, including strengthening the Strategic Rocket Forces and the Navy, creating aerospace defense forces, and bolstering rapid reaction forces. Medvedev ordered a rearmament effort due to military shortcomings exposed by the Russia-Georgia conflict and US missile defense efforts. Russia's experiences in combating separatism and terrorism in the North Caucasus also motivated the reform. Shamanov, a veteran of combat in Chechnya and Georgia, exemplified motivations for military reforms in 2009. The reforms aimed to create a more mobile and armed army, similar to the US military structure. The plan included reducing the armed forces' size from 1.2 million to under 1 million by 2012. The military reforms initiated by Serdyukov in 2009 aimed to reduce the size of the armed forces from 1.2 million to under 1 million by 2012. Key initiatives included cutting the officer corps from 355,000 to 150,000, abolishing noncommissioned officer ranks, and reducing the number of officials and officers at the Defense Ministry and General Staff. The military reforms in 2009 led to a reduction in the size of the armed forces, including cutting the Ground Forces from 400,000 to 270,000 troops and converting divisions to brigades. The Air Force and Navy were also affected, with a focus on acquiring ships and submarines. President Medvedev implemented these changes on March 5, 2010. President Medvedev claimed that armed forces reorganization had been completed, personnel reduced to 1 million, and focus shifted to improving combat readiness and weapons modernization. Challenges included issues with contract troops, officer corps size, and supplying new brigades with weaponry. General Makarov admitted transition to professional soldiers had largely failed, with future contracting focusing on NCOs. Critics highlighted ongoing challenges in the military. Former President Putin launched the use of contract troops in the military in 2003. Critics argued that contractees were paid below adequate wages, leading to low quality and numbers. Allegations of funds being pilfered from defense budgets for transitioning to contracts were made. In late 2010, a large number of contractees were discharged, leaving about 110,000 contractees. Funding was shifted to procure weapons and boost salaries of remaining contractees. The reduction in contractees was controversial, with calls for new contracting efforts to obtain skilled personnel. Military officers in the Airborne Troops also raised concerns. President Medvedev approved raising the number of contract personnel to 425,000 by 2017 in response to objections from military officers and civilians. General Makarov stated that this is just the first stage of reforms, with the ultimate goal being a staffing model similar to the Czech armed forces. Increasing pay and benefits will be crucial in attracting more contractees to the Russian military. President Medvedev approved raising the number of contract personnel to 425,000 by 2017 in response to objections from military officers and civilians. General Makarov stated that this is just the first stage of reforms, with the ultimate goal being a staffing model similar to the Czech armed forces. A new process would be introduced for training and offering contracts to prospective contractees due to a demographic need for more contractees. Russian military analyst Viktor Litovkin criticized the apparent change in stance regarding the need for professionals in the military. Serdyukov faced resistance for planned reduction in officer corps, but increased number of officers to 220,000 by 2012. Additional 70,000 officers needed for Aerospace Defense Command and high-tech billets. Sources for new officers include 39,000 officers not discharged and reinstating lieutenants as sergeants. President Medvedev set five reform tasks for 2011, including implementing the new State Armaments Program, enhancing troop control, creating the Aerospace Defense Command, strengthening defense of the country's borders, and prioritizing social guarantees for servicemen and military pensioners. He also pledged to increase a lieutenant's pay to 50,000 rubles a month by the beginning of 2012. At the beginning of 2012, pensions would increase by at least 60% and the armed forces modernization had completed the creation of brigades, logistics improvement, combat readiness, and new housing for officers. However, there is a lack of transparency in Russia's weapons procurement and military reform. In late March 2011, at a meeting of the Academy of Military Sciences, Makarov criticized Russia's past failures to modernize its armed forces, blaming military planners for focusing on obsolete arms and large-scale linear actions instead of new-generation defense strategies. The Russia-Georgia conflict in 2008 forced reforms, but some efforts seemed ad hoc due to a lack of scientific-theoretical basis. Under Serdyukov's reforms, the Ministry of Defense gained more power to implement changes through personnel shifts. The president, as commander-in-chief, approves military doctrine, appoints top commanders, and endorses plans for the Armed Forces and civil defense. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are directly subordinate to the President, who issues annual decrees on the draft and signs international treaties on defense. The constitution and a 1996 law provide limited legislative oversight over defense matters. The Ministry of Defense ensures civilian control over the military, with efforts to increase the number of civilians in the ministry. The General Staff previously had substantial operational control. The General Staff, under Serdyukov's reforms, has been downsized and now focuses on defense research, education, and foreign military relations. The Chief of the General Staff reports directly to the defense minister, indicating a shift in power dynamics within the military hierarchy. The General Staff's Center for Military-Strategic Research has been subordinated to the General Staff Academy, with the GRU being a key element of its power. There have been shifts in control over Spetsnaz brigades, indicating a power struggle between the Defense Ministry and the General Staff. The GRU is seen as crucial due to instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan, potentially affecting the \"Central Asian axis.\" General Makarov emphasized a clear military reform plan until 2020, with debates on the relationship between the General Staff and Defense Ministry. Some analysts believe the GRU aims to assert operational powers, evidenced by the movement of Spetsnaz brigades and calls for Aerospace Defense Forces to be subordinate to the General Staff. The Security Council, composed of top officials, is a consultative body for threat assessments and force planning. It was seen as a retirement post for military officials, but played a role in brokering agreements during the Russia-Georgia conflict. President Medvedev issued an edict on the Security Council. President Medvedev's edict in early May 2011 strengthened the role of the presidential administration in overseeing military affairs, including defense organization, military development, and combating corruption. The Security Council now monitors budget expenditures for national defense, with an Interdepartmental Commission for Military Security assisting in these functions. The status of the Security Council's secretary is strengthened, overseeing the implementation of decisions and activities of the military branches and combat arms of service. Military reforms by Serdyukov have impacted all branches and combat arms, including the introduction of the brigade system and consolidation of military districts. The military districts were consolidated into four larger ones with new responsibilities, including the establishment of a new Aerospace Defense command. President Medvedev called for unifying aerospace defenses under a single command by the end of 2011. The Aerospace Defense Operational-Strategic Command's main function is to detect attacks and warn state leadership for decision-making. In June 2011, a planning exercise was conducted in Moscow on shooting down air attackers. The Aerospace Defense Command is set to merge with the Military Space Forces, with S-400 and planned S-500 missile systems forming its basis. The development of the S-500 surface-to-air missiles by Almaz-Antey Air Defense is seen as crucial for the new command's effectiveness, although both the S-400 and S-500 systems are still years away from completion. The creation of the Operational-Strategic Command of Aerospace Defense was a key part of Serdyukov's reforms, driven by concerns of potential U.S. or NATO-led attacks with cruise missiles. The Command was established to counter such threats, with a focus on protecting command and control agencies from decapitating strikes. This decision was made in response to the anticipated proliferation of cruise missiles in Western inventories by the 2020s. The creation of the Operational-Strategic Command of Aerospace Defense was driven by concerns of potential U.S. or NATO-led attacks with cruise missiles. President Medvedev decreed the creation of four military districts in July 2010 to replace the Soviet-era distribution of equipment and manpower. The new military districts/JSCs are the Central, Eastern, Southern, and Western, with specific roles in defending Russia against foreign invasion. In late October 2010, Serdyukov announced the establishment of four military districts/JSCs in Russia. Each district has its own commander with authority over personnel and equipment, aiming to reduce bureaucratic hurdles to warfighting. Troops from various ministries located within a district fall under the operational control of the commander. The four new commanders of the military districts/JSCs, under the operational control of the commander, are pro-reform. Mission planning has been transferred to the military districts/JSCs, while training and armaments needs remain with the branches of service. Ground Forces retain control over combat training, peacekeeping activities, and armaments planning. Two mountain warfare brigades are combating insurgency in the North Caucasus. Two mountain warfare brigades were fully operational by 2008 to combat insurgency in the North Caucasus. Serdyukov's reform effort introduced brigades throughout most of the armed forces by the end of 2009. By 2009, 85 brigades were formed in the Ground Forces, including combined-arms, missile troops, artillery, army air defense, signal, electronic warfare, and air assault brigades. Despite claims of being fully equipped, this assessment has been contradicted by Russian and other observers. In March 2011, testimony to the Defense and Security Committee of the Federation Council indicated differing opinions on the number of Ground Forces brigades, with estimates ranging from 64 to 70. The readiness of the Ground Forces was hindered by aging weaponry that needed modernization. A decision was made in early 2011 to establish heavy, medium, and light combined-arms brigades in the Ground Forces to address readiness issues. Heavy brigades would be equipped with tanks and armored vehicles up to 65 tons, medium brigades would be multirole with armored vehicles in development, and light brigades would be prepared for rapid deployment. The Airborne Forces of the Army, a rapid-reaction force, resisted the switch to brigade structure but was exempted. It consists of 35,000 personnel in four airborne divisions, one brigade, and specialized regiments. Despite exemption, readiness has been impacted by reforms. In late July 2011, General Makarov stated that readiness in the Airborne Forces had decreased since the reforms began, with 69% of personnel being conscriptees. He aimed for a minimum of 50% contract personnel and had formed airborne and air assault battalions with 70% contract personnel in 2010. By mid-2011, there were 184,000 contract troops and about 600,000 conscripts, with officer numbers increasing from 150,000 to 220,000 by 2012. However, there were doubts about whether the armed forces had reached 1 million personnel, with observers questioning the reported recruitment levels. The military reforms aim to create fully manned brigades for combat operations with a reduced need for reserve mobilization. The existing mobilization system is partially restructured, with unclear ultimate status. Some elements of the military advocate for maintaining substantial mobilization capability. Training of reservists was assigned to military district commanders in 2010. In 2010, reservists were assigned to military district commanders, ending the practice of training within brigades. The reserve system is reportedly in collapse, with equipment pilferage and lack of reservist involvement in training. Makarov claimed that a mass mobilization could man 180 brigades, but questions were raised about this figure. Some observers questioned Makarov's figure of 180 brigades for mass mobilization and raised concerns about unclear plans for training reserve troops and officers. A government-backed bill to create an active reserve was submitted to the Russian Duma in July 2011, calling for a phased implementation over three years. Former officers and privates are to sign three-year contracts in 2011 for training and exercises, with the reserve officers and sergeants receiving $400-$500 per month. The budget for creating an active reserve in 2011 was set at $15.8 million. President Medvedev initiated military reforms in July 2008, directing the consolidation of 65 military higher educational institutions into 16 large training centers by 2013. The budget for creating an active reserve in 2011 was set at $15.8 million, gradually increasing to $34.6 million by 2014 to cover 8,600 active reservists. Military reforms resulted in thousands of officers being relieved of duty but retained in a pool for future service. Military reforms in Russia led to thousands of officers being relieved of duty but kept in a pool for potential reassignment. General admissions to military higher educational institutions were significantly reduced in 2010. General Makarov mentioned the ongoing work on troop and officer training for permanent operational readiness, emphasizing the need to update guidance documents and regulations. The failure of the contract system has resulted in conscription remaining the primary source of manpower for creating fully manned permanent readiness units. The shift to one-year conscription terms led to a need for better training and supervision by NCOs. To address this, 5,000 junior officers were reassigned as NCOs, and the Ryazan Airborne Troops Higher Command School was reorganized to train senior sergeants. The school also began training conscripts in a three-month program, with other military institutions temporarily focusing on NCO training. The training programs for sergeants in Russia were restructured, with senior sergeants undergoing a two-year program and other sergeants a 5-10 month program. Former sergeants, warrant officers, conscripts, and active duty contractees were admitted for training. The DOSAAF organization, affiliated with the Communist Party, provided paramilitary training to youth. In 2009, it was renamed and in 2011, it resumed its former name to revitalize pre-induction training due to the reduction of conscription to one year. In 2011, DOSAAF provided training for 64,000 individuals joining the armed forces, with calls to expand training in schools. Russian commentators advocated for stronger pre-draft military training, suggesting at least two years of service for national security. President Medvedev established eight \"presidential cadet schools\" to enhance pre-induction training and attract more to military careers. In March 2010, Russia established eight \"presidential cadet schools\" for servicemen's children and orphans. The first school opened in Orenburg in September 2010 with 800 students, and a second school is planned for Tula in 2012. Russia has focused on weapons modernization, aiming to maintain technological independence in producing armaments despite challenges from the Soviet Union's breakup. Russia has sought to establish business relations with former production facilities in newly independent republics to ensure a stable supply chain. The defense industry in Russia is focused on the production of armaments and military equipment in line with the state arms program. There are numerous defense research institutes and industries, many of which are state-owned. The government is working to consolidate defense industries into holding companies. These companies also handle non-military functions like food services and laundry. The defense industry in Russia focuses on producing armaments and military equipment under the state arms program. Holding companies handle military duties and non-military functions like food services and laundry. Rostekhnologii State Corporation was established to consolidate defense and nondefense high-technology firms, led by Sergey Chemizov. Rostekhnologii State Corporation, led by Sergey Chemizov, is a private entity not subject to bankruptcy laws with limited reporting requirements. It has taken over 580 defense and nondefense firms, employing 780,000 workers. The goal is to boost high-technological transformation, increase sales of high-tech goods, attract investment, and facilitate foreign defense technology transfers. Defense industrial production increased in the 2000s after a decline in the 1990s. Defense industrial production in Russia increased somewhat in the 2000s due to boosted military procurement orders and arms exports, but it still remained below Soviet-era levels. Analysts believe that state-controlled defense industries face challenges such as outdated technology, aging workforce, inefficient management, and lack of relationships with Western firms for technology exchanges. In 2008, Prime Minister Putin had to provide emergency funds to prevent bankruptcies in the defense sector. In December 2010, officials confirmed that many defense firms taken over by the government were bankrupt due to mismanagement, corruption, and technological backwardness. The Izhmash holding company, a key player in Russia's defense industry, was on the verge of bankruptcy due to incompetent management. Lieutenant General Sergey Karakayev emphasized that reforms under Serdyukov aimed to protect Russia's offensive nuclear capabilities. Russian defense analyst Margarete Klein highlights the prioritization of nuclear forces for deterrence, leading to inadequate funding for modernizing conventional armed forces. Despite steady arms exports, defense procurements have been increasing in recent years. In recent years, defense procurements in Russia have been increasing, with a new arms acquisition plan set to further boost spending. The Russia-Georgia conflict prompted the recognition that some military equipment needed to be purchased abroad. A Federal Agency on Procurement of Weapons Systems was established in 2008 to enhance the defense ministry's control over defense contracting. The Equipment and Logistics agency, established in 2008, aims to oversee defense contracts to reduce wasteful spending and corruption. It will gradually take on more contract responsibilities, with plans to handle all contracts by 2013. Additionally, a Scientific-Technical Council was formed to review R&D proposals for arms and equipment. The NTS oversees military research institutes formed from various organizations. Only one-fifth of R&D proposals were funded in 2011. The 2010 defense order was not fulfilled, leading to criticism for failing to deliver weaponry as agreed. The 2010 defense order faced delays in delivering weapons systems, including submarines, aircraft, and infantry fighting vehicles. The Nizhnyy Novgorod Association of Manufacturers and Enterprises attributed the shortfalls to inadequate government funding and an unrealistic procurement process. The 2010 defense order faced delays in delivering weapons due to inadequate funding and an unrealistic procurement process. Ministry of Industry official Vladimir Nefedov supported the defense industry argument, stating that the Defense Ministry's delays in finalizing contracts gave defense industries limited time to produce weaponry. Analyst Ivan Safronov noted that the 2010 order was mostly completed, with 50% of weapons delivered from the 2009 order and 70% from the 2010 order. Defense Minister Serdyukov reported failures in the 2010 order to President Medvedev, suggesting disciplinary measures against some defense directors. President Medvedev criticized the lack of fulfillment of the 2010 defense order, threatening disciplinary action against defense industry directors. Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov reported dismissals of personnel, including Anatoliy Perminov, in response to the President's concerns. In response to President Medvedev's criticism of the 2010 defense order, several personnel, including Anatoliy Perminov, were dismissed or reprimanded. Prime Minister Putin announced a significant 19.4 trillion ruble weapons procurement plan for 2011-2020 to modernize the armed forces, aiming to upgrade 11% of military equipment annually and increase the share of modern weaponry to 70% by 2020. The program includes gradually increasing funds to address past payment delays to defense firms. Serdyukov announced in July 2011 that defense firms would receive up to 100% of funding in advance, with a 25% profit margin allowed as long as profits were reinvested in modernization. General Makarov emphasized the importance of modernizing weapons in defense reforms, stating the need for modern equipment in the army. The 2011-2020 military procurement program will focus on nuclear weapons and delivery systems. The 10-year procurement program in Russia focuses on nuclear weapons, fighter aircraft, ships, submarines, air-defense systems, digital communications, and intelligence capabilities. R&D funding has been reduced to 10% of planned spending, with complaints of funds disappearing without results. To compensate, Russia is increasing foreign weapons purchases with technology transfers and emphasizing procurement funding for basic research. President Medvedev ordered Defense Minister Serdyukov to address delays in the 2011 defense order and to dismiss officials hindering its fulfillment. Serdyukov warned of sanctions against those pressuring for price increases in contracts. About one-fifth of defense order funding remained uncontracted due to pricing issues. President Medvedev ordered Defense Minister Serdyukov to address delays in the 2011 defense order and dismiss officials hindering its fulfillment. Serdyukov warned of sanctions against those pressuring for price increases in contracts. Contracts would be signed in August 2011 with 100% funding provided to prevent a repeat of the 2010-2011 situation. Military doctrine prioritizes domestic weapons production but also includes purchases of advanced military technology to revitalize the defense industrial sector. Former Deputy Defense Minister Popovkin emphasized acquiring technologies for domestic production. Russia openly expresses willingness to pay for technologies and buy licenses for production, with the condition of transfer to Russian territory. Suppliers have been hesitant to provide sensitive technologies. The arms import policy involves purchasing equipment with technology transfer initially, followed by joint ventures for serial production in Russia. Deputy Chair of the State Duma's Defense Committee supports purchasing foreign weapons to stimulate Russian defense industries. The policy includes reestablishing ties for arms technology purchases. Russia has been reestablishing ties with defense industries in former Soviet Union countries to improve their products, including joint ventures for co-production of weapons based on Soviet-era designs. They have also pursued high-technology transfers from European and Asian countries. In 2007, a deal was signed with France for thermal imagers for Russian tanks. Russian military vehicles are required to have domestically made parts, as stated by then-First Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov in 2008. In April 2008, Russian officials emphasized the need for military vehicles to use only domestically made parts. Prime Minister Putin expressed concern about dependence on foreign suppliers for air defense systems. The debate on importing materials or limiting technology transfers intensified after the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Lieutenant-General Shamanov stressed the importance of outfitting troops with necessary assets. The position on outfitting troops with necessary assets is specific, with a willingness to purchase from foreign manufacturers if domestic industry cannot compete. Collaboration with foreign defense industries is seen as necessary for Russia to offer modern weapons for export. The purchase of UAVs from Israel Aerospace Industries in 2009 aimed to modernize Russia's defense production after observing the effectiveness of Israeli UAVs during the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. In late 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) trained 50 Russian pilots to operate UAVs under a deal. A follow-on $400 million contract was signed for a joint venture to assemble Heron UAVs in Russia. Russian UAV production faced challenges due to poor quality micro-electronics. French firm Sagem supplied navigation systems for Russian aircraft since the 1990s. In December 2010, Sagem and Rosboroneksport formed a joint venture in Russia. In February 2011, Russia negotiated to procure the FELIN infantry combat uniform from Sagem for a Russian version by 2020. Defense cooperation with India includes a $295 million contract for joint development of a fifth-generation fighter aircraft. Russia also negotiated with France for the purchase of Mistral-Class ships. In 2009, Russia negotiated with France for the purchase of Mistral-Class warships. French President initially stated the ships would be sold without armaments, but Russia insisted on including command systems and weapons. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress and the government of Georgia. In 2011, an agreement was signed for two Mistrals to be built in each country, marking the first sale of a major weapons system by a NATO member to Russia. New shipyard facilities will be built in Kronstadt, Russia, to construct two Mistrals, with plans to build other warships. Deputy Minister Bulgakov took over Mistral purchase duties after the transfer of First Deputy Minister Popovkin. Vice Admiral Borisov was reportedly removed from the negotiating team for making unilateral decisions. Rosoboronexport General Director Isaikin signed a contract in mid-June 2011. In mid-June 2011, Russia signed a contract with France for the purchase of two Mistral-class warships. The French side agreed to transfer know-how to Russia, including computer codes for combat systems. Russian firms will be involved in the construction of the warships. Details on pricing, timeframes, and building additional warships in Russia will be finalized in a separate agreement. In early July 2011, Russia demonstrated intentions of continued cooperation with foreign firms through the purchase of Mistral warships from France. Russia and the United States have been competing for top place in global arms sales, with Russia accounting for about one-quarter and the US for slightly less than one-third of global weapons exports from 2005-2009. Russia's arms deliveries fluctuated from $3.3 billion in 2005 to $6 billion in 2006, with a significant jump to $10 billion in 2010. Russia's arms export deliveries reached $10 billion in 2010, with $48 billion in future orders. The country expanded cooperation and increased volumes of arms deliveries, including spare parts and servicing. Despite unrest in the Middle East, arms deliveries for 2011 were projected to exceed $9 billion. Military aircraft and helicopters were highlighted as major components of agreements and deliveries. Key recipients of Russian arms from 2000-2010 include China, India, Algeria, Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Yemen. Around 70 countries utilize Soviet-era weaponry and are customers for servicing and upgrades. Russia's defense industries heavily rely on arms exports to generate revenue, especially since the 1990s. Military academician Vladimir Lutovinov expressed concern in 2008 that the defense sector survives by producing weapons for foreign armies, as arms sales to countries like Algeria, Yemen, and Libya are crucial. The prices at which weapons are sold abroad are sometimes lower than those for Russia's own armed forces. The Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSVTS) oversees import and export licenses for military products, participates in arms sales negotiations, and assists in setting up arms shows abroad. Despite challenges from defense industry reorganization, FSVTS Director Mikhail Dmitriyev notes a decrease in international complaints about Russian weapons, emphasizing competitive pricing and quality as key advantages in the arms market. Russian arms exports are overseen by FSVTS, with Rosoboroneksport controlling exports from over 100 firms. Besides Rosoboroneksport, 21 other firms are authorized to export weapons. Despite a recent decline in arms transfers to India and China, sales are expected to remain substantial. Russia has sold combat aircraft, tanks, and other weaponry to India, including the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier renamed Vikramaditya for $1.5 billion in 2004. The refurbishment of the Russian aircraft carrier for India faced delays and cost overruns, leading to a final delivery in early 2013 at a cost of $2.3 billion. Russia has also engaged in co-production of fighter aircraft, tanks, and missiles with India. Additionally, Russia has sold various weaponry to China, but recent tensions have hindered further arms agreements. In 2011, Rosoboroneksport signed its first contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. In May 2011, Rosoboroneksport signed a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to export 21 Mi-17 helicopters to Afghanistan for the Afghan Army. Serdyukov's reforms aim to enhance Russia's power projection capabilities in Soviet successor states, with extended leases for bases and troop deployments in Georgia's breakaway regions. The reforms prioritize maintaining military presence in Soviet successor states, with less emphasis on global power projection. Russia has strengthened its presence in the Arctic and conducts demonstrative exercises. Russia has strengthened its military presence in Soviet successor states, including Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, and Moldova's Transnistria region. They have reintroduced substantial forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia after the 2008 conflict with Georgia. Additionally, Russia cooperates with international forces and participates in exercises like BLACKSEAFOR. They are also focusing on bolstering the military power of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Russia participates in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) with China and other members, sharing leadership responsibilities. Russian involvement aims to enhance regional security and counter Chinese influence. In 2007, President Putin relaunched a policy of power projection beyond borders, increasing rhetoric against U.S. foreign policy and NATO. Russia resumed strategic long-range bomber patrols in 2007, conducted naval exercises in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, and bolstered the military power of the Collective Security Treaty Organization. In November-December 2008, Russian naval ships visited Venezuela and Cuba for exercises, marking a significant presence in the Caribbean Sea. Presidents Medvedev and Bush agreed to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden, leading to Russian ships joining international operations. Despite relaunched patrols and exercises, Russia has not prioritized establishing a global network of military bases, reflecting a lower emphasis on military expenditures for global power projection. Russia has increased military expenditures and deployments for global power projection, with plans to refit the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and purchase Mistral warships. Despite opposition, there will be no funding for new aircraft carriers. Defense budgets have risen due to reforms by former President Putin and recent efforts, supported by the country's improved economy since 1999. Defense spending increased in the 2000s and continued to rise slightly after the 2008 global financial crisis. Russian defense spending increased slightly after the 2008 global financial crisis, with a focus on boosting the economy and modernizing procurement. However, it still lags behind U.S. and former Soviet levels, with issues of corruption and mismanagement affecting its efficacy. The transparency of military spending has decreased over the years, making it difficult to estimate the actual allocation of funds. Russia's military expenditures are estimated to be the fifth largest in the world, with plans to surpass France and the United Kingdom to have the third-largest military expenditures. Cutbacks in military personnel have not resulted in budgetary savings due to expenditures on pensions and housing for retiring officers. This has limited funds for increasing salaries and contract soldiers. Russia's military expenditures in 2010 totaled $33.9 billion, with 56% spent on personnel, 21% on operations, and 17% on arms procurement. President Medvedev planned to maintain defense spending at 2.8% of GDP from 2011-2020. Major expenses included electronics, communications equipment, and warships. The 2011-2020 State Program of Armaments plans to increase defense spending to 1.5 trillion rubles in 2011, reaching 2 trillion rubles annually by 2013. This would total 19.4 trillion rubles over the 10-year period, exceeding Medvedev's target of 2.8% of GDP. The program includes funds from arms exports and aims to enhance military capabilities by investing in new technology and addressing social issues for servicemen. Putin's draft budget guidelines for 2012-2014 propose further increasing defense spending to 1.85 trillion rubles. The draft budget guidelines for 2012-2014 propose boosting defense spending to 1.85 trillion rubles in 2012, 2.33 trillion rubles in 2013, and 2.75 trillion rubles in 2014. This increase will mainly go towards weapons expenditures, military personnel salaries, pensions, clothing kit, and food rations. Nondefense spending will be reduced, potentially affecting social programs. Russian Finance Minister Alexey Kudrin previously mentioned defense spending of $70 billion in 2012, with military pensions costing $28.5 billion, totaling $98.5 billion. The guidelines for defense spending contradict previous assertions about militarization of the state budget. Military reforms have faced challenges in weapons modernization, troop recruitment, and increasing professional soldiers, potentially leading to political instability and economic issues. The military reform effort launched in 2008 has created tensions among active and ex-military personnel, diverting budget resources from social programs. This has led to discontent, including high-profile resignations and protests. Major-General Vladimir Dvorkin has criticized the reforms for damaging military morale. In November 2010, veterans and ultranationalists in Moscow demanded Serdyukov's resignation. In February 2011, veterans protested against military reforms. Despite discontent, observers see no risk of a military coup. Analysts believe Putin-Medvedev era strengthened political control over the military. Government officials claim reforms do not drain resources from civilian spending. Russian analysts criticize increased defense spending, stating it could lead to a dangerous arms race and lacks public oversight. Some believe the civilian population is apathetic and subject to suppression, while others see a growing interest in political affairs that could lead to protests. Some observers warn of potential large-scale economic-related demonstrations due to military discontent with reforms. Putin announced significant salary and pension boosts for officers in 2012 to appease disgruntled former officers. Efforts to gain military support for upcoming elections were seen in the welcome given by the All-Russia People's Front to the Armed Forces' All-Russia Veterans Organization joining it. Political motives may have also played a role in these actions. The Armed Forces' All-Russia Veterans Organization and Russian Trade Unions called for a ban on arms imports, possibly to show support for Putin as the next president. There are speculations that Putin or Medvedev may remove Serdyukov and Makarov to address military discontent with reforms, which could complicate the reform process. The defense reforms may have mixed effects on the Russian economy. The defense reforms in Russia may strain the economy by diverting resources from other needs, potentially leading to budget deficits and inflation. Efforts to combat corruption and price inflation in defense industries are crucial for economic improvement, but progress has been mixed. Military Procurator Sergey Fridinskiy revealed collusion between Defense Ministry officials and a medical supply firm to inflate prices, allowing kickbacks. Corruption in the state defense order system has become the norm, with increased defense spending straining the budget. Minister of Finance Aleksey Kudrin criticized optimistic budget deficit projections in February 2011 and called for cutting military expenditures in May 2011. In May 2011, Kudrin proposed reducing military expenditures to lower the projected 2012 budget deficit. Cuts were suggested for increasing officers and soldiers, weapons procurement, and military housing. The Finance Ministry succeeded in reducing military budgets over the next two years, including cutting manpower levels. Analyst Klein believes defense budgets are insufficient to modernize a 1 million personnel armed forces. The State Armament Program faces challenges like mismatched armaments orders and technological backwardness. The defense sector in Russia faces challenges such as mismanagement, inefficiency, corruption, and technological backwardness hindering weapon development. President Medvedev has taken action against officials, but long-term solutions remain uncertain. In June 2011, the Defense Ministry cut off Kurganmashzavod from defense orders as a sanction. In June 2011, Defense Minister Serdyukov criticized inflated prices for weapons due to social infrastructure costs, leading to exclusion of some costs in weapon production contracts. He also condemned the high price requested by Sevmash shipyard for a nuclear submarine. Russian analyst Felganhauer criticized the reported price of $12.4 billion requested by Sevmash shipyard for a new Borei-class nuclear submarine, calling it \"astonishing\" and pointing out potential overpricing and misappropriation. Analyst Dmitry Gorenburg highlighted challenges in meeting arms renewal goals due to corruption and decay in the defense industry, making it difficult to reach procurement plan targets over the next decade. Additionally, efforts to purchase weapons abroad face resistance from the defense industry. Critics argue that Russia's state armaments program focuses too much on a large land army and not enough on a professional military for counter-terrorism missions. They claim the program is unnecessary and diverts funding from important reforms like increasing salaries and contract troops. The reduction in conscription service from two years to one year was due to concerns about hazing and soldier deaths in the North Caucasus. The reduction of conscription service from two years to one year led to the need for a substantial increase in the number of men conscripted annually. Efforts to expand voluntary service through contracts fell short of expectations due to a decline in the draft-eligible age cohort. Draft quotas have become harder to fill, leading to the admission of young men with criminal records and physical weaknesses. The Russian military faces challenges in recruiting due to a shrinking age cohort and difficulties in attracting enlistees with adequate salaries. There are concerns about the physical and mental fitness of recruits, as well as opposition from military leaders to a shift towards a contract-based armed forces. Efforts to increase the length of service for conscripts have been met with criticism and suspicion. The presidential administration opposed a Duma bill to increase conscript service length, instead calling for more contract troops to reach 425,000 by 2017. This would reduce the number of conscripts needed for a 1-million-man army to around 355,000, addressing demographic challenges. Colonel General Valeriy Smirnov stated that 280,000 conscripts would be released from service in spring 2011. In spring 2011, 280,000 conscripts were released from service, leaving a shortfall in the Spring military draft. Efforts were made to attract contractees to make up the numbers. Around one-third of men called up in Autumn 2010 were unfit for service, with half of those deemed fit not healthy enough for unrestricted service. The military was accused of inducting men with chronic conditions and from other Soviet successor states to meet quotas. Police raids were allegedly conducted at higher educational institutions to round up men with legitimate deferments. In mid-July 2011, the Defense Ministry announced that it had recruited 218,000 men for military service, but this may not be enough to meet the claimed 1-million-man armed forces. The Defense Ministry decided not to draft soldiers from the North Caucasus due to hazing issues. In Chechnya, all 7,000 conscripted men were allowed to serve under President Ramzan Kadyrov's personal forces, showing a high level of autonomy granted to him. The percentage of North Caucasian and other Muslims in the armed forces is already higher than their population percentage due to increased draft deferments. The percentage of Muslims in the armed forces is expected to increase as their population percentage rises. Military leaders are concerned about hazing by North Caucasians and the loyalty of these forces in future deployments. Despite reducing conscription to one year, hazing leading to death or serious injuries has unexpectedly increased. Fridinsky warned of declining discipline and the formation of ethnic gangs in military units. The rise in hazing is attributed to the doubling of draftees compared to contractees. The draft cohort has more petty criminals due to societal prejudices, leading to violence in the barracks. Suicides and noncombat deaths contribute to draft-dodging. The entry of professional sergeants and military police is hoped to improve discipline, but a significant training program is needed. The Defense Ministry plans to create a military police force to address these issues. In 2011, Serdyukov announced the deployment of a military police force to strengthen discipline and order in the troops. Main Military Procurator Fridinskiy supported this move but warned that it may not eliminate all crime due to societal influences on conscriptees. Critics raised concerns about the slow creation of the force and the potential for corruption and violence within the military. Military officers are reportedly demoralized by dealing with low-quality recruits with various issues like low intelligence, health problems, alcoholism, and criminal records. The reforms in the military under Serdyukov aimed to address issues with low-quality recruits, limited training due to short service terms, and popular prejudices against military service. Efforts included outsourcing nonmilitary duties, improving living conditions, and increasing the quality of rations. Observers noted that these reforms have been more extensive than previous efforts in reshaping the armed forces inherited from the Soviet Union. President Medvedev has proclaimed that Russian conventional armed forces are more capable than they were in the 1990s and have reaffirmed Russia's status as a \"great power.\" However, German analyst Klein argues that Russia falls short of \"great power\" status in terms of global power projection capabilities. The military reforms in Russia aim to improve combat readiness in local and regional conflicts, counter-terrorism, and insurrections in the North Caucasus. Resistance from some military theorists may hinder the modernization efforts, as they advocate for a mobilization army to address threats from China along the Far Eastern borders. Russian defense analyst Aleksandr Sharavin believes that Russia should maintain the draft for the next two decades due to its long borders with potential enemies. United Kingdom defense analyst Roger McDermott suggests that the creation of an active reserve shows some Russian decision-makers still think in terms of mobilization. Despite efforts to develop modern warfare capabilities, Jane's argues that Russian ground forces still rely on traditional tactics. Analysts Dale Herspring and Roger McDermott doubt that Serdyukov's reforms will create a modern fighting force by 2020 due to budget issues and production inefficiencies. Roger McDermott criticizes the Russian military reform process, stating that budget problems, production inefficiencies, and poor maintenance will hinder progress. He highlights issues such as rapid officer downsizing, faltering NCO introduction, and difficulties in fulfilling conscription needs. McDermott doubts that the reforms will result in a modern fighting force by 2020. Roger McDermott criticizes the Russian military reform process, highlighting budget problems, production inefficiencies, and poor maintenance. He argues that a hybrid army has formed, combining elements of the original reform plan with the old army's problems. The 34th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, a template for the brigade system, had to give up its fully professional force and now struggles to train conscripts. Some believe the reforms pose challenges to U.S. interests, but not a Soviet-style threat. According to German defense analyst Margarete Klein, Russia's military reforms do not involve significant reductions in size or increased defense budgets, hindering the creation of modern armed forces. Resistance from military and political elites prevents further downsizing, while competing priorities limit defense spending increases. Maintaining parity in nuclear capabilities with the US is a top priority, but the defense industry struggles to produce new weapons. Klein suggests that Russia's threat posture will be more symbolic than realistic, with a growing gap between military ambitions and reality. Russia's military reforms may boost regional power projection capabilities, leading to a potential revival of conventional arms control efforts with Europe. U.S.-Russian relations are expected to remain stable, with a focus on former Soviet Union members and internal secessionist movements. Russia's economic growth is constrained by global demand for oil and gas, requiring stable ties with importers. However, Russia's ability to compete with U.S. power is limited by an aging population and lack of warm water access for naval power projection. Jane's argues that Russia's naval power projection is limited due to lack of warm water access. Analysts suggest that Russian officials discussing NATO threats may actually be concerned about China's growing military and economic power. The Navy's 10-year procurement plans now focus on countering China, combating piracy, and addressing instability along Russia's southern flank. The emphasis is on building frigates, corvettes, and diesel submarines for the Pacific Fleet and Black Sea Fleet, rather than large surface combatants and nuclear attack submarines. U.S. analyst Janusz Bugajski believes Russia's strategic ambition is to be a significant regional power. U.S. analyst Janusz Bugajski argues that Russia's strategic ambition is to be a Eurasian regional or global superpower, equal in status to the United States and EU. Bugajski warns of Russia's military pressure as a serious threat to weaker neighbors and Western interests, urging a realistic appraisal of Moscow's imperial ambitions for developing defense policies. Felganhauer supports Bugajski's concerns about Russia's intentions, stating that Russian decision-makers view the US and NATO as main threats. Military reforms aim to counter these perceived threats, with the creation of Aerospace Defense Forces in 2011 driven by fears of a potential air-space attack. The 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict highlighted the need for improved conventional military capabilities to deter US and NATO interference. Felganhauer questions the logic of Russia's heavy spending on defense against perceived threats. Russian decision-makers are diverting resources to develop capabilities against perceived threats from the US and NATO, despite the 2011 US National Military Strategy indicating a lack of interest in confronting Russia. The State Armaments Program for 2011-2020 focuses on countering US net-centric warfare, with concerns that US-developed conventional means could be used against Russia. Russian decision-makers are focusing on building offensive and defensive capabilities to counter U.S. net-centric warfare. Calls for U.S.-Russia arms control talks to include conventional strike weapons and a revival of the Conventional Arms Control in Europe Treaty have been made. The Shygys military exercise between Russia and Kazakhstan in late June 2011 involved intercepting enemy cruise missiles. The Serdyukov reforms, initiated in late 2008, have raised concerns about their potential threat to U.S. interests. A bipartisan Congressional Strategic Posture Commission was formed in mid-2008 to address these issues. The Strategic Posture Commission, formed in response to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008, highlighted concerns about Russia's uncertain political relationships with the West and the reduced risk of U.S.-Russian military confrontation. Despite Russia no longer posing a large land army threat, the Commission warned of potential future changes and emphasized the need for effective deterrence measures. The United States needs to ensure effective deterrence and stability in its strategic military relationship with Russia. The sizing of U.S. forces is driven by Russia as some allies see it as a potential threat. Russia and the United States are strategic partners on some issues but competitors on others. The Obama Administration launched a \"reset\" of bilateral ties in 2009 to improve relations. The United States aims to build a strong relationship with Russia based on mutual interests, including nonproliferation, countering extremism, trade, and promoting rule of law. The 2011 National Military Strategy emphasizes countering extremism and supporting Russia's neighbors' sovereignty. The 2011 National Military Strategy stresses national military objectives such as countering violent extremism, deterring aggression, and strengthening international security. It mentions the need for increased dialogue and military relations with Russia, particularly in areas like strategic arms reduction, counter-terrorism, and space cooperation. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted both risks and opportunities in Russia's defense reforms. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted the risks and opportunities posed by Russia's defense reforms, driven by Moscow's perception of the US and NATO as strategic challenges. He noted Russia's increased military capabilities and potential for more aggressive reactions to crises, but also suggested the possibility of Russian participation in international peacekeeping operations, presenting an opportunity for US engagement. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized Russia's defense reforms driven by the perception of the US and NATO as strategic challenges. He downplayed Russia's conventional military threat to Europe, highlighting their nuclear forces as supporting deterrence and enhancing Moscow's geopolitical clout. Clapper mentioned Russia's formidable nuclear arsenal as a potential threat but clarified that he doesn't believe they have the intent to use it. The United States has a new START treaty with Russia, ranking them lower as a potential threat. There is no such treaty with China, but both countries have the capability to harm the US. In 2009, the US and Russia agreed to resume defense and military cooperation, focusing on counter-terrorism and missile defense. Bilateral military cooperation between the United States and Russia has been promoted through various activities such as counter-terrorism, peace-keeping, missile defense, and crisis response exercises. This includes events, exchanges, and consultations planned for 2011, as well as the signing of a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism cooperation in May 2011. Additionally, a Defense Relations Working Group was established to foster engagement between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense. The Defense Relations Working Group facilitates engagement between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Defense Department, with sub-groups covering various topics. Russia cooperates with the US on military equipment trans-shipment and security measures in Afghanistan. The possible implications of Russia's military reform efforts are being discussed by several congressional committees, including those focused on foreign affairs and armed services. Congress has held hearings on the annual threat assessment and formed a commission in 2008-2009 to examine the long-term strategic posture of the United States, which also discussed Russia's national security and defense policy. Other concerns addressed include Russia's military operations in Georgia, its military occupation of parts of Georgia and Moldova, and its suspension of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty. Congress is closely monitoring Russia's military reform efforts and their implications on the sovereignty and security of other countries. They will continue to assess Russian policy statements and the outcome of the reforms in the context of broader Russian domestic and foreign policy, as well as U.S. engagement with Russia on international issues of national security interest."
