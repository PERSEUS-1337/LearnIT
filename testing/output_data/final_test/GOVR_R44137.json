The Obama Administration aimed to close the detention facilities but not the naval station. Congress has imposed restrictions on detainee transfers and station closure. The station occupies 45 square miles leased from the Cuban government since the early 20th century. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, established in the early 20th century, serves as a protected harbor, coaling station, convoy staging area, and airfield. It operates under the military chain of command of the United States Navy, providing logistical support to detention and military commission facilities within its boundaries. Joint Task Force \u2013 Guantanamo, a combined military organization, oversees the detention facilities on the station. Joint Task Force \u2013 Guantanamo is a subordinate of U.S. Southern Command and was established in late 2002. The Office of Military Commissions, located in Washington, DC, oversees military commissions created under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Guantanamo Bay's military installation originated during the Spanish-American War. During the Spanish-American War of April-August 1898, the United States intervened in Cuba and Puerto Rico, as well as in Guam and the Philippines. After the war, the U.S. retained control of Spain's former territories in the Pacific and Puerto Rico, while Cuba eventually gained independence. The military campaign in Cuba began with the landing of U.S. Marines at Guantanamo Bay in early June 1898. During the Spanish-American War, the U.S. Marines landed at Guantanamo Bay, which served as a staging area for campaigns against Santiago de Cuba and Puerto Rico. Spain ceded control of Cuba to the U.S. in 1898, and the Platt Amendment allowed for the return of control to Cuba under certain conditions. The Platt Amendment allowed the United States to maintain independence of Cuba and protect its people by leasing lands for naval stations. Cuba became independent in 1902, and in 1903, a lease agreement was signed for coaling and naval stations under President Theodore Roosevelt. The agreement recognized Cuba's sovereignty while allowing the US to use the designated areas. During the period of occupation, the United States had complete jurisdiction and control over designated areas in Cuba under the Platt Amendment. In 1903, a treaty incorporating the amendment was signed, with the Senate's approval. President Roosevelt signed a lease agreement in October 1903, citing the Platt Amendment as his authority. In 1934, the 1903 Treaty was replaced during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration. The 1934 Treaty of Relations replaced the 1903 Treaty under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, repealing the controversial Platt Amendment language that led to U.S. military interventions in Cuba. The new treaty included a provision regarding the lease of Guantanamo, stating that the stipulations related to the naval station shall continue until both parties agree to modify or abrogate them. The naval station at Guantanamo, established under the 1934 Treaty of Relations, will continue to have its current territorial area and limits unless modified by both governments. Relations with the surrounding community remained stable until the Cuban revolution, when incidents like the capture of sailors by forces led by Ra\u00fal Castro began to occur. The naval station at Guantanamo, established under the 1934 Treaty of Relations, had incidents like the capture of sailors by forces led by Ra\u00fal Castro in 1958. As bilateral relations deteriorated after the Cuban revolution, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961. The naval station became self-sustaining in water and power in 1964. In the early 1990s, it housed Haitians and Cubans seeking asylum, with thousands being housed there by December 1991. In December 1991, over 6,000 migrants were housed at facilities on Navy ships and ashore at the naval station. The migrant population peaked at over 45,000 in the fall of 1994, leading to an evacuation of Department of Defense civilians and service family members. The population gradually decreased, with the last migrants leaving by January 1996. The naval base was repurposed after the September 11, 2001 attacks for detaining non-citizens suspected of terrorism. Construction of new detention centers at the naval station was announced in January 2002, shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Joint Task Force-160 began building facilities for up to 2,000 detainees, with the first 300 arriving from Kandahar, Afghanistan. Joint Task Force-Guantanamo was established in November 2002 to manage the new detention facilities. The detainee population peaked at 684 in June 2003, with 60 detainees remaining at the site as of October 2016. The 1934 Treaty of Relations between the United States and Cuba states that the naval station at Guantanamo Bay will continue to be leased to the United States until both parties agree to modify or end the agreement. The station will maintain its current territorial limits unless otherwise decided. The 1934 Treaty of Relations between the United States and Cuba stipulates that the Guantanamo Bay naval station lease can only be modified or terminated by agreement between the two countries. The territorial limits remain as they were in 1934 unless the lease is ended or boundaries are modified by mutual agreement. The question arises whether such modifications require a treaty ratified by the Senate or can be done through an executive agreement. Additionally, it is unclear if the President has the authority to abandon the naval station without Congressional action. The Constitution does not specify how international agreements like those between the US and Cuba can be amended or terminated. While the general practice is to modify agreements through the same means as the original agreement, there is flexibility in Congress or the Senate approving different methods based on the treaty's subject matter. The Guantanamo lease agreements blend elements of congressional-executive agreements and executive agreements under the 1903 Treaty with Cuba. The Platt Amendment, which required Cuba to lease lands for coaling and naval stations as agreed upon by the President of the United States, was repealed by the abrogation of the 1903 treaty. The 1934 Treaty of Relations permits abrogation or modification of lease agreements only with Cuba's consent, but does not clearly delegate U.S. authority to the President. It could be argued that executive agreements like these are amenable to alteration through another executive agreement. The 1934 Treaty of Relations allows for modification of lease agreements with Cuba's consent. Presidents have claimed authority to terminate treaties under the Take Care Clause. An executive agreement with Cuba to close the base may not require Senate approval. Congress may have the authority to modify or abrogate treaties, including the 1934 treaty regarding the Guantanamo lease. Legislation could be enacted to require Senate approval for any modifications to the lease agreement. The Committee of the 114th Congress reported favorably on the United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Protection Act (H.R. 4678), which would prohibit any actions to modify or replace the Guantanamo Lease Agreements without specific authorization. The House of Representatives passed language in Section 1099B of S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, regarding Guantanamo leases. Congress previously established policy for negotiations with a democratic Cuban government over the possible return of Guantanamo Bay. The House of Representatives passed language in Section 1099B of S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, regarding Guantanamo leases. It does not explicitly approve the entry into such an agreement as a congressional-executive agreement. The 1934 Treaty of Relations with Cuba states that the boundaries of the naval station at Guantanamo remain unless the \"United States of America\" abandons it, raising questions about presidential authority to order abandonment without an executive agreement or legislative permission. The 1934 Treaty of Relations with Cuba raises questions about the President's authority to abandon the naval station at Guantanamo without congressional approval. Overseas basing decisions are shared between the President and Congress, with Congress historically playing a role in base closure decisions. If no statute controls, authority may be determined through prior practice. The 1934 Treaty of Relations with Cuba raises questions about the President's authority to abandon the naval station at Guantanamo without congressional approval. While there are no statutory prohibitions against closing an overseas military installation, practical impediments exist due to restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The treaty recognizes Cuba's sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay, granting the U.S. control and jurisdiction during its occupation. The abandonment of Guantanamo Bay could have implications for the President's power to recognize foreign sovereigns and their territory. Congress's inaction on closing foreign bases may support the President's authority in this matter. The 2016 NDAA and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 prohibit expenditures related to returning Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, including closing or abandoning the station, relinquishing control to Cuba, or modifying the treaty. The 2016 Omnibus also prohibits the closure or transfer of the station. These provisions do not address treaty modifications for lease agreements. The 2016 NDAA and Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibit expenditures related to returning Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Cuba, including closing or abandoning the station, relinquishing control to Cuba, or modifying the treaty. Treaty modification for lease agreements is not addressed. If a treaty modification were negotiated and approved by the Senate, it could override certain restrictions. Funds available through FY2016 are restricted, but funds from other agencies or future years could potentially lead to the closure of the station. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017 is likely to extend prohibitions related to the closure of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The bill would continue the prohibition on using DOD funds to relinquish Guantanamo Bay to Cuba or implement a treaty modification. If the lease of Guantanamo Bay were to be terminated, the Department of Defense would face the challenge of repatriating or disposing of U.S. property at the naval station. The challenge of repatriating or disposing of U.S. property at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, including buildings, may be complicated by current sanctions against Cuba. Assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is prohibited to the present government of Cuba, and Cuba is not entitled to receive any benefits under U.S. law until compensation is provided to U.S. victims of expropriations. The President can suspend these prohibitions only upon certifying a transition government in Cuba. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibits assistance to the current government of Cuba until a democratically elected government is in power. Section 614 of the FAA allows for assistance to Cuba if deemed important to U.S. security interests, with consultation and justification required. This special authority also applies to the disposal of foreign excess property. The disposal of foreign excess property is governed by Chapter 7 of Title 40, U.S. Code, which authorizes various methods such as return to the U.S., sale, exchange, lease, donation, or destruction. This authority is separate from foreign assistance provisions and must be exercised accordingly. The President must ensure that transferring buildings and improvements on naval station grounds aligns with U.S. foreign policy. Title 10, U.S. Code may also provide authority for such transfers, especially for properties valued over $10 million. The Secretary of Defense is restricted from settling agreements with host countries for the release of improvements made by the United States. The President must ensure that transferring buildings and improvements on naval station grounds aligns with U.S. foreign policy. Title 10, U.S. Code may provide authority for such transfers, especially for properties valued over $10 million. The Secretary of Defense is restricted from settling agreements with host countries for the release of improvements made by the United States. The provision does not clearly authorize the entry into an executive agreement of settlement with host countries, but suggests that such authority exists elsewhere. The exercise of such authority in such a way as to benefit the government of Cuba would have to be deemed necessary to U.S. interests to avoid the prohibition against assistance to Cuba in Section 620(a) of the FAA. The Leasing of Guantanamo Bay is a book by Michael J. Strauss published in 2009."
