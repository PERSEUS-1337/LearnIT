The Senate acknowledges the vulnerability of individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits, emphasizing the need for outreach and education during healthcare system changes. The transition of 6.4 million dual eligibles to Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage is highlighted as the largest ever insurance program shift. MedPAC's 2004 report recommended that small private employers provide a minimum of 6. Private employers with 75,000 employees or less require at least 6 months to transition their employees' drug coverage between pharmacy benefit management companies. The transition of 6.4 million dual eligibles to Medicare Part D is crucial for timely access to prescription drugs, preventing health complications. Congress must ensure a smooth transition to avoid gaps in coverage for dual eligibles. SEC. 3. Continuing state coverage of Medicaid prescription drug coverage to Medicare dual eligible beneficiaries for 6 months. During the six-month transition period from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2006, states are required to continue providing Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs to dual eligible beneficiaries as if certain provisions of the Social Security Act had not been enacted. This does not affect the primary payer status of Medicare prescription drug plans for full-benefit dual eligible individuals. During the 6-month transition period, states must maintain Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs for dual eligible beneficiaries. States can seek reimbursement from prescription drug plans or other third parties for costs incurred in providing prescription drug coverage. SEC. 4. DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAID CLAWBACK PAYMENTS. States are not required to make payments to the Secretary of Health and Human Services before July 1, 2006, for Medicaid clawback payments. SEC. 5. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO DUAL ELIGIBLES REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. $100,000,000 from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will be used for education and outreach to dual eligible individuals regarding prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D. At least $20,000,000 will be awarded to States for grants. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will allocate $50,000,000 to develop a standardized protocol for collecting data on the impact of education and outreach efforts on dual eligible individuals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will allocate $50,000,000 to develop a standardized protocol for monitoring the impact of transitioning full benefit dual eligible individuals from Medicaid to Medicare Part D coverage. The protocol will include monitoring emergency room visits, hospitalizations, nursing home placements, and deaths among these individuals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will allocate funds to develop a protocol for monitoring the impact of transitioning dual eligible individuals from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. The protocol will require data collection by prescription drug plans and MA-PDs, including information on race and ethnicity. Reports on the implementation of the protocol must be submitted to Congress by specific dates. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is appropriated funds to award grants to States under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The availability of amounts appropriated under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is extended until September 30, 2006. SEC. 6. COLLECTION AND SHARING OF DUAL ELIGIBLE DRUG UTILIZATION DATA. The Social Security Act is amended to require PDP sponsors and MA organizations to submit drug utilization data of full-benefit dual eligible individuals to the Secretary for collection and sharing with States and the District of Columbia in real-time. The Social Security Act is amended to require PDP sponsors and MA organizations to submit drug utilization data of full-benefit dual eligible individuals to the Secretary for collection and sharing with States and the District of Columbia in real-time.

The Social Security Act is amended to require submission of drug utilization data for dual eligible individuals to the Secretary for sharing with States and the District of Columbia in real-time. Additionally, a GAO study on the clawback formula is mandated. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the clawback formula in the Social Security Act, focusing on disincentives for States to enroll dual eligible individuals in Medicaid or Medicare Part D, and the 6-month delay in States receiving rebate data. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on issues related to prescription drug cost containment measures implemented by States after 2003 and the impact on States paying more for prescription drug coverage for full benefit dual eligible individuals. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2006."
