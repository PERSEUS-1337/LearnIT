Congress finds the need for adequate infrastructure and policies under the Department of Homeland Security to protect against potential terrorists entering the US via the Southwest Border. Al Qaeda leaders believe operatives can enter through Mexico illegally, which is more advantageous for security reasons. Border patrol records show a significant increase in non-Mexican individuals, including those from countries of interest, crossing the border. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Removal lacks bed space to detain all illegal immigrants from special interest countries, leading to their release on personal recognizance. Up to 90 percent of these immigrants do not appear for their immigration hearings. The Department of Homeland Security needs more personnel, security clearances, and equipment at the borders to screen and detain immigrants effectively. The Secretary of Homeland Security should provide ongoing training for inspectors and support staff to utilize new technologies.

The Secretary of Homeland Security must increase detention beds to hold all immigrants caught by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Congress believes the Office of Detention and Removal Operation should be under the control of the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
