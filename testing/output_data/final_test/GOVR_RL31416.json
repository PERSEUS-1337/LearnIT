The Fed can target money supply growth or interest rates, but not both simultaneously. The Federal Reserve can target money supply growth or interest rates to influence aggregate spending for low inflation and sustainable economic growth. In recent years, the Fed has focused on interest rates instead of the money supply due to the unstable link between the two. However, some economists still prefer targeting money growth for stability. Money and economic activity are highly correlated, with contentious debates on their role in business cycles. The close relationship between the growth of M2 and real GDP over decades suggests a correlation with inflation rates. M2 grew at 7.0% annually while real GDP grew at 3.3%, resulting in a 3.7% difference, matching the inflation rate. This correlation does not imply causation. The relationship between changes in M2 and nominal GDP is debated among economists, with no clear consensus on causation. Money could play a role in monetary policy as an intermediate target variable, with a 3.5% growth rate of M2 suggested for stable prices. The United States transitioned to a flexible exchange rate system in the early 1970s, giving central banks more freedom to manipulate their national money supplies. However, they do not have direct control over the money supply, but rather control the reserves available. This shift allowed for more flexibility in monetary policy compared to the previous fixed exchange rate system. The Federal Reserve does not have direct control over the money supply but rather controls the reserves available to depository institutions. The amount of money created depends on public preferences for holding money assets and actions of depository institutions. The Fed's control over the money supply is indirect and relies on the relationship of various factors. The Federal Reserve indirectly controls the money supply through reserves, which is influenced by public preferences and actions of depository institutions. While the Fed has used the money supply as a target variable in the past, it has recently been reluctant due to instability in the velocity of money. The relationship between money growth and nominal GDP has weakened in recent years, leading to changes in reporting growth rate target ranges to Congress. The practice of manipulating measures of money started in the 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 1990s. Despite not being the objective of monetary policy, the growth rate of money supply, specifically M2, has shown a close relationship with nominal GDP growth and inflation. This information can provide valuable insights into the economy's performance, even if the Federal Reserve does not directly control the money supply. The relationship between money supply, nominal GDP growth, and inflation is a good predictor of future economic performance. However, the usefulness of money as an informational variable diminishes without a close relationship with aggregate spending. Velocity instability has reduced the effectiveness of money as a source of information about the economy's performance. The velocity of money, symbolized by V, is the turnover rate of existing money in an economy. It is calculated using the equation MV = PY, where M is the amount of money, P is a price index, and Y is a measure of real goods and services. To calculate V, PY needs to be measured, which represents total money spending in an economy over a period. The velocity of money, denoted as V, is the turnover rate of money in an economy. It is calculated using the equation MV = PY, where M is the amount of money, P is a price index, and Y is a measure of real goods and services. Different definitions of money exist, with one approach stating that money is any asset that fulfills the functions of a unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value, and standard of deferred payment. Another definition views money as a \"temporary abode of purchasing power.\" The functional definition of money emphasizes its roles as a unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value, and standard of deferred payments. Money is primarily assets used for transactions, such as paper currency. The M1 velocity of money, consisting of paper currency and deposits for transactions, has fluctuated over time. Between 1959 and 1981, it grew at a rate of 3.3% but declined from 1981 to 1994 before rising again. By 2007, it reached its highest value. Between 1997 and 2008, it grew at a rate of 2.0%, lower than the earlier period. The Federal Reserve indirectly controls M1 as an intermediate target variable by influencing reserves available to depository institutions. The stability and predictability of M1's velocity are crucial for its use as a target variable, with reserve growth being a major determinant of M1 growth. Control alone is not sufficient; the velocity of M1 must be explainable by a few variables to be predictable for monetary authorities. The stability and predictability of M1's velocity are crucial for its use as a target variable, with reserve growth being a major determinant of M1 growth. The behavior of M1 velocity shown on Figure 1 does not necessarily indicate instability, as factors determining how rapidly the public spends money must be considered. Economists have developed a model to explain how quickly the public spends money, based on factors like opportunity cost and transaction costs. As interest rates rise, individuals hold less money relative to transactions, and innovations that lower transaction costs also decrease money holdings. This model helps economists understand the dynamics of money velocity. The yield on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills from 1958-2008 shows an upward trend until 1981, followed by a decline. M1 velocity did not mirror these movements, indicating instability. M1 velocity showed a general decline from 1995 through 2008, but then began to rise, indicating instability in the fundamental relationship. The discussion about the instability of M1's velocity has focused on the concept of \"missing money\" rather than addressing instability directly. This suggests that something else was influencing M1 velocity that was previously unaccounted for. The growing conviction by influential Members of Congress in the 1970s led to a resolution requiring the Federal Reserve to report its objectives for money growth, later enacted into law in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. This was due to the higher than predicted velocity of M1, indicating missing money and instability in the fundamental relationship. In the 1970s, the Federal Reserve, led by Paul Volcker, implemented new procedures to control M1 growth in response to double-digit inflation. M1 was considered an intermediate target variable due to its stable velocity, but evidence of its instability emerged by 1982. The Federal Reserve de-emphasized M1 in its deliberations as the economic downturn neared its end in 1987. The instability in M1's velocity led to the Fed discontinuing setting a target range for M1 growth. M1 was briefly used as an intermediate target variable but its instability diminished its usefulness. The erratic behavior of M1 growth rate during a specific period and its impact on market interest rates will be reviewed. The Federal Reserve de-emphasized M1 in its deliberations as the economic downturn neared its end in 1987. The erratic behavior of M1 growth led to the Fed discontinuing setting a target range for M1. Money market participants voiced disapproval of Fed policy due to these developments. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act mandated the Fed to present semi-annual reports to Congress, including growth rate ranges for various measures of money and credit. The Fed decided to discontinue setting a monitoring range for M1 in the early 1980s, and in July 2000, a similar decision was made for the remaining aggregates. The instability in M1's velocity does not imply that monetary aggregates have no role in monetary policy, as there are other measures like M2 and M3. In the 1950s, economists like Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that variations in the money supply growth rate caused business cycles, emphasizing the importance of defining money beyond its literal medium-of-exchange function. In the 1950s, economists like Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that variations in the money supply growth rate caused business cycles. They emphasized the importance of defining money beyond its literal medium-of-exchange function. Friedman and Schwartz settled on M2 as a collection of assets that could predict consequences for economic variables like nominal GDP. M2 was stable and predictably related to nominal GDP, with a near constant velocity over the 1959-1988 period. In the 1980s and early 1990s, M2 replaced M1 as the primary variable in monetary policy decisions. However, M2's velocity started deviating from its historical patterns in the late 1980s, leading to challenges in predicting its behavior based on opportunity cost. In the late 1990s, M2's velocity unexpectedly rose to its highest levels despite expectations of a decline due to falling interest rates. This discrepancy, known as \"missing money,\" caused concern among the Board of Governors, leading to uncertainty about the usefulness of M2 and M3 as informational variables in monetary policy decisions. The Board of Governors discontinued setting growth rate ranges for M2 and M3 due to uncertainty about their relationship to spending. Instead, they now use a variety of financial and economic indicators in formulating monetary policy. The Board of Governors announced in 2005 that data on M3 would no longer be published starting in March 2006. The relationship between money (M2) and nominal GDP was found to have a significant degree of covariability. Economists debated the cause and effect relationship, with some suggesting that knowledge of money growth could be used for forecasting GDP and inflation. Time series analysis, including the Granger test, has been a focus in this area. The Granger test, named after Prof. Clive Granger, determines if additional variables can improve forecasting a focus variable. Prof. Christopher Sims used this methodology in 1972 to show that M1 Granger caused nominal gross national product. This enhanced prediction by using the history of M1 growth along with GNP data. In 1980, Sims conducted a study on the Granger causality role of M1 and the commercial paper rate in explaining industrial production. M1 was found to no longer play a significant role, while the commercial paper rate had a major impact. Subsequent studies in the 1980s and 1990s yielded inconclusive results on the Granger causal role of money. Several studies in the 1980s and 1990s have come to inconclusive results on the Granger causal role of money. Friedman and Kuttner's study found no causal role for various measures of money and credit in explaining GDP and inflation. Short-term interest rates and risk measures were found to be more influential. Estrella and Mishkin's later study confirmed these findings, rejecting even an informational role for the monetary base and M2. Several studies in the 1980s and 1990s have yielded inconclusive results on the Granger causal role of money. Friedman and Kuttner found no causal role for money and credit in explaining GDP and inflation. Estrella and Mishkin's study also rejected a causal role for the monetary base and M2. However, Feldstein and Stock concluded that the relationship between M2 and nominal GDP was strong and stable, warranting further investigation. Becketti and Morris found a Granger causal role for M2 in explaining movements in real GDP, particularly during the period when the Federal Reserve shifted to using monetary aggregates instead of interest rates. The study found that M2 failed to predict the 1989-1990 recession accurately but did forecast the weak recovery since 1991. Including bond mutual funds and stock mutual funds in M2 improved forecasts of nominal GDP growth from 1990-1994. However, the advantage over conventional M2 was not significant when federal funds rate and Treasury note yields were considered. The results highlighted the sensitivity of the outcomes to the variables, money measures, and time periods used in the analysis. The study found that M2 may have value in predicting future GDP trends, despite instabilities in M1 and M2 velocities. By 1973, a stable velocity for M1 was accepted, but errors in predictions began in 1974. Goldfeld's equation, based on interest rates and income, failed to accurately predict M1's velocity. In 1976, Goldfeld published a study on the \"missing money,\" leading to an outpouring of articles in journals. Judd and Scadding surveyed this research in 1982, highlighting the search for the cause of instability in money holdings. Financial market innovations in the 1960s and 1970s, driven by rising interest rates and banking regulations, were factors affecting the velocity of M1. The regulations in the 1960s and 1970s impacted the velocity of M1. Economists explored new measures for key variables to adapt to financial innovations. The regulations in the 1960s and 1970s impacted the velocity of M1, with a focus on business practices regarding demand deposit holdings. Banks were believed to assist businesses in managing their money holdings more efficiently, potentially reducing the need for precautionary money holdings. Improved cash management techniques were thought to reduce variability in income and expenditure flows. The GNP (or GDP) may not always accurately reflect total spending requiring money, as it includes non-monetary factors. Changes in financial markets can impact money demand without affecting income, leading to unstable velocity. This was observed in the 1970s when income and velocity were not moving in sync. During the 1970s, the growth in financial and asset transactions relative to income caused instability in M1's velocity. Efforts to find better measures of total spending were unsuccessful. Deregulation in the late 1970s and 1980s altered the range of assets considered substitutes for M1 and M2. In the 1970s, the introduction of interest-paying accounts like NOW and Super NOW accounts, along with repurchase agreements (REPOs), caused instability in M1's velocity due to a decline in demand deposit holdings of businesses. This shift in financial transactions led to the need for better measures of total spending. The introduction of interest-paying accounts and repurchase agreements caused instability in M1's velocity. REPOs were thought to have played a role in the decline in M1's velocity, but subsequent research cast doubt on this. The search for missing money reopened the debate on the definition of money, with M2's velocity showing stability and predictability. The velocity of M2 remained stable despite changes in financial structure and deregulation of banking from 1960-1980. M2 became the primary variable for monetary policy, while research continued on the instability of M1's velocity. In 1992, Duca found that business demand deposit weakness was linked to interest rates and compensating balances. Duca's research in 1992 highlighted the impact of rising interest rates on compensating balances held by businesses, leading to a shift towards direct borrowing in the commercial paper market. This change resulted in a significant decrease in business demand deposits, contributing to the \"missing money\" phenomenon. Additionally, the increasing use of the U.S. dollar as an international currency posed another challenge. The increasing popularity of the U.S. dollar as an international currency led to a rise in dollars held by foreigners for various purposes. Estimates showed that the amount of dollars in circulation overstated the actual amount used for spending in the United States. This phenomenon raised concerns about the accuracy of recorded data on M1 and its use as an intermediate variable for monetary policy. Research identified several factors responsible for the instability of M1's velocity in the early 1970s and beyond. Structural changes in the financial environment, shifts in substitute assets for money, the use of American currency abroad, and one-time events all contributed to measurement problems for M1 and other related aggregates. The velocity of M2 remained stable during the 1980s but started to rise in 1990, contrary to predictions. This change was attributed to factors such as the missing money and the economic expansion that began in March 1991. The velocity of M2 became a key variable for the Board of Governors, referenced in monetary policy reports. The economic expansion that started in March 1991 was sustained without help from M2, as the missing money was tied to components like currency circulating abroad, money market mutual fund balances, and time CDs. Efforts to find the missing money were inconclusive, reducing some instability in M2's velocity but not enough to consider it an intermediate target variable. Some economists suggested that the missing M2 could be accounted for by the rapid growth of bond and equity mutual funds, which were seen as substitutes for traditional savings accounts. Studies using an augmented M2 found more stability in its velocity, with Duca reporting he could explain over 40% of the missing M2. However, the problem with this approach was that bond and equity funds were subject to capital gains and losses, affecting their value. The introduction of bond and equity mutual funds reduced transactions costs, leading to a rise in velocity. This, along with interest rates and deregulation, contributed to the missing M2. The deregulation of interest rates led to changes in the velocity estimating equation, with economists advocating for including yields on short and long term assets. The spread between long and short term interest rates was seen as a factor in diverting funds from depository institutions to bond and stock funds. The missing M2 money was attributed to bond funds offering higher rates than depository institutions due to the spread between long and short term interest rates. Feinman and Porter's study added a spread variable and found that more than two-thirds of the missing M2. Another explanation was the thrift and banking crisis of the mid-1980s and weakness in the sector in the early 1990s, which affected M2 velocity. Adjusting for this event involved the activities of the Resolution Trust Corporation, making CD yields more uncertain. The Resolution Trust Corporation's activities increased uncertainty in CD yields, affecting M2 velocity. This one-time effect was not expected to have a lasting impact on M2's velocity, which is primarily determined by factors like opportunity cost and income. Duca was able to explain 83% of the missing money by incorporating this uncertainty into the standard estimating equation for velocity. Orphanides and Porter's approach involved purging conventional M2 of certain components to calculate velocity, which was then related to various economic factors such as bank capitalization and stock market volatility. Their modified M2 accounted for a significant portion of the missing money. The velocity of M2 is stable and considered a good informational variable. Lown, Peristiani, and Robinson constructed a new M2 series to address banking and thrift crisis issues. They found that their modified M2 contained useful information about economic growth. Structural changes in the intermediation process during 1990-94 reduced the role of commercial banks, leading to a rise in M2's velocity. The role of banks as intermediaries diminished due to the removal of federal subsidies, such as deposit insurance. Changes in deposit insurance premiums and capital standards have made it more costly for banks to lend, leading borrowers to seek funds from other sources. This has resulted in a decline in the banking sector's share of lending. The decline in the banking sector's share of lending was matched by the run off of CDs. Research was done to find the missing M2 when its velocity became unstable in the early 1990s, involving redefining M2 and accounting for changes in the institutional setting. This research did not prevent the Board of Governors from discontinuing setting growth rate ranges for monetary aggregates. Professor William Poole, a retired president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, attempted to construct new monetary aggregates based on Friedman and Schwartz's definition of money as a \"temporary abode of purchasing power.\" Poole focused on assets that can be accessed without notice and at par, labeling them as assets of zero maturity. This approach aimed to address the missing money in M2, with the exception of CDs, which had a fixed term to maturity. Poole proposed creating a new monetary aggregate called MZM (Money with Zero Maturity) to include assets with zero maturity characteristics. Carlson and Keen studied the stability of MZM in the early 1990s, finding that its velocity was closely tied to changes in interest rates. The velocity of MZM varied significantly from 1975 to 1995, indicating that forecasting its movements alone would not provide consistent predictions. The growth rate of MZM in the early 1990s did not consistently forecast economic activity due to fluctuations in interest rates. Despite high growth rates in 1991-1992 and a decline in 1993-1994, economic activity did not follow suit. MZM's growth accelerated from 1995-1999, indicating a period of change. The pace of MZM growth accelerated noticeably from early 1995 to early 1999, during a period of high real GDP growth. Divisia indexes were developed as an alternative approach to defining money, weighting the components of monetary aggregates based on their \"moniness\" to create Divisia M1, M2, and M3. The Divisia aggregates, including M1, M2, and M3, were created to compute related velocities but were found to be unstable. Despite this, they outperformed non-Divisia counterparts in forecasting real GDP and prices. New monetary aggregates like MZM, Divisia money, and M2+ were suggested, raising questions about their roles in monetary policy. The Federal Reserve considered using MZM as an intermediate target variable, but the stability and predictability of all three aggregates were questionable. While M2+ seemed more suitable as an informational variable, controlling it would have been more challenging for the Fed compared to MZM. The report discusses the relationship between the money supply and economic activity, focusing on how it affects monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of a stable relationship between the money supply and money spending for effective policy execution. The question of whether the Federal Reserve can control the money supply over a short period is raised. The Federal Reserve does not directly control the various measures of money but rather the reserves available to depository institutions, which can then create money and expand credit. Individuals and other groups also play a role in determining how much money is created. Individuals and banks play a crucial role in determining the composition of money, such as M1, M2, M2+, and MZM. Banks can influence their liabilities based on the types of deposits they hold, resulting in varying amounts of money created from a given dollar of reserves. Reserves held by banks for different liabilities are not uniform, with a 10% requirement for demand deposits. Other types of liabilities have lower reserve requirements. The Federal Reserve's ability to control money supply depends on the relationship between bank reserves and money. Tight control is necessary for using money supply as an intermediate target, but some proposed measures of money may not allow for tight control. Unpredictable swings in bank reserves could be required for the Fed to control the money supply, posing challenges for the banking sector. The Federal Reserve's ability to control money supply depends on the relationship between bank reserves and money. Tight control is necessary for using money supply as an intermediate target, but some proposed measures of money may not allow for tight control, posing challenges for the banking sector. Friedman and Schwartz suggested a rule-based policy where M2 should grow at a fixed rate to maintain a constant price level, based on historical evidence. Friedman and Schwartz proposed a rule where M2 should grow at a fixed rate to maintain price stability, assuming that cyclical instability is mainly caused by erratic money supply growth. However, an alternative view suggests that instability may be due to factors like business expectations, leading to arguments for discretionary monetary policy for stabilization. Discretionary monetary policy is crucial for stabilization, as the Federal Reserve adjusts the money supply growth to counter changes in private sector spending. Timely decisions and predictability in the lag between decisions and spending changes are essential for effective discretion. The Federal Reserve must be able to recognize and act upon changes in private sector spending promptly to address cyclical instability. The economy's spending response must be predictable for effective discretionary monetary policy. Some proponents suggest rule-based regimes based on interest rates instead of money growth due to the instability of money velocity. The ability of the Fed to control money supply in a timely manner may not support a rule-based policy. Interest rates could potentially serve as effective intermediate targets for discretionary policy. Interest rates can play a crucial role in monetary policy by influencing spending. Changes in interest rates can impact household and business spending on interest-sensitive goods. Rising interest rates signal monetary tightness, while falling rates indicate monetary easing. The Fed has used interest rates to control total spending and provide information about future economic activity. The Federal Reserve has used interest rates as intermediate targets to control total spending and communicate monetary policy. Economic theory suggests real interest rates are key in linking money supply changes to economic activity, but the rates used by the Fed differ from those suggested. The real interest rates are not a reliable indicator of monetary policy as they can be influenced by factors like federal budget deficits and economic activity. The high real interest rates in the 1980s were due to large budget deficits, not tight money policy. Additionally, economic upswings and downturns can also impact real interest rates. Real interest rates can be influenced by factors like federal budget deficits, economic activity, and international developments. Market or nominal interest rates may not accurately reflect the stance of monetary policy due to their connection with real rates and inflation expectations. Easy monetary policy can paradoxically lead to high market interest rates if it raises inflation fears, while tight monetary policy can result in low market interest rates. The informational content from market or real interest rates regarding monetary policy may be limited. Monetary policy is a powerful tool for influencing economic activity, employment, and inflation rates. It is more potent than fiscal policy in the current international monetary system. Oversight responsibilities for monetary policy require objective and clear indicators. Monetary aggregates provide little information about monetary policy. The oversight of monetary policy relies heavily on the central banker for information and judgments, as monetary aggregates and interest rates may not provide clear indicators. This lack of clarity can lead to decisions based on current economic conditions, with effects felt years later. Monetary policy success over the past 25 years may be attributed to the abilities of the central banker or simply good luck. The Federal Reserve navigated through rapid changes in the financial system, with only two minor downturns between the early 1990s and 2007. The financial system underwent changes due to rising interest rates and regulations that hindered banks' competitiveness. To survive, banks innovated ways to pay interest to depositors, leading to the creation of new financial instruments. Governments eventually realized that interest rate regulations were counterproductive, leading to deregulation. These changes impacted the velocity of various money measures. The financial system underwent changes due to rising interest rates and regulations that hindered banks' competitiveness, leading to the creation of new financial instruments. Governments eventually realized that interest rate regulations were counterproductive, leading to deregulation. These changes impacted the velocity of various money measures, prompting ongoing research efforts to adjust to the effects and develop new monetary aggregates and measures. Technical issues related to econometric estimations of velocity equations have also been addressed in this research. Interest rates can provide valuable information for forecasting economic performance variables like nominal GDP. However, their movements are influenced by factors beyond the Federal Reserve, requiring careful interpretation. M1 includes currency held by the public, traveler's checks, demand deposit balances, and other checkable deposits. M2 includes M1, time and savings deposits under $100,000, individual holdings in money market mutual funds, and money market deposit accounts. M3 includes M2, time deposits over $100,000, term repurchase agreements, institution-only money market mutual funds, and term Eurodollars held by U.S. residents in Canada. The curr_chunk discusses various financial instruments such as money market mutual funds, term Eurodollars, repos, and nonfinancial debt held by different sectors. It also references sources like a symposium on mutual funds and monetary aggregates and historical perspectives on monetary policy. The curr_chunk discusses studies on velocity and money demand functions, stability of money demand, alternative measures of money, redefining M2 to include mutual funds, and a critical review of the recent debate on M2 and monetary policy. The curr_chunk provides references to various studies on monetary policy, including the relationship between money growth and inflation, the usefulness of money in conducting monetary policy, and the forecasting of inflation using monetary aggregates. The curr_chunk provides references to studies on monetary policy, including the relationship between money growth and inflation, the usefulness of money in conducting monetary policy, and forecasting inflation using monetary aggregates.
