    "content": "The 111th Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The House later considered repealing PPACA with H.R. 2. The 112th Congress may review legislation to amend PPACA, including alien eligibility for key provisions. This report analyzes alien eligibility for certain provisions in PPACA based on immigration status and discusses the potential effects on health insurance coverage. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) estimated that as of March 2010, there were approximately 37.6 million foreign-born persons in the United States, making up about 12% of the population. This included 16 million naturalized U.S. citizens and 21.6 million noncitizens. Researchers at the Pew Hispanic Center also provided estimates using similar data. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated in March 2010 that there were around 40.2 million foreign-born individuals in the US, with 37% being naturalized citizens, 31% legal permanent residents, 4% nonimmigrants, and 28% estimated to be unauthorized aliens. They also discussed alien eligibility for provisions under PPACA. The PPACA established a temporary high-risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage for eligible individuals until the exchanges became operational on January 1, 2014. Eligibility is based on lawful presence in the United States, with unauthorized aliens being ineligible. The program started offering coverage on August 1, 2010. The PPACA established a temporary high-risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage for eligible individuals until the exchanges became operational on January 1, 2014. Eligibility is based on lawful presence in the United States, with unauthorized aliens being ineligible. The program started offering coverage on August 1, 2010. Participation in the high-risk pool program requires creditable coverage in the six-month period prior to application and having a pre-existing condition. The PPACA includes an individual mandate starting in 2014 to maintain health insurance, with tax penalties for noncompliance. Unauthorized aliens are exempt from this mandate. The PPACA established a temporary high-risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage for eligible individuals until the exchanges became operational on January 1, 2014. Unauthorized aliens are exempt from the individual mandate to maintain health insurance starting in 2014. The act specifies that only U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawfully present aliens are considered eligible. It is unknown what the shortest enrollment period will be for nonimmigrants, and no penalty is imposed for those without coverage for less than three months. The penalties for noncompliance with the individual mandate are tax-based, and there are rules for taxation of noncitizens working in the United States. Foreign nationals are subject to U.S. tax laws and classified as resident or nonresident aliens for federal tax purposes. These terms are in the Internal Revenue Code but not in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act does not use the terms resident and nonresident alien. An individual is considered a nonresident alien unless they meet the qualifications for residency tests, such as the Green card test or Substantial presence test. Resident aliens are taxed the same as U.S. citizens, while nonresident aliens are subject to different tax treatment. Nonresident aliens are generally taxed only on income from U.S. sources, but income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business is taxed by the same rules as U.S. citizens. Various situations may classify an individual as a nonresident alien, even if they pass the substantial presence test. For instance, having a closer connection to a foreign country, maintaining a tax home there, and being in the U.S. for fewer than 183 days can lead to nonresident alien status. Additionally, individuals in the U.S. under certain visas may also be treated as nonresident aliens if they comply with visa requirements. Under PPACA, \"American Health Benefit Exchanges\" will start operating by 2014, providing eligible individuals and small businesses access to insurers' plans. Certain individuals may qualify for a tax credit based on income. Nonresident aliens can include employees of foreign governments, regular commuters from Canada or Mexico, individuals unable to leave the U.S. due to a medical condition, foreign vessel crew members, and athletes in charitable sporting events. Income tax treaties between countries and the U.S. may also impact residency status. Under PPACA, eligible individuals may qualify for tax credits and subsidies towards premium costs and cost-sharing through exchanges starting in 2014. Lawfully present noncitizens can purchase insurance through exchanges, while unauthorized aliens are barred from doing so. Specific rules apply for calculating credits and subsidies for mixed-status families. Under PPACA, eligible individuals may qualify for tax credits and subsidies towards premium costs and cost-sharing through exchanges starting in 2014. Concerns have been raised about inequality between U.S. citizens and some noncitizens with incomes at or below 133% of the federal poverty level regarding eligibility for Medicaid and exchange participation. Noncitizens' eligibility for Medicaid depends on their immigration status and arrival date in the U.S. before August 22, 1996. Noncitizens' eligibility for Medicaid in the United States depends on their immigration status, arrival date before August 22, 1996, and duration of residency and work history. Legal permanent residents arriving after August 22, 1996, face a five-year Medicaid ban, with exceptions for pregnant women and children. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid for seven years post-arrival, with potential extension at the state's discretion. LPRs with a 10-year U.S. work history may also qualify for Medicaid. Beginning in 2014, PPACA requires states to expand Medicaid to individuals under age 65 with income up to 133% of the FPL, making all non-elderly U.S. citizens and certain noncitizens eligible for Medicaid. This reform not only expands eligibility to low-income childless adults but also raises Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups. PPACA expands Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the FPL, the most significant expansion in years. However, immigration status restrictions on Medicaid remain unchanged. Starting in 2014, eligible individuals receive tax credits for purchasing exchange plans, with income limits set at 100% to 400% of the FPL. Lawfully present noncitizens with incomes below 100% of the FPL can also qualify for premium credits. Under PPACA, lawfully present noncitizens who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their alien status can participate in an exchange and receive premium credits. If a person eligible for Medicaid applies for premium credits, they will be enrolled in Medicaid instead. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to establish a program to verify the citizenship status of individuals applying for exchange plans or claiming premium tax credits. The verification system under PPACA requires individuals claiming premium tax credits or reduced cost-sharing to be citizens or lawfully present in the US. It will use personal data to verify citizenship and immigration status, similar to the DHS SAVE system. The SSA will verify name, social security number, and date of birth for U.S. citizens, while non-citizens must attest to being lawfully present. The verification system under PPACA requires individuals to claim premium tax credits or reduced cost-sharing to be citizens or lawfully present in the US. It will use personal data to verify citizenship and immigration status, without a biometric identifier to prevent identity theft. The system only verifies name, SSN, and date of birth with SSA records and immigration documents with DHS records, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to access subsidies. The verification system under PPACA for accessing subsidies may make it difficult for some eligible U.S. citizens to gain access due to lack of biometric identifiers. In a recent evaluation of the E-Verify system, researchers estimate that about 3.3% of queries receive a false positive verification, primarily due to identity theft. DHS is enhancing E-Verify to detect identity fraud better. Unauthorized aliens are exempt from health coverage mandate and federal subsidies. Unauthorized aliens cannot participate in high-risk pools. PPACA verification system may hinder eligible citizens due to lack of biometric identifiers. The study uses CPS data to analyze health insurance coverage of U.S. citizens and noncitizens, focusing on the impact of PPACA changes to Medicaid eligibility. Data from March 2010 CPS supplement, a household survey sample, weighted to reflect the population. Three groups compared: native-born U.S. citizens, naturalized U.S. citizens, and noncitizens. Unauthorized aliens face challenges in accessing health coverage. The CPS data used in the study analyzes health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens and noncitizens, including unauthorized aliens. It is challenging to differentiate between legal and illegal aliens or different categories of noncitizens. The CPS survey asks about various types of coverage during the previous year, allowing respondents to have multiple types of health insurance. Research suggests that CPS estimates reflect the number of uninsured individuals at a specific point in time, rather than those uninsured for the entire previous year. The CPS data used in the study analyzes health insurance coverage for U.S. citizens and noncitizens, including unauthorized aliens. Research suggests that CPS estimates reflect the number of uninsured individuals at a specific point in time. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured compared to native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens, with noncitizens having the lowest rate of private insurance coverage. Noncitizens have lower rates of Medicare coverage due to their younger age and eligibility requirements. Naturalized citizens have the highest Medicare coverage rate, likely because they are older. Noncitizens are slightly less likely to have Medicaid coverage compared to native-born citizens. Noncitizens also have lower rates of military/veterans coverage compared to naturalized and native-born populations. Overall, noncitizens tend to be poorer. Noncitizens tend to be poorer than native-born and naturalized citizens, with 35% having family incomes below 133% of poverty. Noncitizens are less likely to have private health insurance at all income levels, with only 12.9% having insurance at the lowest income level. The disparity in insurance coverage between noncitizens and citizens is smallest for those with family incomes above 400% of poverty. Noncitizens are less likely to have private insurance compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. While noncitizens have slightly lower Medicaid coverage overall, they are much less likely to be covered by Medicaid at or below 133% of poverty. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured across all income levels compared to U.S. citizens. Noncitizens are more likely to be uninsured than U.S. citizens across all income levels. Changes in Medicaid eligibility under PPACA may increase coverage for U.S. citizens, but noncitizens may not see the same level of increase due to alien eligibility requirements. Lawfully present noncitizens ineligible for Medicaid may be able to purchase insurance through an exchange, potentially reducing the uninsured rate for this population. An exchange could help lower the uninsured rate for noncitizen populations with incomes at or below 133% of poverty."
