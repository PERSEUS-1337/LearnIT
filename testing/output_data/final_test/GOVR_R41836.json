    "content": "A number of states and local governments are taking actions to address greenhouse gas emissions, including implementing regulations and cap-and-trade programs. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program for GHG emissions involving nine states. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a sector-specific cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions from electric power plants in nine states. It can provide insights into implementing a federal cap-and-trade program and potential design pitfalls. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was established in 2005 with discussions dating back to 2003. It is a cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions from electric power plants in nine states. The program's initial goal was to serve as a foundation for emissions trading and potentially expand to cover other sectors and states. Covered entities in RGGI states contribute to 20% of all GHG emissions in the region, with the majority coming from fossil fuel combustion in various sectors. The RGGI states conducted a design review of the program between 2010 and 2012, resulting in significant changes to emissions cap and other design elements. These changes took effect in 2014, with a second design review initiated in 2015. The cap-and-trade program includes three-year compliance periods and allows banking of emission allowances for future use. The RGGI states implemented changes to the emissions cap and design elements in 2014, allowing banking of emission allowances for future flexibility. Emission allowance auctions include a reserve price, and at least 25% of the allowance value is distributed for consumer benefit or strategic energy purposes. Cost containment measures were established in 2014 to provide additional allowances if certain price thresholds are reached. The RGGI program includes a reserve price for emission allowance auctions and allows for the use of offsets. The initial emission cap exceeded actual emissions, leading to a revision in 2014 where the cap was lowered by 45%. This change aimed to encourage internal emission reductions or the purchase of emission credits. The initial emissions cap set by RGGI aimed to stabilize CO2 emissions at 2009 levels and gradually decrease them by 10% by 2019. Actual emissions fell below projections, attributed partly to long-term structural changes. The decline in CO2 emissions in RGGI states was primarily influenced by long-term structural changes, such as shifts in the electricity generation portfolio and energy efficiency improvements. Despite a decrease in electricity retail sales, CO2 emissions from in-state electricity generation significantly dropped, indicating factors beyond economic conditions were at play. From 2012 to 2016, CO2 emissions continued to decrease even as electricity sales remained stable. This trend is supported by changes in RGGI's electricity generation portfolio, showing a significant reduction in carbon-intensive electricity over the years. The figure shows a significant decrease in carbon-intensive electricity generation in RGGI states from 2005 to 2016. Coal and petroleum sources, with high carbon intensity, decreased from 33% to 7% of electricity generation, while natural gas, nuclear, and renewables increased their contributions. Natural gas generation rose from 25% to 43% during this period. Electricity generation from natural gas increased from 25% to 43% in RGGI states from 2005 to 2016. The RGGI program had impacts despite the original emission cap not directly requiring reductions. The cap attached a price to CO2 emissions, with the allowance price being relatively low due to abundant emission allowances. Studies found that the allowance price and the RGGI program as a whole were significant factors in emissions decrease. The emission allowances also acted as a new form of currency. The emission allowances in the RGGI program acted as a new form of currency, supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. Studies show that distributing allowance value through strategies like auctions creates wider benefits, including emission reduction, consumer savings, and job creation. Efforts to utilize allowance value play a crucial role in the program's effectiveness, as seen in a 2017 study on public health impacts. The RGGI program's air quality improvements from 2009-2014 led to $5.7 billion in health benefits. In 2013, the emissions cap was reduced from 165 mtCO2 to 91 mtCO2 based on accurate 2012 emission projections. The cap will decrease by 2.5% annually until 2020, with no cap established beyond that. Adjustments were made to account for banked emission allowances. The RGGI program adjusted the emission cap between 2014 and 2020 to accommodate banked emission allowances, with some years seeing a significant decrease of over 20 mtCO2, equivalent to a 28% reduction. The revised cap is expected to have a different impact on RGGI states compared to the original cap, leading to higher emission allowance prices initially but declining in recent years. The RGGI program adjusted emission cap between 2014 and 2020 to accommodate banked allowances, leading to higher prices initially but declining recently. RGGI states distribute allowances mainly through auctions, raising questions on how to utilize the allowance value, primarily auction revenues. The RGGI states have offered 91% of their emission allowances at auction between 2008 and 2016, with some allowances not sold and others sold at fixed prices or distributed for various objectives. RGGI's auctions are of interest to Congress as part of proposed cap-and-trade systems. RGGI auctions are conducted in one round with a sealed-bid, uniform-price format. Participants submit confidential bids for allowances at specific prices. The clearing price is the highest rejected bid. Auctions also include a reserve price set by the seller. The RGGI program has conducted 35 auctions with a reserve price starting at $1.86 in 2008 and increasing to $2.15 in 2017. The auctions have been successful in terms of price discovery, transparency, and revenue generation, totaling over $2.7 billion after 35 auctions. A reserve price helps guarantee a revenue stream and address logistical concerns like bidder collusion. After 35 auctions, cumulative proceeds exceed $2.7 billion, with clearing prices meeting reserve prices until 2012. Around 40% of allowances went unsold during this period, prompting RGGI states to retire them. In 2013, auction results shifted due to proposed emissions cap reductions, leading to clearing prices surpassing reserve prices. The auction clearing prices for RGGI allowances have fluctuated significantly, reaching a peak of $7.50 in December 2015 before dropping to $3.00 in March 2017. Despite the price decrease, all allowances offered at auction have been sold. The Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) was added in 2014 and has been triggered twice. Policymakers face trade-offs when deciding how to distribute the emission allowance value. The RGGI states have exceeded the 25% commitment for emission allowance value allocation for consumer benefits or strategic energy purposes. Auction revenues have accounted for approximately 91% of the emission allowance value, with allocations including 42% for energy efficiency, 11% for electricity bill assistance, 9% for GHG abatement, and other categories. 17% of auction revenue remained to be invested at the time of data collection. The distribution of emission allowance value in RGGI states has shown flexibility, with some states reallocating funds to address budget deficits. This raises questions for federal policymakers on the level of flexibility needed in emission allowance distribution strategies. Environmental groups criticized these actions, but state policymakers defended them as necessary. This highlights a design issue for cap-and-trade systems. Designers of the RGGI program are concerned about \"emissions leakage,\" which can occur when emissions reduction programs do not cover all sources contributing to the environmental issue. The RGGI regime does not regulate emissions from electricity generated outside the region but used within it, potentially leading to leakage if imported electricity replaces in-state electricity generation. Leakage levels depend on the sources of electricity involved in the tradeoff. The RGGI program monitors electricity generation and CO2 emissions from both RGGI and non-RGGI sources. A recent report showed an increase in electricity generation from non-RGGI sources, mainly due to imported electricity, but CO2 emissions from these sources decreased by 0.5%. This decrease is attributed to RGGI states increasing electricity generation from hydropower and renewable sources, as well as importing more hydropower from Quebec. After its 2012 program review, RGGI participants committed to collaborating on identifying tools to track imports, modeling energy and price implications, and addressing emissions from imported electricity. Emissions leakage and offsets are key topics for discussion, especially with the revised emissions cap in 2014. RGGI's emission reduction program limits offsets to 3.3% of a source's allowance submission. Offset projects are restricted to five types located in RGGI states, such as landfill methane reduction and sulfur hexafluoride. Offset projects must meet specific requirements and be certified by a third party. Offset projects in the RGGI program are limited to five types within RGGI states, including landfill methane reduction and sulfur hexafluoride reductions. Concerns exist about the credibility of some offset projects, as they should equate to emissions reduced from RGGI power plants. Despite no offset projects being developed under the RGGI program, changes were made to cost containment provisions in 2012. The RGGI states altered cost containment provisions in the program by introducing a cost containment reserve (CCR) in 2014. The CCR provides additional allowances if specific price thresholds are met during quarterly auctions. The CCR was triggered in 2014 and 2015, allowing for the sale of additional allowances. The RGGI states introduced a cost containment reserve (CCR) in 2014, providing additional allowances if price thresholds are met during auctions. Unlike other programs, allowances from CCR are not borrowed from future years, effectively increasing the cap if triggered. An issue for policymakers is how RGGI's emission program would interact with the Clean Power Plan. The rule establishes CO2 emission guidelines for states to address emissions from existing power plants, but its enforceability is currently stayed due to litigation. President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 in March 2017, directing federal agencies to review regulations that could hinder domestic energy development. The order instructed the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan and related rules for potential suspension, revision, or rescission. The status of the Clean Power Plan is uncertain, with significant decisions possible from both the executive and judicial branches. If implemented, the plan would give states flexibility in meeting CO2 emission targets through new or existing programs, and through individual or collaborative efforts with other states. The RGGI program may need to collaborate with other states to meet EPA's Clean Power Plan targets. The program's emission cap ends in 2020, while the Clean Power Plan starts in 2022 and runs through 2030. The new CCR could provide up to 10 million additional allowances annually, complicating analysis. A design review process began in 2015 to gather stakeholder input on program design elements for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. The nature of the RGGI program changed significantly in 2014, making comparisons with earlier years challenging. The RGGI states altered their emissions cap in 2014, impacting electricity use and prices in the region. The program contributes to a small reduction in global GHG emissions but businesses prefer a national policy. The RGGI program, along with California's initiatives, could influence federal policymakers. The combined CO2 emissions from RGGI and California would rank above seventh globally. RGGI's activities serve as examples for crafting wider applications and have trained personnel in emissions trading issues, potentially useful for a federal system."
