    "content": "Mexico is a major producer and supplier of heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana to the U.S. market. It is also a major transit country for cocaine sold in the United States, with up to 90% of cocaine entering the U.S. transiting through Mexico. Mexican drug trafficking organizations control significant drug distribution operations along the Southwest border and extend their criminal activities into cities across the United States. These organizations exhibit characteristics of organized crime and operate in distinct cells, controlling subordinate cells throughout the country. In 2009, Mexican drug trafficking organizations became the primary threat to the United States. They took over cocaine trafficking from Colombian cartels through the Southwest border, dominating the illicit market and becoming increasingly violent. The National Drug Threat Assessment reveals that Mexico's DTOs control most of the U.S. drug market, with distribution in 230 cities. President Calder\u00f3n launched a campaign against organized crime in 2006, deploying thousands of troops and police. The violence escalated in 2008, with over 5,600 deaths and a rise in brutal crimes like beheadings and kidnappings. The battle for control of the multi-billion dollar drug trade in Mexico has been brutal, with beheadings, violent kidnappings, and the indiscriminate killing of civilians. The high numbers of killings have exceeded 2,000 in 2009. The Mexican government previously tolerated the export of illegal narcotics to the United States, leading to a working relationship between Mexican authorities and drug lords through the 1990s. The relationship between Mexican authorities and drug lords in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by mistrust. Reforms to the U.S. drug certification process in 2002 improved bilateral cooperation with Mexico on counternarcotics efforts during the administration of Vicente Fox. During Vicente Fox's administration (2000-2006), combating drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) became a priority. President Fox's election in 2000 ended 71 years of one-party rule by the PRI, shifting Mexico towards a more democratic system. Critics debate the effectiveness of Fox's approach to the drug problem, with some calling it a \"lost years\" period while others highlight improved antidrug policies and institutional capacity building. Under Fox, the federal police force was reorganized, leading to more aggressive actions against DTOs such as increased arrests, drug seizures, and extraditions. During President Felipe Calder\u00f3n's administration, there were more arrests, increased drug seizures, and extradition of major drug kingpins to the United States. However, these counternarcotics successes led to violent turf battles among DTOs over territory and resources. President Calder\u00f3n made combating drug cartels a top priority, sending soldiers and federal police to drug trafficking hot spots to arrest traffickers, establish checkpoints, and interdict drug shipments along the Mexican coasts. Many praised Calder\u00f3n's determination to combat DTOs and corruption. President Calder\u00f3n's administration focused on battling drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) and corruption. The crackdown in 2008 led to increased violence in northern Mexico near the U.S.-Mexico border. Rival DTOs fought for control of drug smuggling routes, resulting in attacks on each other and Mexican security forces. Since 2006, Calder\u00f3n deployed troops and police, resulting in approximately 10,000 deaths. The drug war in Mexico has led to a realignment of control among major cartels, with the Sinaloa Federation breaking apart in 2008. The major DTOs in Mexico are polydrug operations, handling methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. The recent violence indicates a shift in control of national markets and transport routes. The Sinaloa cartel, led by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, controlled a majority of cocaine trafficking from Mexico to the US but lost territory in Mexico in 2008. The Gulf Cartel, once powerful, is now weakened due to government campaigns and leadership changes. The Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization, formerly part of the Sinaloa federation, is now independent and one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Mexico. They control large areas of the country and are responsible for high-profile assassinations and attacks on government officials. They have secured narcotics transport routes in several states and have clashed with their former Sinaloa partners. The Arellano Felix Organization/Tijuana Cartel, once a powerful DTO, was significantly weakened in 2008 by law enforcement efforts. The Vicente Carillo Fuentes Organization/Ju\u00e1rez Cartel operates in northern Mexico and is in a violent battle with the Sinaloa cartel for control of Ju\u00e1rez. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel is in a battle with Sinaloa for control of Ju\u00e1rez. Los Zetas, a group of former military commandos, have grown in power despite losing their leader. They have formed alliances with various drug trafficking organizations, including the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization. Los Zetas, a violent enforcer gang with military expertise, have been operating independently as a DTO since 2009. They have engaged in firefights with the Mexican military and have a history of cross-border violence. The escalation in violence in 2007 and 2008 has been attributed in part to them. Los Zetas have gained power by filling leadership voids in cartels following arrests by the Mexican government. Los Zetas have recruited former Guatemalan special forces and contracted with Central American gangs like MS-13. Sinaloa cartel formed enforcer gangs battling with the Zetas. La Familia Michoacana, now an \"emergent cartel,\" is active in the drug trade struggle in various Mexican states. The Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2009, leading to the arrest of La Familia members in Mexico. Drug trafficking organizations have expanded into other criminal activities like kidnapping and human trafficking to increase profits, causing a rise in violence and criminal enterprises. The U.S. and Mexican drug enforcement measures may be pushing drug traffickers into alternative criminal activities. Observers question the Mexican government's strength due to violence and attacks on officials. Reports suggest Mexico could face collapse, but U.S. officials deny this possibility. During Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's trip to Mexico in March 2009, she praised the Mexican government's progress against drug cartels and disputed claims of Mexico being a failed state. Mexican officials argue that increased violence indicates cartel infighting rather than state failure. Former U.S. drug policy director John P. Walters agrees with this assessment, stating that Mexico faces challenges from criminal gangs but is not a failed state. According to the government, Mexico has a functioning state that provides education, health, security, and other services to millions of people. Drug trafficking organizations in Mexico aim to subvert the state rather than defeat it, leading to conflicts with state security forces. The organizations rely on corrupt officials and law enforcement to control drug trafficking routes and repatriate billions of dollars annually from drug sales in the United States. This money is used to buy weapons, corrupt officials, and operate with impunity. The drug trafficking organizations in Mexico use large sums of cash to corrupt Mexican law enforcement and officials, allowing them to operate with impunity. This corruption has led to a reliance on the military to combat DTOs and remains a major challenge for U.S.-Mexican law enforcement cooperation. In late 2008, an elite unit within the federal Attorney General's office was implicated in a scandal involving payoffs for sensitive information about antidrug activities, resulting in the arrest of at least 35 officials and agents. In late 2008, Mexican officials were arrested for ties to drug cartels, with President Calder\u00f3n sanctioning over 11,500 public employees for corruption. In May 2009, a major anti-drug operation in Michoacan led to the arrest of politicians and officials linked to drug gangs. Drug-related killings in Mexico have seen a significant increase since 2007, with media tracking the crimes daily. Drug-related killings in Mexico have seen a significant increase since 2007, with the Mexican government providing varying numbers on the death toll. In 2008, there were over 5,600 drug-related killings, a 110% increase from the previous year. The violence continued to escalate in 2009, with nearly 1,000 drug-related killings in the first two months alone. Among the victims were 522 Mexican military and law enforcement officials. In 2009, drug-related killings in Mexico surged with almost 1,000 deaths, a 146% increase from 2008. The violence included high-level government officials' assassinations, gruesome murders, and kidnappings. Mexican officials attributed the violence to disrupting drug transit routes, while others noted a concerning trend of DTO gunmen directly confronting the army. The Mexican drug war has seen a surge in violence, with DTOs battling for control of lucrative drug markets. The Calder\u00f3n government's crackdown has intensified the conflict, leading to escalating brutality among DTOs. The DEA reports inter-cartel and intra-cartel conflicts as key factors driving the violence, with new territories, like the southern border with Guatemala, becoming hotspots for drug-related violence. The number of DTO employees in Mexico is estimated to be as high as 100,000, rivaling the Mexican armed forces. The Mexican drug war has escalated with competing cartels vying for control of drug markets. The violence has increased due to inter-cartel conflicts and the government crackdown. The situation is fluid and secretive, making it difficult to assess alliances and objectives. Analysts describe 2008 as a year of turmoil with unprecedented levels of violence showing no signs of decreasing. The realignment of drug syndicates and violent turf battles in 2008 are attributed to the splintering of the Sinaloa cartel. The drug war in Mexico has escalated with competing cartels fighting for control of drug markets. The violence has increased due to inter-cartel conflicts and government crackdowns. Violence is used as a tool in the drug trafficking business for various objectives, including control of territory, punishing betrayals, and intimidating government officials and the public. The cartels prefer to intimidate and subvert the government rather than bring it down. The drug cartels in Mexico use violence to intimidate and subvert the government, rather than bring it down. This allows them to operate without much interference. Kidnappings for ransom have also increased significantly, with over 1,000 reported cases in 2008. The government is urged to take action against the escalating violence. In late 2008, kidnappings in Mexico targeted both the rich and working-class families, with ransom demands as low as $500. A tragic incident involved the kidnapping and killing of a five-year-old boy in Mexico City. An American anti-kidnapping negotiator, Felix Batista, was also abducted in Saltillo. Mexican officials have called for the U.S. to stop the flow of high-powered guns to Mexican drug cartels, estimating 2,000 firearms smuggled across the border daily. The flow of high-powered guns from the United States to Mexican drug cartels has increased since the expiration of the federal ban on assault weapons in 2004. Cartel enforcers are acquiring military-style weapons, including assault rifles and sniper rifles, which allow them to match the firepower of military or law enforcement units in small engagements. Some seized weapons in Mexico are military-grade, such as rocket launchers and grenade launchers. President Calder\u00f3n urged President Obama to clamp down on the flow of arms southward during their meetings. Cartel-related killings are concentrated in a few states, with the majority occurring in Baja California, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua. Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, located in Chihuahua state, is a key battleground for drug and weapons trafficking between the Sinaloa cartel and the local Ju\u00e1rez DTO. Violence in Ju\u00e1rez has continued into 2009. In 2009, violence in Ju\u00e1rez escalated with cartel gunmen targeting police officers. President Calder\u00f3n collaborated with the US, deploying thousands of troops to combat drug trafficking in hotspots like Ju\u00e1rez. Military took over law enforcement in the city. In 2009, President Calder\u00f3n's crackdown on drug cartels in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez led to a decrease in the murder rate. The Mexican authorities offered rewards for information on top drug traffickers, resulting in arrests and extraditions to the US. However, public support may wane if more tangible results are not seen. In 2009, President Calder\u00f3n's crackdown on drug cartels in Mexico faced public disapproval due to lack of measurable results. The PRI was expected to win more seats in elections than Calder\u00f3n's PAN party. The militarization of law enforcement was criticized, with concerns raised by civil society and human rights organizations. The government argued for military involvement in domestic security until 2013 due to corruption in state and local police. Human Rights Watch alleged serious human rights violations. In April 2009, Human Rights Watch reported serious human rights violations by the Mexican military, including enforced disappearances, killings, torture, rapes, and arbitrary detention. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission also noted a surge in human rights abuses by security forces, with over 1,200 complaints in 2008. Concerns were raised about the military's involvement in civilian law enforcement, as there was a risk of corruption by drug trafficking organizations. Approximately 10% of the 10,000 killed in Mexico's drug violence since Calder\u00f3n took office were from the federal police and military. Mexico, under Calder\u00f3n's administration, has a lower homicide rate compared to other countries in the region. The violence, mainly in states near the Southwest border, has raised concerns about spillover into the United States. The U.S. has a significant security interest in assisting Mexico against drug cartels and organized crime, with a focus on defeating cartels, suppressing violence, and preventing spillover. The United States has increased border security and cooperation with Mexico to combat drug cartels, with initiatives to deny illicit arms, reduce money laundering, trafficking of drug precursor chemicals, and suppress human smuggling. The United States provides direct assistance to Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative to combat drug trafficking and criminal organizations. The U.S. Congress has expressed concern over Mexico's situation and potential spillover effects. A joint statement in 2007 announced a multi-year plan for $1.4 billion in U.S. assistance to combat organized crime in Mexico and Central America. The M\u00e9rida Initiative expands cooperation to combat DTOs and criminal gangs. The M\u00e9rida Initiative aims to enhance bilateral cooperation to combat organized crime, drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), and criminal gangs. The Bush Administration requested $950 million for Mexico, with $700 million already appropriated by Congress. The objective is to disrupt drug-trafficking, weapons trafficking, and illicit financial activities. The joint statement between Mexico and the U.S. highlighted efforts to combat various criminal activities, including drug trafficking and human trafficking. Mexico increased security spending by 24% in 2007, while the U.S. focused on reducing weapons and drug trafficking along the border. The statement mentioned existing strategies like the Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy and efforts to combat criminal gangs from Central America and Mexico. The Bush Administration requested funding for the M\u00e9rida Initiative to be designated for the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account. The Congress appropriated assistance within various accounts for the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), with conditions softer than earlier versions due to Mexico's objections. The Secretary of State must submit a report on implementing human rights conditions for foreign security forces. The Congress appropriated assistance for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative with human rights conditions. The Secretary of State must report on implementing these conditions for foreign security forces, including measures to bring responsible members to justice. The Obama Administration requested $66 million in INCLE assistance for Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative to acquire three Blackhawk helicopters for Mexico's civilian Public Security Secretariat. The House approved a total of $470 million in funding for Mexico, including $160 million in INCLE funding and $310 million in FMF funding. The Senate approved $66 million in INCLE assistance for Mexico in the FY2009 supplemental bill. The bill also shifted $350 million for Southwest border security to domestic agencies and added $250 million for related activities. The Obama Administration requested $450 million for Mexico in FY2010 under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, but it is uncertain if Congress will fully fund this amount. The House-approved FY2009 supplemental appropriations bill focuses on the slow implementation of M\u00e9rida aid in Mexico, with criticism from Mexican officials and U.S. Congress members. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern about the pace of delivery during her visit to Mexico and in her testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The first $400 million for the M\u00e9rida Initiative is led by the Department of State. The first $400 million for the foreign aid program in P.L. 110-252 includes funding for helicopters, surveillance aircraft, inspection equipment, ion scanners, canine units, technologies for data collection, secure communications, technical advice, and training to strengthen Mexican law enforcement agencies. The United States and Mexico signed a Letter of Agreement in December 2008 for the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with $197 million disbursed. Implementation coordination meetings were held in early 2009, with some programs starting in spring 2009 and others with longer procurement processes. The M\u00e9rida Initiative signed between the United States and Mexico in December 2008 allocated $197 million, with some programs starting in spring 2009. However, the procurement process for military equipment funded by the Foreign Military Financing account, such as Bell helicopters and CASA surveillance aircraft, can take one to two years for delivery to Mexico. Only $7 million of the initial $400 million assistance has been spent, with delays attributed to U.S. government contracting regulations, negotiations with Mexico, and the complexity of coordinating aid across multiple agencies and programs. The 111th Congress aims to support Mexico in combating drug trafficking organizations and reducing violence to a manageable level. The heightened violence in Mexico, particularly in border cities, has led to 14 congressional hearings. President Obama visited Mexico in 2009 to discuss security issues and cooperation. He added three Mexican drug cartels to the list of drug kingpins, urging Senate approval of the CIFTA treaty. Further initiatives are expected, including increased funding in the FY2009 supplemental appropriations bill and FY2010 budget, due to concerns about spillover violence into the U.S. The budget request for further appropriations in foreign operations and domestic context may be forthcoming due to concerns about Mexican spillover violence and drug trafficking.
