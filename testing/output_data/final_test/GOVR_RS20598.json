    "content": "The U.S. and other nations are focused on combating terrorism, with a growing number of terrorist groups and increasing access to mass casualty technology. The 105th Congress established the National Commission on Terrorism to assess U.S. laws and policies in response to the terrorist threat. The Commission's report, issued in 2000, emphasizes the need for proactive preparation against international terrorism. The National Commission on Terrorism's report, issued on June 5, 2000, calls for proactive measures to prevent and respond to catastrophic terrorist attacks. It advocates for using intelligence and law enforcement authority to gather information on terrorist activities, targeting states that support terrorists, disrupting sources of terrorist support, enhancing preparation for attacks involving dangerous materials, and creating stronger funding mechanisms for counterterrorism programs. The report warns that the United States is moving away from a strong policy against terrorism. The report suggests that the United States is drifting away from a strong policy of combating state support of international terrorism, leading to a more passive approach. It highlights a softening of U.S. positions on Iran and Syria, a perceived weakness in confronting Pakistan's support for terrorist groups, and a failure to use sanctions against Greece for not investigating terrorist activity. The report also acknowledges the growing threat of lone-wolf terrorists. The report recommends expanding sanctions on state sponsors like Greece and Pakistan for their lack of action against terrorist activities. Greece has been passive in responding to terrorism, with numerous attacks against Americans going unsolved. Pakistan is criticized for providing support to terrorist groups in Kashmir. The report suggests imposing sanctions on both countries. The NTC recommends imposing sanctions on Greece and Pakistan under U.S. law for not fully cooperating on anti-terrorism efforts. Sanctions may also include making non-cooperating countries ineligible for the U.S. visa waiver program. The report suggests expanding the use of sanctions to include nations not fully cooperating with counterterrorism efforts. The report calls for the President to maintain Iran on the terrorist list until it stops supporting terrorism and fully cooperates in the investigation of the Khobar Towers bombing. It also recommends seeking support from allies to compel Iranian cooperation. Additionally, the report advises keeping Syria on the state sponsors list until it shuts down terrorist training camps and prohibits resupply of terrorist groups. The report recommends designating Afghanistan as a state sponsor of terrorism and imposing sanctions against the Kabul regime. It suggests that under extraordinary circumstances, the Department of Defense may be designated as the lead federal agency for the government's response to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil, with detailed contingency plans in place. The Commission recommends advance planning to prevent curtailment of individual liberties in a weapons of mass destruction scenario. It suggests enhancing foreign student visa data retrieval capability to efficiently monitor students from terrorist-list countries. This would help flag any suspicious activities, such as sudden changes in majors. The report recommends enhancing foreign student visa data retrieval to monitor students from terrorist-list countries for suspicious activities, allowing for full use of law enforcement and intelligence authority, including the expulsion of suspected terrorists. The report recommends using the Alien Terrorist Removal Court to expel terrorists when criminal prosecution is not possible, with safeguards for national security. It also suggests senior officials participate in national response exercises annually and calls for the development of an international convention on cyberterrorism/cybercrime. The report recommends developing an international convention to harmonize laws, share information, provide early warning, and establish procedures for international cybercrime investigations. There are concerns about protecting civil liberties while combating terrorism, with some recommendations facing criticism from civil libertarian and Arab-American groups. The Commission's report addresses various counterterrorism measures, including gathering information, modernizing databases, expelling suspected terrorists, and planning for military involvement in catastrophic attacks. However, some complex and unresolved issues remain unaddressed, raising civil liberties concerns in balancing security measures with constitutional limits. The Commission's report emphasizes the need for government action to gather information and restrict terrorist activities. In a globalized world with growing individual freedoms, regulatory and monitoring mechanisms are essential to deter and track terrorists. The report suggests that combating terrorism may require restrictions on individual liberties to prevent mass casualty incidents. The Commission's report highlights the importance of contingency planning for a constructive military role post-incident to preserve individual liberties and democratic freedoms. Unaddressed issues include U.S. embassy security, security of military installations overseas, and weapons of mass destruction disaster management. Unresolved questions within the Commission's mandate include leadership in U.S. counterterrorism policy and organizational mechanisms for policy implementation. The curr_chunk discusses the best organizational mechanisms for policy formulation and implementation, utilizing tools like public diplomacy, sanctions, covert action, military force, and international cooperation to combat terrorism. It also addresses budget prioritization for counterterrorism resources, effectiveness of sanctions and military force, and the role of covert operations in proactive counterterrorism policy. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a review of the U.S. ban on assassinations in proactive counterterrorism policy. It also highlights the importance of attracting international talent for technological research and development in support of counterterrorism goals, and questions the role of media in such policies. Additionally, it suggests the use of \"carrot\" options alongside the traditional \"stick\" approach to combat terrorism, such as constructive engagement, foreign aid, trade packages, and rewards for information programs. The curr_chunk discusses the potential use of rewards for information programs in counterterrorism efforts, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches like the \"carrot\" strategy alongside the traditional \"stick\" approach. It mentions the uncertain outcomes of such strategies but suggests that they could be effective in dealing with groups like the IRA and PLO. The National Commission on Terrorism's report is expected to generate interest in counterterrorism policy in the 107th Congress, focusing on more productive counterterrorism policies. The potential areas of scrutiny for counterterrorism efforts include more productive policies, enhanced use of legislative authority for sanctions on supporting states, and achieving better coordination through enhanced budget mechanisms."
