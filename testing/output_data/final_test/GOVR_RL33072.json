    "content": "In early March 2006, President Bush visited India, emphasizing bilateral cooperation in counterterrorism, democracy promotion, trade, health, and energy. A joint statement with Prime Minister Singh highlighted progress in the U.S.-India strategic partnership, including the successful completion of India's nuclear facility separation plan. The Administration proposed adjustments to U.S. laws for nuclear commerce with India, while also lauding bilateral military relations and potential arms sales. Congress held hearings to discuss the progress and implications of warm U.S.-India relations and agreements. The Senate hearing focused on the controversial aspect of the July 2005 Joint Statement between President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India. Congress requested substantive discussions on legislative proposals related to this cooperation, expressing concern over the lack of consultation by the Administration. In November, a group of experts urged Congress to critically examine the proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with India, warning of adverse implications for U.S. nonproliferation objectives. U.S. Ambassador to India linked progress on the deal with India's vote on Iran at the IAEA, stating that failure to align with the U.S. could jeopardize the initiative in Congress. The State Department spokesman dismissed the Ambassador's comments as a \"personal opinion\" and denied any link between issues. India strongly rejected any connection between the two issues and criticized the remarks. India voted with the majority on an IAEA resolution regarding Iran, emphasizing that it did not affect its relations with Iran. India and France pledged to work towards a bilateral agreement on civil nuclear cooperation. France and India pledged to work towards a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement, with France also committing to collaborate with other countries and the NSG. However, France indicated that India would need to make compromises regarding the separation of civilian and military nuclear facilities. Canada announced it would supply dual-use items to India's nuclear program, and Australia considered altering its policy on selling uranium to non-NPT signatories like India. After intensive negotiations, U.S. and Indian officials reached an agreement on India's plan to separate civilian and military nuclear facilities. The plan requires moving 14 of India's 22 reactors under international oversight by 2014 and placing all future civilian reactors under permanent control. India's fast breeder reactors are exempt, and there will be an uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel for civilian facilities. Under Secretary of State Burns, the lead U.S. negotiator, sees the plan as a boost for nonproliferation efforts. The U.S. and India reached an agreement on separating civilian and military nuclear facilities, with plans to increase safeguards on Indian nuclear facilities. Despite criticism from nonproliferation experts, the White House responded to critics. Legislation was introduced in the Senate and House regarding nuclear cooperation with India. President Bush and Prime Minister Singh established a \"global partnership\" between the two countries during a state visit in 2005. The Joint Statement between the United States and India established a \"global partnership\" with increased cooperation on economic issues, energy, environment, democracy, development, non-proliferation, security, high-technology, and space. It included plans for full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India, requiring changes in U.S. law and Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. This marked a significant shift in U.S. nonproliferation policy towards India's nuclear weapons status. The July 18 statement on U.S.-India relations highlighted strategic cooperation efforts to counterbalance China's rise. The report reviews bilateral agreements signed in 2005 and 2006, covering security, economic, and global issues. Arguments for and against increased cooperation are discussed. The U.S.-India agreements in June and July 2005 marked a significant milestone in the warming relations between the two countries. The relationship, once constrained by global U.S.-Soviet bipolarity, improved notably after the Clinton Administration and further accelerated after a meeting between President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari in November 2001. The agreements cover various major issue areas, including regional concerns involving China, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as Indian perspectives. After a meeting between President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari in November 2001, U.S.-India cooperation expanded on various issues, including counterterrorism. Pro-U.S. sentiment is strong in India, with a focus on defeating militant Islam. President Bush emphasized the importance of a strong relationship with India in his National Security Strategy. The launch of the \"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership\" initiative in January 2004 further solidified the relationship. The \"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership\" (NSSP) initiative was launched to expand cooperation in civilian nuclear activities, space programs, and high-technology trade between the US and India. The Bush Administration aimed to help India become a major world power in the 21st century. Proponents of closer US-India security cooperation cite China's rise as a reason to strengthen ties. India is expected to purchase up to $5 billion worth of conventional weapons from the US. India is expected to purchase up to $5 billion worth of conventional weapons from the United States, with concerns about the US turning India into a regional \"client state.\" The redefinition of US-India ties is driven by the end of the Cold War, globalization, and the influence of Indian-Americans. India is facing criticism for potentially becoming a regional \"client state\" of the United States, despite its traditional nonalignment stance. The defense ministry assures that joint military operations with the US will be guided by India's national interest. India rejects the idea of using its relations with the US as a counterforce against China. The US policy of supporting India's rise as a major power has significant implications. The US policy of supporting India's rise as a major power has significant implications for US interests in Asia and beyond, especially in relation to China and Pakistan. The Bush Administration aims for full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India, which raises concerns in Congress about India's relations with Iran. Congressional oversight of US foreign relations in Asia will likely consider the implications of increased cooperation with India in areas such as arms sales. The Indian government has pushed for increased cooperation with the United States in high-technology trade, arms sales, and civilian nuclear and space cooperation. These areas are crucial for demonstrating a strengthened U.S.-India relationship, with the inclusion of missile defense forming a \"quartet\" of key issues. The U.S. has sought to balance Indian interests in sensitive trade and cooperation before launching the NSSP initiative in 2004. The United States has aimed to balance Indian interests in sensitive technology trade with proliferation and security concerns. Secretary of State Powell emphasized the importance of being forthcoming while protecting red lines regarding proliferation. India's export controls are considered robust, but recent U.S. sanctions on Indian entities involved in WMD-related transfers to Iran have raised concerns. The NSSP involved reciprocal steps to expand engagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues, missile defense, space technology, and high-technology commerce with India. Despite the initiative's focus on increasing India's access to advanced technologies, some analysts saw it as a significant shift in U.S. strategic orientation towards India. The State Department hailed the completion of the NSSP on July 18, 2005, as a milestone in transforming U.S.-India relations and enabling further cooperation efforts. The July 18 Joint Statement outlined progress in three NSSP issue-areas, with a focus on missile defense. Since 1998, Indian entities faced licensing requirements and were on the U.S. Commerce Department's \"Entity List\" for weapons proliferation. President Bush waived nuclear-related sanctions in October 2001, reducing Indian companies on the list. Adjustments to export licensing policies were made in 2004 and 2005, removing some entities but leaving four subordinates on the list. Many Indian entities were removed from the Entity List, leaving only a few, including subordinates of ISRO and DRDO, a Department of Atomic Energy entity, and Bharat Dynamics Limited. Despite progress outlined in the July 18 Joint Statement, some Indian observers remain skeptical about the NSSP process, questioning its impact on U.S. technological superiority. Past U.S. moves are seen as symbolic, with little substantive changes in high-technology trade licensing requirements and limited progress in space and nuclear energy cooperation. Indian analysts have faced bureaucratic obstacles in Washington, with references to nonproliferation interests. The July 18 Joint Statement implicitly recognizes India as a nuclear weapons state, citing its strong nonproliferation record and export control laws. The Bush Administration believes India should align with international nonproliferation norms. The IAEA Director General sees the agreement as innovative and beneficial for nuclear safety. Some analysts see the decision as a way to balance against a rising power. Favorable analysts view nuclear cooperation with India as a way to counterbalance a rising China and bring New Delhi into the global nonproliferation regime. India aims to increase its nuclear power capacity to offset its energy needs, with a goal of generating 20,000 megawatts by 2020. General Electric built India's Tarapur nuclear power plant in 1969. General Electric, the American company that built India's Tarapur nuclear power plant in 1969, may benefit financially from selling nuclear fuel to India. Secretary of State Rice acknowledged in 2005 that current U.S. law prohibits the sale of nuclear technology to India, raising concerns about the implications for the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Critics argue that granting exceptions to India could weaken the nonproliferation regime and fault the Bush Administration for a selective and self-serving policy. The Joint Statement raises concerns about the United States' commitment to nonproliferation obligations, potentially leading other supplier countries to relax rules and aid security risks like Iran and Pakistan. There is worry that advanced scientific countries may be tempted to develop nuclear capabilities if negotiations with Iran and North Korea fail. Additionally, U.S. support for India is seen as disrupting power balances with Pakistan and China. Some in Congress oppose selling nuclear materials to non-NPT countries that have tested nuclear devices. During a hearing on U.S.-India relations, concerns were raised about potential damage to international nonproliferation regimes from changes in U.S. law allowing civil nuclear cooperation with India. Some criticized the lack of prior consultation with Congress. Administration officials defended the move, stating it would bring India into nonproliferation norms and benefit international efforts. The Administration assured the Committee of not undermining NSG guidelines, despite mixed reactions from NSG members on making an exception for India. Former Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee criticized the July 18 Joint Statement for causing concern among Indian nuclear scientists and defense analysts, citing potential erosion of India's nuclear deterrent and prohibitive costs of separating civilian and military nuclear facilities. India's main opposition BJP also raised objections to greater U.S.-India nuclear cooperation. The costs of separating civilian and military nuclear facilities in India are deemed prohibitive. Prime Minister Singh dismisses criticisms, stating the deal won't limit India's nuclear program. The July 18 Joint Statement aims to strengthen energy security in India and discourage a proposed pipeline for Iranian gas delivery through Pakistan. The U.S.-India Energy Dialogue aims to secure clean, reliable energy sources. A Joint Working Group on Civil Space Cooperation was established for enhanced collaboration in space activities, including satellite projects and Earth observation. The next meeting is scheduled in Washington, D.C. in 2006. The July 18 Joint Statement between the United States and India calls for closer ties in space exploration, satellite navigation, and commercial space activities. Increased civil space cooperation could lead to practical solutions in communication, navigation, environment, and scientific research. Plans include launching U.S. instruments on an Indian moon mission and potentially including an Indian astronaut in the U.S. astronaut training program. Cooperation on the Global Positioning System is also on the agenda. Past U.S. efforts to restrict India's access to technology for military missile programs have been noted. The U.S. and India established the U.S.-India High-Technology Cooperation Group (HTCG) in 2002. The inaugural HTCG session in July 2003 focused on market access, barriers, and export controls for high technology commerce. Public-private events under HTCG included a meeting in 2003 with industry representatives. Commerce Department officials dispelled myths about dual-use trade restrictions with India. In February 2005, the U.S.-India High-Technology Defense Working Group met in Bangalore to identify new opportunities for cooperation in defense trade. The Joint Statement in July 18 mentioned the signing of a Science and Technology Framework Agreement. U.S. proponents advocate for increased high-technology trade with India, emphasizing the benefits for both economies. Concerns include the transfer of sensitive U.S. technologies to third parties. Critics warn that sharing high-technology dual-use goods with India could advance its military programs, including nuclear weapons capabilities. U.S.-India security cooperation has flourished since September 2001, with a desire for greater bilateral security cooperation. The India-U.S. Defense Policy Group was revived in late 2001, emphasizing military cooperation as crucial in transformed U.S.-India relations. Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee visited on June 28, 2005. On June 28, 2005, Indian Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the United States signed a ten-year defense framework agreement, marking a new era in bilateral relations. The agreement includes collaboration in multilateral operations, expanded defense trade, technology transfers, missile defense cooperation, and the establishment of a Defense Procurement and Production Group. The United States sees defense cooperation with India as vital for defeating terrorism, preventing weapons proliferation, and maintaining regional stability. India is considered a strong candidate for increased security cooperation despite some technological disparities. Greater interoperability and coordination with the Indian armed forces has the potential to benefit the United States in areas including counterterrorism, counternarcotics, counterproliferation, and peacekeeping operations. Skeptics point to an Indian strategic culture rooted in concepts of nonalignment and multipolarity as reasons that a true strategic partnership will be difficult to develop in the security realm. The Indian military is quite new to doctrines entailing force projection. The Indian military is new to force projection doctrines and has been focused on defending sovereignty. Indian officials are concerned about the reliability of the United States as a partner. Despite efforts to address Indian concerns, it remains to be seen if both countries can overcome political obstacles in their defense relationship. In February 2004, joint military exercises called \"Cope India\" showcased Indian pilots outperforming American pilots in mock air combat. Analysts suggest that joint exercises need to focus more on planning for combined operations to benefit both countries. There is a proposal for a memorandum of understanding on cooperative military operations between the United States and India in the Indian Ocean region, which could potentially upset security planners in Islamabad and Beijing. Additionally, U.S. arms sales to India have become a prominent issue, with a group of private U.S. arms dealers visiting New Delhi for discussions. In early 2004, a group of private U.S. arms dealers visited New Delhi to discuss potential sales with Indian officials. The Indian government has expressed interest in purchasing various U.S.-made weapons, including aircraft and missile defense systems. The Bush Administration welcomed Indian requests for information on buying F-16 or F/A-18 fighters and transformative systems. India may also seek to purchase a decommissioned U.S. Navy transport ship. India has shown interest in expanding security commerce with the United States beyond a \"buyer-seller\" interaction to focus on technology transfers, co-development, and co-production. The country currently relies heavily on Russian military equipment imports. There is a willingness from the United States to discuss potential sales of missile defense systems to India, with New Delhi expressing interest in Arrow and/or Patriot anti-missile systems. India's defense minister has stated that while they are open to limited area use of these systems, they have no intention of accepting a full missile shield. The Indian defense minister states that India has no intention of accepting a missile shield from anyone. Some Indian commentary advises against purchasing U.S.-made systems, citing concerns about effectiveness and regional insecurities. U.S. proponents see increased missile defense dialogue with India as aligning with President Bush's policy. Skeptics warn that anti-missile systems in South Asia could disrupt the regional balance and fuel an arms race. The Proliferation Security Initiative seeks multilateral cooperation on interdicting WMD-related shipments. India has reservations about the mechanics of maritime interventions in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and seeks to be among the decision-makers. The United States supports India's economic reform policies, with trade between the two countries increasing in 2004. The U.S.-India Economic Dialogue is also mentioned. In 2003, India became the 22nd largest U.S. trading partner. The U.S.-India Economic Dialogue has four tracks: Trade Policy Forum, Financial and Economic Forum, Environment Dialogue, and Commercial Dialogue. The July 18 Joint Statement called for revitalizing the Economic Dialogue, launching a new CEO Forum, and modernizing India's infrastructure for continued economic growth. The CEO Forum, consisting of ten chief executives from each country, identified poor infrastructure and bureaucracy as obstacles to increased bilateral trade and investment. In September 2004, U.S. Under Secretary of State Larson highlighted the slow pace of economic reform in India and the lackluster trade and investment flows between the U.S. and India. The New Delhi government's decision to abandon plans to sell state-owned companies in August 2005 was seen as a setback to India's economic reform program. Despite concerns about India's closed economy, its GDP growth rates have been among the highest globally, averaging over 6.5% annually for 2002-2004. In November 2005, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snow visited India to focus on liberalizing the financial sector and improving financing infrastructure. U.S. Trade Representative Portman also visited New Delhi to discuss trade policy and promote bilateral trade agreements. Proponents argue that increased economic cooperation with India will benefit both countries' economies and citizens. Increased economic cooperation between the U.S. and India has raised concerns about outsourcing jobs and transmitting private information. U.S. officials urge India to enact privacy and cybersecurity laws to address these issues. President Bush and Prime Minister have emphasized the benefits of trade and investment for both countries. The U.S. and India are working together to combat terrorism, with a focus on strengthening military capabilities and intelligence sharing. India is particularly concerned about militant Islamic extremism, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. After the September 2001 attacks, the U.S. and India increased cooperation, including offering base usage and territorial transit for counterterrorism efforts. India, Germany, Brazil, and Japan are pushing for permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council, with the U.S. rejecting their proposal. There is a disconnect between Washington and New Delhi in their definitions of terrorism and preferred global counterterrorism policies. The United States rejected the \"G4\" proposal and is coordinating with China to defeat it in the U.N. General Assembly. India's U.N. aspirations were not explicitly mentioned in the July 18 Joint Statement during the Prime Minister's DC visit. Many in Congress support India's permanent representation on the UNSC, but the Bush Administration believes any changes should be part of a broader U.N. reform agenda. The U.S.-India Global Issues Forum was inaugurated. The U.S.-India Global Issues Forum, established in 2002, addresses environmental protection, sustainable development, combating organized crime, and promoting democratic values. The forum also includes initiatives on democracy and disaster relief. Cooperation on combating HIV/AIDS is emphasized in the Joint Statement. The growing U.S.-India relations have implications for other regional countries. The U.S.-India \"global partnership\" has implications for U.S. relations with regional countries like China, Pakistan, and Iran. U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's increasing global influence and are looking to India as a potential counterbalance. However, it is unlikely that India will act as a \"balancer\" against China unless it aligns with New Delhi's own interests. India sees China as an opportunity rather than a problem and is unlikely to form an overt counterweight alliance against China unless it aligns with New Delhi's own terms. The history of a border war in 1962 strained relations between the two countries, with India viewing China as a potential threat. India's Defense Ministry is concerned about China's growing economic and military strength, especially its defense and arms sales relations with Pakistan. India's defense establishment views China as a future threat due to its military modernization, strategic weapons, and arms sales relations with Pakistan. Concerns include China's potential to restrain India through alliances with neighboring countries and providing cruise missile technology to Pakistan. The global oil market is shifting towards India and China, leading to competition for oil and gas supplies abroad. Despite unresolved territorial issues, India remains wary of China's actions. Despite unresolved territorial issues, high-level exchanges between India and China emphasize common interests over differences. Recent years have seen increased bilateral security engagement, joint military exercises, and plans to expand defense cooperation. In 2005, a \"strategic partnership\" was launched to enhance defense links and economic relations, with growing trade between the two countries. Many in India and China view each other as not being a threat. Trade between India and China is growing rapidly with potential benefits for both countries. The July 18 Joint Statement between New Delhi and Beijing signaled a shift in U.S. relations with India and Pakistan. Despite historical engagement with Pakistan, the United States is increasingly delinking its India policy. In recent years, the United States has started to separate its India policy from its Pakistan policy, recognizing India as a responsible state with advanced nuclear technology. This has caused concern in Islamabad, which feels overlooked compared to New Delhi. Increased U.S.-India cooperation may push Pakistan to strengthen its ties with China. India is uneasy with the U.S. support for Pakistan post-9/11, especially when Pakistan was designated a major non-NATO ally in 2004. India's reaction to the United States designating Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally was one of disappointment and betrayal. New Delhi rejected any military alliance with Washington and expressed further dismay when the US resumed sales of F-16 fighters to Pakistan. India remains wary of Pakistan's relations with the US and China, with potential friction in US-India relations over dealings with Iran. In 2005, India gave conditional diplomatic support for Iran's nuclear program, emphasizing adherence to international obligations. Indian firms have secured long-term contracts for Iranian gas and oil, with plans for a pipeline construction to strengthen energy ties. Relations with Iran are seen as a test of India's commitment to an independent foreign policy. The proposed pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan has become a point of contention in U.S.-India relations. Indian External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh expressed willingness to consider the project if Pakistan provided security guarantees. The Bush Administration strongly opposes any gas pipeline projects involving Iran due to concerns about funding Iran's weapons program and terrorist activities. Secretary of State Rice acknowledged India's need for civil nuclear energy to reduce dependence on carbon. The U.S. has concerns about foreign companies investing in Iran's energy sector, but India maintains friendly relations with Tehran and sees the pipeline project as in its national interest. Despite U.S. pressure, Indian officials have committed to the pipeline project with Pakistan. Members of the House International Relations Committee have expressed serious concerns about India's relations with Iran. The House International Relations Committee raised concerns about India's stance on Iran's nuclear case, urging Indian cooperation with the U.S. President Bush also expressed worries to the Indian prime minister about Iran's actions. India declined to take a strong stand on Iran and called for further negotiation. New Delhi surprised observers by voting with the majority on a resolution finding Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear program. The decision was criticized by opposition parties, but New Delhi defended it as being in India's national interest. The U.S. State Department praised India's vote as a stance against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The U.S. and India have been involved in discussions regarding nuclear energy cooperation and nonproliferation implications in various committee meetings."
