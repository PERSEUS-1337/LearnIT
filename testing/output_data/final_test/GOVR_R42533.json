    "content": "The report answers FAQs about presidential primaries, caucuses, and national party conventions. The nominating process is complex due to a mix of national and state rules, with conventions officially selecting candidates. The goal is for a candidate to accumulate a majority of delegates to secure the nomination. The report discusses the process of choosing delegates in primaries and caucuses at the national convention. State parties use caucuses and primaries to select national convention delegates. Caucuses involve participants publicly showing their candidate preference, while primaries are more like traditional elections. Delegates are elected at various levels leading up to the national convention. The caucuses and primaries are methods used by state parties to select national convention delegates. Caucuses involve public candidate preference, while primaries are traditional elections. Delegates are elected at different levels leading to the national convention. The national party conventions historically played a crucial role in nominating presidential candidates. In the era of \"party bosses,\" state and local party leaders controlled delegates in closed meetings. Candidates needed their support for nominations, with deal-making crucial. National conventions were key, often requiring multiple votes before a candidate emerged. The last brokered convention was in 1952, when Democrats needed three ballots to nominate Governor Adlai Stevenson. The 2016 Republican convention may require multiple ballots to declare a nominee, as reforms have reduced the importance of conventions in selecting candidates. Conventions now showcase the parties and their candidates, ratifying primary results. In the 1960s, reform movements focused on political inequities, leading to changes in the Democratic Party's nomination process after the 1968 convention in Chicago erupted in controversy and violence. The McGovern-Fraser Commission recommended democratizing the delegate selection process, which was adopted by the Democratic National Committee. The 1972 election saw new rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee, making the nomination process more open and responsive to party voters. The primary system replaced caucuses and conventions, increasing transparency. Candidates could claim nomination once they won a majority of delegates, shifting suspense from the convention to the primary season. In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Governor Ronald Reagan competed for delegate support until the national convention, with Ford prevailing. Recent primary seasons have seen candidates claiming the nomination as early as March due to \"front-loading.\" This trend involves scheduling early events to attract attention, resulting in a cluster of early primaries and caucuses. Front-loading has led to early resolution of the nomination, allowing the presumptive nominee to focus on the general election campaign. However, criticisms include the quick resolution of the contest without much testing period. The 2016 primary calendar is less front-loaded than in recent decades, with the Iowa caucuses on February 1 and the New Hampshire primary on February 9. The current nominating system emerged from 1970s reforms, emphasizing rank and file participation and primaries as the dominant method for selecting delegates. The current nominating system emerged from 1970s reforms, emphasizing rank and file participation and primaries as the dominant method for selecting delegates. The national conventions are largely symbolic with respect to conferring the nomination. The contest for delegates among presidential candidates is now a mostly transparent, democratic process. The report is organized into two sections, one on the primary season and the other on the national party conventions. The primary season section includes questions about caucuses, primaries, delegate selection rules, and delegate disposition. The second section explains the national party conventions, including their financing, proceedings, and history of brokered conventions. The delegate selection process involves precinct caucuses, county conventions, congressional district conventions, and state conventions to choose national delegates. Variations exist in how state parties implement this process. The caucus/convention system used by state parties varies greatly, making it difficult to generalize. The key factor is whether rank-and-file voters' preferences determine the selection of national convention delegates. If not, party activists and leaders choose delegates as \"free agents.\" Overall, the caucus/convention system is party-run, unlike primary elections which are state-funded. Voting venues for caucuses can include schools, fire stations, and government buildings. The caucus system involves voting at various venues like schools, fire stations, and government buildings. Participants must check in, listen to candidate speeches, and then group themselves based on their preference. The process is more complex than a primary election. During caucuses, participants group themselves based on their preferred presidential candidate or uncommitted preference. A minimum viability threshold, such as 15% for Democrats, is required for a group to elect delegates to the next stage. Republicans do not have a specific viability threshold but advise states to set it at no higher than 20%. Non-viable groups can join viable ones, with persuasion tactics used to increase group size. The caucus/convention process involves grouping participants based on their preferred candidate, with a viability threshold for electing delegates to the next stage. Delegates are elected at various levels, culminating in the selection of national convention delegates. The process can take several months to complete. The caucus/convention process involves grouping participants based on their preferred candidate, with a viability threshold for electing delegates to the next stage. It typically takes several months to complete, with various levels of elections leading to the selection of national convention delegates. Voter turnout in caucuses tends to be lower than in primaries, with Iowa having a turnout rate of 6.5% in 2012. Iowa is the best-known caucus state, but Democrats and Republicans use different designs to elect national convention delegates. For Republicans, the caucus process involves a simple presidential preference vote in February, leading to the selection of delegates for county, congressional, and state conventions where national convention delegates are chosen. All national convention delegates are unbound. Democrats use a conventional caucus system with precinct, county, and congressional caucuses. In primaries, there are two types: preference and direct election. Preference primary allows voters to mark ballot for a presidential candidate. Direct election primary includes a presidential preference vote and instructs voters to mark ballot for delegates pledged to a candidate. Delegates may be awarded on a proportional basis in direct primary elections. In preference primary states, voters mark their presidential preferences, but the results may not affect the selection of national convention delegates. Some states have separate caucus/convention processes to choose national convention delegates, regardless of primary results. Kentucky Republicans will have a presidential primary on May 17, 2016, but delegates will be selected through a separate caucus process starting on March 5. The number of delegates each presidential candidate receives is usually determined by primary results. Front-loading is the trend of scheduling primaries and caucuses near the beginning of the nominating season, influenced by the prominence of New Hampshire and Iowa in the process. The trend was partially reversed in 2012 and 2016 due to cooperation between major parties. Democrats' rules changes post-1968 encouraged primaries, but initially did not result in a more front-loaded calendar. Efforts to schedule early events in other states to attract candidate attention or promote a \"native son\" only resulted in Iowa and New Hampshire scheduling even earlier events over time to protect their \"first-in-the-nation\" status. The two states benefit economically from hosting presidential campaigns before voting begins, with New Hampshire estimated to reap $264 million in 2012. Other states did not challenge Iowa and New Hampshire's claim to being first, and Democrats continued to revise their rules after each election. New Hampshire's claim to being first in the presidential election cycle was solidified in 1980 when the Democratic party adopted a timing rule exempting Iowa and New Hampshire from the party's sanctioned \"window\" for delegate selection events. The creation of the southern Super Tuesday regional primary in 1988 accelerated the trend of \"front-loading\" primaries, organized by the Southern Legislative Conference to increase the impact of southern voters. Iowa and New Hampshire continued to vote in February until the 2000 election. The 2000 election saw Iowa holding caucuses on January 24 and New Hampshire holding its primary on February 1. Many states not exempt from the Democratic Party window scheduled primaries or caucuses early, leading to a front-loaded nominating season with clusters of state contests dominating the early calendar. This limited the testing period for voters to evaluate candidates before the contest was perceived as over. The 2012 election aimed to reduce front-loading, with Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada early in the calendar. Unlike 2008, there were fewer contests in February, with March set as the starting point for nonexempt states. The 2016 primary calendar starts in February for the first time since 1996, with Iowa on February 1 and New Hampshire on February 9. The largest number of contests will be held on March 1, reducing the front-loading problem. The New Hampshire primary has been significant since 1952 when voters could mark their presidential candidate preference on the ballot. The New Hampshire primary, significant since 1952, allows voters to mark their presidential candidate preference. The preference vote boosted Eisenhower and Kefauver's candidacies, capturing media attention. New Hampshire's primary status is protected by legislation, ensuring it precedes similar contests. The secretary of state has the power to change the date of the New Hampshire primary to precede similar contests by seven days. The national Democratic Party has protected New Hampshire's frontrunner status since 1980. Iowa caucuses gained prominence in 1972 due to reforms aimed at democratizing the delegate selection process after the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Iowa caucuses in 1972 marked the beginning of the nominating season under new rules set by the McGovern/Fraser Commission. Senator Edmund Muskie, the presumed frontrunner, was unexpectedly challenged by Senator George McGovern, who finished third. Despite Muskie leading in Iowa, his campaign fell short of media expectations, while McGovern's early organization in the state paid off. Muskie's victory in the New Hampshire primary was not enough to regain momentum, leading to McGovern eventually winning the nomination. The 1972 Iowa caucuses marked the start of the nominating season with new rules. Senator Muskie, the frontrunner, was challenged by Senator McGovern and eventually lost the nomination to McGovern, who then lost to President Nixon in the general election. The presidential nominating process is complex, relying on national and state party rules and election laws. Democrats follow specific rules for delegate selection at the national convention. The Rules and Bylaws Committee must approve delegate selection plans before the presidential election. Republicans have general parameters set by the national party, but delegate selection details vary by state. State election laws affect primaries and caucuses, determining if they are open to all voters or restricted to registered party voters. Minnesota and Iowa have codified rules for their caucus traditions. The rules for primaries and caucuses in Minnesota and Iowa are codified in state election law, while most caucus procedures depend on state party rules. New Republican party rules changes for the 2012 presidential primary season impacted the 2016 election, including timing rules for primaries and caucuses and the use of proportional allocation of delegates. Governor Romney secured the nomination after the May 29 Texas primary. The 2008 convention created the \"Temporary Delegate Selection Committee\" to review delegate selection procedures and make recommendations to the RNC. In 2010, the RNC approved a window for holding delegate selection events similar to the Democratic Party's rule. Rule 16 of The Rules of the Republican Party now prohibits delegate selection events before the first Tuesday in March, with exceptions for Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. This marked the first timing rule for Republican delegate selection events. The RNC implemented Rule 16 to require states to allocate delegates proportionally before March 16, with a threshold not exceeding 20%. This aims to delay winner-take-all systems until later in March, providing guidance on implementing proportional allocation methods. District level delegates may still be awarded on a winner-take-all basis, exempting four states from the timing rule. Democrats have two categories of delegates, pledged and unpledged, with pledged delegates required to express a candidate preference. Pledged district delegates are elected at a district level, while at-large delegates are elected statewide. Add-on delegates, representing party leaders, are calculated based on total base delegates for a state. The allocation process for Democratic delegates is based on a formula using state Democratic vote history and electoral college votes. Delegates are assigned to states based on the allocation factor, with base delegates divided between district level and at-large delegates. For example, South Dakota has an allocation factor of .00399, resulting in 13 delegates. South Dakota is allocated 20 delegates, with 2 alternates, for a total delegation of 22. Delegates are divided into base delegates and at-large delegates, with some being pledged delegates required to express a presidential candidate preference. The state also has unpledged delegates, including superdelegates. In presidential elections, American Samoa, Democrats Abroad, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands participate. Democrats allocate at-large delegates to each entity based on DNC members, Members of Congress, and Democratic Governors. Republicans assign 10 at-large delegates to each state and 3 delegates per congressional district. Bonus delegates are given to states that supported the Republican nominee in the previous election. Additionally, states with Republican governors, majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, or state legislature also receive delegates. In the presidential election, delegates are allocated based on various criteria such as DNC members, Members of Congress, and Democratic Governors for Democrats. Republicans assign delegates based on at-large and congressional district representation, with bonus delegates given to states that supported the Republican nominee in the previous election. The number of delegates needed to secure the nomination is 2,382 for Democrats and 1,236 for Republicans in 2016. Delegates for Democrats are allocated based on rank-and-file voters' preferences in primary or caucus events, with pledged delegates reflecting the voters' presidential preference. Those seeking to be elected as delegates must declare their candidate preference at all levels of the process. The national party requires a proportional allocation of delegates according to the presidential candidate. The allocation of delegates in primaries and caucuses is based on voter preferences, with a minimum threshold of 15% to receive delegates. Republican rules for selecting national convention delegates vary, with some contests using proportional allocation while others use winner-take-all. The delegation's binding to primary and caucus results at the national convention is a measure of their impact. Some state parties bind national convention delegates based on caucus or primary results. Delegates who are unbound can vote for any candidate. Republican Party rules require statewide votes to allocate and bind delegates in a proportional or winner-take-all manner, except for those elected directly by primary voters. Delegates to the national convention are elected, selected, allocated, or bound according to Republican Party rules of a state or state laws. Automatic delegates are also included in the process. Delegates to the national convention, including automatic delegates, are bound according to Republican Party rules or state laws. Rules for binding delegates vary by state, with some states binding the entire delegation while others have a mix of bound and unbound delegates. Democrats are required to reflect the sentiments of those who elected them at the national convention. The Republican Party designates automatic delegates, while the term \"superdelegate\" is used for unpledged Democratic Party delegates. Superdelegates are not required to disclose their presidential candidate choice. Superdelegates in the Democratic Party are automatically designated and do not have to reveal their presidential candidate preference. They include party leaders, members of Congress, governors, and former Presidents. Superdelegates were added after the 1980 election to balance the influence of rank and file party voters in evaluating presidential candidates. Superdelegates were introduced in 1984 by Democrats to balance the influence of party voters in evaluating presidential candidates. They made up nearly 20% of all delegates in 2008, 14% in 2012, and will be a little more than 16% in the upcoming Democratic convention. Republicans have automatic delegates making up less than 7% of their national convention, with some states binding them to vote as part of the delegation. In 2008, superdelegates gained attention as they could have decided the contest between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama secured victory with 2,201 delegates compared to Clinton's 1,896. Superdelegates, comprising nearly 20% of all delegates, played a crucial role in the nomination process. Presidential primaries are typically funded by states, with occasional \"firehouse\" primaries held by state parties for greater control over delegate selection. The 2012 election cycle faced issues with the cost of separate presidential primaries in some states, leading to cancellations. Caucuses are organized and funded by state parties. From 1976 to 2012, major parties received funds from the taxpayer checkoff program for national nominating conventions. The program was eliminated in 2014. Additional federal funds have been allocated for convention security since 2004. Since 2004, additional federal funds have been provided for convention security, coordinated by the U.S. Secret Service with state and local law enforcement. Congress allocated $100 million for convention security in 2004, 2008, and 2012, with $50 million for each convention in each year. National nominating conventions showcase nominees, party leaders, and positions to a TV audience, but no longer choose the nominee. Speculation arose about a contested convention at the 2012 Republican convention, which did not happen. There is speculation that the 2016 Republican nomination could be contested if a candidate does not secure a majority of delegates. The role of national conventions in recent decades has been to ratify party nominees rather than select them. Elections without an incumbent President running are usually resolved early in the primary season, while elections with an incumbent President are typically concluded without much drama. Incumbents can be endangered under certain conditions, as seen in the 1976 Republican and 1980 Democratic conventions, but ultimately prevailed. The national conventions in recent decades have evolved into media events with a television-friendly format. Delegates ratify the nominee choice in a roll call vote, while party leaders and rising stars give speeches targeted at viewers. The conventions may feature keynote speakers, a vice presidential candidate speech, and a nominee's speech to kick off the general election campaign. Brokered conventions, where delegates vote multiple times, were more common in the mid-20th century. In recent decades, national conventions have become media events with a TV-friendly format. Delegates ratify the nominee choice in a roll call vote, while party leaders and rising stars give speeches. Brokered conventions, where delegates vote multiple times, were more common in the mid-20th century. The competitive 2012 Republican primaries raised speculation of no candidate amassing a majority of delegates before the convention, but Governor Willard M. Romney claimed a majority following the Texas primary on May 19. In 2016, speculation arose about an extended primary season and a brokered Republican convention due to varying state party rules on delegate binding. The results of some contests do not determine delegate selection, making the process unpredictable. A candidate needs 1,236 of 2,470 total delegates for the Republican nomination, while 2,382 of 4,763 total delegates are needed for the Democratic nomination. Party nominees have typically been decided before conventions since the late 1960s. The primary reason for nominees being decided before conventions is the widespread adoption of primaries to choose delegates. This was seen as more democratic than the previous caucus/convention method controlled by party leaders. Reforms were made after the 1968 Democratic convention to democratize the nominating process. The Democratic Party reformed its delegate selection process after the 1968 convention in Chicago. The McGovern/Fraser Commission recommended democratizing the process, leading to changes in delegate selection rules. The use of primaries increased, shifting the nominee selection from national conventions to the primary season. Multi-ballot conventions became rare, with the last one in 1952 for the Democrats. The 1924 Democratic convention famously took 103 ballots and 17 days to nominate John W. Davis of New York. Deadlocked conventions were more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, often requiring multiple votes to choose the nominee. Republicans will meet in Cleveland, OH, from July 18-21, and Democrats will meet in Philadelphia, PA from July 26-28."
