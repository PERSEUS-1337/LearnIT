    "content": "The chemical industry in the United States employs over 790,000 workers and serves both domestic and global markets. Congressional policymakers have long been concerned about the potential harm to public health and the environment from hazardous chemical releases, leading to legislative proposals to reduce risks. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress focused on the security risks posed by hazardous chemicals, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes in 2006, with reaffirmation in 2014. In 2007, DHS established risk-based performance standards known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) for security purposes. DHS has faced challenges in implementing these regulations, with delays in facility inspections. As of February 2015, 1,526 site security plans had been inspected and approved, covering 43% of regulated facilities. The report provides information on DHS CFATS implementation, authorized by Congress in 2006 for chemical facility security. DHS established risk-based performance standards and required vulnerability assessments and site security plans. Regulations apply to facilities deemed high risk by the Secretary. The DHS CFATS program, authorized by Congress in 2006, applies risk-based standards to chemical facilities deemed high risk by the Secretary. The program includes vulnerability assessments, site security plans, audits, inspections, and enforcement measures for non-compliance. In 2007, the DHS issued the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The DHS CFATS program, established in 2007, applies risk-based standards to chemical facilities deemed high risk by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Facilities with specified quantities of 322 chemicals of interest must submit information via the \"Top-Screen\" process to determine their risk status. High-risk facilities are subject to the CFATS program and assigned to one of four risk-based tiers with varying performance-based requirements. High-risk facilities under the DHS CFATS program must develop a vulnerability assessment and security plan, submit them to DHS, and implement the plan. The vulnerability assessment determines the facility's risk-based tier and serves as a baseline for assessing the security plan's effectiveness. The security plan must address specific modes of terrorist attack and meet risk-based performance standards provided by DHS. High-risk facilities may use alternative security programs to develop vulnerability assessments and site security plans, as long as they meet DHS standards. DHS may disapprove plans that do not meet standards, but not based on specific measures. Facilities can request further adjudication of disapprovals. Once approved, facilities must implement their security plans, which are monitored by DHS for compliance. The DHS monitors facility compliance with site security plans, requiring updates every two to three years based on facility tiers. Congress granted new authority to DHS in 2014 to regulate security at chemical facilities, supporting existing regulations. The CFATS regulation involves a multistep process of facility information submission and DHS approval. The CFATS regulation involves a multistep process of facility information submission and DHS approval, including submitting a Top Screen for facilities with chemicals of interest above a certain threshold. Facilities then receive a preliminary tier assignment and must submit a Security Vulnerability Assessment for final tier determination by the CFATS Program. The CFATS Program determines a facility's final tier assignment and requires the submission of a Site Security Plan (SSP) to DHS for review by the Infrastructure Security Compliance Division (ISCD). ISCD conducts an authorization inspection after issuing a letter of authorization for the SSP, making a final determination on compliance. After ISCD conducts an authorization inspection and issues a letter of authorization for the SSP, it determines if the facility's SSP meets risk-based performance standards. If approved, the facility must implement the SSP provisions; if not, ISCD may issue a notice of deficiency and require resubmission. Facilities have 45 days for modifications, with ISCD reviewing the resubmitted SSP for approval. In some cases, technical consultation may be needed for SSP revision. The DHS authorizes an SSP for facilities under CFATS, conducts authorization and compliance inspections, and approves the SSP if satisfactory. Compliance inspections occur periodically based on risk tier assignment. The analysis of DHS data identifies challenges in assigning facilities to risk tiers. The DHS assigns facilities to risk tiers, authorizes site security plans, inspects and approves them, and conducts compliance inspections. Facilities with chemicals above a threshold must report through Top-Screen. Initially, 7,000 high-risk facilities were identified, with over 48,000 submissions from 36,000 facilities since then. Some submissions are from facilities that had not previously submitted. The DHS has seen a decrease in high-risk facilities to approximately 3,600, as some facilities have reduced their chemical holdings below threshold levels. This could be due to voluntary reductions or facility closures. The agency may reassess facility assignments based on new submissions, which include facilities that have increased their chemical holdings or have not previously complied with regulations. The DHS has reduced the number of high-risk facilities to around 3,600, with some facilities lowering their chemical holdings. There is a delay in identifying facilities as high-risk after submitting Top-Screen information, with an average wait time of 4.8 months. This delay may lead to an increase in Top-Screen submissions without a corresponding rise in regulated facilities. The increasing number of Top-Screen submissions suggests that some existing facilities are submitting multiple times, posing a challenge for DHS in reviewing risk tiers. DHS assigns preliminary and final risk tiers to facilities based on Top-Screen data and security vulnerability assessments. Between 14% and 25% of high-risk facilities lack a final tier assignment at any given time. Between 14% and 25% of high-risk facilities lack a final tier assignment at any given time, with 63% of these facilities being in Tier 4. Reasons for this include new facilities joining the program, incomplete security assessments, and facilities requesting new tiering determinations. Facilities in certain categories, such as those with aboveground gasoline storage tanks, have had their compliance timelines indefinitely extended by DHS. Approximately 405 of these facilities are preliminarily high-risk. Oversight challenges arise for facilities awaiting final risk-tier assignments, as DHS requires the site security planning process to begin only after the final assignment. This delay in final tier assignments has been a trend, with 14-25% of high-risk facilities lacking a final tier assignment at any given time. The DHS has faced challenges in authorizing site security plans for regulated facilities, with a slight downward trend in final tier assignments over time. This may be due to the dynamic nature of the pool of CFATS-regulated facilities. The DHS has been working on improving the authorization process through internal reviews. Figure 4 shows the number of authorized site security plans, with the first plan authorized in May 2010. Since May 2010, DHS has authorized approximately 2,646 site security plans, with an increased rate of authorization since August 2012. The focus has been on Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities, with 74% of regulated facilities having an authorized SSP as of February 2015. Comparison suggests all SSPs may be authorized within a year. Figure 5 illustrates trajectories for completing SSP authorization within 1, 2, 5, or 10 years. DHS would need to authorize an average of 76 site security plans monthly to complete within 1 year, 38 monthly within 2 years, 15 monthly within 5 years, and 8 monthly within 10 years. DHS authorized an average of 132 SSPs per month from February 2014 to February 2015, with an increasing trend. The past rate of authorization may not predict future performance. The DHS may increase the rate of SSP authorization, especially for Tier 3 and Tier 4 facilities. As DHS gains more experience, the process could become more efficient. However, challenges may arise if future SSPs have lower quality or if other activities compete for resources. Many facilities without an authorized SSP also lack a final tier assignment, delaying the submission of SSPs. Resolving the security of these facilities may be a pressing challenge. The DHS resumed authorization inspections in July 2012 and had completed more than 100 inspections by April 2013. The approval of site security plans did not match the inspection rate, indicating a rough parallel between authorized SSPs and inspections. The authorization inspection rate is commensurate with the rate of SSP authorization. There is no indication of a backlog of authorized SSPs waiting for inspections. If the SSP authorization rate increases, a backlog could develop, which may require increased inspection capability. The rate of authorization inspections aligns with SSP approvals, but not all inspections lead to approval. Some facilities may be disapproved or require multiple inspections to address challenges. As of February 2015, 57% of regulated facilities lack an approved SSP, and it will likely take more than a year for DHS to finish inspecting and approving existing SSPs. If the total number of facilities remains unchanged, DHS would need to approve an average of 169 site security plans monthly to approve all within 1 year. The DHS has generally increased the rate of approving site security plans over time, with an average of 93 approvals per month between August 2014 and February 2015. The Government Accountability Office estimated in April 2013 that it could take DHS from seven to nine years to complete reviews and approvals for SSPs from facilities with a final risk tier. The rate of approvals has increased since then, and DHS may be able to increase the rate further. Tier 3 and Tier 4 facilities may be simpler to inspect. The DHS has increased the rate of approving site security plans over time, with an average of 93 approvals per month between August 2014 and February 2015. DHS may face challenges in maintaining the current rate of approvals if future SSPs have lower quality or pose particular challenges. Compliance inspections for facilities started in September 2013, with 31 inspections by May 2014 and 61 by December 2014. GAO estimated in April 2013 that full regulatory implementation for existing facilities would take 8 to 10 years. The DHS may need 8 to 10 years for full regulatory implementation. Compliance inspections have not increased significantly. Facilities in Tiers 1 and 2 must update their Top-Screen, SVA, and SSP every two years, while Tiers 3 and 4 must do so every three years. DHS would need to perform approximately 108 inspections monthly to approve updated SSPs. The DHS is considering updating facilities' Top-Screen information on a regular schedule, reducing the number of inspections needed for approval. Assessing the future performance of the CFATS program is challenging due to potential external and internal events that could impact program performance. Significant reforms to the program began in 2012, with limited data available on performance since then. Increased efficiencies or compliance by regulated facilities could alter program performance. The CFATS program has historically struggled to meet deadlines for securing high-risk chemical facilities. Despite progress in authorizing Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans, there are still challenges in approving facilities without a final tier assignment. It is estimated to take around two more years to inspect authorized facilities and approve SSPs, not accounting for compliance inspections. Approximately 25% of CFATS regulated facilities are still in preliminary risk-tier assignment, leading to delays in compliance. The DHS has adjusted its target metrics to approve over 90% of Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities with authorized SSPs by the end of FY2014. The CFATS system operates slower than needed to process all facilities within compliance inspection timeframes. The DHS faces challenges in processing all regulated facilities within the compliance inspection timeframe due to the rate of authorization inspections. Multiple inspections may be necessary for some facilities, limiting overall compliance with the CFATS program. Analysis shows fluctuations in the number of authorization inspections and SSP approvals, indicating delays in approval processes. Increasing authorization inspection capacity may reveal secondary capacity gaps in processing SSP approvals, as the number of inspections and approvals roughly parallel each other. This suggests that DHS may not have additional capacity in the authorization inspection process. Delays in processing information and issuing approval letters could be highlighted by increasing inspection capacity. Increasing authorization inspection capacity may reveal secondary capacity gaps in processing SSP approvals. Inspection capacity can be increased by employing more inspectors or through process improvements. The lack of additional inspection capacity may lead to challenges once compliance inspections start. The same inspector cadre is responsible for both compliance and authorization inspections, which could reduce staff availability for authorization inspections. Delays in processing approvals could be highlighted by increasing inspection capacity. To avoid developing a backlog in facility resubmissions, DHS would need to perform 108 inspections per month, higher than the current rate. Allowing facilities to not resubmit updated SVAs and SSPs could lower the inspection rate. As DHS gains experience in compliance inspections, future performance projections may become more confident."
