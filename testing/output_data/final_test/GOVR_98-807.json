    "content": "Making a false statement is a federal crime under various circumstances, including perjury and false certifications. Subornation of perjury, inducing someone to commit perjury, is also a federal crime. Conspiracy to commit these crimes is a separate federal offense. Additionally, a defendant may face enhanced sentencing for making false statements during an investigation or trial. The federal law prohibits false statements, concealment, or false documentation within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Section 1001 of the law applies to the executive, judicial, and legislative branches, outlining the consequences for making false statements. Section 1001 of federal law prohibits falsifying information within the jurisdiction of the US government. Violators face fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years, or up to 8 years for terrorism-related offenses. Offenses related to sexual abuse or exploitation carry specific penalties. The term of imprisonment under Section 1001 of federal law can be up to 8 years for offenses related to sexual abuse or exploitation. The term \"whoever\" includes corporations, and the jurisdiction of a federal entity involves matters under the authority of a federal agency. The term \"within the jurisdiction\" of a federal entity refers to matters under the authority of a federal agency or department. Courts have interpreted this to include false statements made to state, local, or private entities involving federal funds or regulations. Section 1001(b) provides an exception for false statements made in judicial proceedings, including false statements of indigency filed by a defendant. Section 1001(b) provides an exception for false statements made in judicial proceedings, including false statements of indigency filed by a defendant seeking the appointment of counsel. The application of Section 1001 to matters within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch is limited to false statements in legislative branch administration and congressional investigations. The government must prove that the defendant acted \"knowingly and willfully\" in making false statements. The prosecution for a violation of Section 1001 requires proof of materiality, as well as the defendant's knowledge or election not to know that the statement, omission, or documentation was false and presented with intent to deceive. The offense must be committed \"knowingly and willfully,\" with the knowledge that it was unlawful. The prosecution does not need to prove that the defendant knew the conduct involved a federal entity or intended to defraud it. Prosecution for a violation of Section 1001 requires proof of materiality, as does conviction for perjury. The statement must have a \"natural tendency to influence\" without the need to show actual influence. Section 1001's false statement element includes concealment, false statements, and false writings. Prosecutions for concealment must also prove a duty not to conceal. A federal employee's ethical obligation to disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption does not support a conviction under Section 1001(a)(1). Section 1001(a)(2) applies to making false statements, requiring knowledge of the falsehood. Defenses are limited, with no safe harbor for recantation. Earlier versions of the law recognized an \"exculpatory no\" doctrine. The Supreme Court rejected the \"exculpatory no\" doctrine under Section 1001, stating that the law does not allow exceptions for false denials. Section 1001(a)(3) covers written false statements and requires proof of a false, material, knowingly made statement. Defendants have struggled to establish an exculpatory no doctrine under the current language of the law. Perjury involves making a false, material statement knowingly and willfully before a federal entity. There are three primary perjury statutes, each involving statements or writings made under oath. Section 1621 outlines two offenses for testimony and written statements before a competent tribunal or officer. Perjury involves making false statements under oath, punishable by fines or imprisonment up to five years. The Supreme Court defines perjury as giving false testimony willfully, not due to confusion or mistake. The term \"whoever\" includes individuals who commit perjury. Corporations can be held liable for crimes committed by their employees, officers, or agents for their benefit. Conviction for perjury under Section 1621(1) requires knowingly making false statements under oath, presented willfully as deliberate material falsification. Perjury under Section 1621(1) involves deliberate material falsification under oath, with the prosecution needing to prove the defendant believed their statement was untrue. The Supreme Court clarified that even if testimony is technically true but deceptive, it does not constitute perjury. Perjury under Section 1621(1) involves deliberate material falsification under oath, with the prosecution needing to prove the defendant believed their statement was untrue. The Supreme Court clarified that even if testimony is technically true but deceptive, it does not constitute perjury. Bronston's conviction was overturned as his evasive but technically true answer did not qualify as perjury. The Court suggests that perjury under Section 1621(1) may not be based on an ambiguous question. Lower federal appellate courts have varying interpretations on the issue of ambiguity in perjury cases. The line between permissible and impermissible ambiguity is difficult to define, with some courts finding it impossible to pinpoint. The Two-Witness Rule in Section 1621(1) is also discussed. The Two-Witness Rule in Section 1621(1) requires compliance with the common law rule to establish the falsity of a statement. Conviction compels the government to provide testimony from two independent witnesses or one witness with corroborating evidence. Materiality is essential for perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(1), where a false statement must be material in a criminal prosecution. A false statement is considered material in a criminal prosecution for perjury under \u00a7 1621(a) if it can influence the tribunal on the issue before it, regardless of whether the decisionmaker was deceived by it. Defenses such as recantation or contemporaneous correction do not absolve the crime of perjury, as the offense is completed when the false statement is presented to the tribunal. Section 1621(2) was added in 1976 to eliminate the need for an oath in certain certifications and declarations. Perjury is defined as willfully subscribing to a false statement under penalty of perjury, with penalties including fines or imprisonment. Section 1621(2) applies to individuals and entities, serving as an enforcement mechanism for Section 1746 which requires written statements under oath. Section 1623 was enacted by Congress to simplify perjury prosecutions and enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries. Unlike Section 1621, it allows for a conviction in cases of mutually inconsistent declarations without requiring proof of falsehood, includes a limited recantation defense, eliminates the two-witness rule, and has a different approach to perjury prosecutions. Section 1623 simplifies perjury prosecutions by allowing convictions for mutually inconsistent declarations without proof of falsehood, includes a limited recantation defense, and eliminates the two-witness rule. It employs a \"knowing\" mens rea standard and carries penalties of fines or imprisonment for false material declarations in federal court proceedings. To prove perjury, the government must establish that the defendant knowingly made a false material declaration under oath in a proceeding before a court or grand jury of the United States. Corporations can be held liable for the crimes of their employees, officers, or agents committed for the benefit of the corporation. While corporations have been convicted for false statements under Section 1001, they are rarely convicted under Section 1623, which covers false statements made under oath. Section 1623 covers false statements under oath or \"under penalty of perjury\" in proceedings before a court or grand jury of the United States. This includes various proceedings in criminal cases and civil litigation, but not interviews in preparation for judicial hearings. The Supreme Court's ruling that a misleading but technically true statement cannot support a perjury conviction applies to Section 1623 as well. Perjury under Section 1623 requires a knowingly false statement, not confusion or mistake. Ambiguity in a question cannot lead to perjury, but if understood, a false answer can still result in a conviction. Perjury can be based on two inconsistent statements made under oath. Perjury under Section 1623 requires a knowingly false statement, not confusion or mistake. Conviction requires two statements made under oath to be inherently contradictory. The two-witness rule can be abrogated by statute, and materiality is a key element in perjury cases. Perjury's materiality is crucial, defined as having the potential to influence decision-making. In civil cases, the definition varies between leading to discoverable evidence or affecting the outcome of the suit. In grand jury proceedings, the focus is on articulating the false statement's impact. The courts have described circumstances where false testimony may be considered material, even if it did not divert the decision-maker. The \"perjury trap\" doctrine arises when a witness is called solely to elicit perjurious testimony, making the statement not material. This doctrine does not prevent prosecution in most cases, as the government can usually provide a valid reason for the grand jury's inquiries. Other subsections of Section 1623 aim to overcome common law obstacles to successful perjury prosecutions. Subsection 1623(d) provides a defense in perjury prosecutions if the false declaration is admitted to be false in the same court or grand jury proceeding, and it has not substantially affected the proceeding or been exposed as false. The courts require specific and thorough repudiation of the false testimony for the defense to be valid. There is some disagreement on whether the defense can be denied if either the substantial impact or imminent exposure conditions are met. Most courts have concluded that the defense in perjury prosecutions can be denied if either the false declaration substantially affected the proceeding or if it has been exposed as false. However, a recent appellate decision suggested that the defense may still be available if the witness can show a lack of an intervening adverse impact or likely exposure of the false statement. Additionally, relatively contemporaneous corrections of earlier statements may prevent a conviction for perjury by negating the inference of knowingly presenting false testimony. Section 1622 prohibits inducing another to commit perjury. Subornation of perjury involves inducing another to commit perjury, which carries a penalty of fines or imprisonment for up to five years. The crime requires proof of the induced false statement and knowledge of its falsity. Subornation is not frequently prosecuted separately, as it can be charged as obstruction of justice under different statutes. Conspiracy under Section 371 outlaws conspiring to commit federal offenses, including perjury, subornation of perjury, and false statements. The agreement of two or more people to commit a federal crime and an affirmative act in furtherance of the scheme are required. Offenders may be punished for conspiracy and the commission of the crime, with a maximum imprisonment of five years for each offense. Perjury and false statements can result in imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). These offenses can also enhance the sentence for other crimes under the obstruction of justice guideline. Federal sentencing is based on the calculation of sentencing ranges under the Sentencing Guidelines, with obstruction of justice being a factor in determining the offense level. The Sentencing Guidelines assign offense levels to sentencing ranges based on past crime history. Section 3C1.1 increases the offense level by 2 if the defendant obstructed justice related to the offense. This section is not meant to punish a defendant for exercising constitutional rights like denying guilt. The Sentencing Guidelines allow for an increase in offense level if the defendant obstructed justice. This enhancement applies if the defendant committed perjury during trial, with the court needing to find that the false testimony was willful and related to a material matter. The false statement must be material and intended to obstruct justice, even if not made under oath. False identification at the time of arrest only warrants a sentencing enhancement under the section when the deception significantly hinders the investigation or prosecution."
