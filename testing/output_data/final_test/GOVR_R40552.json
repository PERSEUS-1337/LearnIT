    "content": "Adults may go missing for various reasons, including personal choice, disabling conditions, natural disasters, or crimes like abduction. Unlike children, adults have the legal right to go missing, leading to limited assistance from law enforcement for families. Media attention on cases of missing adults, especially seniors with dementia, has prompted policymakers to consider expanding the federal government's role in recovery efforts. Congress has proposed legislation, such as H.R. 632, to assist in recovering vulnerable adults who go missing. At the start of the 111th Congress, legislation was passed in the House (H.R. 632) to establish a grant program for alert systems for vulnerable adults with disabilities. A similar bill (S. 557) was introduced in the Senate. The program is akin to the AMBER Alert system for missing children, with a focus on missing adults. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reviewed existing state alert systems in 11 states in response to congressional interest in alert systems for missing adults. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reviewed state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults in 11 states established since 2006. These systems are administered by local and/or state law enforcement agencies to alert entities and the public about missing vulnerable adults who may need assistance. The alerts are activated for high-risk groups, such as individuals with cognitive or mental impairments like Alzheimer's or developmental disabilities. This report provides an overview of the alert systems in these 11 states. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reviewed state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults in 11 states established since 2006. The report details the methods used to obtain data from states with alert systems and provides an overview of each state's alert systems, including legal authority, target population, administrative responsibility, training, activation process, coordination, costs, system use, and outcomes. The report also discusses issues for Congress to consider regarding the federal role in developing state alert systems for missing adults. Individuals can go missing for various reasons, including becoming lost or disoriented. Individuals can go missing for various reasons, including becoming lost or disoriented due to mental, cognitive, developmental, or physical impairments, natural disasters, or voluntary reasons such as escaping abuse or law enforcement. Persons with Alzheimer's disease and dementia are particularly vulnerable to missing episodes, with wandering behavior posing a significant danger. The aging population has led to interest in establishing systems to address missing vulnerable adults. According to the Alzheimer's Association, nearly 50% of those who wander risk serious illness or death if not found within 24 hours. The federal government has been increasingly involved in preventing and recovering missing adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease and dementia through programs like Safe Return funded by the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert grant. Safe Return, administered by the Alzheimer's Association, provides MedicAlert identification for memory-impaired individuals with a 24-hour emergency response number. The program offers support to caregivers and trains law enforcement on Alzheimer's. Despite lapsed authorization, Congress continues to fund the program with appropriations ranging from $800,000 to $2 million annually. The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization of 2009 aims to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization of 2009, introduced on February 10, 2009, aims to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It would reauthorize the program through FY2016, expand it to include locating other missing elderly individuals, and establish a preference for awarding grants to national nonprofit organizations with a direct link to patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Funding for the Kristen's Act grant program ranged from $1.7 million in FY2002 to $150,000 in subsequent years. The Kristen's Act grant program funding decreased from $1.7 million in FY2002 to $150,000 in FY2006, with the National Center for Missing Adults as the sole recipient. The program assists in locating missing individuals with various circumstances and expired in FY2006. Legislation is being considered to reauthorize the grant at $4 million annually from FY2010 to FY2020. The Kristen's Act grant program funding decreased from $1.7 million in FY2002 to $150,000 in FY2006. Legislation is being considered to reauthorize the grant at $4 million annually from FY2010 to FY2020. H.R. 632 would also establish a national \"Silver Alert communications network\" to assist in finding missing seniors. The bill H.R. 632 aims to establish a national \"Silver Alert communications network\" to assist in finding missing seniors. It includes developing alert programs, protocols, and an advisory group. Additionally, it authorizes appropriations for grants to states to enhance Silver Alert plans. The focus is on state alert systems for missing adults, with CRS gathering detailed information to inform Congress. The alert systems aim to rapidly disseminate information about missing persons to law enforcement and the public. Safe Return, a federally funded program, maintains a database of individuals at risk of wandering due to Alzheimer's and dementia. It can provide information on missing individuals to aid in search efforts, regardless of whether the state has an alert system in place. CRS identified 11 states with alert systems for missing adults: Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia. CRS identified 11 states with alert systems for missing adults and reviewed their authorizing legislation, executive orders, and regulations to obtain program data. They also contacted state officials to gather additional information based on key areas of interest expressed by some Members of Congress. The alert system for missing adults in 11 states was established through state statutes, executive orders, and regulations. Key details include target population characteristics, administrative responsibility, training for stakeholders, activation process criteria, interstate coordination protocols, and alert duration. Between September 2008 and March 2009, questions were submitted to state officials regarding the missing adult alert system in 11 states. Responses varied in detail, with some states providing more information than others. Alert systems for missing vulnerable adults are a recent but growing initiative. Among the 11 states with active alert systems, Colorado and Georgia were the first to implement one in 2006. Since then, nine other states have adopted similar systems. Eight of the states are in the South, one in the West, one in the Midwest, and one in the Northeast. See Figure 1 for a map of the 11 states with missing adult alert systems. Table 1 provides an overview of the alert systems in these states. State alert systems for missing vulnerable adults are authorized by law or executive order in 11 states. These systems involve a cooperative effort among state and local law enforcement agencies to disseminate information about missing persons through various media outlets. Legislation to establish these alert systems was often prompted by public attention surrounding missing person investigations involving adults. State alert systems for missing vulnerable adults are authorized in 11 states, prompted by public attention surrounding missing person investigations involving adults with mental or cognitive impairment. These systems are modeled after AMBER Alert systems for abducted children, with similar administration and training provided to law enforcement agencies. Target populations for alert systems vary among states, with some including age as a factor for activation. The process for activating an alert for missing vulnerable adults involves factors like age, cognitive or physical disabilities, and mental health impairments. Local law enforcement agencies take missing persons reports, and alerts are activated based on criteria set by local and state entities. Verification of impairments can be done by family members, caregivers, or guardians. Different states have varying designated entities responsible for activating alerts. In some states, a lead agency activates alerts for missing persons, while others have localized models where local law enforcement can activate alerts regionally. The responsible entity disseminates the missing person's information to law enforcement and media outlets to alert the public. States coordinate alerts with other states to recover individuals who may have crossed state lines. There is generally no additional cost to implement the alert system. Some states reported no additional cost to implement the alert system, with costs absorbed by existing budgets. Data from states estimated annual operating costs between $40,000 and $182,000. Ten out of 11 states used the alert system, with varying numbers of alerts activated since implementation. Most states reported outcomes of recovery efforts for missing vulnerable adults, with individuals mostly found recovered but some found deceased. States provided varying levels of detail about their alert systems, including legal authority, target population, administrative responsibility, training, process for activating alerts, and interstate coordination. Missing adult alert systems were recent initiatives in several states, with two states implementing systems in 2006, four in 2007, and five in 2008. States often developed their alert systems in response to similar efforts in neighboring states. Most states derived authority for their alert systems from enacted laws, with a few exceptions. Oklahoma, for example, created a Silver Alert program through a non-binding resolution. In 2006, Oklahoma established a Silver Alert program through a non-binding resolution, followed by Florida in 2008. The impetus for these alert systems often stemmed from public attention on missing adults with mental or cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. Other states cited the need to focus on the senior population and advocacy efforts for seniors as reasons for implementing alert systems. The implementation of alert systems for missing seniors is a priority in various states, with a focus on aiding in the search and recovery of seniors with cognitive impairment within the critical first few hours of their disappearance. State alert systems target vulnerable populations of older adults with cognitive, physical, or developmental disabilities. Some states exclusively target older adults in their alert systems. In some states, alert systems exclusively target older adults with cognitive impairment, while others can be activated for adults of any age with disabilities. Some states also activate alerts for individuals with physical or severe mental health conditions. Oklahoma, Georgia, and Delaware have specific criteria for activating alerts for adults with disabilities. Delaware's alert system targets missing suicidal persons, with some states requiring verification of cognitive impairment or disability for activating an alert. Reporting parties attest to the missing person's condition, which is then verified by investigating officers. Some states require further documentation, such as prescription medications or medical records, to verify an individual's condition. In Texas, documentation from a medical or mental health provider is required for a missing senior's condition. Colorado verifies impaired mental condition through a statement signed by family members. Georgia allows verification of cognitive impairment or disability by family members, caregivers, or guardians without additional documentation. Statewide agencies in six states administer alert systems and activate alerts at the request of local law enforcement agencies. For example, in North Carolina, the Center for Missing Persons activates alerts. In Texas, the Governor's Division of Emergency Management activates alerts for missing seniors, while local law enforcement agencies can also issue alerts locally or regionally. Ohio and Texas have steering committees guiding alert systems, comprised of local and state law enforcement agencies. In other states like Delaware, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Virginia, local law enforcement leads in administering and activating alerts, with the option to seek assistance from state agencies for wider dissemination or coordination. In Virginia, local law enforcement agencies administer and activate alerts locally, with the option to request assistance from the Virginia State Police for regional or statewide alerts. In Oklahoma, local law enforcement agencies can seek help from the state's Department of Public Safety to disseminate alerts statewide. Florida's Silver Alert Plan is managed by the state Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse within the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, with alerts activated when requested by local law enforcement for multiple regions via electronic highway signs. The Silver Alert system in Florida is managed by the state Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse within the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Alerts can be activated for multiple regions via electronic highway signs and the FLDE website. Local law enforcement agencies may also activate a Silver Alert locally based on their own criteria. Coordination between missing adult alert systems and AMBER Alert systems in 11 states showed that both systems are often administered by the same state-level agency and may share a budget. AMBER Alert systems are voluntary partnerships to alert the public when a child is abducted and believed to be in grave danger. States often have their missing adult alert systems and AMBER Alert systems managed by the same agency and sometimes share a budget. Some states model their missing adult alert systems after their AMBER Alert systems and use similar communication mechanisms to disseminate information to the public. However, AMBER Alerts are typically more widely distributed than alerts for missing adults in some states. For example, in Texas, both types of alerts are distributed through various media channels, billboards, and lottery machines. AMBER Alerts in some states are distributed through various channels including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Secondary Notification System and the Emergency Alert System (EAS) technology. EAS technology is used in at least seven states to report AMBER Alerts to the public with the cooperation of broadcast radio, television, and cable stations. The FCC manages broadcaster involvement in EAS for AMBER Alerts. States provide training for law enforcement and the public on their alert systems for missing vulnerable adults. There is wide variation among states in training and activation procedures for alerts regarding missing vulnerable adults. Some states, like Colorado and Virginia, provide training to law enforcement and the public, while others, like Florida, lack funding for training. Kentucky and Oklahoma officials are uncertain if local law enforcement received training. Among states, there is variation in the process for activating alerts for vulnerable adults. The process includes filing a missing persons report, criteria for activation, communication mechanisms, target audiences, and alert duration. In some states, specific individuals must file the report to activate the alert system. For example, in Georgia, a family member or caretaker must file the report. In some states, specific individuals such as a custodian or medical personnel must file a missing person's report to activate an alert. Other states allow any individual to file a report. Once filed, the local law enforcement agency reviews the report to determine if criteria for activating an alert have been met, including age or disability criteria. States have specific criteria for activating alerts for missing vulnerable adults, including unknown whereabouts, credible threat to health or safety, sufficient information for law enforcement, and residency in the state. Most states require the person's status to be unknown before activating an alert, with local law enforcement verifying the disappearance in some cases. North Carolina is an exception in not requiring the disappearance to pose a credible threat. In most states, alerts for missing vulnerable adults are activated based on specific criteria, such as credible threat to health or safety, sufficient information for law enforcement, and residency in the state. Some states require the person's status to be unknown before activating an alert, with additional criteria varying by state. For example, Texas and Georgia require sufficient information to disseminate to the public, while Delaware requires the missing person to be a resident of the state. Florida, North Carolina, and Rhode Island have specific criteria for activating missing person alerts. Florida requires activation of a local or regional alert first, along with a description of a vehicle. North Carolina mandates reporting to the North Carolina Center for Missing Persons, while Rhode Island requires the person to have last been seen in the state. Six states have a lead agency responsible for activating alerts. In six states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Rhode Island, specific criteria are in place for activating missing person alerts. The lead state agency is responsible for activating alerts in these states, while in the remaining five states, local law enforcement agencies can seek assistance from the state agency to disseminate alerts. For example, in Oklahoma, alerts are activated locally and disseminated statewide through the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunication System. States have various methods for disseminating information about missing persons, including television, radio, newsprint, lottery terminals, electronic highway signs, and trucker alert systems. Descriptive information can be shared electronically through email or fax. Some states use systems like NLETS or OLETS to send out alerts to law enforcement agencies. Electronic highway signs are used automatically in some states, while others use them on a case-by-case basis. Florida and North Carolina have a reverse 911 system for alerts. Florida and North Carolina utilize a reverse 911 system to disseminate information about missing persons, including contact details for law enforcement. Information is also shared through lottery terminals and electronic highway signs, with media outlets encouraged to provide public awareness. Some states have specific time constraints for activating and maintaining alerts for missing persons. For example, Texas requires alerts to be activated within 72 hours of a person's disappearance. Five states have reported time limits for active alerts, with Oklahoma and Texas setting alerts for up to 24 hours. Texas also allows for extensions upon request from the requesting agency. In Virginia, alerts can be activated for up to 12 hours, while Ohio evaluates the need for the alert after 48 hours and every 24 hours thereafter. Florida's electronic highway signs are activated for six hours, but information on the FDLE website can be posted indefinitely. Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Rhode Island do not have a time limit for alert activation, allowing stakeholders discretion on the duration. Media outlets in Rhode Island and Delaware determine how long to broadcast the alert, while Georgia discontinues the alert at the family's discretion. North Carolina does not have a set time period for alert activation. Most states have mechanisms in place for coordinating with other states in recovering missing individuals who may have crossed state lines. They would use national or interstate law enforcement communication systems like NLETS or disseminate information to fusion centers in nearby states. Ohio officials mentioned utilizing these systems for sharing information about missing adults. Ohio, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island officials are coordinating with other states' law enforcement agencies to share information on missing persons. Some states face challenges in reporting missing residents due to the lack of alert systems. States without alert systems may rely on law enforcement to be on the lookout for missing individuals. Four states have requested others to activate alerts for missing residents. Texas officials stated that a missing senior from another state would not meet the alert criteria unless domiciled in Texas. Local law enforcement agencies can still coordinate public notifications for non-residents without state assistance. Regional alert networks are available in four regions to help recover missing adults. Nearly all states require reports of missing persons to be entered into the NCIC Missing Person File, used by law enforcement agencies nationwide. States also provided data on costs related to carrying out alerts for missing adults, with cost estimates varying. Cost estimates for operating missing adult alert systems annually ranged from $40,000 to $182,000. Some states mentioned that costs were absorbed by the budget for the AMBER Alert system. Administrative costs for both AMBER and missing adult alerts include salaries of on-call staff, with an approximate cost of $40,000 per fiscal year. Some states do not have specific funds set aside for adult alert systems. The cost of operating missing adult alert systems annually ranges from $40,000 to $182,000. Some states absorb these costs within their budgets for AMBER Alerts. Administrative costs include salaries of on-call staff, approximately $40,000 per fiscal year. Some states do not have dedicated funds for adult alert systems. North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Texas provided detailed cost information for their alert systems. The cost of operating missing adult alert systems annually ranges from $40,000 to $182,000. Texas incurs approximately $182,000 annually for their alert system, funded through grants and internal expenses. Virginia's state police spent $30,000 for implementing the program in FY2007. Virginia spent $30,000 to implement the alert system, with ongoing annual costs estimated at $25,000. State officials project a need for $50,000 for technology implementation and $45,000 annually for training and support. Delaware, Rhode Island, and Oklahoma reported no state costs for their alert systems, as they are primarily managed by local law enforcement agencies. Kentucky did not provide cost information. Most states reported activating alerts for missing individuals, with varying numbers activated. Kentucky and Oklahoma estimated fewer than 10 alerts each. States mentioned factors affecting the number of alerts activated, such as population size and alert criteria. Most states activated alerts for missing individuals, with varying numbers reported. The majority of missing individuals were found alive, but some were found deceased. Florida's missing adult alert is only activated for individuals who are driving, while North Carolina had alerts for individuals who had wandered away or traveled by different means. Ohio also had alerts activated for individuals. In Ohio, 64.3% of the individuals with alerts were driving. In Texas, 81.7% were driving and 18.3% wandered. In Virginia, 14.3% were believed to be driving. Florida and Georgia reported where missing individuals were found, with most found near their home county. Georgia had individuals found within their home city or county. Six states reported that alerts aided in the recovery of missing individuals. In Florida, 21.9% of missing adults were recovered based on tips from drivers who saw alerts on highways. Georgia reported that the alert helped recover all but one individual alive. Texas saw 27.3% of senior citizens recovered out of 77 alerts activated. Rhode Island's one alert did not assist in recovery. North Carolina officials stated that alerts did not directly aid in recovery efforts. The report describes findings from 11 states with active alert systems for missing adults, showing a patchwork of systems with varying target populations and procedures. These systems target vulnerable adults with cognitive, mental, or physical impairments. Virginia officials reported that the alert did not help recover seven missing individuals. The report highlights the patchwork of alert systems for missing adults in 11 states, involving local or state law enforcement agencies. Congress may consider a federal role in developing state alert systems, such as providing funding for expansion and setting minimum guidelines. The federal government could assist in developing minimum guidelines for a missing adult alert system and provide technical support to states. Establishing a uniform network of state alert systems could aid in coordination across state lines. The federal government could also help states collect data on the efficacy of alert systems and disseminate best practices for implementation. Issues for Congress to consider include autonomy, creating a uniform identity, and training. The use of alert systems for missing adults raises issues such as autonomy, individual rights, and coordination across states. Unlike the AMBER Alert program for missing children, it is not a crime for adults to go missing. States have specific criteria to activate a missing adult alert, targeting vulnerable individuals with credible threats to their health and safety. Timing is crucial in activating these alerts. Timing is crucial in activating alerts for missing adults with cognitive or mental impairment. Concerns about privacy often outweigh the benefits of filing a missing person's report. States like Texas ensure that alerts are based on legitimate reports of missing vulnerable seniors. The popularity of state AMBER Alert systems has led to the development of missing adult alerts, named Senior, Silver, or Gold Alerts in some states. These alerts aim to create a \"brand\" identity similar to AMBER Alerts, but the terms may not accurately describe the target population for these alert systems. Some states have alert systems named Senior, Silver, or Gold Alerts for missing adults aged 18 to 59, aiming to create a distinct brand identity similar to AMBER Alerts. A uniform name for state alert systems could help in coordinating alerts and educating stakeholders. Some states have alert systems for missing adults, training law enforcement agencies on procedures for activating alerts. However, uniform training at the local level is unclear. Advocates suggest specific training on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia to aid in identifying and recovering missing individuals. Pending legislation (H.R. 632 and S. 557) aims to assist states in developing missing adult alert systems, including training for law enforcement on identifying and communicating with individuals with mental or cognitive impairments. Coordination between states with alert systems may pose challenges. The federal government could assist in coordinating efforts for missing individuals crossing state lines and developing formal agreements for interstate alerts, modeled after the AMBER Alert program. This program provides training on recovering abducted children and how different jurisdictions can work together. State and local law enforcement agencies, along with other stakeholders, have opportunities to meet and exchange ideas at conferences and training exercises to facilitate coordination. The DOJ has issued guidelines for activating AMBER Alerts to encourage adoption of similar criteria. Proposed legislation aims to establish a network of state missing adult alert systems for greater coordination, including the creation of a Silver Alert Coordinator position at the DOJ. The effectiveness of state alert systems in recovering missing vulnerable adults is unclear. The effectiveness of state alert systems in recovering missing vulnerable adults is uncertain, as some states lack detailed outcome data on activated alerts. Only three states could confirm that the alerts aided in the recovery of missing individuals. Funding constraints and administrative challenges hinder the tracking of alert outcomes, with the need for additional technology and resources. The federal government could potentially assist in developing a more coordinated approach. The federal government could assist in developing guidelines for data collection and outcomes measures for state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults. Some states are concerned about overuse of alerts desensitizing the public, especially in relation to AMBER Alerts. Officials in Virginia and Oklahoma suggest that the Emergency Alert System should not be used for missing adult alerts to prevent desensitization to AMBER Alerts. The EAS is considered best for missing children as they are often taken from their communities, while missing vulnerable adults tend to wander close to where they were last seen. Some states are concerned about using law enforcement resources for missing vulnerable adults and question if activating alert systems is the best use of resources. States may choose to activate alerts regionally or statewide for vulnerable adults believed to be driving. Alert systems for vulnerable adults can help in locating missing individuals who wander away from home due to cognitive impairment. Some law enforcement agencies have integrated programs like the Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return to assist in these cases. Electronic monitoring services are also being provided for individuals at risk of going missing close to home. Proposed legislation aims to authorize funding for grants to states and local governments for programs providing electronic monitoring services to elderly individuals to assist in their recovery if they go missing. State alert systems for missing vulnerable persons could benefit from engaging community social services agencies or partnering with state units on aging and local area agencies on aging to prevent future wandering behavior through caregiver assessments. Caregiver assessments aim to identify support services for family caregivers, such as back-up support and respite care. These assessments also gather information on the caregiver's health, willingness to provide care, and training needs. Resources like the National Family Caregiver Support Program and state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults can provide assistance. The emerging trend of alert systems for missing vulnerable adults in 11 states has prompted Congress to consider legislation for federal assistance. States model their programs after the AMBER Alert system, targeting individuals with cognitive or mental impairments. There is variation in target populations and activation procedures. Federal efforts could aid in interstate coordination for missing persons crossing state lines and provide minimum guidelines and technical assistance to states. State AMBER Alerts systems provide minimum guidelines, technical assistance, and training to states for locating missing vulnerable adults. Coordination with federal, state, and local initiatives can also assist in recovery efforts. Family caregivers may benefit from referral to programs like the Safe Return Program or Project Lifesaver International. These alert systems educate caregivers about the needs of vulnerable adults and link them to community resources to prevent future wandering behavior."
