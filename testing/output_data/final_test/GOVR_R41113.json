    "content": "In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2499, introduced by Representative Pedro Pierluisi, aimed to establish procedures for determining Puerto Rico's political status through a two-stage plebiscite. If Puerto Rico were to vote for statehood as outlined in H.R. 2499, it would likely gain representation in Congress with five Representatives and two Senators. This could potentially impact the size of the House of Representatives, leading to adjustments in its composition. The House size is typically increased when new states are admitted to the union. Exceptions include states formed from other states like Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia. When Alaska and Hawaii were admitted, the House size temporarily increased to 437. This differed from past practices where new states' representation was added to the apportionment totals. The apportionment act of 1911 anticipated the admission of Arizona and New Mexico by increasing the House size to 435 seats. In 1960, Alaska and Hawaii's admission temporarily increased the House size to 437 seats. After the 1960 census, Alaska received one seat and Hawaii received two seats in the reestablished 435-seat House. Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Missouri each received one less seat than they would have if the House size had been increased to 438. If Puerto Rico were admitted to statehood, Congress would have options for handling the new state's representation. If Puerto Rico were to be given statehood, Congress would have three options for handling the new state's representation: subtract seats from other states, temporarily increase the House size, or permanently increase the House size. The first option has only been done when new states were formed from existing states, the second option was used for Alaska and Hawaii, and the third option was commonly used in the 19th century. If Puerto Rico were to become the 51st state, the apportionment of the House of Representatives would need to be adjusted. The total figure for overseas military and federal employees and their dependents in the 2010 apportionment process was 1,039,648 for all 50 states. When considering Puerto Rico as the 51st state, its population would impact the apportionment process for the House of Representatives. Without Puerto Rican statehood, California, Florida, Minnesota, Texas, and Washington would have received the last five seats. Puerto Rico would be allocated five seats if included as a state, given its population of almost 4 million people. The comparison between the current allocation of seats based on the 2000 Census population and the allocation of the 2012 seats based on the 2010 apportionment population figures shows that several states will gain seats, including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, and Utah. Florida and Texas would also gain seats, but the number would change if Puerto Rico became a state. Washington would gain a seat, but its allocation would remain the same if Puerto Rico became a state. Illinois and Iowa are not mentioned in the comparison. If Puerto Rico becomes a state, several states will lose House seats, including Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. New York and Ohio will each lose two seats. California and Minnesota will lose a seat if Puerto Rico becomes a state. The total number of Representatives in the House of Representatives is traditionally set at 435 members, which may prevent an increase in the House size if Puerto Rico is admitted to statehood. The Constitution requires that Representatives be apportioned among states based on their respective populations. District boundaries cannot cross state lines, and the House size can be adjusted within certain limits set by law. The House could potentially have up to 10,430 Members if Puerto Rico becomes a state. Statehood for Puerto Rico could increase the House size to 10,430 Members, but the House has remained at 435 since 1910. Temporary increases occurred in 1960 for Alaska and Hawaii's admission as states, but reverted to 435 in 1963. Arguments against permanent increases focus on efficiency and cost, while proponents suggest a larger House could function effectively like other legislative bodies. The average population of a congressional district has more than doubled since 1940, increasing from 303,827 to 710,767 in 2010. Advocates for increasing the House size argue that larger memberships can provide better representation for minorities in Congress."
