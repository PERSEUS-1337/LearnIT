    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Expanding Broadcast Ownership Opportunities Act of 2017\". The Federal Communications Commission aims to promote diversity in ownership and viewpoints in the broadcasting industry. Data from 2014 reveals a lack of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations, with less than 6% of TV stations and less than 3% of radio stations being owned by women or minorities. The Commission should collect data and make recommendations to increase diversity. During the 17 years of the minority tax certificate program at the Commission, 287 certificates were issued for radio stations and 40 for television stations. The Commission can support minority- and women-owned entrants in the broadcasting industry through an incubator program where existing licensees assist new entrants. SEC. 3. FCC REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The Commission is required to submit biennial reports to Congress with recommendations on increasing the number of minority- and women-owned broadcast stations, as well as reporting the total number of such stations based on data reported to the Commission. SEC. 344 of the Communications Act of 1934 introduces a tax certificate program to promote ownership of broadcast stations by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The Commission will issue a certificate to a person selling an interest in a broadcast station to socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, as described in the subsection. The Commission will issue a certificate for the sale of an interest in a broadcast station owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with rules including a limit on the value of the sale and a minimum holding period for ownership by disadvantaged individuals. The FCC will issue certificates for sales involving socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with limits on the number or value of sales and requirements for participation in station management. An annual report to Congress will detail the sales covered. The term 'owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals' for a broadcast station means it is majority owned by such individuals, with management controlled by them. A socially and economically disadvantaged individual is someone who is both socially and economically disadvantaged. The Commission presumes socially and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, other minorities, and women. Socially disadvantaged individuals have faced prejudice or bias due to their group identity. Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals who struggle to compete in the free market. The Commission will adopt rules to implement section 344 of the Communications Act of 1934, which aims to support socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the free enterprise system by providing them with improved capital and credit opportunities. Additionally, a report on program expansion will be submitted to Congress within 6 years of the enactment of this Act. The Commission will submit a report to Congress on whether to expand section 344 of the Communications Act of 1934 beyond broadcast stations to cover other regulated entities. The report will assess the nexus between diversity of ownership/control of broadcast stations and diversity of viewpoint, specifically focusing on minority and women ownership/control. The report will evaluate expanding section 344 of the Communications Act of 1934 to include other regulated entities. It will analyze the relationship between ownership/control diversity of broadcast stations and viewpoint diversity, with a focus on minority and women ownership/control. \"PART V--SALE OF INTEREST IN CERTAIN BROADCAST STATIONS. SEC. 1071. NONRECOGNITION OF GAIN OR LOSS FROM SALE OF INTEREST IN CERTAIN BROADCAST STATIONS.\" If a sale of an interest in a broadcast station is certified by the FCC under section 344 of the Communications Act of 1934, it can be treated as an involuntary conversion under section 1033. Stock of a corporation operating a broadcast station is considered similar property. Any gain not covered by section 1033 can be used to reduce basis for determining gain or loss on a sale subject to depreciation. The taxpayer can make an election under section 167 for depreciation reduction, with the amount determined by the Secretary's regulations. The election is binding for the year of sale and subsequent years. If gain or loss is not recognized in a sale under this section, and the taxpayer fails to meet FCC rules requirements, continued management is required. Under section 344(c) of the Communications Act of 1934, there will be no nonrecognition of gain or loss for the taxpayer in a sale, except that any recognized gain or loss will be accounted for when the taxpayer no longer fulfills requirements. Basis for property acquired in such a sale is determined under section 1033(b). Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 1071 of the Communications Act of 1934 addresses the nonrecognition of gain or loss from the sale of interests in certain broadcast stations. The effective date for these amendments is 1 year after the enactment of the Act, with a sunset provision after 16 years. Additionally, there is an Incubator Pilot Program outlined in Section 5. The Commission will establish a program to grant waivers to broadcast station licensees for ownership interests by disadvantaged individuals. A report on the program's effectiveness must be submitted to Congress within 4 years, and waivers cannot be granted after 5 years. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"broadcast station,\" \"Commission,\" and \"owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\""
