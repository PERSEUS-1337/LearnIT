    "content": "The Employee Benefits Protection Act of 2003 may be cited as the \"Employee Benefits Protection Act.\" Congress finds that mislabeling or relabeling employees to exclude them from benefit plans frustrates the intent of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Employees are wrongly denied benefits when classified as temporary, part-time, leased, agency, staffing firm, or independent contractors. Recognizing their true employment status would make them eligible for pension and welfare benefit plans offered to other employees doing the same work for the same employer. Employers mislabel employees to avoid providing benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. They use staffing firms or contractor labels to disguise the true employment relationship, violating the law. Employers are adding provisions to exclude mislabeled employees from benefit plans, violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Employees are often required to sign documents waiving their right to participate in plans, which also violates the Act. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is violated when employees are required to sign waivers limiting their rights to bring lawsuits. The Act aims to prevent employees from being excluded from benefit plans due to mislabeling or reclassification of their employment status. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL STANDARDS RELATING TO MINIMUM PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include all service for the employer as an employee under common law, regardless of payment arrangements. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include all service for the employer as an employee under common law, regardless of payment arrangements. A pension plan shall not exclude any person who performs the same work from participation. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include all service for the employer as an employee under common law, regardless of payment arrangements. A pension plan shall not exclude any person who performs the same work from participation, irrespective of their employment category. Individuals who do not meet minimum service period or age requirements specified in the plan can still be excluded. SEC. 4. OBJECTIVE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN PLAN INSTRUMENTS. Section 402 of ERISA is amended to require employee benefit plans to have objective eligibility criteria that are uniform, based on reasonable job classifications, and stated in the plan instrument. Employers are prohibited from excluding any person from participation in the plan. The amended Section 402 of ERISA mandates that employee benefit plans must have uniform eligibility criteria based on reasonable job classifications. Employers cannot exclude employees from participation based on their status as temporary, leased, agency, or contractor workers. The amended Section 402 of ERISA ensures that all employees, including temporary, leased, agency, or contractor workers, must be treated as participants in the employee benefit plan without discrimination based on their employment status. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include additional relief options for enforcement and administration of trusts, compensatory relief, and remedial relief. This includes providing restitution and appropriate relief to employees who have been excluded or misclassified in violation of specific sections. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new relief options for enforcement and administration of trusts, compensatory relief, and remedial relief. This includes allowing participants or beneficiaries to seek judicial declaration on the validity of waivers of rights under the act or a plan. Additionally, expert fees and costs may be awarded to a prevailing party in actions brought to enforce specific sections. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to provide new relief options for enforcement and administration of trusts, including allowing participants or beneficiaries to seek judicial declaration on the validity of waivers of rights. In an action under this section, if the court finds violations of section 510, relief may include enjoining unlawful conduct, ordering affirmative action like reinstatement or back pay. SEC. 6. WAIVERS. Section 502 of ERISA is amended to prohibit waiving rights under the title, including the right to maintain a civil action, through unauthorized agreements. Exceptions are made for arbitration agreements entered into after a dispute arises or under a collective bargaining agreement. Waivers related to misclassification in an employee benefit plan are not considered knowing and voluntary. The amendment to Section 502 of ERISA prohibits waiving rights under the title, including the right to bring a civil action, through unauthorized agreements. The burden of proving the validity of a waiver related to misclassification in an employee benefit plan falls on the asserting party. Waivers cannot impose limitations affecting an individual's right to challenge them in court. The amendment to Section 502 of ERISA prohibits waiving rights under the title, including the right to bring a civil action, through unauthorized agreements. No individual bringing a civil action is required to return any consideration received for a waiver before filing the action. Waivers cannot interfere with the Secretary's enforcement rights or impede a person's participation in an investigation or proceeding. SEC. 7. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The amendments made by this Act apply to plan years starting on or after January 1, 2004, with a special rule for collectively bargained plans to adjust the effective date based on collective bargaining agreement termination dates. The Act requires plan amendments to be made by the first plan year starting on or after January 1, 2005. The plan must operate in good faith compliance with the Act's requirements before that date, and the plan amendment must apply retroactively."
