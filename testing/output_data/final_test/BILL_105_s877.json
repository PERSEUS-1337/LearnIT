    "content": "The \"NOAA Corps Disestablishment Act\" aims to disestablish the Corps of Commissioned Officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ensure fair treatment of retired officers and employees, and retain professional skills needed for NOAA's mission. The NOAA Corps Disestablishment Act requires conversion-eligible officers to be converted into civilian service by the disestablishment date. Prior service in the NOAA Corps and other uniformed services will be credited for retirement benefits and annuity eligibility. All officers converted to civilian service under the NOAA Corps Disestablishment Act are eligible for retirement benefits, annuity, disability retirement, health insurance, and other entitlements as outlined in the relevant sections of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 4. CONVERSION BENEFIT. The Secretary will provide a conversion benefit to eligible officers transitioning to civilian service, calculated based on specific criteria. Officers leaving NOAA within 180 days of conversion must repay a portion of the benefit. Additionally, officers can contribute to the Thrift Savings Fund despite set time periods. Each conversion-eligible officer transitioning to civilian service can immediately elect to contribute to the Thrift Savings Fund under specific time periods outlined in the regulations. SEC. 5. LEAVE AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT LIABILITY. SEC. 5. LEAVE AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT LIABILITY. (a) Credit for Unused Leave.--Each officer in the NOAA Corps on the date of enactment of this Act, converted or appointed to civilian service without a break, receives credit for unused leave transferred to the employing agency. No lump-sum payment is made for transferred leave. If an officer receives a lump-sum payment for unused leave and is employed in civilian service before the payment period expires, they must refund the compensation amount to the agency. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will receive an appropriation to cover the supplemental liability created by granting service credit to NOAA Corps officers converted into civilian service. The amount credited to the Fund must be determined by the Office of Personnel Management and completed by September 30, 1998. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL CIVILIAN POSITIONS. The Under Secretary will establish necessary civilian positions in NOAA by the disestablishment date and may fill them using customary recruitment procedures. Vacancy announcements will be provided to retired officers and current Department of Commerce employees. SEC. 7. DISESTABLISHMENT. The Commissioned Officers Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is disestablished as of October 1, 1997. Officers in the NOAA Corps on the date of enactment of this Act are eligible for noncompetitive appointments in the Department of Commerce for a specified period based on their years of service. Upon appointment or conversion under this Act, officers in the NOAA Corps with at least 1 year of service will acquire competitive status. Those with 3 years of service will receive career appointments, while others will receive career-conditional appointments with their time in the Corps credited towards career tenure. Annual fitness reports will serve as performance ratings for civilian service appointments, allowing for additional service credit based on performance. SEC. 8. SEPARATION AND RETIREMENT OF OFFICERS. Each conversion-eligible officer not signing a conversion agreement will be involuntarily separated from the NOAA Corps by September 30, 1997. Officers eligible to retire by the same date will be retired under existing laws. Involuntarily separated officers will receive separation pay as per the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned Officers Act of 1948. The cap on separation pay is repealed. Amendments were made to remove certain monetary limits in subsections (b)(1)(B) and (b)(2), as well as subsection (d)(2). Retirement eligibility based on unused leave allows officers with 15 years of service to retire if their total active service and unused leave equals or exceeds 15 years. An officer described in the previous paragraph is ineligible for civilian service conversion, does not qualify as a \"conversion-eligible officer,\" will be retired under a specific subsection, will receive retirement pay based on certain criteria, and will not receive a lump sum payment for leave used for retirement qualification. SEC. 9. STATUS OF OFFICERS AND ADMINISTRATION OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS. On the disestablishment date, active service in the NOAA Corps and its predecessors will be considered as service in the Navy for retired officers. The Department of Defense will administer retired pay, survivor benefits, and other entitlements for retired officers of the former NOAA Corps. Retired officers of the former NOAA Corps and its predecessors, along with their dependents and survivors, will receive retired pay and survivor benefits transferred to the Secretary of the Navy. The Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund will cover these payments. Any additional benefits, such as health and dental care, will be funded by appropriations to the Department of Defense. Effective on the disestablishment date, the Department of Defense will handle the administration of retired pay for these officers. The amendment to Section 1461(b) of title 10, United States Code, includes provisions for retired officers of the former Commissioned Officers Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to receive retired pay. This pay will be administered by the Department of Defense after the disestablishment of the NOAA Corps. The term 'armed forces' now includes the former Commissioned Officers Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its predecessors. The Secretary is required to transfer records to the Secretary of the Navy and inform retired members of the former NOAA Corps about the changes. On the disestablishment date, active service of an officer in the NOAA Corps and its predecessors, including retired officers, will be treated as active duty in a uniformed service as per applicable law. SEC. 10. DISABILITY DETERMINATIONS. The Secretary of Commerce will make final determinations on the cases of NOAA Corps officers on the temporary disabled retired list based on physical examinations. If the physical disability still exists, the officer will be retired or separated accordingly. Upon final determination under subsection (a), if an officer is deemed fit for duty, they may be converted to civilian service with a signed agreement or retired/separated in accordance with section 8. SEC. 11. AMENDMENTS AND REPEALS. Amendments to the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned Officers Act of 1948 include redesignating subsections and removing references to section 8. Several provisions of law are repealed upon disestablishment, including the Act of 1948 and other related acts. The Act of December 3, 1942, and other related acts are listed, along with provisions for continuing application of benefits for NOAA Corps personnel. SEC. 12. IMPLEMENTING AUTHORITIES. The Secretary of NOAA has the authority to establish, eliminate, or reorganize any office within NOAA as needed to fulfill the purposes of the Act. A report on these actions must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of enactment. SEC. 13. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as Conversion Agreement, Conversion Eligible Officer, disestablishment date, NOAA, and NOAA Corps. The Act defines key terms related to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including NOAA Corps, Predecessors, Secretary, and Under Secretary."
