    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"End Oil Speculation Act of 2008\". Congress finds that skyrocketing energy prices in oil and gas are damaging the economy, foreign policy, and national security of the United States, with excessive speculation in petroleum futures markets being a major contributing factor. This issue harkens back to the early 20th century when speculators traded commodities at the expense of farmers and families, leading to the enactment of the Commodities Exchange Act and the establishment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Commodities Exchange Act and the establishment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were designed to ensure fraud-free futures markets, limit speculative trading, and promote legitimate hedging of physical commercial products. The Commission achieved this through rules requiring trading information disclosure and restricting speculative activities. Excessive speculation in petroleum futures markets has led to soaring oil and gas prices, with experts estimating manipulation or speculation accounting for 30 to 50 percent of price increases. Speculators, rather than commercial parties seeking to hedge, make up as much as 70 percent of trading in these markets. Excessive speculation in petroleum futures markets has led to soaring oil and gas prices, with speculators accounting for a significant portion of trading. The speculation is fueled by actions of the Commission, technology changes, and threats to move trading to unregulated overseas markets. Restoring the markets to their original purpose of legitimate hedge trading involving commercial parties is crucial. The Commission has the authority to regulate petroleum futures markets to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation. A broad investigation is being conducted to determine any improper activities in the crude markets. The Commission's investigation into crude markets is a good start, but more action is needed quickly. Elimination of manipulation and excessive speculation as the cause of high oil and gas prices is addressed in Section 3. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to address manipulation and excessive speculation in petroleum futures markets to control high oil and gas prices. The Commission is tasked with investigating, regulating, and making rules to achieve this goal. The Oil Speculation Act of 2008 distinguishes between legitimate hedge trading involving physical petroleum products for future delivery and all other trading. Legitimate hedge trading includes transactions by commercial producers and purchasers. The Oil Speculation Act of 2008 aims to ensure that all parties in the petroleum futures market are clearly identified for legitimate hedge trading or any other type of trading, while also addressing excessive speculation. The Oil Speculation Act of 2008 requires the Commission to review all actions related to petroleum futures market participants to prevent excessive speculation and ensure legitimate hedge trading. The Commission shall revoke or modify any prior actions related to trade, market participants, and activities that are not legitimate hedge trades, as required by the Oil Speculation Act of 2008. The Commission will consider revoking prior actions that limit position limits on non-legitimate hedge trading or the filing of reports on trades or traders. Different rules may apply to various situations. The Commission will modify margin requirements to discourage excessive speculation by setting at least a 25 percent margin for non-legitimate hedge trading, regardless of other laws or regulations. The Commission will regulate any person involved in petroleum futures trading unless they are in a market with similar regulations that are fully enforced. The Commission will disclose all trades and traders involved in petroleum futures trading to effectively regulate and monitor the activity. A working group of international regulators will develop uniform reporting and regulatory standards to protect the markets from speculation and manipulation. The Commission will submit reports to Congress on these matters. The Commission will provide detailed reports to Congress on its actions, including any recommended legislative changes, every 45 days. Additionally, a report on additional employees or resources will be submitted within 60 days of enactment. The Commission will use expedited procedures to carry out the necessary tasks, but if not used, a detailed report must be submitted to Congress within 30 days explaining the reasons. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act and its amendments take effect on June 24, 2008. Section 4a(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act applies to actions taken by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or any entity on or after this date. The Commission must implement these changes by December 31, 2008."
