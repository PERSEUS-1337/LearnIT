    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an agency within the Department of Defense responsible for military and civil works. Congress oversees USACE's civil works funding through authorization legislation and appropriations. This report focuses on USACE's annual discretionary appropriations for civil works activities, funded through Title I of Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. It covers the appropriations process, including the President's budget request, congressional appropriations, and the annual USACE work plan. The report also discusses trends and policy questions related to USACE's annual appropriations. USACE is led by a military Chief of Engineers and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASACW). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is overseen by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASACW) and is organized into eight divisions and 38 districts. USACE's civil works activities include water resource projects, environmental infrastructure assistance, regulation of certain activities, and remediation of sites involved in U.S. nuclear weapons development. Congress has provided appropriations ranging from $4.72 billion to $7.65 billion from FY2010 to FY2020. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives appropriations ranging from $4.72 billion to $7.65 billion annually. Unlike other federal funding programs, USACE's funds are primarily used for water resource projects like dams and navigation improvements. Congress allocates funding through annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts, with additional funding for environmental infrastructure, regulatory activities, and FUSRAP. In FY2020, USACE received $210 million for regulatory activities and $200 million for FUSRAP. Congress has authorized construction projects totaling $96 billion, including $32 billion of unfunded projects and $64 billion for rehabilitation and repair work. This backlog exceeds annual construction appropriations of $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion. Many projects in the backlog go unfunded for years. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) backlog projects receive no funds for years, with Congress providing emergency supplemental appropriations in response to floods. These funds are used for repairing damage, flood fighting, and constructing new flood control improvements. Nonfederal sponsors are required to share project costs, including operation and maintenance after construction. The annual appropriations process for US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects involves the President's budget request, congressional deliberation, and enactment of appropriations. Congress considers various factors to create an Energy and Water Development appropriations bill that includes USACE civil works activities. The congressional appropriations process for US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects involves the President's budget request, congressional deliberation, and enactment of appropriations. The Administration develops a USACE work plan after the Energy and Water Development bill is enacted, detailing additional funding for specific studies and projects. The President's budget request for USACE is typically at the account level, with detailed information provided in the agency's budget justification and a summary in the press book. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) publishes a summary of funding information in a document called the press book, detailing requested funding for projects in each state. The executive branch uses metrics like benefit-cost ratios to determine project inclusion in the President's request, with budget guidance using risk assessments for operation and maintenance investments. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) uses metrics like benefit-cost ratios to determine project inclusion in the President's budget request. Congress generally appropriates more funding for USACE civil works than requested by the President. Appropriations reports identify specific projects and programs to receive funds. Congress has provided the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) with over $47 billion for flood fighting and recovery from FY2006 to FY2019, including $4.6 billion for economic recovery in 2009. The majority of USACE's funding comes from the Construction and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts, with O&M accounting for a growing portion of annual appropriations. Since FY2006, Congress has allocated over $47 billion to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for flood fighting and recovery, with O&M accounting for a growing portion of annual appropriations. Funding for USACE projects increased from 37% in FY2006 to 53% in FY2018 and FY2019. Congress has shifted from funding specific projects to providing additional funding for specified categories of work within USACE budget accounts, with directions and limitations on the use of these funds. In FY2020, Congress provided $2.69 billion more than the President's request. In FY2020, Congress provided $2.69 billion more than the President's request for US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) activities. This additional funding was allocated for 26 categories of work in four budget accounts, including navigation activities, flood risk reduction activities, and other authorized project purposes. Congress also directed USACE to initiate a maximum of six new studies and six new construction projects using the FY2020-enacted funding. Additionally, since FY2012, Congress has required USACE to produce an annual work plan detailing how funds will be allocated at the project level. In FY2020, the explanatory statement accompanying the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) required USACE to issue a work plan within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The work plan includes specific additional funding allocations for each project, with descriptions of what USACE aims to accomplish with the funds. Investments in some USACE business lines increased while others decreased from FY2014 to FY2019. In FY2020, USACE was required to issue a work plan within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment, detailing funding allocations for projects. Investments in various business lines fluctuated from FY2014 to FY2019, with navigation funding increasing and environmental funding decreasing. Flood risk reduction funding remained consistent at around 30% of total annual appropriations. In FY2020, Congress provided funding for coastal storm damage reduction in annual appropriations acts. The explanatory statement urged a balance between inland and coastal projects. From FY2006 to FY2019, around $24 billion was allocated for construction of flood risk reduction projects, with almost $15 billion for flood fighting and repair. Annual appropriations for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) were generally less than $35 million and used for emergency response training. Congress has provided annual appropriations above the President's request for various categories of work since the earmark moratorium. The Administration follows congressional guidance to develop post-enactment agency work plans with limited project-level details. The Administration-developed work plans limit project-level details to a few sentences per project. Policy questions include the impact on congressional oversight and considerations for congressionally directed spending. USACE had a construction backlog of $96 billion in early FY2020, including projects with signed Chief's reports, dam modifications, and deferred maintenance. The Chief of Engineers signed 19 Chief's reports totaling over $9 billion in proposed construction since the last Water Resources Development Act. Congress appropriated $2.2 billion in FY2019 and $2.7 billion in FY2020 for construction, leading to a construction backlog of $96 billion in early FY2020. Congress may need to address the national demand for water resources. The backlog includes addressing the national demand for water resource infrastructure projects and stakeholder interest in new starts for USACE projects. The aging U.S. water infrastructure, with dams, locks, and levees over 50 years old, requires increased funding for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) activities. The O&M account has seen a rise from 37% to 53% of USACE annual appropriations, prompting the question of how Congress will address funding for O&M. Congress has altered Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund spending in relation to budget caps. Funding from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund has been reduced for some projects to allow more inland waterway construction projects. The Administration has proposed ways for waterway interests to contribute to construction and O&M costs. Policy questions include how Congress will address the inland waterways industry's interest in waterway construction funding. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund may not cover 50% of construction costs, leading to questions about funding for waterway construction. Changes to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund accounting could impact annual appropriations levels for flood risk reduction activities. Congress directs 30% of USACE's funds to flood risk reduction, with most going to riverine flood risk reduction. The FCCE account receives around $35 million annually for flood response and repair, primarily through supplemental appropriations. Policy questions include how funding for flood risk reduction activities will be addressed by Congress or the Administration. The funding for flood risk reduction activities, including inland and coastal projects, is a key concern. There has been a decrease in appropriations for USACE's environmental activities in recent years, potentially impacting aquatic ecosystem restoration efforts. Postponed investments may lead to missed opportunities for wetlands loss mitigation and related ecosystem benefits. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives funding for civil works activities at the account level, including Investigation, Construction, and Operation and Maintenance (O&M). Different business line activities are funded across these accounts, with some exclusive to specific accounts. The consequences of current funding levels on USACE restoration efforts are a potential policy concern. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives funding for civil works activities at the account level, including Investigation, Construction, and Operation and Maintenance (O&M). USACE publishes a press book that identifies how the President's budget requests are distributed across the agency's business lines. Congress has provided additional funding for specific categories of work within some USACE budget accounts. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives funding for civil works activities across different budget accounts. Congress directed USACE to allocate additional funds to projects meeting specific criteria within 26 categories. Some states received funding for larger projects, while others received funding for less extensive work. For example, the work plan allocated varying amounts of additional funding to different states under the Construction account."
