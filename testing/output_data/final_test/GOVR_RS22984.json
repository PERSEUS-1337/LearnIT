In 2007, China became the world's second-largest exporter, with net exports accounting for one-third of its GDP growth. The foreign trade sector employs over 80 million people, with 28 million in foreign-invested enterprises. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has played a crucial role in China's economic growth, with FDI flows reaching $75 billion in 2007 and $92 billion in 2008. The global economic slowdown is impacting China's export sector and industries dependent on FDI flows. China's economy slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, with GDP growth at 6.8% in Q4 2008 and 6.1% in Q1 2009. Analysts warn that growth below 8% could lead to social unrest due to job seekers. China's economic slowdown could have significant global implications as it was a major contributor to world economic growth in 2007. The Chinese economic slowdown could have global implications due to uncertainties surrounding its exposure to the global financial crisis, including the U.S. sub-prime mortgage problem. China's restrictions on capital outflows limit investments overseas, leading to most savings being invested domestically. This limits the exposure of Chinese private sector firms and investors to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. China's government entities, including the China Investment Corporation, state banks, and state-owned enterprises, are heavily invested in U.S. securities to earn interest on their large foreign exchange reserves. As of June 2009, China's reserves had grown to $2.1 trillion, with a significant portion invested in long-term Treasury debt, agency debt, corporate debt, equities, and short-term debt. The Treasury Department estimated China's holdings of U.S. securities at $1,205 billion as of June 2008. China's holdings of U.S. securities totaled $1,205 billion as of June 2008, with investments in LT U.S. agency securities, LT Treasury securities, LT equities, LT corporate securities, and ST debt. Troubled sub-prime mortgage backed securities would likely be included in the corporate securities category. China's holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities were substantial but less risky compared to other investments. China's holdings of U.S. securities totaled $1,205 billion as of June 2008, with investments in various categories including LT corporate securities. The Bank of China reported a $10.6 billion investment in asset-backed securities supported by U.S. sub-prime mortgages in 2006, with minimal exposure to troubled sub-prime U.S. mortgages. The Chinese government does not disclose detailed information on financial holdings, but some banks have reported on their exposure to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. The Bank of China reduced its holdings of U.S. sub-prime mortgage-backed securities from $10.6 billion in 2006 to $3.3 billion by September 2008. Fitch Ratings noted that the bank had the largest exposure among Asian financial institutions but could absorb any related losses. However, China's economy was affected by the global financial crisis due to its heavy reliance on trade and foreign direct investment. The global financial crisis heavily impacted China's economy, leading to a sharp slowdown in the real estate market, a significant drop in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, and a steep decline in trade and foreign direct investment. Exports, imports, and FDI flows all experienced substantial decreases, with millions of migrant workers losing their jobs. In response to the global financial crisis, China implemented various measures to maintain steady economic growth and prevent major fluctuations. These measures included cutting interest rates, boosting bank lending, stimulating consumer spending, restructuring industries, and increasing incomes for farmers and rural poor. China announced a 4 trillion yuan stimulus package in 2008, equivalent to 13.3% of its GDP, focused on infrastructure projects, affordable housing, rural development, environmental initiatives, health, education, and disaster recovery. This stimulus package was one of the largest globally in terms of spending levels and GDP percentage. The Chinese stimulus package announced in 2008 included support for 10 pillar industries to enhance their competitiveness through measures like tax cuts, industry subsidies, and financing support. The Chinese government announced plans to spend $124 billion over the next three years to create a universal health care system, extend basic coverage to most of the population by 2011, invest in public hospitals and training for doctors, boost rural incomes and spending levels, narrow the gap in living standards between rural and urban citizens, and offer rebates for home appliances to rural residents. The Chinese government is implementing various initiatives to boost rural development, including a 13% rebate for home appliances, targeted projects in education and infrastructure, and increased agricultural subsidies. A new rural pension program was launched in 2009 to cover 10% of counties initially. Positive economic indicators show GDP growth of 7.9% in the second quarter of 2009, with forecasts predicting further growth in the coming years. China's economy is showing signs of recovery with growth projections of 8.0% in 2009 and 10.1% in 2010. Various sectors have seen healthy growth, such as retail sales up 15%, urban fixed-asset investment up 32.9%, and industrial output up 7.5%. Real estate prices in major cities are also increasing. Despite concerns over long-term growth prospects, there are indicators of economic recovery in China. Many analysts are concerned about China's long-term growth prospects due to heavy reliance on bank lending and infrastructure projects rather than consumer spending. They worry about high levels of borrowing by local governments and state-owned enterprises leading to non-performing loans and heavy indebtedness. There are also fears that stimulus policies could hinder further economic reforms, with accusations of rolling back reforms by boosting industrial subsidies and trade barriers to support favored firms. China has imposed \"buy China\" regulations to support domestic firms and stimulate the economy. Analysts debate China's role in the global financial crisis, with speculation that China may increase purchases of U.S. securities to stabilize its trading partner. China's economic recovery may be short-lived without promoting greater domestic consumption and market-oriented reforms. China may increase purchases of U.S. securities, including Treasury securities, to help fund the U.S. government's stimulus efforts. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised China's confidence in U.S. Treasuries and urged continued support. This move could enhance China's image as a positive contributor to global economic stability. During the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, China provided financial aid to Thailand and pledged not to devalue its currency. However, China may be hesitant to increase investments in U.S. assets due to concerns about long-term economic benefits and the riskiness of some investments. A potential economic downturn in China could also lead to a focus on domestic investment rather than overseas. Critics question the wisdom of investing foreign exchange reserves in low-return U.S. government securities when there are significant development needs at home. China's holdings of U.S. securities at the end of 2008 were estimated to be over $1,000 per person in China, a significant figure for a country with a per capita GDP of about $3,190. Concerns have been raised about the safety of Chinese assets in the United States, leading to calls for replacing the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency. Critics question the wisdom of investing foreign exchange reserves in low-return U.S. government securities when there are significant development needs at home. China's large holdings of U.S. securities raise concerns about potential leverage against U.S. policies. Chinese officials have hinted at using their holdings to counter U.S. pressure on trade issues. In exchange for new purchases of U.S. debt, China may seek lower expectations for financial sector reforms and currency appreciation. China may use its reserves to buy stakes in distressed U.S. industries, raising concerns about technology transfer and political influence. U.S. policymakers have opposed Chinese firms acquiring ownership of U.S. companies in the past. President Obama and President Hu discussed these issues at the G-20 summit in London in 2009. During the global financial crisis in 2009, President Obama and President Hu pledged to support global trade, resist protectionism, and cooperate on economic issues under the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. The first round of the S&ED took place in Washington, D.C. in July 2009, where they agreed to continue cooperation on promoting balanced economic growth and financial reforms. The extent of the crisis's impact on U.S.-Chinese economic ties remains uncertain, with China blaming U.S. economic policies for the crisis, potentially weakening U.S. influence on economic issues with China. China's increased use of subsidies, \"buy China\" procurement regulations, and trade barriers may lead to pressure on the United States to enforce trade laws against unfair practices. Despite attempts to diversify foreign exchange holdings, China is unlikely to reduce reliance on the dollar or fully convert its currency in the near term. Chinese officials are concerned about the security of their dollar holdings in case of a sharp depreciation. This may prompt the government to focus on promoting domestic consumption and reducing dependence on trade and FDI for economic growth."
