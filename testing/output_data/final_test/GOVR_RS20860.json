    "content": "The NAAQSs under the Clean Air Act set maximum pollutant concentrations for outdoor air, including ozone and particulates. These standards determine emission limits for states to meet within their borders. Primary NAAQSs protect public health, while secondary NAAQSs protect public welfare. EPA must review and revise NAAQSs every 5 years. In 1997, stricter NAAQSs for ozone and particulate matter were implemented, leading to legal challenges due to perceived economic impacts. In response to legal challenges, two members of Congress filed as amici on the side of the challengers in a suit filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court ruled that EPA's promulgation of the NAAQSs had deficiencies and needed further consideration. The court found that EPA had too much discretion in setting the NAAQSs, violated the nondelegation doctrine, and could not consider implementation costs. EPA's revised primary NAAQS for ozone was also challenged due to being an eight-hour standard instead of the one-hour standard required by the Clean Air Act. In American Trucking, the Supreme Court gave EPA a unanimous victory on the two major issues in the case: consideration of costs, and nondelegation doctrine. The Court affirmed that EPA may not consider the costs of implementing new primary NAAQSs. The Supreme Court ruled that EPA cannot consider costs when setting new primary NAAQSs. The focus should solely be on health impacts to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. Industry's arguments about economic impacts were dismissed by the Court. The D.C. Circuit's majority opinion concluded that section 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act bars cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process. Additionally, the opinion embraced the \"nondelegation doctrine,\" a constitutional principle that limits Congress's ability to delegate legislative powers. The D.C. Circuit's majority opinion found that the EPA's interpretation of CAA section 109 was too vague, making it an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The court agreed with the factors used by the agency to assess air pollutants but stated that there was no clear principle for setting NAAQS. Ozone and particulates are non-threshold pollutants, causing health effects at any concentration above zero. The D.C. Circuit found EPA's interpretation of CAA section 109 too vague, leading to an unconstitutional delegation of authority. This raised concerns about how Congress delegates standard-setting authority to agencies. The Supreme Court later reversed this decision, stating that the discretion allowed by section 109(b)(1) was within acceptable limits. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision on EPA's interpretation of CAA section 109, stating that the discretion allowed by section 109(b)(1) is within acceptable limits. The Court clarified that primary NAAQSs should be set at levels \"requisite\" to protect public health, with \"requisite\" meaning \"sufficient, but not more than necessary.\" The Court acknowledged the need for more guidance when agency actions have a broad scope, such as with revised NAAQSs affecting the entire U.S. economy. EPA has discretion to determine the level of public health threat from ozone and particulates, even at non-zero levels. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision on EPA's interpretation of CAA section 109, stating that primary NAAQSs should be set at levels \"requisite\" to protect public health. The Court acknowledged EPA's discretion in determining the level of public health threat from ozone and particulates, even at non-zero levels. EPA lost on two issues regarding the implementation of the revised ozone NAAQS in non-attainment areas, with the Court questioning which CAA provisions govern the policy. The Court found that EPA's implementation policy of the revised ozone NAAQS in nonattainment areas, focusing only on Subpart 1 and ignoring Subpart 2, was not justified. The provisions of Subpart 2, designed for a 1-hour ozone standard, did not align with the new 8-hour ozone standard. The Court ruled that EPA cannot disregard Subpart 2 entirely, as it would render its restrictions on EPA discretion meaningless once a new standard is in place. The Court found that EPA's implementation policy of the revised ozone NAAQS in nonattainment areas, focusing only on Subpart 1 and ignoring Subpart 2, was not justified. Subpart 2's restrictions on EPA discretion would be rendered meaningless once a new standard is in place. EPA had stronger arguments on the nondelegation issue in American Trucking, but it was not guaranteed that they would win unanimously. The Court's reluctance to revive the nondelegation doctrine stems from the belief that Congress needs the flexibility to delegate power in a complex society. Rewriting federal statutes to comply with a stricter nondelegation doctrine would be a daunting task. Statutes necessitated by a reinvigorated nondelegation doctrine could be of daunting magnitude, covering various federal laws from environmental to antitrust to civil rights. The American Trucking decision largely restores the status quo ante on issues like the nondelegation doctrine and the impermissibility of considering costs in setting NAAQSs. Justice Scalia focused on statutory text, while Justice Breyer's concurrence highlighted legislative history supporting EPA's position on keeping costs out. The Court's decision in Whitman v. American Trucking may signal a reduced judicial deference to agency decision-making. However, it is premature to draw a final conclusion as the case is ongoing with numerous issues before the D.C. Circuit. Developing an implementation plan for the revised ozone NAAQS that meets the Court's mandate is a challenging task for the EPA. The new ozone standard of 0.08 ppm is more stringent than the old 0.09 ppm level. However, there is a gap in the classification system for areas with readings between 0.08 - 0.09 ppm. The setting of attainment dates for ozone pollution areas has also posed challenges, with deadlines already passed and uncertainty on how the EPA should respond. The Act's method for calculating attainment dates is questioned for areas classified under a new standard after November 15. The EPA's approach to areas classified under a new standard after November 15, 1990, may face challenges and potential litigation. Congress intervening to settle these matters could raise issues regarding the level of new standards, implementation measures, and EPA's authority, which interested parties may not want legislated."
