    "content": "Section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313) is amended to read as follows: \"SEC. 313. DRAWBACK.\" Section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include conditions for granting drawback on exported merchandise, outlining the requirements for exporters and imported merchandise. The amended Section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 outlines conditions for granting drawback on exported merchandise, requiring that the exported merchandise or its substitute be classifiable within the same 8-digit HTS subheading as the imported merchandise. Additionally, a drawback claimant can be any party involved in the process. The amended Section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows for drawback claims by parties meeting specific conditions, including obtaining permission from the importer or exporter. Importers and claimants share joint liability for drawback claims, with a 5-year time limit for filing. The drawback claim must be filed within 5 years from the earliest date of importation of the merchandise designated on the claim. The amount of drawback paid to the claimant cannot exceed the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the designated line item. The calculation for the drawback amount is based on the entered value of the line item and the number of units claimed. For drawback claims, the amount refunded is based on the duties, taxes, and fees per unit on the designated line item, multiplied by the number of units claimed. Refunds, waivers, or reductions under certain free trade agreements have limitations on the amount that can be refunded, waived, or reduced. The amount refunded for drawback claims is limited by the total customs duties paid on the merchandise in the US or to the NAFTA country. If Canada ceases to be a NAFTA country, shipments made during the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement do not count as exports for refund purposes. Chile FTA drawback allows for refunds, waivers, or reductions of customs duties on exported goods to Chile, with varying percentages over specific time periods. The exportation of fungible merchandise to NAFTA countries or Chile, which is substituted for imported goods, will not be considered as an exportation for certain purposes. This includes merchandise not covered in specific sections of trade agreements. Total amount of customs duties paid or owed on merchandise imported into the United States includes duties, taxes, and fees per unit paid on the import line item designated for drawback. The provisions of this section also apply to merchandise used in constructing vessels for foreign ownership or government use. No drawback is available for agricultural merchandise subject to over-quota rates. The section discusses the conditions for drawback authorization, including the payment source for Puerto Rico and the option to satisfy exportation requirements by destroying merchandise under specific conditions. The section outlines the conditions for claiming drawback, including the amount paid to the claimant and the limitation on the exportation requirement. It also specifies that imported merchandise must be regularly entered or withdrawn for consumption to satisfy the exportation requirement. Additionally, it states that exportation or destruction can only be claimed once on a drawback claim, except for components or ingredients not previously claimed. The Secretary of the Treasury can create regulations for this section. For flavoring extracts, medicinal or toilet preparations, bottled distilled spirits, and wines exported from the US, a drawback equal to the tax paid on the alcohol used can be claimed. For distilled spirits and wines manufactured in the US with internal revenue tax paid, a drawback equal to the tax paid can be claimed under regulations approved by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Secretary of the Treasury. The claim must be filed by the bottler or packager, and the spirits must be stamped for export.
