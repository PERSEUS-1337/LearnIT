This program aims to recruit principals for schools. The purpose of this section is to recruit, train, and support effective principals for high-need schools. An eligible grantee is defined as a partnership between a nonprofit organization, a research organization, and local educational agencies with a track record of selecting, training, and supporting principals. The partnership must have the capacity for world-class research and evaluation using student-level data to analyze academic achievement. The term 'high-need school' refers to a public school where at least 40% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. The term 'principal' includes assistant principals. The Secretary will establish a multiyear national principal grant program. The Secretary will establish a multiyear national principal recruitment grant program to enable eligible grantees to carry out activities focused on urban and rural schools. Grantees must submit an application containing required information to receive a grant and use it for specified activities. The grant recipients must use funds for recruiting, training, and supporting new principals for high-need schools through a year-long residency and ongoing professional development. They must also conduct research and evaluation to create a national knowledge base. The grant recipients must use funds for recruiting, training, and supporting new principals for high-need schools through a year-long residency and ongoing professional development. They must also conduct research and evaluation to create a national knowledge base to inform the recruitment, selection, and training of principals for high-need schools. Additionally, a performance-based program will be implemented where Federal funding will be contingent on a rigorous demonstration of impact on student academic achievement. Specific activities include recruiting, selecting, and providing preservice training to individuals aspiring to be principals. The grant recipients must recruit, train, and support new principals for high-need schools who believe in the potential of all students to achieve at high levels. They should have knowledge of effective instruction and leadership, commit to serving high-need schools, and aim for significant improvement in student academic achievement within 5 to 6 years. The grant recipients must recruit, train, and support new principals for high-need schools who believe in the potential of all students to achieve at high levels. Training includes coaching from an effective principal, hands-on instructional leadership experience, and a curriculum covering topics like creating a data-driven learning community and fostering teacher professional development. The grant recipients focus on developing teachers to improve student academic achievement by using data to evaluate instruction, managing resources effectively, and engaging community members for additional support. The curr_chunk focuses on providing professional development and training to principals of high-need schools, with a focus on teaching and learning, school culture, and management. Additionally, it mentions delivering differentiated support services to meet the specific needs of these schools. The curr_chunk focuses on providing support for data-driven school-wide improvement plans, conducting successful assessments, and assistance from content expert coaches and data specialists. It also emphasizes developing organizational capacity for long-term success. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an eligible grantee must contribute matching funds equal to at least 100 percent of the grant amount, which can be in cash or in kind. The Secretary may waive part of the matching requirement under certain circumstances. The eligible grantee must contribute at least 75 percent of the grant amount and provide a plan for the remaining 25 percent. The Secretary can waive the matching requirement in cases of hardship. Grant funds should supplement, not replace, other available Federal or State funds. The Secretary works with grant recipients to develop a research and evaluation plan approved by the Secretary to assess the impact of specific activities. Assess impact of eligible grantee's program on student academic achievement, including value-added analysis of gains in high-need schools led by trained principals, compared to other schools. The assessment includes examining retention rates of high-performing educators in high-need schools, student attendance, and secondary school graduation rates. Factors that support or impede program implementation need to be identified. Understanding internal and external factors, such as principal characteristics, that impact student learning is crucial for improvement. The analysis includes evaluating the impact of increased principal autonomy and accountability, rigorously assessing school-level support, utilizing data for progress analysis, and sharing information on effective principal recruitment and training for student academic success. The Secretary will provide a 50 percent increase in grant amount to eligible grantees who demonstrate improved student academic achievement gains after implementing the grant for at least three years. The program funded by the grant is helping students achieve better academically compared to students in other schools. The grant will be terminated if high-need schools do not show improvement after implementing the grant for four years. The program funded by the grant aims to improve academic achievement in high-need schools. Principals who receive training and support from the program are not showing more gains in academic achievement than students in other schools. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the lessons learned from the performance-based approach to federal funding. The grant recipients must provide an annual report to Congress and the Secretary, including data on aspiring principals trained and academic achievement growth in high-need schools. Amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to align with the new requirements.
