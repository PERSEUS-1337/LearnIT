    "content": "The offices of the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico and the delegates to the House of Representatives from American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are created by statute, not by the Constitution. They represent territories and associated jurisdictions, not states, and do not possess the same parliamentary rights as Members. This report examines their parliamentary rights in legislative committee, in the House, and in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. The delegates and resident commissioner have limited parliamentary rights in the House. They can participate in debates, sponsor legislation, raise points of order, and chair committees, but cannot vote for Speaker or file discharge petitions. They are appointed by the Speaker and represent territories, not states. In the House, delegates and the resident commissioner have limited voting rights but can participate in debates, sponsor legislation, raise points of order, and chair committees. In the 115th Congress, they cannot vote in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union but can preside over it. In prior Congresses, they had the same voting ability as Representatives in the Committee of the Whole. In the 110th and 111th Congresses, delegates and the resident commissioner could vote and preside over the Committee of the Whole. These provisions were removed in the 104th Congress and reinstated in the 110th Congress. A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the rule was ultimately upheld on appeal. In the 103rd Congress, votes of delegates and the resident commissioner were subject to automatic revote by the House on three occasions. In the 111th Congress, the votes of delegates were decisive and subject to automatic revote once. The prior rule did not automatically reconsider votes with a difference of six votes or fewer. The chair determined the decisiveness of delegate votes using a \"but for\" test. If the votes of delegates and the commissioner were decisive, the committee would automatically vote and the final result would be announced before resuming its sitting."
