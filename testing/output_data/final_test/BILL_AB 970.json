    "title": "AB 970",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 558 of the Labor Code is amended to impose civil penalties on employers or their representatives for violating labor regulations. The penalties include $50 for each underpaid employee for initial violations and $100 for subsequent violations, in addition to recovering underpaid wages.Recovered wages must be paid to the affected employee. Wages recovered for overtime work violations under labor regulations shall be paid to the affected employee. The Labor Commissioner may issue a citation if a violation is found, with procedures for contesting and enforcing judgments similar to Section 1197.1. In jurisdictions where a local entity can issue citations for local overtime law violations, the Labor Commissioner can also issue citations upon request if the local entity has not already done so. Civil penalties in this section are additional to other penalties under the law, and it does not change the application of local overtime wage laws. Section 1197 of the Labor Code is amended to establish the minimum wage for employees, with penalties for paying below that amount. Section 1197.1 outlines penalties for employers who pay less than the minimum wage set by state or local laws. For intentional violations, a penalty of $100 per underpaid employee per pay period is imposed, in addition to recovering underpaid wages, liquidated damages, and any applicable penalties. Subsequent violations for the same offense incur a penalty of $250 per underpaid employee per pay period, regardless of intent. All recovered amounts are to be paid to the affected employee. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a person has paid less than the minimum wage, a citation may be issued describing the violation and penalties to be enforced. The citation can be served personally or by registered mail, and actions will be taken to recover penalties, wages, and damages. If contesting a citation or civil penalty, notify Labor Commissioner within 15 days for an informal hearing. Commissioner will hold a hearing within 30 days to affirm, modify, or dismiss the citation or penalty. The Labor Commissioner's decision includes a notice of findings, findings, and an order, served to all parties within 15 days after the hearing. Any amount due must be paid within 45 days, and a writ of mandate can be taken to the superior court within 45 days of service. A citation recipient can choose to pay the specified amount within 15 days instead of contesting the citation. When no petition is filed objecting to a citation or proposed assessment, the Labor Commissioner can file a certified copy in the superior court clerk's office for judgment against the assessed person. When findings affirm or modify a citation or assessment, the Labor Commissioner can enter a certified copy in the superior court clerk's office for judgment against the assessed person. The judgment will bear interest and have the same effect as other judgments, with no charge for the service. In jurisdictions where a local entity can issue citations for violations of local minimum wage laws, the Labor Commissioner can also issue citations upon request if the local entity has not already done so. Civil penalties mentioned are additional to other penalties under the law. This section does not affect local minimum wage laws' applicability to any entity. Section 2802 of the Labor Code is amended to require employers to reimburse employees for necessary expenses incurred while performing their duties, even if the actions were unlawful. Court or Division of Labor Standards Enforcement awards for reimbursement will accrue interest, including attorney's fees. The commissioner may issue a citation against an employer who violates reimbursement obligations to an employee. Procedures for enforcing citations are the same as in Section 1197.1, with recovered amounts paid to the affected employee. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution, as any costs incurred by a local agency or school district would be due to the creation, elimination, or change in penalties for crimes or infractions."
