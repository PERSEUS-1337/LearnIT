    "content": "Hundreds of thousands of trucks and rail tank cars transport hazardous materials daily, which can be targets of terror. Hazmat shipments can be attacked or hijacked by terrorists to harm large groups of people or critical infrastructure. The Department of Transportation warns of ongoing security threats targeting hazmat transportation, prompting the need for a layered security system to reduce risks. The report discusses a layered system of security measures for hazmat transportation, including incident prevention, preparedness, and response. Key activities involve inspection of drivers and vehicles, regulation of security aspects, training employees, and emergency planning. The challenge is to enhance security cost-effectively while meeting transportation needs. The focus is on the federal role in hazmat transportation security. The report outlines key actions taken by the DOT and DHS to promote hazmat security in surface transportation. It highlights concerns with current federal efforts and presents ten options to strengthen hazmat transportation security. The report focuses on rail and highway modes, excluding private sector efforts and high-level nuclear shipments. The hazmat transportation system is vulnerable to terrorist attacks through various means such as sabotaging rail tracks, attacking tank trucks, and releasing poisonous gases. With over one million hazmat shipments daily in the US, there are numerous points of vulnerability. Decision makers question the effectiveness of current security measures and seek ways to enhance hazmat transportation security. The hazmat transportation system is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, with a layered approach being deployed to enhance security. This system includes private sector initiatives supported by governmental efforts like research, outreach, directives, advisories, and regulations. Key components of the layered security system may include background checks for drivers, special permits for carriers of high-hazard materials, security training for hazmat employees, and safety and security requirements. The hazmat transportation system requires security-oriented training and carefully designed security plans overseen by federal and state inspectors. Grants may be provided for emergency responder training and alert systems for possible terrorist threats. The DOT and DHS have taken actions to increase security for hazmat shipments. The DOT and DHS have administered grants and implemented security measures for hazmat transportation. They are working with industry to create a layered system of security measures, but the adequacy of these actions is debatable. Both departments have important responsibilities in promoting hazmat transportation security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigns the DOT Secretary to regulate hazmat transportation security. DOT's modal administrations have taken various actions to enhance hazmat transportation security, including visits to carriers and issuing security regulations. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) plays a key role in promoting hazmat transportation security through direct industry contacts, enhanced regulatory requirements, grants to state safety officers, training, and security testing. FMCSA conducts visits to hazmat trucking companies to provide technical assistance and reviews security plans for compliance with federal regulations, resulting in enforcement actions. FMCSA requires hazmat trucking companies transporting highly hazardous materials to obtain a special safety permit. They have provided enforcement grants to border states for hazmat shipment inspections and sponsored an evaluation of security technologies for hazmat transportation, including tracking systems and anti-hijack measures. An operational test with 100 trucks assessed the costs and benefits of these technologies. FMCSA has implemented security measures for hazmat transportation, including training safety specialists and police officers on recognizing suspicious activities. They have also developed a communications system to notify drivers and companies about possible security threats. The FMCSA has implemented security measures for hazmat transportation, including training safety specialists and police officers on recognizing suspicious activities. They have also developed a communications system to notify drivers and companies about possible security threats. Additionally, DOT's PHMSA requires regulated entities to develop and implement security plans for transporting hazmats, with some industry members expressing concerns about the broad applicability and subjective assessment of these plans. This regulation covers a wide array of companies in the hazmat industry. The DOT's PHMSA requires hazmat companies to develop security plans tailored to their operations and commodities. Security awareness training must be provided to employees by a specified date. Enforcement actions are taken against non-compliant companies. PHMSA has issued a risk management framework for hazardous material transportation. The PHMSA administers a grant program for hazmat training, while the FRA is involved in reviewing hazmat shipments and providing technical advice on tank cars. FRA also conducts hazmat training for first responders and participates in security exercises focusing on terrorist strikes. FRA participates in hazmat security exercises and conducts inspections of shippers and railroads for compliance with security regulations. They also oversee rail bridges and track security and share intelligence with railroads. DHS is the lead federal department for homeland security, conducting threat assessments and issuing warnings to improve transportation security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assesses vulnerabilities, issues warnings, and develops security plans. They operate the Homeland Security Operations Center for threat monitoring and information sharing. DHS also manages the Homeland Security Information Network for rapid exchange of security-related information, including hazmat transportation security. Additionally, DHS administers a research and development program focused on security technologies relevant to hazmat transportation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducts research and technology development related to hazmat transportation security, including tracking hazmat shipments, detecting nuclear materials, improving emergency response strategies, and reducing vulnerability to toxic industrial materials during transport. DHS collaborates with the Department of Transportation (DOT) on research projects, such as detecting tank car breaches caused by small arms fire. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within DHS is responsible for transportation security across all modes and has the authority to develop security policies and strategies to address threats. TSA has primary responsibility for transportation security, with a focus on aviation security. DHS and DOT share responsibility for hazmat transportation security, with DOT providing technical assistance and supporting DHS's security policies. TSA's resources are primarily directed towards aviation security, with less attention and funding for surface transportation concerns. TSA's activities for hazmat transportation security are spread across multiple offices to maximize resources and program effectiveness. They use various approaches such as planning, communications, research, and training. One planning activity involved developing the \"Sector Specific Plan for Transportation\" to identify participants, critical assets, and communication methods. The Sector Specific Plan for Transportation aims to assess vulnerabilities, prioritize assets, and measure security performance. Hazmat transportation security is not a separate activity in the plan but is included in various modal portions. Some Members of Congress are interested in vulnerability assessments, with bills introduced to require DHS to prepare assessments for freight rail transportation and hazmat transportation by rail. TSA is involved in promoting hazmat security. TSA is actively involved in promoting hazmat security by communicating with industry representatives, conducting briefings for stakeholders, and sponsoring outreach and training activities. They have provided funding to programs like the American Trucking Associations' Highway Watch\u00ae Program to train transportation professionals to identify and report safety incidents and security threats. The Highway Watch\u00ae Program trains transportation professionals to report safety hazards and potential terrorist-related activity in the transportation industry. The program has responded to over 1,415 calls, with 200 reports of suspicious activity. It has trained almost 50,000 participants and plans to train over 450,000 in 2005. The Highway Watch\u00ae Information Sharing and Analysis Center issues alerts and suspicious incident reports. TSA's role in hazmat security is evolving with support from DOT. TSA and PHMSA are exploring security enhancements for rail shipments of toxic-by-inhalation materials, including potential \"hardening\" measures. This includes revising storage requirements and considering the removal of identifying marks from rail tank cars used for transporting TIH materials. The TSA and PHMSA are considering security enhancements for rail shipments of toxic-by-inhalation materials, including potentially removing identifying marks from rail tank cars. There is a debate on whether alternative hazard communication methods could improve safety without compromising security. Uncertainty remains on the actions that TSA and PHMSA may take following a regulatory announcement on August 16, 2004. The TSA is focusing on promoting security for toxic-by-inhalation materials in the rail mode, as part of a multi-phase effort to secure transportation in all modes. They conduct rail-corridor assessments in high threat areas, providing recommendations for necessary improvements to industry and governmental officials. The TSA has completed assessments of rail corridors in Washington, DC, Ohio, and New Jersey, making progress on security enhancements without direct funding to railroads. They are managing a pilot project for truck tracking technologies and plan to develop a prototype for a centralized tracking center. Researchers will examine technology interoperability and information system linking between the tracking center and government intelligence. TSA provided funds to FMCSA for assistance. TSA is implementing a security awareness program for the truck leasing/rental industry to increase sensitivity to security risks, such as illegal transport of hazmat. Other parts of DHS, like CBP, are enhancing hazmat transportation security with scanners and advanced cargo notification rules. The Office for Domestic Preparedness conducts planning and training activities. The Office for Domestic Preparedness in DHS conducts planning activities and provides training for dealing with hazmat transportation in terrorist attacks. TSA is implementing Section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act to assess security risks associated with hazmat transportation, including conducting security threat assessments for drivers with hazmat endorsements on their CDL. Congress is overseeing TSA's program implementation and financial impacts. The House passed H.R. 3, which includes a provision for reviewing Canadian- and Mexican-domiciled drivers transporting hazmats into the United States. TSA screened 2.7 million commercial drivers with hazmat endorsements in 2004, leading to over 100 leads sent to the FBI. TSA plans to implement a fingerprint-based criminal background check for commercial drivers seeking hazmat endorsements over the next five years. This process is guided by federal regulations and state procedures, posing financial costs. The TSA's hazmat endorsement program is guided by federal regulations and state procedures, leading to delays in implementation. Drivers appealing TSA's decisions face challenges, with name-based checks conducted periodically. TSA has not allowed states to issue new hazmat endorsements without security threat determinations since January 31, 2005. Starting May 31, 2005, this rule also applies to CDL renewals and transfers. Drivers seeking to renew a CDL with a hazmat endorsement or transfer their license may face policy issues related to federal hazmat transportation security. Despite efforts by DOT and DHS, vulnerabilities remain in the current system. FMCSA began issuing hazmat permits to carriers of high hazard materials in 2005. Hazmat permits are required for carriers transporting high hazard materials. Carriers must go through the permit process, with the first round of carriers being considered for permits within the next 21 months as they register or renew with FMCSA. FMCSA will issue temporary permits and conduct compliance reviews on carriers without a safety rating. The review checks compliance with safety and hazmat security regulations. FMCSA will issue hazmat permits to carriers with a satisfactory rating. FMCSA issues hazmat safety permits to carriers meeting requirements and with satisfactory ratings. FMCSA has reviewed hundreds of carriers for compliance with PHMSA regulations. Only 180 carriers have received permits as of March 21, 2005, with 125 applications rejected. Financial penalties and legal consequences promote compliance with security regulations. Increased security measures under the permit program reduce security risks. Compliance with current federal security measures for hazmat transportation may still leave vulnerabilities for terrorist attacks. TSA's evolving role includes security threat assessments for hazmat endorsement holders, but the impact on transportation security is uncertain. The TSA's security threat assessment process for hazmat endorsement holders may not fully address all vulnerabilities in the transportation system. While it may deter potential terrorists, it is not foolproof and does not guarantee complete security. TSA's threat assessment process for hazmat transportation aims to reduce easy access to the system and hinder coordinated terrorist attacks. Despite generating leads for the FBI, TSA's efforts have limited impact on promoting hazmat security. Regulations requiring security measures for key industry components are still lacking. The TSA is working with the DOT to enhance security measures for transporting hazardous materials, but comprehensive regulations are not expected in the near future. A detailed risk assessment is deemed necessary before implementing any new regulations or standards for the hazmat transportation industry. The TSA is collaborating with the DOT to improve security measures for hazmat transportation, but comprehensive regulations are not imminent. There is uncertainty regarding when new security directives will be issued. Additionally, there is no consensus on implementing a national routing system for hazmat shipments, with DHS working with industry to reduce risks for events involving large numbers of people. Limited federal and state inspection of hazmat shipments in highly populated areas poses security concerns. Inspectors focus on safety regulations, but security problems are harder to detect. Funding limitations and lack of necessary technologies hinder effective security measures. Increased use of technology like radiation detectors would enhance security, but costs are a concern. Limited federal and state inspection of hazmat shipments in highly populated areas poses security concerns. Inspectors focus on safety regulations, but security problems are harder to detect. Funding limitations and lack of necessary technologies hinder effective security measures. FMCSA plans to conduct security awareness training for MCSAP personnel in FY2005. TSA has the authority to hire 100 inspectors to promote security for passenger railroads, with flexibility to conduct cargo inspections as needed. DHS has allocated funds for security measures. Limited federal and state inspection of hazmat shipments in highly populated areas raises security concerns. More inspections in urban areas could enhance security by identifying trucks with hazardous loads deviating from intended routes. Renewed interest in routing hazmat shipments near heavily populated areas is driven by security concerns over potential terrorist attacks or hijackings. The possibility of terrorists targeting hazmat shipments like chlorine is being evaluated by government agencies for safety and security concerns. Some jurisdictions, like the District of Columbia, have laws restricting hazmat transportation through certain areas, requiring permits for specified hazmat transport. This law has faced legal challenges in federal court. The freight railroad industry opposes giving local jurisdictions a role in hazmat shipment routing due to concerns about increased costs, disruptions, and safety implications for remote communities. Legal questions also arise regarding the authority of state and local governments to impose such restrictions on transportation. Some argue that high hazard shipments should be rerouted to avoid potential terrorist attacks that could cause mass casualties. Legal issues arise regarding state and local governments' authority to restrict transportation of hazardous materials. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, criticizes the lack of action in securing hazmat transportation from terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. They argue that the Bush Administration has not supported rerouting trains carrying hazmat away from populated areas, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. Public Citizen also highlights deficiencies in government monitoring of trucks transporting hazardous materials. The Government Accountability Office recommended that DHS and DOT develop a risk-based plan to address the security of the nation's rail infrastructure and protect hazmat rail shipments. Some Members of Congress want to increase the information provided to governmental entities, such as allowing State homeland security coordinators to request comprehensive lists of hazardous materials scheduled for transport through their state. Some argue for increased information on hazardous materials transported by rail, while others oppose a general prenotification requirement due to the high volume of daily shipments and potential burden on industry. The current emergency response planning and training negate the need for a universal pre-notification requirement in hazmat transportation security. Limited federal funding has been allocated for hazmat transportation security research and development. Research includes testing tracking and communication technologies, breaching of containers, spill patterns, and understanding hazmat reactions for improved security measures. Research on hazmat transportation security is crucial for understanding how different hazmat combinations react and improving security measures. Some Members of Congress are interested in establishing a hazardous materials cooperative research program to enhance security for transportation of hazardous materials by rail. Federal funding for hazmat transportation security research is evolving to support enhanced security measures. The federal role in enhancing hazmat transportation security is evolving, with various measures being considered. These measures need to be evaluated based on factors like resource allocation, effectiveness in reducing risks, and impacts on transportation efficiency. Different options are being explored, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The cost of strengthening hazmat transportation security is high, potentially requiring hundreds of millions of dollars. Despite investments, the system would still have vulnerabilities. Additional security measures could lead to delays and increased costs for commerce. However, proponents argue that the costs of a successful attack on hazardous shipments justify the need for further security investments. The public highlights the catastrophic costs of a well-placed attack on a hazardous shipment, such as toxic gas. DHS and DOT are exploring options to reduce the risk, focusing on cost-effective measures. Progress is being made towards this goal, although the timing of future actions is uncertain."
