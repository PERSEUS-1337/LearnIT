    "content": "YELLOWSTONE BUFFALO PRESERVATION. The Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act, also known as the \"Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act,\" recognizes the American buffalo as a symbol of the United States and Native American cultures. Despite being nearly exterminated in the late 19th Century, their numbers were reduced to 25 by 1900 due to poaching. The Yellowstone buffalo herd, descendants of the survivors nearly exterminated by poaching, are the only wild, free-roaming American buffalo in their native habitat. They are genetically unique, never interbred with cattle, and have retained their wild character. Wildlife migrate from Yellowstone National Park to lower elevation habitats in winter and spring due to lack of winter forage. The Yellowstone buffalo herd, exposed to Brucella abortus in 1917, can cause brucellosis transmitted through contaminated reproductive products. Risk of transmission to cattle is low, with no confirmed cases in the wild. Buffalo and cattle grazed together for over 50 years without incident. The National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and State of Montana Department of Livestock haze, capture, and kill Yellowstone buffalo to confine them in Yellowstone National Park, while allowing elk with brucellosis access to Federal land. Nearly 3,700 American buffalo have been killed in Montana since 1984 due to this policy. In the winter of 2002-2003, 244 buffalo were killed by Federal and State agencies. On the north and west sides of Yellowstone National Park, key lower elevation habitat for American buffalo is primarily on Gallatin National Forest lands. A $13,000,000 private-Federal land exchange in 1999 aimed to provide access to low elevation habitat near the Yellowstone River for the buffalo herd and other wildlife, but it has not been finalized. The Horse Butte peninsula on the west side of the Park offers prime wildlife habitat for various species including grizzly bears, trumpeter swans, bald eagles, wolves, and buffalo, comprising approximately 10,000 acres of Gallatin National Forest Federal lands extending into Hebgen Lake. The Federal lands adjacent to Yellowstone National Park provide valuable wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities for the public. These lands should be managed to sustain diverse wildlife and preserve this national treasure. The purpose of this Act is to protect the Yellowstone buffalo herd by allowing them to roam freely on Federal lands outside of the Park. Hazing is defined as any effort to drive away or deter wildlife movements. The Act defines key terms such as \"individual,\" \"Park,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Yellowstone buffalo herd.\" It prohibits killing, hazing, or capturing buffalo on Federal land until certain duties are carried out. Penalties for violating the Act include fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment up to 1 year for initial violations, and fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years for subsequent violations. A reward of half the fine collected or $2,500, whichever is less, is given to informants leading to a conviction. The Act imposes penalties for violations, including fines and imprisonment. A reward is given to informants leading to a conviction. The Act exempts individuals physically endangered or whose property was damaged by a buffalo from prosecution for hazing. The Secretary and other Federal agencies must ensure that the Yellowstone buffalo herd can freely roam designated areas without being hazed within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Yellowstone buffalo herd is managed solely by the National Park Service. A land exchange with a private property owner has been finalized to allow the buffalo to roam freely. The Stephens Creek Buffalo Capture Facility has been dismantled. Efforts have been made to allow the buffalo to roam federal lands through various means.
