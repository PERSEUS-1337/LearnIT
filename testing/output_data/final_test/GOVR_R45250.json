    "content": "Despite steady urbanization, 71% of U.S. road mileage is in rural areas. Many rural areas have lost population, leaving governments with the burden of maintaining roads that may carry diminishing traffic. Rural roads received 37% of federal highway funds during FY2009-FY2015, despite accounting for 30% of annual vehicle miles traveled. This report examines the challenges of maintaining rural roads, presents data on their use and condition, and discusses federal spending and policy issues for Congress. Different definitions of \"rural\" may lead to different conclusions about conditions in rural America. Rural areas in the United States are defined as those outside urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. This definition includes urban fringe counties and rural areas within urban counties. Approximately 97% of the land area in the U.S. is considered rural, home to about 60 million people. Residents in rural areas are more likely to own single-family homes, be older, and have slightly lower household incomes compared to urban areas. The Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service uses a different definition, where rural counties do not have urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more and are not tied to urban areas by labor commuting patterns. This definition covers 72% of U.S. land area and 46 million residents. The Economic Research Service (ERS) defines rural areas in the U.S. as encompassing 72% of the land area and 46 million residents. ERS finds that median household income in rural areas is 25% lower than in urban areas, but this gap is offset by differences in the cost of living. Median household farm income exceeds U.S. household income by 29%, indicating better economic outcomes for farm households. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) defines urban and rural areas similarly to the Census Bureau but sets a higher population threshold for urban areas. FHWA's definition results in a larger rural area compared to the Census Bureau. Rural residents are more reliant on automobiles than urban residents. Rural residents are more dependent on automobiles than urban residents, with high vehicle availability rates in rural areas. However, a significant proportion of low-income rural households lack access to a vehicle. Agriculture and mining are major industries in rural areas but provide less than 5% of wage and salary jobs. The leading sources of rural employment are education and other sectors. The leading sources of rural employment are education and health, trade, transportation, and utilities, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality. Increased oil and gas drilling has also contributed to rural job growth. Manufacturing and mining workers have the highest median wages in rural areas. Prior to the 2007-2009 recession, some rural counties experienced population losses, particularly in agriculture-dependent plains states. The rural population in the plains states continued to grow, but there was a shift in trend during the 2010-2016 period with overall population decline in rural counties. This decline was due to lower fertility rates, outmigration of young adults, and increased mortality among working-age adults, partly due to opioid and heroin overdoses. Population loss spread geographically, especially in the eastern United States, where 18 out of 23 states saw rural population decline. The loss of manufacturing jobs post-recession was a significant factor in this population decline. Population decline in rural areas of the eastern states is linked to the loss of manufacturing jobs and reclassification of counties from rural to urban due to population growth. This raises questions about redirecting highway funding from underused roads and bridges in population loss areas to growth areas. The national roadway system serves two fundamental travel needs: access and mobility. 71% of public-access roads in the United States are rural roads, with 45% being unpaved. Over the last 30 years, the share of rural roads has declined. Over the last 30 years, the share of rural roads in the United States has declined from 82% to 71% due to urbanization. There are 443,610 bridges over 20 feet long on rural roads, making up 72% of the national total. Despite rural roads accounting for 71% of road mileage, only 30% of vehicle miles traveled are on rural roads. Usage of rural roads differs from urban roads, with cars and light vehicles accounting for 84.5% of VMT on rural roads. The majority of combination truck VMT occurs on rural Interstate Highways, with FHWA monitoring pavement conditions on Federal-Aid highways. Pavement quality is categorized as good, fair, or poor, with roads of good or fair quality considered acceptable. FHWA's biannual report shows that rural roads have better pavement conditions than urban roads, with 92.8% of rural miles traveled on roads of acceptable quality compared to 78.1% for urban roads. Interstate System highways are in the best condition and have improved since 2012. In 2016, 2.0% of rural Interstate miles traveled were rated as poor, while 14% of rural road mileage was rated poor overall. The percentage of rural roads in poor pavement condition increased from 2013-2016, mainly due to rural major collectors being downgraded. Urban road mileage rated poor was higher at 35%, with the greatest difference seen in minor arterials and other principal arterials. Data for off-system roads is not compiled at the federal level. Off-system roads, mainly minor roads, are more likely to be in poor condition compared to federal-aid highways. Unpaved rural roads, totaling 1.3 million miles, are considered to have unacceptable ride quality. The majority of structurally deficient bridges in the US are in rural areas, with 76% of these bridges located on least-used rural roads. Urban bridges, although fewer, are larger and more costly to repair, with almost 57% of structurally deficient bridge deck area on urban bridges. Interstate Highway bridges carrying heavy traffic loads are more likely to be in good repair. Despite the decline in structurally deficient rural bridges since 2000, the number is still relatively large, mainly on minor roads in counties with sparse populations and low tax revenues. Urban bridges have also seen a decrease in deficiency rates, with Interstate Highway bridges generally in better repair due to heavy traffic loads. Off-system bridges in counties with sparse populations and low tax revenues are eligible for federal assistance under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program. States must allocate at least 15% of their highway bridge apportionment for FY2009 to off-system bridges, with a minimum nonfederal funding share of 20%. Some counties struggle to provide the local match for off-system bridge projects, which may be classified as structurally deficient but not necessarily unsafe. Unsafe bridges may require weight restrictions and immediate closure by officials. Closure authority varies by state, with some under county commissioners. Recent delays in closing unsafe bridges in Mississippi highlight the issue. Rural traffic congestion is mainly non-routine, caused by accidents, weather, or oversized loads. Seasonal and weekend-related congestion is common near popular destinations. Interstate highways and turnpikes may also experience congestion. Rural roads accounted for a significant share of highway use in the past, but the growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) was much lower for rural roads compared to urban roads over a 30-year period. This led to a larger congestion impact on urban roads. Road-use factors like VMT and traffic congestion can help determine where road expansion projects would be most beneficial in terms of saving travel time. Spending on rural road maintenance and improvements may be justified for reasons like connectivity and safety, even though many rural roads are underused due to serving thinly populated areas. Future population growth trends could lead to increased congestion on rural roads, especially in areas experiencing rapid suburban and exurban growth. Additionally, patterns of freight movement and economic development activities may result in concentrations of truck traffic on certain rural roads. Trucking accounts for a significant portion of freight movement in rural areas, with the majority of combination truck traffic occurring on rural roads. Factors such as the consolidation of grain elevators, logging activities, and changes in energy development have increased the reliance on trucks for transportation. The growth of ethanol refineries has also contributed to the increase in truck traffic in rural areas. The number of ethanol refineries has grown to almost 500, mostly in corn-producing areas, receiving feed stocks by truck. Natural gas and shale oil production in various states generate truck trips for drilling and transportation. Rural warehousing has increased, leading to more truck traffic. Off-system bridges are crucial for rural counties due to heavy truck use. Congestion is less of an issue than wear and tear from trucks on rural freight routes. In 2016, there were 36,166 highway fatalities in the United States, with slightly more than half involving trucks. In 2016, there were 36,166 highway fatalities in the United States, with 18,553 occurring on rural roads. The fatal accident rate on rural roads was more than twice that of urban roads, attributed to factors like higher speeds, lower seat belt use, and infrastructure design elements. Urban roads, particularly Interstate System highways, have lower fatality rates. Some rural roads have higher fatality rates compared to Interstate System highways. Infrastructure changes like side striping, expanding shoulders, rumble strips, and roundabouts could help improve safety. Federal-state partnership in highway construction dates back to the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. Not all rural roads are eligible for federal assistance, with most state highway agencies owning eligible roads. Off-system county roads are mostly maintained with local funds. Most rural roads are maintained with local or state funds, with some federal-aid eligible. Federal highway funds are apportioned to states by formula, allowing state departments of transportation to decide on road and bridge construction projects. States must provide a percentage of the project cost, depending on whether it is part of the Interstate System. The U.S. Department of Transportation provides funding for both Interstate and non-Interstate System projects, with states determining which projects receive funding. Federal grants are also available through programs like the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects and the BUILD program. In FY2017, a majority of TIGER grants were awarded to rural projects, highlighting the department's focus on addressing underinvestment in rural transportation systems. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 prioritizes funding for rural projects in the BUILD Transportation Discretionary Grant program, with at least 30% of funds allocated to rural areas. Additionally, a discretionary bridge grant program is available for states with low population density, and 10% of TIFIA loans are reserved for rural projects. The funds distributed through various programs, including the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and others, are also spent in rural areas. Published nationwide funding statistics distinguishing between rural and urban road spending are limited. Rural roads received an average of 37.4% of federally obligated highway funds during FY2009-FY2015, exceeding their 29% share of VMT on Federal-Aid. Data for FY2016 and FY2017 are not comparable due to adjustments made using geospatial data. During FY2009-FY2015, rural roads received 37.4% of federally obligated highway funds, exceeding their 29% share of VMT on Federal-Aid highways. Spending per vehicle mile traveled on rural roads is approximately 10% higher than on urban roads. Evaluations show that 2.1% of rural Interstate Highway miles were in poor condition in 2014, compared to 5.3% of urban Interstates. Data on capital outlays by states for off-system roads and bridges are not broken down by rural and urban roads. During FY2009-FY2015, rural roads received 37.4% of federally obligated highway funds, exceeding their 29% share of VMT on Federal-Aid highways. Capital outlays by states for non-FAHP roads in FY2014 totaled $13.4 billion, while local government capital outlays for streets and highways totaled $23.4 billion. Public-private partnerships (P3s) are supported by the federal government and many states to improve roads and bridges, but few projects are suitable for large-scale private investment. P3s supported by tolls may not be feasible in rural areas due to insufficient traffic for funding streams. The funding streams for P3s in rural areas often require availability payments from state or local governments, as toll revenues may not be sufficient due to low traffic volumes. Rural roads not on the federal-aid system have unclear conditions, with deficient bridges posing a challenge for states and counties to repair due to funding constraints. Traffic congestion in rural areas is not as severe as in urban areas. In rural areas, funding constraints hinder the repair of deficient bridges on roads not part of the federal-aid system. Despite improvements in pavement condition, states struggle to raise funds for infrastructure projects. Calls have been made for expanding lane miles on the Interstate System and National Highway System in rural areas. The proposal aims to add 73,600 lane miles of metropolitan road and bridge improvements, 68,000 lane miles of freight logistics improvements, and 16,000 lane miles to existing Interstate System highways in rural areas, totaling $3.1 trillion in 2007 dollars ($3.8 trillion in 2018 dollars). States can request additions to the Interstate System through administrative or congressional procedures, with new routes needing to meet all highway standards and logically connect to the system. States can use federal highway funds for new Interstate construction. A separate program could be created by Congress to finance new Interstate Highways based on cost-to-complete estimates. The FHWA's road classification system determines that major roads like Interstate System highways serve a national purpose, while local roads and rural collectors do not receive federal funding. Expanding the Federal-Aid Highway system to include rural local connectors and other local roads could help address rural road conditions, but it may lead to states spreading their federal funds more thinly across the network. This could make it harder for states to focus on more expensive or higher-priority road projects. Adding local roads to the system could also increase the costs of road improvements for local governments. Adding local roads to the Federal-Aid Highway system could raise costs for road improvements for local governments. Closing lightly used roads and bridges or reverting them to gravel could save maintenance costs, allowing funds to be directed towards maintaining a smaller, more heavily used network of roads. This could indirectly impact federal-aid spending by potentially increasing funds for off-system bridge repairs. Congress could incentivize pulverizing underused paved rural roads or permanently closing underused rural bridges with nearby alternatives by allowing federal funds to cover the cost. Increasing funding for safety projects on rural roads through the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) could be achieved by altering state use of grants or eliminating certain state abilities. The Federal-Aid Highway Program has reduced the number of specific programs over time, with MAP-21 reducing them by two-thirds. Creating a separate program for rural roads could ensure federal funds are used for this purpose, but it may limit state flexibility. FHWA regulations require economic development consideration in transportation planning, with guidance provided in a primer for state and local officials. The primer emphasizes making highway project decisions based on broader transportation benefits rather than just job creation. It warns that transportation alone cannot create development in areas with no demand. Rural areas often focus on highway improvements to attract industry, but without other reasons for employers to locate there, construction may result in underutilized infrastructure and missed opportunities for funding allocation. Fully autonomous vehicles could provide significant benefits to rural areas by offering mobility similar to public transportation in urban areas. These vehicles could help transport elderly or carless residents, reduce accident rates, and improve freight movement efficiency. While fully autonomous vehicles for all rural roads may be far off, limited domain autonomous vehicles could be used sooner, with Interstate System roads likely being the first to see their deployment. In rural areas, autonomous vehicles are likely to operate on Interstate System roads first due to their design uniformity. Unpaved rural roads pose challenges for autonomous vehicles due to the lack of road markings and uniform design features. Road design standards will play a crucial role in the adoption of autonomous vehicles."
