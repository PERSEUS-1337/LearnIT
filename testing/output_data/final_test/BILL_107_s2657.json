    "content": "The \"Opportunity Passport Act of 2002\" may be cited as the Opportunity Passport Act. It establishes Opportunity Passports. Section 105(a)(3) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act is amended to allow the Secretary to make grants to partnerships in 10 States to provide financial security for youth in foster care and those aging out of foster care. The grant funds can be used for activities like developing electronic opportunity passports for youth aging out of foster care. The partnership may use grant funds to establish individual development accounts for youth aging out of foster care, helping them with postsecondary education, housing, medical care, business operations, or car purchases. The partnership provides seed money and money management training before granting access to debit accounts for youth aging out of foster care. This helps them build credit histories and purchase essential items like work uniforms and car insurance. The partnership provides seed money and money management training to assist youth in becoming self-sufficient. They may also establish a youth leadership board for further assistance. The partnership aims to help youth in foster care transition to independent living by providing support in negotiating agreements, accessing education and training programs, obtaining student financial assistance, and becoming entrepreneurs. The term 'youth aging out of foster care' refers to children leaving foster care due to reaching the maximum age for eligibility and transitioning to independent living. The partnership aims to assist youth in foster care transition to independent living, as determined by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for Opportunity Passports under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act is amended to allocate $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and additional funds for subsequent years."
