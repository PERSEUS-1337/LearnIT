    "title": "AB 848",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes substance abuse as a medical condition requiring interdisciplinary treatment, including the use of licensed physicians. The lack of scientific understanding in state laws hinders the licensing of residential treatment facilities with California-licensed physicians, endangering patients and delaying recovery. The Legislature aims to modernize state law to protect individuals in treatment for substance abuse by allowing them to receive modern medical treatment. A new section is added to the Health and Safety Code requiring facilities to obtain a signed certification from a licensed health care practitioner before providing medical services to program participants. The department will create a standard certification form for health care practitioners to use, detailing the alcoholism and drug abuse recovery services needed by applicants. Regulations must be adopted by July 1, 2018, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The department may provide guidance through bulletins or written instructions until regulations are in place. Section 11834.026 is added to the Health and Safety Code. Section 11834.026 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"incidental medical services\" as services related to detoxification from alcohol or drugs and alcoholism or drug abuse recovery. These services include obtaining medical histories, monitoring health status, testing, and providing recovery or treatment services. Licensed alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities may allow incidental medical services to be provided on-site by licensed physicians knowledgeable about addiction medicine or other healthcare practitioners under physician supervision. These services include overseeing self-administered medications, treating substance abuse disorders, and detoxification. The facility must be able to comply with all laws and regulations to provide medical services to residents. The physician must sign a form provided by the department and keep it in the resident's file. The admission agreement must be signed by the resident and describe the medical services provided by the facility under a physician's supervision. The department will specify the content and manner of the agreement in regulations, and the facility must keep a copy in the resident's file. (5) Once medical services are started for a resident, the facility must monitor the resident's condition. If a change requires different services or higher care, the facility must arrange for them immediately. (6) The facility must keep proof of licensure for the physician and any other healthcare provider offering medical services. The department is not responsible for evaluating medical services provided by healthcare practitioners at licensed facilities. The facility offering approved medical services is not considered a clinic or health facility. The department is not responsible for evaluating medical services at licensed facilities. The provision of medical or health care services requiring a higher level of care is not authorized at alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facilities. Residential treatment facilities are not required to provide incidental medical services. The department will adopt regulations to implement this section by July 1, 2018. The department may implement this section through provider bulletins or guidelines until regulations are adopted. Section 11834.03 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include requirements for licensure application, including a completed written application, fire clearance, and licensure fee. Section 11834.36 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include requirements for licensure application, including a licensure fee established in accordance with Chapter 7.3. If an applicant intends to provide services under a specific section, they must submit evidence of a valid physician and surgeon license. An additional licensure fee will be collected for such applications to cover the costs of assessment and investigation. The director has the authority to suspend or revoke a license for violations of the Health and Safety Code related to alcoholism or drug abuse treatment facilities, if conduct is deemed harmful to individuals or the public in California. The director can suspend or revoke a license for violations such as misrepresentation, refusal of entry, violation of regulations, or failure to pay penalties. The director has the authority to temporarily suspend a license if necessary to protect residents from abuse or threats to health and safety. The suspension remains in effect until a final determination is made within 30 days. The director must make a final decision on the merits within 30 days after receiving the proposed decision from the Office of Administrative Hearings."
