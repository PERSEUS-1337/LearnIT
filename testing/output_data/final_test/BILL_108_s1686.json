    "content": "The \"Adoption Promotion Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes child safety in welfare decisions and promotes adoptions through incentive programs. All states have qualified for incentive payments since 1997, leading to a 64% increase in adoptions between 1997 and 2002. Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 percent, with adoptions of children with special needs increasing by 63 percent. Despite this progress, 542,000 children remain in foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption. Attention should be focused on promoting the adoption of older children, as half of the children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older. SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF ADOPTION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS PROGRAM. The text chunk discusses amendments to Section 473A of the Social Security Act related to foster child adoptions and older child adoptions in the State. The amendments include changes in the number of adoptions exceeding base numbers for fiscal years and reauthorization of the adoption incentive payments program. The amendments to Section 473A of the Social Security Act involve determining foster child adoptions, special needs adoptions, and older child adoptions in a State based on data from fiscal years 2002 through 2007. The Secretary will use data meeting system requirements reported by the State for approval by August 1 of the following fiscal year. The amendments to Section 473A of the Social Security Act involve calculating foster child adoptions, special needs adoptions, and older child adoptions in a State based on data from fiscal years 2002 through 2007. The formula includes a base amount for older child adoptions and adjustments for subsequent fiscal years. The amendments to Section 473A of the Social Security Act involve calculating foster child adoptions, special needs adoptions, and older child adoptions in a State based on data from fiscal years 2002 through 2007. The formula includes a base amount for older child adoptions and adjustments for subsequent fiscal years, with specific criteria for each fiscal year. The amendments to Section 473A of the Social Security Act involve calculating foster child adoptions, special needs adoptions, and older child adoptions in a State based on data from fiscal years 2002 through 2007. The formula includes a base amount for older child adoptions and adjustments for subsequent fiscal years, with specific criteria for each fiscal year. The base number of older child adoptions for a State is determined by the number of older child adoptions in the State in fiscal year 2002, and for subsequent fiscal years, it is based on the highest number of older child adoptions in the period from fiscal year 2002 to the year before the subsequent fiscal year. The term 'older child adoptions' refers to the final adoption of a child aged 9 or older who was in foster care under state supervision or had an adoption assistance agreement. In subsection (i)(4), the time frame was changed from 1998 through 2000 to 2004 through 2006, and subsection (j) was removed. Additionally, funding of $43,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 through 2008 was added. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report by October 1, 2004, to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on State efforts to promote adoption and other permanency options for children in foster care, focusing on older children. The report will review State waiver programs and consult with various stakeholders to identify effective approaches. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO SUBMIT AFCARS REPORT. Section 474 of the Social Security Act is amended to require States to submit data for a data collection system within 30 days of the due date. Failure to submit the data within 6 months will result in reduced payments to the State. The Secretary shall reduce payments to the State under this part if data is not submitted within 6 months, with reductions increasing for subsequent 6-month periods until compliance is met. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on October 1, 2003."
