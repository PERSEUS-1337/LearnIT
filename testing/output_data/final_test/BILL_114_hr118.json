The \"Surface Transportation and Taxation Equity Act\" proposes reducing federal fuel taxes based on increases in state fuel taxes. The \"Surface Transportation and Taxation Equity Act\" suggests decreasing federal fuel taxes based on state fuel tax increases. The decrease will not go below 2 cents per gallon and will be determined by the applicable State tax rate increase for the fuel or liquid. Any increase in State fuel or liquid tax rates must be accounted for under this subsection if State law requires it. An \"applicable State\" is determined based on where the fuel or liquid is sold or used. Subsection (a) does not apply if the State has not entered into an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation. The State must maintain the interstate highway system under an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation. Amendments are made to section 9503 of the Code regarding reduction in transfer rates based on state tax rate changes. Amendments to section 9503 of the Code define 'aggregate reduced tax rate' and 'aggregate unreduced tax rate' for liquid or fuel taxes after application of section 4106. Amendments to section 9503 of the Code redefine terms for liquid or fuel taxes, and update the table for subpart B of part III of subchapter A of chapter 32.
