    "content": "The task involves program synthesis with a reward function to find programs with maximal rewards. An iterative optimization scheme called priority queue training (PQT) is introduced, where an RNN is trained on a dataset of best programs and new programs are synthesized by sampling from the RNN. PQT outperforms genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning baselines on the BF programming language. Adding a program length penalty to the reward function helps in synthesizing short, human-readable programs. Recent interest in developing neural models for program synthesis has led to successful attempts at using neural networks to induce programs from input-output examples and unstructured text. However, these approaches often require restrictive programming syntax and supervisory signals in the form of ground-truth programs. We propose using the BF programming language for program synthesis under the reinforcement learning paradigm, where a reward signal is computed by a solution checker. This approach allows for flexibility in searching for short and efficient programs without the need for desired programs or correct outputs during training. Two approaches are studied, including a policy gradient algorithm that trains a recurrent neural network to generate programs token by token. The BF programming language is used for program synthesis with a reinforcement learning approach. Two methods are compared: a recurrent neural network (RNN) generating programs and a priority queue training (PQT) algorithm. PQT outperforms genetic algorithm (GA) and policy gradient (PG) methods in generating effective BF programs. The BF language is Turing complete with a minimalist syntax of 8 operations. The BF language's minimalist syntax simplifies program generation compared to higher-level languages. Various tasks were considered, with search algorithms proving effective in finding correct programs. Key contributions include a learning framework for program synthesis without needing ground-truth programs, advocating for BF as a benchmark environment, and proposing an efficient search algorithm using a priority queue and an RNN. The experimental methodology compares program synthesis methods like genetic algorithm and policy gradient. A recurrent network trained with priority queue training outperforms baselines. Traditional techniques in program synthesis have practical applications in education and programming assistance. Probabilistic program induction in machine learning has been successful in various settings. There is growing interest in using neural networks to induce and execute programs. The approach uses a Turing complete language, does not require existing programs or stack-traces, and only needs a verifier to score outputs. It has shown promising results in tasks like binary search, sorting arrays, Q&A, and filling missing values in tables. The approach presented in the current text chunk discusses the use of a PG approach for program synthesis, inspired by neural architecture search and neural combinatorial optimization. It also introduces the PQT algorithm, which utilizes a priority queue of top-K programs to enhance PG with off-policy training, similar to the cross-entropy method. The text chunk discusses the use of a PG approach for program synthesis and introduces the PQT algorithm, which enhances PG with off-policy training. It compares the technique to genetic algorithms for program synthesis in the BF language and highlights the benefits of using neural networks for transfer learning. The implementation includes a generative model of programs as an RNN that emits BF language characters one at a time. The RNN program synthesizer uses a special START symbol as input for the first time step and stops when it generates an EOS symbol or exceeds the maximum program length. Predictions are sampled from a multinomial distribution with shared weights across timesteps. Two training algorithms, policy gradient, and priority queue training, are studied. The RNN is treated as a policy parametrized by \u03b8, with actions representing symbols in the BF language. The RNN program synthesizer uses a special START symbol as input and stops when it generates an EOS symbol or exceeds the maximum program length. The goal is to learn a policy that assigns a high probability to plausible programs using the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize parameters \u03b8 for maximizing expected rewards. Stochastic gradient descent is used to iteratively refine \u03b8 by estimating the gradient through Monte Carlo sampling. The paper introduces a method to reduce the high variance in estimating the policy gradient by using a baseline term. It also involves training an RNN with a buffer of top-K best programs to maximize the probability of these programs. The paper introduces a method to reduce high variance in estimating policy gradient by using a baseline term and training an RNN with a buffer of top-K best programs to maximize their probability. The RNN and priority queue work together, with the priority queue providing better training targets. The objective for Priority Queue Training (PQT) is log-likelihood. When combined with Policy Gradient (PG) objectives, their gradients are added together for a joint gradient. The priority queue component stabilizes the policy and reduces catastrophic forgetting. Entropy exploration and regularization are also used to encourage model uncertainty and exploration. The optimization goal is to maximize the objective by assigning scalar weights to different components like PG, PQT, and entropy. Distributed training is used to speed up training by utilizing an asynchronous distributed setup with a parameter server storing shared model parameters. In an asynchronous distributed setup, a parameter server stores shared model parameters for synthesizer replicas. Each replica samples episodes, computes gradients, and updates shared parameters. Replicas have their own priority queue. The effectiveness of the program synthesis setup is assessed by discovering BF programs, a minimalist Turing complete language with 8 low-level operations. The BF language is a Turing complete language with 8 low-level operations represented by characters. Programs operate on a memory tape and manipulate a data pointer. Memory values are accessed by shifting the data pointer left or right. BF programs can read from an input stream and write to an output stream. In BF programs, inputs and outputs are passed through the memory tape using a task-dependent base B for integers. The interpreter writes zeros at the end of the input stream and many programs utilize this feature to clear memory. Memory values are typically interpreted as characters for string tasks. Programs are fixed length with many characters serving as no-ops, easily padded out with operations like <, unmatched braces, or opposite pairs like +- or <>. BF's syntax is simple with unmatched braces being the only syntax error. Turning off strict mode in the interpreter makes synthesis easier. Programs are evaluated on test cases from the task, with scores summed for the final reward. The program is treated as a function of input. In code synthesis, a candidate program P is treated as a function of input I to compute output Q. A graded reward function is necessary for learning, as 0/1 rewards are too sparse. The method presented offers a way to compute rewards for tasks, not relying on any specific form of reward. The scoring of program outputs is straightforward for tasks in the polynomial time class. In code synthesis, a candidate program P is treated as a function of input I to compute output Q. To score program outputs, a continuous comparison metric between Q and Q* is used to reduce reward sparsity. Test cases are sampled from task T, which can be static or stochastic. A standardized scoring function S(Q, Q*) is defined for all tasks. Total reward for the program is calculated using a scaling factor \u03b6 to keep rewards in the range [-1, 1]. The agent receives Rtot as terminal reward. When generating variable length programs, a program length bonus is added to the total reward to give preference to shorter programs. Negative rewards are assigned for syntax errors and programs exceeding 5000 execution steps. The effectiveness of priority queue training is compared against genetic algorithm (GA) and policy gradient (PG) baselines in the RL paradigm. Priority Queue Training (PQT) is compared to genetic algorithm (GA) and policy gradient (PG) baselines in the RL paradigm. Benchmark coding tasks are used to compare methods, with the best program found during training used as the final program. Hyperparameters are tuned on a subset of tasks before training on all tasks. Performance is measured by success rate after a set number of executed programs. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search on reverse and remove-char tasks. The hyperparameters for PG, PQT, and GA are tuned using grid search. Parameters such as learning rate, entropy regularizer, loss multiplier, population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate are explored within specific ranges. For PQT, a maximum queue size of 10 is set to balance memorization and training effectiveness. Specific parameter settings are provided for PG+PQT and PQT methods. The hyperparameters for PG, PQT, and GA are tuned using grid search. Parameters such as learning rate, entropy regularizer, population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate are explored within specific ranges. For PG and PQT methods, a 2-layer LSTM RNN architecture is used with 35 units in each layer. The outputs are passed through a linear layer with 8 or 9 outputs for the softmax policy. Additional hyperparameters include gradient norm clipping threshold, parameter initialization factor, optimizer, and decay for the exponential moving average baseline. Various strategies for making test cases are explored. In experiments, different strategies for generating test cases were tested. Solutions were only found when using static test cases. All programs are evaluated on the same randomly generated test inputs. Potential overfitting issues were addressed by running synthesized code on a large set of held-out evaluation test cases. The success rates of different algorithms in finding the correct program after a set number of executed programs are compared. Training runs are considered successful if a program solves all test cases for the task, with a maximum number of programs executed before stopping. Genetic algorithm is used with different maximum NPE values for tuning and evaluation. In experiments, a genetic algorithm is used with a maximum NPE of 5M for tuning and 20M for evaluation. Program length is fixed at 100 characters with a search space size of approximately 10^90. Success rates from tuning tasks vary between different algorithms due to smaller NPE and different test cases used. Initialization, sampling noise, and weight updates affect synthesis methods.

The success rates of algorithms are compared in TAB2, showing PQT outperforming PG and GA in training and eval averages. Shortest possible code strings are generated using PG+PQT with a length bonus to encourage code efficiency. The agent trains on tasks with a maximum NPE of 500M, using alternative hyperparameters for code simplification. Simplified programs are shown in Table 4, with some programs overfitting their tasks. The agent synthesizes programs for problems, highlighting tasks with code solutions that overfit. In this paper, the task of learning to synthesize programs with a defined reward function is explored using an RNN trained with a priority queue training method. Experimental results show that this method outperforms vanilla policy gradient and genetic algorithm baselines. The algorithm is able to bootstrap itself to a solution from an empty buffer and randomly initialized RNN. Further research is needed to better understand this surprising standalone search algorithm. The coding environment complements the PQT algorithm for finding code with non-zero reward through random search. A BF program is demonstrated to reverse a list, using a non-symmetric distance function computed from an extension of Hamming distance. The Hamming distance provides additional information for conveying how many increment or decrement operations to use in various places, making the reward space smoother. The distance function adds maximum character distance for missing or extra positions in Q and Q*. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes a fitness function by simulating sexual reproduction in a population of genomes. Each iteration generates a new population through parent selection, mating, and mutation steps. Parent selection involves randomly sampling parents using roulette selection based on fitness.

Mating involves single point crossover to create two children. Mutation introduces random modifications to each child using the primaryobjects mutation function.
