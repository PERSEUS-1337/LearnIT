    "content": "NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, designed for regular servicing by astronauts. A defective mirror was discovered, but astronauts on a servicing mission in 1993 installed corrective optics, leading to years of scientific accomplishments. Additional servicing missions in 1997, 1999, and 2002 replaced aging hardware and installed advanced instruments. Two planned shuttle missions in 2004 and 2010 were canceled after the Columbia accident in 2003. Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990 and underwent several servicing missions. A servicing mission is scheduled for October 8, 2008. Hubble's location above Earth's atmosphere enhances image clarity for astronomical observations. It was designed to operate for 15 years. Websites provide information about the telescope and its discoveries. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, was designed to operate for 15 years. NASA planned to extend its operational period until 2010 but funding constraints led to discussions of ending its operations earlier to focus on building the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for infrared observations. The JWST mission was rescheduled for launch in 2013. Shuttle crews during servicing visits repair or replace aging equipment on Hubble. During servicing visits to Hubble, shuttle crews repair or replace aging equipment and install updated scientific instruments. Hubble has six gyroscopes, but only two are functional, with one degraded. New techniques allow operation on just two gyroscopes, with one kept in reserve. Solar arrays generate electricity stored in batteries, as Hubble lacks a propulsion system and relies on the shuttle to boost its orbit. Tasks for the SM-4 mission included replacing gyroscopes, batteries, a fine guidance sensor, thermal protection blankets, boosting orbit, and installing new scientific instruments. The 2008 servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope will attempt to repair malfunctioning instruments, including the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The mission was not originally planned to repair these instruments, but due to their importance, repairs will be attempted. Following the Columbia shuttle disaster in 2003, NASA grounded the shuttle system and canceled the 2010 Hubble retrieval mission due to safety concerns. The decision was made by NASA administrator Mr. O'Keefe, citing the lack of a safe haven on the ISS and the changes needed to meet the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. NASA administrator Mr. O'Keefe's decision to cancel the 2010 Hubble retrieval mission was influenced by safety concerns following the Columbia shuttle disaster. The decision was also driven by the lack of a safe haven on the ISS and the need to meet the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. President Bush's new exploration initiative further shifted program and funding priorities, with funding primarily coming from canceling or delaying other NASA programs. The timing of NASA Administrator Mr. O'Keefe's decision to cancel the 2010 Hubble retrieval mission raised concerns about the President's initiative. Some praised the decision, while others criticized it for prioritizing new exploration goals over Hubble's research. Initial opposition focused on reversing the decision and proceeding with a shuttle mission to Hubble, with debates comparing the risks involved. NASA's Chief Scientist, Dr. John Grunsfeld, suggested the need for a second shuttle ready in case of a mission to Hubble. In 2004, NASA considered options for extending Hubble's life, including shuttle and robotic missions. Congress allocated $291 million for a Hubble servicing mission in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The H.Rept. 108-792 report emphasized the importance of a successful servicing mission to Hubble, without specifying if it should be done with the space shuttle or a robotic mission. The final NRC report recommended a shuttle servicing mission for Hubble, stating that robotic servicing was unlikely to extend its science life. Dr. Michael Griffin, the new NASA Administrator, planned to reconsider using the shuttle for servicing Hubble after his confirmation hearing in April 2005. In April 2005, NASA Administrator Dr. Michael Griffin planned to reconsider using the shuttle for servicing Hubble. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 called for a shuttle servicing mission after the successful post-Columbia flights. In October 2006, NASA announced a Hubble servicing mission scheduled for October 8, 2008, on space shuttle Atlantis, with a total cost of $900 million. NASA planned a $200 million budget for gyroscopes, batteries, and instruments for the 2008 Hubble servicing mission. An additional $100 million was allocated for external tanks and boosters, with $100 million for shuttle launch processing. The mission aimed to extend Hubble's operation until 2013, impacting funding for other astronomy missions. The end of Hubble expenditures was expected to fund the James Webb Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope is facing uncertain funding, with Hubble costs expected to be $115 million in FY2011, $95 million in FY2012, and $94 million in FY2013. Plans for deorbiting Hubble are unclear, as the shuttle no longer retrieves it. NASA considers attaching a propulsion module for a controlled deorbit to prevent debris in populated areas. Analysis shows Hubble is unlikely to make an uncontrolled reentry until at least 2020. NASA now believes that Hubble will need to be deorbited at some point to avoid an uncontrolled reentry, with the issue considered beyond the budget horizon. Boosting Hubble's orbit during the 2008 servicing mission will delay reentry further."
