The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2011\" introduces a total coverage option for crop insurance, allowing producers to purchase additional coverage based on individual or area yield and loss basis, with a maximum coverage level of 85 percent. The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2011\" allows producers to purchase crop insurance coverage not exceeding 85 percent of individual yield or 95 percent of area yield. The Corporation provides information on catastrophic risk and additional coverage options. Producers can opt for total coverage in combination with existing insurance plans. The \"Crop Risk Options Plan Act of 2011\" allows producers to purchase insurance coverage that can pay indemnities equal to the deductible if area losses exceed 10 percent of normal levels. Indemnities cannot exceed the amount of coverage purchased. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include new provisions regarding premium payments and coverage options. Premium payments can now be based on individual yield and loss basis as well as an area yield and loss basis. In the case of total coverage option, the corporation will pay at least 60 percent of the additional premium. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation will provide additional coverage based on individual and area yield and loss basis within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation will adjust actual production history calculations using a seven-year Olympic average and data from the Risk Management Agency or the National Agricultural Statistics Service."
