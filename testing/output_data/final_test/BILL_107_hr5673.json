    "content": "The \"Early Education Employee Benefit Act of 2002\" allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to eligible States and political subdivisions to establish partnerships with private partners for reducing costs of early education or to help with building new early education facilities. To receive a grant under the \"Early Education Employee Benefit Act of 2002,\" a State or political subdivision must submit an application to the Secretary with details such as the lead agency, program description, funding sources for the non-Federal share, and a commitment to contribute non-Federal funds. The subdivision receiving a grant must contribute 50% from non-Federal funds, not mandate on-site early education, and use the grant to supplement, not replace, existing spending on early education. SEC. 4. SELECTION OF APPLICANTS TO RECEIVE GRANTS. The Secretary will prioritize eligible applicants who can increase the number of employees and members receiving Early Education Benefits, propose innovative public-private partnerships for replicable early education programs, ensure sustainability beyond the grant period, consult with relevant agencies, and demonstrate the ability to provide Early Education Benefits. In section 5(1), Early Education Benefits are provided through Agreements to employees of private employers with fewer than 50 employees, or with funds for Early Education Start-up Grants to such employers. Applicants must have experience in early childhood issues and working with the business community, or have an agreement with a nonprofit entity for program implementation. SEC. 5. USES OF FUNDS. Recipients of grants must use funds for Early Education Benefit Agreements or to establish new early education facilities, with a limit of 5% for administrative costs. To be eligible for funds under a grant, a private partner must enter into an Early Education Benefit Agreement with the recipient, ensuring payment of a portion of the cost of the benefit. This includes creating new early education facilities for children under 2 years old or with disabilities, or those available during nontraditional work hours. The Early Education Benefit Agreement requires the private partner to prioritize employees with lower incomes for the benefit. If the benefit is limited to specific sites, there must be at least one provider near the employee's residence or workplace. The Early Education Benefit Agreement mandates that the provider must be accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children or the National Association for Family Child Care. Additionally, the early education paid for by the benefit must be provided by a state-licensed or regulated provider. The agreement also requires a detailed description of the benefit, financial contributions from the private partner and grant recipient, and the expected number of employees or members to benefit. In selecting private partners for Early Education Benefit Agreements, priority is given to those making larger financial contributions, with fewer employees or members, and offering benefits on a sliding scale. The benefit available to employees and members is on a sliding scale inversely proportional to their earned income level, and is offered by private partners with family-friendly personnel policies. SEC. 7. EARLY EDUCATION START-UP GRANTS. Private partners receiving funds from grants must agree to subsidize attendance for children of lower-paid employees and contribute at least one-third of the costs for acquiring, building, and renovating the facility. Priority for funding will be given to private partners creating facilities for early education serving children under 2 years old or children with disabilities. Private partners eligible for Early Education Start-up Grants must operate accredited facilities with a low child-to-adult ratio and demonstrate high-quality early education programs. They should also contribute a larger share of non-governmental funds and have policies supporting work-life balance for employees. SEC. 8. REPORTS. The Secretary will require grant recipients to submit annual reports including details on Early Education Benefit Agreements, Start-Up Grants, private partners, employees receiving benefits, and private spending. The Secretary will submit biennial reports to Congress summarizing information on private spending and investment in early education facilities, as well as details on private partners continuing to provide benefits after grant participation. The reports will also include summaries of received reports, implementation of the Act, and its impact on employees' access to early education programs. The Secretary will submit biennial reports to Congress summarizing private spending and investment in early education facilities, as well as the impact on employees' access to early education programs for their children. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.
