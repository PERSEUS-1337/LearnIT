It is crucial to support private landowner-centered efforts to protect and enhance natural resources. There is a need for a program that provides technical biological information to assist with habitat restoration projects on private lands through public-private partnerships. Since 1987, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program has been a successful cooperative conservation initiative, involving various stakeholders to restore wetland and wildlife habitats on private lands. Executive Order No. 13352 encourages collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal governments, private entities, and individuals to implement conservation programs and reduce endangered species listings. The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program has successfully restored 677,000 acres of wetland, 1,253,700 acres of prairie and native grasslands, and 5,560 miles of riparian and in-stream habitat since 1987. The purpose of this Act is to enhance fish and wildlife habitats on private land through cost-effective projects in collaboration with landowners. The Act aims to enhance fish and wildlife habitats on private land through cost-effective projects in collaboration with landowners. The Act defines \"Federal trust species\" as various protected species and includes the term \"habitat enhancement\" as activities to manipulate native habitats for the benefit of species. The Act defines \"Federal trust species\" as protected species and includes \"habitat enhancement\" activities to manipulate habitats for species, such as increasing hydroperiod and water depth, improving waterfowl habitat, establishing water level management for native plants, creating mud flat conditions for shorebirds, and implementing grazing systems for grassland nesting birds. The term \"habitat enhancement\" includes activities like burning native grass communities, brush shearing, and forest management to promote specific plant community stages. Exclusions are regularly scheduled maintenance activities like mowing or spraying unwanted vegetation. Habitat establishment involves manipulating the project site to create new habitat, such as shallow water impoundments and side channel spawning areas. Habitat improvement focuses on restoring or providing conditions for native plant and animal communities. Habitat restoration involves periodic manipulations to maintain intended habitat conditions. Habitat restoration involves manipulating the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site to return natural functions to lost or degraded native habitat, including activities like removing tile drains or plugging drainage ditches in wetlands. Habitat restoration includes activities like restoring degraded wetlands, returning meanders to straightened streams, burning invasive grass communities to reestablish native plants, and planting native plant communities. If restoring the site to its original condition is not possible, activities that repair original habitat functions using native vegetation are also considered. Habitat restoration involves using native vegetation, such as installing water control structures and habitat diversity structures in streams. Private land may also require the removal of disturbing elements to allow native habitats to reestablish. Private land is any land not owned by the Federal Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, including tribal land and Hawaiian homeland. A project is a project carried out under the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program provides assistance to private landowners for voluntary projects benefiting Federal trust species through habitat improvement, restoration, enhancement, and establishment. An authorization of up to $75,000,000 is allocated annually for fiscal years 2006 through 2011 to carry out this program."
