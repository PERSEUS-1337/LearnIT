Without these services, seniors may face negative health outcomes and may need to rely on Medicaid for long-term care expenses. Targeting community-based services to at-risk seniors can help them avoid depleting their assets and becoming Medicaid dependent. SEC. 1859A. COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN DEMONSTRATION. The Secretary will establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan (CBI-SNP) demonstration program to provide home and community-based care to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through agreements with MA organizations offering eligible MA plans. The program will be limited to five MA plans. Eligible MA plans must include additional items and services beyond regular coverage. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan (CBI-SNP) demonstration program provides coverage for long-term care services and supports such as homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, adult day care services, and safety equipment. Eligible MA organizations offering specialized MA plans can participate in the program. Eligible MA organizations offering specialized MA plans for special needs individuals must have experience working with low-income seniors groups, be located in a State participating in the CBI-SNP demonstration program, and meet additional criteria set by the Secretary. Eligible Medicare beneficiaries are those who can enroll in an eligible MA plan under the CBI-SNP program. The CBI-SNP demonstration program is for subsidy eligible individuals who are unable to perform 2 or more daily activities, not eligible for Medicaid, and are age 65 or older. The Secretary will establish payment rates for MA organizations offering eligible plans under this program, in addition to existing payments. The CBI-SNP demonstration program provides additional payments to MA organizations for treating eligible Medicare beneficiaries, capped at $400 per beneficiary per month. Eligible beneficiaries have a special election period outside of the annual enrollment periods. The CBI-SNP demonstration program allows beneficiaries to switch from non-participating MA plans to participating ones, or from original Medicare to an MA plan in the program. The Secretary will educate eligible beneficiaries on the program's availability through various organizations. The program must be implemented by a specific deadline. The CBI-SNP demonstration program must be implemented by January 1 of the second year after enactment and will run for five years. The Secretary has the authority to extend or expand the program based on a report, potentially increasing expenditures under Medicare. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be evaluated independently to assess its impact on patient care and hospitalizations. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be evaluated to determine its impact on reducing hospitalizations, nursing facility admissions, spend down of income and assets for Medicaid eligibility, improving quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries, and enhancing caregiver satisfaction. The evaluation process will follow specific guidelines. The Secretary will establish goals and criteria for the CBI-SNP demonstration program, implement data collection requirements, and recognize definitions, benefits, and program details. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with evaluation results and recommendations for the CBI-SNP demonstration program. Budget neutrality will be ensured in payments under the program. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with evaluation results and recommendations for the CBI-SNP demonstration program.
