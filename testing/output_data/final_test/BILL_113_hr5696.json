The Act, titled the \"Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\", outlines findings related to the Joint Declaration between the UK and China regarding Hong Kong's sovereignty and autonomy under the Basic Law. The \"Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\" protects Hong Kong's autonomy, prohibits interference from the central Government of China, guarantees rights to free speech and religion, maintains Hong Kong's capitalist system, and upholds the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies to Hong Kong, stating that the Chief Executive and Legislative Council should be selected or elected through universal suffrage. The National People's Congress Standing Committee is involved in the process. The National People's Congress Standing Committee decided in 2007 that Hong Kong could have universal suffrage for electing the Chief Executive in 2017 and the Legislative Council in 2020. Currently, the Chief Executive is chosen by a 1,200-member Election Committee, with candidates needing support from one-eighth of the members. In 2014, it was determined that the 2017 Chief Executive election could be held by universal suffrage, but voters could only choose from two candidates. The Hong Kong government's electoral reform plans limit voters to choosing from two to three candidates selected by a nominating committee controlled by pro-Beijing members. International standards guarantee the right to vote in genuine elections without unreasonable restrictions. Hong Kong residents have peacefully expressed dissatisfaction with the reform plans. The Hong Kong protests in August 2014 called for genuine elections meeting international standards. Reports show police using tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, failing to protect them from counter-protestors, some with gang affiliations. Accusations of excessive force by police are under investigation. The United States has close ties with Hong Kong, with 60,000 US citizens and 1,400 businesses there. Hong Kong is the US's 18th largest trade partner and 9th largest goods export market. Its status as an international finance center with protected rights and freedoms has led to stability and prosperity. The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires reports on conditions in Hong Kong of interest to the US. The last report on conditions in Hong Kong was issued on June 30, 2007. Failure to establish democratic options by 2017 and 2020 would erode Hong Kong's autonomy. The United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed China's compliance with international law in October 2014.
