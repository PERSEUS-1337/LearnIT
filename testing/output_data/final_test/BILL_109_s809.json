    "content": "The \"Access to Legal Pharmaceuticals Act\" protects individuals' rights to religious belief, worship, and access to legal contraception. Pharmacies have duties regarding pharmacists refusing to fill valid prescriptions. The \"Access to Legal Pharmaceuticals Act\" requires pharmacies to ensure that if a pharmacist refuses to fill a valid prescription based on personal belief, another pharmacist must fill it without delay. If a product is not in stock and a pharmacist refuses to order it based on personal belief or pharmacy policy, they must still fulfill the prescription. The pharmacy must inform the individual if a product is not in stock and offer to order it without delay by another pharmacist. Pharmacist conduct must not prevent individuals from filling valid prescriptions. The pharmacy must not prevent individuals from filling valid prescriptions by refusing to transfer prescription information, subjecting them to humiliation, or breaching medical confidentiality. Subsection (a)(2) applies only when ordering a particular product for an individual with a valid prescription. Enforcement of the requirement for pharmacies to fill valid prescriptions includes civil penalties up to $5,000 per day of violation and $500,000 for all violations in a single proceeding. Individuals aggrieved by violations can seek relief through civil action, including damages and injunctive relief. The civil action against a pharmacy for violations can include damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. The action must be filed within five years of the alleged violation. Definitions include the roles of pharmacist and pharmacy in dispensing prescription drugs. The term 'prescription drug' refers to a drug subject to specific regulations, while 'prescription device' is a restricted device. 'Product' encompasses both prescription drugs and devices. 'Valid' prescription means compliance with applicable laws. The term 'without delay' for pharmacy filling or ordering prescriptions means within the usual timeframe. The effective date for the amendment is 30 days after enactment. Upon the expiration of 30 days after the enactment of this Act, the amendment will take effect regardless of any guidance or final rule issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
