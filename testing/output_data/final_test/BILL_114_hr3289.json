    "content": "The \"Natural Gas Environmental and Economic Security Act\" is introduced to amend the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 by adding measures for gas waste reduction and enhancement of gas measuring and reporting. The Secretary is required to issue rules for reducing and preventing gas waste, including capturing 99% of gas produced annually within 5 years. Flaring of gas is mandated when capture is not feasible, and drilling permits must meet specific requirements. The Natural Gas Environmental and Economic Security Act mandates infrastructure for gas capture, public comments for new wells, and prohibits flaring from new wells within 2 years. Operators must submit gas capture plans and meet gas capture requirements. The legislation requires operators to demonstrate yearly decrease in gas flaring and set performance standards for minimizing gas loss from various equipment. The Secretary mandates the replacement of high-bleed gas-actuated pneumatic devices with low-bleed or no-bleed devices and sets performance standards to minimize gas loss from various procedures. Operators must have leak detection programs using infrared cameras. The Secretary requires leak detection programs using infrared cameras and mandates repairs for any leaks found within 2 weeks. Recordkeeping is also required for equipment maintenance, leak detection and repair, venting events, flaring events, and other necessary operations. Gas measuring, reporting, and transparency requirements are also established. The Secretary will establish new requirements for measuring and reporting gas production and disposition to accurately track consumption, venting, flaring, and fugitive releases. Operators must measure gas production accurately, install metering devices for vented and flared gas, and report volumes to the Secretary. The Secretary will require operators to report gas volumes measured for production and disposition, including vented and flared volumes, as well as fugitive releases. All new data, including calculated fugitive releases and gas lost to venting and flaring, will be made publicly available online without charge in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable format. The Secretary will require operators to report gas volumes measured for production and disposition, including vented and flared volumes, as well as fugitive releases. The requirements established by the Secretary shall apply to the construction and operation of any covered operation initiated after the issuance of rules, and enforcement mechanisms will be included in the rules for consistent enforcement. The rules issued by the Secretary will include enforcement mechanisms for covered operations not complying with requirements. These mechanisms will involve civil penalties for unauthorized venting and flaring, including production restrictions and penalties equal to 3 times the market value of the gas. Additionally, civil penalties will apply for noncompliance with new or existing procedures. In addition to penalties under section 109, enforcement mechanisms for covered operations will include production restrictions or monetary penalties proportional to market conditions. Covered operations refer to all oil and gas operations subject to mineral leasing law or title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, including production, storage, gathering, processing, and handling operations. Flaring is defined as the intentional burning of gas. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions related to gas emissions in oil and gas operations, including intentional and controlled burning of gas, fugitive release, gas capture plan, gas release, and venting. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the table of contents related to gas emissions in oil and gas operations. The Secretary of the Interior must issue rules on gas waste reduction and reporting within 1 year of the enactment of the Act. A report to Congress on fugitive releases and gas venting/flaring must be submitted within 6 months after receiving data on covered operations. The Secretary of the Interior must issue rules on gas waste reduction and reporting within 1 year of the Act's enactment. A report to Congress on fugitive releases and gas venting/flaring must be submitted within 6 months after receiving data on covered operations. The rules must include additional regulations to curtail venting, flaring, and fugitive releases, as well as recommendations for new statutory authority to limit these activities. Rules described in the report must be issued within 1 year of its submission. SEC. 3. ROYALTY COLLECTION FOR ALL GAS PRODUCED ON FEDERAL LANDS. Royalties for gas production on federal lands, including beneficial use gas and gas lost during operations, are assessed except in acute emergencies. Gas royalties on federal lands are typically assessed, except in cases of acute emergencies where gas is vented or flared for up to 48 hours, or injected into the ground to enhance oil or gas production. Amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act ensure royalties are assessed for oil and gas, excluding certain types of gas as specified in the Natural Gas Environmental and Economic Security Act. Amendments to various sections of the Mineral Leasing Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act remove references to oil or gas being removed or sold, ensuring royalties are assessed for all oil and gas production on federal lands. Amendments to the Continental Shelf Lands Act remove references to oil or gas being removed or sold, ensuring royalties are assessed for all oil and gas production on federal lands. The amendments made by this section apply to leases issued after the enactment of this Act."
