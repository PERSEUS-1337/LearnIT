Two forms of symmetry are explored, implemented through convolution to achieve effective generalization in rule learning. Deep Learning has been successful with convolution, capturing translational symmetry in images. Researchers aim to exploit additional symmetries like rotation or scale. Incorporating symmetries from symbolic processes into neural architectures improves generalization on unseen tasks. Convolution-based models outperform standard approaches in handling elements and structures not seen during training. Convolution-based models outperform standard approaches in rule learning tasks, including a simplified form of the SCAN task and context-free language learning. Symbolic architectures represent structured combinations of symbols, allowing for complex structure manipulation without focusing on the meaning of the symbols themselves. Thought is viewed as algebraic in nature, following formal rules. Thought is seen as a form of algebra where formal rules operate over symbolic expressions, allowing for systematic processing of values across different contexts. Connectionist approaches have been criticized for lacking systematicity, as neural networks may not model cognitive capacities exhibiting certain symmetries. Understanding and designing neural architectures around these symmetries could help build systems that demonstrate systematicity. The concept of systematicity in neural architectures has drawn scrutiny from researchers. Pullum & Scholz argue that the definition is vague, but understanding symmetries in symbolic processes is valuable. Two types of symmetry are explored: permutations of symbols and equivalence between memory slots. The relation between symbols and referents is arbitrary, allowing for equivalent results regardless of the names used. The text discusses the importance of treating symbols consistently in data structures like stacks and queues. It explores using convolution to implement symmetry in architectures, connecting symbolic processes with spatial representations. The first symmetry considered is the arbitrary correspondence between symbols and referents, allowing for permutations of symbols as symmetries. The text discusses the arbitrary nature of symbol permutations as symmetries in data structures. While this symmetry is crucial for human cognition, it can hinder effective learning in neural networks that require specific differentiation in inputs. The text discusses how infants were able to generalize learned rules to novel stimuli by treating syllables symbolically, allowing for abstraction and application to any syllable. This behavior was not replicated in a recurrent network architecture, which lacked the symmetry needed for generalization to unseen syllables. The architecture involves weight sharing between syllables, implemented as a 1D convolution followed by maxpooling and softmax. Input is a 12x3 array of binary values representing syllables and time steps. Convolution treats syllables as positions and time steps as channels. Output has two channels, serving as logits for binary outputs. Unlike typical language sequence convolutions, weight sharing occurs between symbols and temporal information is encoded in channels, making the model not invariant to time translations. The model architecture involves weight sharing between syllables, implemented as a 1D convolution followed by maxpooling and softmax. Input is a 12x3 array of binary values representing syllables and time steps. Convolution treats syllables as positions and time steps as channels. Output has two channels, serving as logits for binary outputs. The model is not invariant to time translations but is instead invariant to permutations of symbols. Training and test inputs are taken from the Marcus et al. (1999) paper, where the model is trained to distinguish ABB sequences from ABA sequences. The architecture applied to the rule learning task consists of convolution followed by max-pooling and softmax. The model architecture involves weight sharing through convolution, max-pooling, and softmax. The convolutional net shows perfect generalization by applying the same function to each syllable, unable to discriminate between syllables but capturing temporal structure. This approach mirrors infants learning algebra-like rules about relationships between placeholders. The convolutional network architecture involves weight sharing to learn functions sensitive to abstract structure rather than specific syllables. Lake & Baroni (2018) studied the systematicity of recurrent networks in a task called SCAN, finding that sequence-to-sequence models performed well on closely related test instances. The study found that while the network performed well on test instances similar to the training data, it struggled with generalization outside the training distribution. The SCAN task required solutions for handling various challenges systematically, such as parsing instruction sequences and composing items using an encoder-decoder architecture with convolutional filters. In the decoder, actions are predicted by taking a convolution of the hidden state, and recurrence between time steps is also a convolution. The focus is on learning to compose instructions like jump with modifiers like twice systematically. A dataset is constructed with two-word instructions from a vocabulary of commands and modifiers, translated into corresponding actions repeated the appropriate number of times. The network struggled with generalization outside the training distribution, as shown in the SCAN task. The network uses a recurrent-convolutional architecture to learn how to associate modifiers with actions systematically. Each symbol has two input representations, one for structural information and one for content. This approach allows the network to discover the best way to represent this information without hard-coding it. The recurrent-convolutional architecture in the model allows information flow from inputs to output logits through convolutions, ensuring invariance to permutations of output symbols. Hidden states consist of units with 5 channels by 11 positions, using one-dimensional convolutions for recurrence and projecting output logits. Two embeddings x and y are learned for each word in the encoder, enhancing representation learning. The decoder in the model uses convolutional filters to project hidden channels and predict the next hidden state. Targets are encoded as one-hot vectors, and the loss function includes cross entropy and an L1 regularizer. Results show that the architecture exploiting convolutional symmetry generalizes systematically, allowing the net to associate commands with actions and modifiers with abstract structures. In this section, the role of symmetry in structuring memory for handling long-range dependencies within hierarchical structures in natural language grammars is considered. The use of convolution allows for separating memory contents from how it is manipulated, particularly in a reverse recall task that demonstrates the operation of such memory. The reverse recall task demonstrates how memory operates with long-range dependencies in natural language grammars. It shows how number agreement is maintained even with the insertion of additional material, such as relative clauses. The tennis player's racquet is surprisingly cheap. Language users must maintain trace of multiple dependencies in sentences like this. Processing in a last-in-first-out manner is crucial for understanding complex structures. Context Free Grammars are commonly used to generate sentences with production rules. Context Free Grammars describe how the start symbol is expanded into sequences of terminal symbols without regard for context. The grammar in Figure 3 generates palindromes with a single 'o' at the center. This process is similar to a pushdown automata, where symbols representing outer structures are pushed onto a stack and then popped off to move outward. The interior structure is completed by popping symbols off the stack in a last-in-first-out manner. While CFGs can handle sentences of unbounded length, language users struggle with nested structures deeper than two or three levels. Natural language grammars are mildly context sensitive, as evidenced by Swiss German and Dutch. However, the focus here is on CFGs and the ability of Recurrent Neural Nets to learn these structures. In this study, the focus is on Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) and the capability of Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically Long Short Term Memory networks, to learn palindromic language patterns. The LSTM was trained on strings of varying lengths and tested on both in-domain and out-of-domain examples. Results show the network's ability to predict symbols correctly, especially after the central symbol 'o'. The LSTM network learned the structure of the grammar and made accurate predictions for sequences seen at training time. However, it struggled with generalization outside the training set, particularly with deeper nesting of symbols. This lack of generalization is due to the network's unstructured memory and inability to understand the concept of sameness. The LSTM network struggled with generalization due to its unstructured memory, lacking the ability to apply the same rule to different cells. To address this, memory cells are organized into a one-dimensional stack structure with convolutions controlling information flow across timesteps. This allows for the same symbol to be stored in different cells, enhancing the model's performance. The memory cells in the convolutional LSTM architecture are organized into a one-dimensional stack structure with convolutions controlling information flow. The forget gate is replaced with width three filters to shape the recurrent flow of information, allowing the network to use input context to control the memory cell stack. Performance of this architecture is shown in Table 3. The convolutional LSTM architecture in Table 3 demonstrates optimal performance on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showcasing the importance of the convolutional layer for robust generalization. Various authors have explored replicating rule learning behavior in connectionist systems, with some relying on specific training regimes while our approach focuses on modifying the architecture to embed necessary capacities innately. The relevance of symmetry is highlighted through convolution, which could potentially be achieved purely through learning. The SCAN task by Lake & Baroni (2018) has prompted responses aiming to meet the task requirements. Lake & Baroni (2018) has prompted responses to meet task requirements. Lake (2019) uses a meta learning approach to learn invariance to symbol-meaning permutations. Russin et al. (2019) learn separate semantic and syntactic representations for words. The recurrent PDA described is similar to other architectures proposed by Sun et al. (1998), Grefenstette et al. (2015), and Joulin & Mikolov (2015). Symmetries in neural network architectures have been discussed by various authors, including the role of symmetry beyond spatial translation and the application of probabilistic symmetries. Permutation invariance is relevant for representational strategies like bag-of-words approaches and Deep Sets. Mitchell et al. (2018) provide practical examples of symmetries supporting extrapolation and generalization beyond the training set. In contrast to existing approaches like White et al. (2015) and Deep Sets (Zaheer et al., 2017) that focus on symmetry over permutations on input order, our study explores symmetry over symbol identity. Addressing criticisms raised by Fodor & Pylyshyn (1988), we examine how symmetry impacts the systematicity of processing representations. By imposing symmetry on the architecture, we achieve effective generalization in learning rules, composing representations, and learning grammars. The study explores symmetry over symbol identity to achieve effective generalization in learning rules, composing representations, and learning grammars. Symmetry under permutations of symbols and across memory locations is implemented using convolution, connecting cognition of space. The implementation decision connects cognition of space and symbols, using translational invariance as a foundation for understanding other symmetries. Corcoran & Tarski (1986) use spatial transformations for their definition of logical notion. Evolutionarily, there may be common origins for mechanisms supporting various symmetries. Recent research suggests cerebral structures linked to spatial representation also play a role. The use of convolution in representing spatial structures like the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex illustrates how spatial symmetries may relate to abstract domains. Push and pop operations in recursive push down automata relate to spatial translations. Future research will focus on discovering and learning symmetries empirically in human cognition. Imposing symmetry allows for the separation of content from structure. Imposing symmetry allows for the abstraction of content from structure, enabling generalization across different instances. Translation symmetry in learning tasks involves preserving fundamental properties of a system, such as spatial translations, to predict labels accurately. This mechanism can be applied to various scenarios beyond composition and grammar learning tasks. Imposing symmetry in learning tasks involves preserving spatial translations to predict labels accurately. This is achieved through equivariant convolutions and invariant poolings, ensuring the output is unchanged by input translations. Permutation equivariance arises in formal logic, where deduction rules depend on logical structure rather than specific names within an expression. The process of deduction should be equivariant under any substitution of names, as seen in formal logic. Symmetries also arise in computational processes, where the behavior of a machine should be equivalent under different memory addresses. The encoder-decoder architecture is used for the composition task. The encoder-decoder architecture for the composition task involves token embeddings, convolutions, softmax output, and L1 regularization to predict the next action. The architecture for learning the simple palindromic language involves a modified LSTM with convolutional filters. Each input token is embedded and concatenated with the hidden state to control filters for output. Recurrence between memory stacks is based on one-dimensional convolution. The architecture for learning the simple palindromic language involves a modified LSTM with convolutional filters. Each memory stack is controlled by filters and updated based on input values. The final outputs predict the next symbol using a softmax function. The loss is calculated using cross entropy, with memory stack depth of 20 and both M and N set to 10."
