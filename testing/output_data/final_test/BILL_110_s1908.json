    "content": "Access to student recruiting information. Changes to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 include providing access to student recruiting information to military recruiters and institutions of higher education. Local educational agencies must give access to student contact details unless the parent opts out. Parents of secondary school students can opt out of having their child's contact information released to military recruiters and higher education institutions. The school must notify parents of this option and cannot release the information without parental consent. The amendment prohibits local educational agencies from using opt-in processes to withhold student information from military recruiters or higher education institutions. Once a student turns eighteen, parental consent is no longer required, and the student has the rights previously held by parents. The amendment to title 10, United States Code requires local educational agencies to provide military recruiters with access to secondary school students and their contact information, unless parental consent is given to withhold it. The parent of a secondary school student can request that their child's contact information not be shared with military recruiters without prior consent. Local educational agencies must inform parents of this option. However, schools cannot withhold student information from military recruiters or higher education institutions through an opt-in process. The legislation allows students over eighteen years old to provide their own consent for educational decisions. It also requires notification to state officials if a local educational agency denies access to military recruiters. The Secretary of Education has the authority to determine if a local educational agency is not complying with certain requirements and can impose penalties or remedies for violations."
