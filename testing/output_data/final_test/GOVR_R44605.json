    "content": "Since 1969, United States-China relations have significantly improved, with few trade restrictions remaining. This includes economic sanctions such as limits on foreign assistance, State Department programs, funding requests in international financial institutions, exportation of defense articles, importation of munitions, and restrictions on exports and imports for national security reasons. Economic sanctions are coercive measures imposed on specific Chinese persons for various reasons such as weapons proliferation, illicit narcotics trafficking, and engagement with sanctioned entities. These measures include trade embargoes, export/import restrictions, denial of foreign assistance, and control of economic transactions involving U.S. citizens or businesses. The decision to apply sanctions can be based on a country's record regarding human rights, religious freedom, and international terrorism. The Departments of State, the Treasury, and Commerce are responsible for administering economic sanctions in U.S. foreign and national security policy. President George H.W. Bush suspended U.S. aid to China after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. The U.S. imposed sanctions on China after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, including restrictions on arms sales, military exchanges, export licenses, and financial support. Congress enacted three bills to further restrict trade and financing with China. In response to the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, the U.S. imposed sanctions on China, including restrictions on arms sales, military exchanges, export licenses, and financial support. In 1990 and 1991, the President suspended various forms of financing and export licenses for China, requiring progress on political reform as a condition for lifting the restrictions. The U.S. imposed sanctions on China in response to the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, including restrictions on arms sales, military exchanges, export licenses, and financial support. The remaining sanctions include a suspension of OPIC funding and restrictions on export licenses for U.S. Munitions List items and crime control equipment. The U.S. provides foreign assistance to China through programs assisting Tibetan communities and addressing HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. The U.S. provides foreign assistance to China through programs assisting Tibetan communities, addressing HIV/AIDS, and funding a Resident Legal Advisor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. The U.S. Peace Corps has deployed volunteers to China since 1993, mainly as English teachers in secondary schools and universities. Foreign operations and State Department appropriations for FY2016 include restrictions on processing licenses for the export of U.S. satellites to China without prior notification to the Committees on Appropriations. The FY2016 foreign operations and State Department appropriations require conditions on foreign aid to China, specifically prohibiting funds from financing projects with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) or its affiliates. Public diplomacy funds are designated to counter China's influence, and any aid for business and human rights programs must be matched by non-U.S. sources. The U.S. government prohibits funds from financing projects with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) or its affiliates in China. Aid for a \"business and human rights program\" must be matched by non-U.S. sources. The UNFPA must keep U.S. contributions separate and document expenditures in China. The U.S. reduces its contribution to UNFPA by the amount budgeted for China. OPIC's China program remains suspended since the Tiananmen crackdown. OPIC aims to facilitate U.S. private capital in developing countries and transition economies. China's economic development post-Tiananmen Square is significant but not complete. China's economic development post-Tiananmen Square has nearly graduated the country out of the qualifying range for OPIC investment. The United States generally abstains from voting on loans for projects in China at international financial institutions, citing human rights grounds. In May 2016, the U.S. abstained from voting on six out of eight project requests in China totaling $209.4 million. The United States considers various factors when voting on loans for projects, including environmental degradation, worker rights, trade distortion, and conditions in Tibet. No single country can block a loan or grant. Certain restrictions, such as Section 1673 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, prohibit the integration of a missile defense system of China into the US system. Section 515 of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, restricts the acquisition of certain information systems by specific departments unless approved. The Science Foundation must assess the risk of acquiring information systems from entities identified as posing a cyber threat, including those linked to China. Prohibitions exist for NASA and OSTP to collaborate with China or Chinese-owned companies. The Act prohibits NASA and OSTP from collaborating with China or Chinese-owned companies, and also restricts the use of appropriations to procure processed poultry products from China for federal school meal programs. Additionally, the U.S. government prohibits exporting defense articles and services to China under various authorities. The United States prohibits the import of munitions and ammunition from China, with sanctions dating back to the Tiananmen era. President Clinton announced the import sanction in 1994, along with the renewal of Most-Favored-Nation trade status. Congress further enhanced this prohibition in 2005, restricting the Secretary of Defense from procuring goods or services from any Communist Chinese company, except for specific circumstances.

Congress further enhanced this prohibition in 2005, restricting the Secretary of Defense from procuring goods or services from any Communist Chinese company, except for specific circumstances. The President can waive the prohibition for U.S. national security purposes with prior notification to the Armed Services Committees. China does not qualify for duty-free treatment under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences due to its communist status. China met the conditions for preferential trade treatment by joining the WTO in 2001, receiving permanent NTR status in 2002, and joining the IMF in 1980. China received permanent NTR status in 2002 and joined the IMF in 1980. The third condition for communist countries is not being controlled by international communism. China, despite being the largest source of imports for the US, may face denial for various reasons such as its political system or intellectual property rights protection. Export controls are applied to US-China trade to comply with international control regimes. Export controls are imposed on US-China trade to meet legal and international obligations, not as economic sanctions. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is primarily responsible for enforcing export controls through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Commerce Control List (CCL). An export license is required for goods, services, or technology intended for China for national security and foreign policy reasons. Export controls are imposed on US-China trade by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Commerce Control List (CCL). Most items on the CCL intended for China require a license due to reasons such as national security, missile technology, and crime control. China falls under the more restricted Tier 3 for computer equipment exports, with each license application scrutinized by multiple departments. The United States imposes export controls on US-China trade through the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) using the Commerce Control List (CCL). Countries are categorized into four groups, with China falling under Country Group D for national security reasons and proliferation concerns. Export licenses for China are generally approved, except in specific instances where items could significantly enhance military potential. The Commerce Department regulations generally approve license applications for exporting items to civil end-uses in China. However, there is a presumption of denial for items that would directly contribute to China's military capabilities. Additionally, the export of goods with a military end-use in China has been prohibited since mid-2007. The export of goods with a military end-use in China is prohibited, including nine categories of prohibited goods. President George H.W. Bush suspended export licenses for satellites to be launched in China after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, with the restriction remaining in law but waived on a case-by-case basis by subsequent Presidents. Since 1998, the President must justify each satellite export license waiver. Congress requires 15-day advance notification for satellite exports to China. China is committed to nonproliferation treaties and has export control regulations in place. Chinese entities and individuals have violated U.S. laws on weapons proliferation by transferring nuclear and missile technology to Iran, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Pakistan. As a result, they have been denied various privileges, including U.S. government contracts, licenses for controlled materials, import rights to the U.S., and access to U.S. foreign assistance. Sanctions are imposed on Chinese entities for violating U.S. laws on weapons proliferation, leading to restrictions on sales or transfers of controlled items, access to U.S. foreign assistance, and trade of dual-use items on the CCL. Some Chinese entities are designated as Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) by OFAC for activities related to weapons proliferation, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking, as well as for actions against U.S. law in various countries. Sanctions are imposed on Chinese entities for violating U.S. laws on weapons proliferation, leading to restrictions on sales or transfers of controlled items, access to U.S. foreign assistance, and trade of dual-use items on the CCL. Some Chinese entities are designated as Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) by OFAC for activities related to weapons proliferation, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking, as well as for actions against U.S. law in various countries. The sanctions regimes for countries like Burma, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, and Ukraine have different parameters triggering designation and requirements for U.S. citizens, financial institutions, and businesses. The 47 Chinese individuals and entities designated as SDN do not have access to their U.S.-held assets and are restricted from engaging in trade with U.S. persons. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to freeze assets, prohibit transactions, and impose restrictions on Communist Chinese military companies operating in the United States. The company or entity must be identified by the Secretary of Defense and notified to Congress and other government officials. There is no public information available on whether this authority has been used. Supplement 4 to 15 CFR Part 744, administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security, lists entities requiring licenses for specified items under Export Administration Regulations. The list is periodically updated with new or amended notifications. It includes addresses of designated entities, with references to cities and provinces. Entities identified under U.S. law for illicit trade in goods and services controlled for nonproliferation reasons are delegated by the President to the Secretary of State, who further delegates to the State Department's Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. Depending on the authority invoked, entities may face restrictions on U.S. government contracts, foreign aid, and import/export licenses. The list is not exhaustive, and sometimes determinations related to weapons proliferation are not publicly disclosed for national security reasons. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designates Chinese and China-located persons and entities as Specially Designated Nationals for various sanctions regimes related to weapons proliferation, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking. These designations are also based on activities that violate U.S. law in countries like Belarus, Burma, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, and Ukraine. Each sanctions regime has specific parameters triggering designation and resulting requirements for U.S. actions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control designates Chinese individuals and entities as Specially Designated Nationals based on activities violating U.S. law in various countries. These designations come with thresholds that trigger restrictions on assets and trade with persons under U.S. jurisdiction."
