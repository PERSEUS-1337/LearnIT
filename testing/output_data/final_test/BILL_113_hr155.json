    "content": "The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2013\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2013\" amends Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act to include a transitional increase amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This increase amount is calculated based on the excess under former law. The product is calculated by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage based on the year the individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits ranges from 55% in 1979 to 5% in 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the excess amount for each individual. The former law refers to the excess of an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount over the amount calculated under current regulations. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined based on the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under the law in effect in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), and modified accordingly. When calculating an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions do not apply, and only specific calendar years are considered for computation base years. When calculating an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions do not apply, and only specific calendar years are considered for computation base years. Increases in the table are included, and the paragraph applies only if it results in a higher insurance amount. Individuals can elect to receive lump sum payments instead of the paragraph's application by filing a written election with the Commissioner of Social Security. Upon receipt of a timely election filed by an individual with the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary of the Treasury will pay the individual $5,000 in 4 annual lump sum installments of $1,250 from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Any election filed after December 31, 2013, will be null and void. The Commissioner of Social Security will pay beneficiaries $1,250 in 4 annual installments starting in fiscal year 2014. If a deceased individual has no timely election filed, the Commissioner will certify all received elections to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner of Social Security will pay beneficiaries $5,000 in 4 equal annual lump sum installments starting in fiscal year 2014, funded by the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. If a deceased individual has no timely election filed, the amount will be distributed evenly among beneficiaries. The amendments made by this Act shall be effective, except as provided in paragraph (2). The amendments made by this Act will be effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977. No increase in benefits will be applied before July 2014. Individuals entitled to benefits in June 2014 will have their benefits recomputed to reflect any increases. In December 1978, the Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount to reflect amendments made by the Act, regardless of previous provisions."
