    "content": "Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States and India have developed a strategic partnership focused on economic, security, and global initiatives. This collaboration aims to address common principles and shared interests such as counterterrorism, preventing weapons proliferation, and maintaining regional stability. Senior Pentagon officials have reassured New Delhi of the current administration's commitment to this partnership. The current administration is fully committed to strengthening ties with India through the enhancement of the defense relationship. There is considerable bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for a deepened partnership with India, with a focus on improving compatibility of defense acquisitions systems and exploring opportunities for co-development of military weapons systems. The curr_chunk provides an overview of American security interests in relation to India, discussing India's strategic interests, defense posture, and obstacles to cooperation. It also touches on the outlook for future security bilateral cooperation. The companion piece, CRS Report R42823, delves into the details of current U.S.-India security engagement. The Cold War, India's Soviet tilt, close ties with Pakistan, India's abstention from the NPT, and pursuit of nuclear weapons fueled American fears of proliferation and nuclear arms race in Asia. The collapse of the Soviet Union removed a major obstacle to closer U.S.-India relations. The end of the Cold War initially set the United States and India on largely incompatible paths. India emerged from the losing side of the Cold War, turning away from its traditionally statist economy to incorporate itself into the liberal order, leading to normalized relations with the United States. The Soviet collapse in the 1980s led India to engage with the West due to the loss of Moscow's financial support. U.S.-India defense ties slowly grew, with the impetus coming from the U.S. Pacific Command in 1991. Despite tensions over nuclear issues, the defense cooperation continued, marking a significant development in the bilateral relationship. In 1995, the Clinton Administration pushed for the indefinite extension of the existing NPT at the United Nations, leading to India's nuclear weapons pariah status. Despite noncooperation on nuclear proliferation, the 21st century began with hopeful prospects for U.S.-India relations. President Clinton's visit to India in 2000 marked a significant milestone, easing U.S. sanctions related to India's 1998 nuclear tests. President Clinton's visit to India in 2000 marked a significant milestone, easing U.S. sanctions related to India's 1998 nuclear tests. He referred to India as a \"natural ally\" and identified shared values and areas for cooperation. The U.S.-India Joint Counterterrorism Working Group was established, formalizing cooperation. Despite Washington's optimistic intentions, policies remained focused on balancing the Indo-Pakistani rivalry and addressing nuclear concerns in the region. The U.S.-India relationship was gradually progressing before the terrorist attacks of September 2001. President George W. Bush's informal meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh in the Oval Office further energized Clinton's pro-India policies. Singh welcomed the Bush Administration's missile defense plans, emphasizing a new security regime for the globe. India's support for Washington's policy stood out among U.S. allies' criticisms. After 9/11, India questioned American alignment as Pakistan supported U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Despite sanctions waivers for both countries, Indian leaders felt ignored and resentful towards perceived U.S. appeasement of Pakistan. New Delhi was concerned about Pakistan-supported terrorism in India, while Washington focused on securing Pakistan's cooperation in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. The challenge for the U.S. was to balance leaning on Pakistan without alienating New Delhi. Despite tensions, by early 2002, the U.S. had secured India's restraint and a pledge from Pakistan to tackle terrorism. Throughout the Bush Administration's first term, U.S. policy towards South Asia reflected this delicate balancing act. In July 2005, President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh established a \"global partnership\" between the United States and India, focusing on increased cooperation in civilian nuclear energy. The \"Next Steps in Strategic Partnership\" initiative involved reciprocal actions to expand engagement on nuclear regulatory issues, missile defense, space technology, and high-technology commerce. Sanctions were further rolled back, signaling progress in the U.S.-India relationship. After the 2001 easing, agreements were signed between the United States and India for increased defense collaboration, technology transfers, and missile defense cooperation. These agreements marked a new era of interaction and cooperation between the two countries, reflecting a shift in U.S. security interests towards India after the Cold War. The United States shifted its security interests towards India after the Cold War, viewing it as a key strategic partner in Asia. Washington's perception of India transformed from a growing global power to a linchpin of U.S. strategy in the region. This shift was driven by U.S. security interests in establishing a stable balance of power in Asia, reducing terrorism and nuclear proliferation threats, and protecting economic and political interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The primary concern for the U.S. in Asia has been China's growing military capabilities and assertiveness, particularly in the South China Sea and potentially the Indian Ocean region. China's influence is expanding in Central Asia and the Middle East, with tensions rising in the South China Sea due to sovereignty claims. The U.S. allies Japan and South Korea remain wary of Beijing, while Taiwan remains a sensitive issue for Washington and Beijing. An increasingly assertive China in the East China Sea poses obstacles to the American presence in the region. U.S. military withdrawal would reduce Washington's influence, while budget cuts limit military expansion. The strategy is to pivot towards the Asia-Pacific and strengthen alliances. Defense Secretary Panetta reassured allies during a 2012 trip to Southeast Asia. The U.S. is clarifying its \"rebalance\" strategy to reassure allies in the region about potential drawdowns. Islamist terrorism, especially in South Asia, has been a major focus of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, with Afghanistan and Pakistan identified as key areas. Despite military drawdowns in Afghanistan, combating terrorism remains a critical issue on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. Despite military drawdowns in Afghanistan, combating terrorism remains a key U.S. policy interest in the region. President Obama emphasized the ongoing threat from al-Qaida and the need for an agile and adaptive strategy. India is a strong supporter of counterterrorism efforts in the region, with cooperation in this area being a significant aspect of the U.S.-India relationship. Cooperation in combating terrorism has been a key aspect of the U.S.-India relationship since 2001. India supports stabilizing Afghanistan to prevent terrorist networks from targeting American and Indian interests. Bilateral counterterrorism cooperation has expanded beyond Afghanistan, especially after the 2008 Mumbai attack. The shared interests were highlighted by the attack on establishments frequented by Westerners and local hubs. The United States and India have potential for collaboration on counterterrorism, but contrasting policies towards Pakistan and bureaucratic differences limit cooperation depth. U.S. interest includes preventing nuclear proliferation in South Asia and averting nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. U.S. sanctions on both countries were waived in 2001, recognizing India as a nuclear weapons state. Washington has a history of promoting regional restraint. The United States encourages regional restraint in nuclear proliferation and supports the India-Pakistan peace initiative. The rise of Asia has led to a focus on freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States sees India as a key partner in maritime policing and disaster relief in the Indian Ocean region. India's growing military capabilities contribute to security in the region and beyond, including interdiction of WMD-related transfers, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, and humanitarian relief efforts. Recent cuts to the U.S. defense budget prompt Washington to promote collective security measures in the region. India is viewed as an important global example. India is seen as a key partner by the United States in promoting democracy and human rights norms in the region. It is also expected to play a significant role in the New Silk Road initiative, linking East and Southwest Asia for trade. The U.S. State Department envisions this initiative to have a stabilizing effect on the entire region. India's defense posture, aspirations, and reforms are broadly portrayed through information on defense budgeting, military deployments, and government reports. India's defense posture, aspirations, and reforms are highlighted, with a shift towards focusing on China rather than Pakistan. Defense Minister A.K. Antony sought an increased budget in response to changing security dynamics. India is now more confident in its military capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis Pakistan, allowing it to address regional security issues beyond traditional concerns. The focus is on posing a credible military deterrent to China and preparing for potential multi-front scenarios. India is enhancing its military capabilities to deter China and preparing for potential multi-front confrontations along disputed borders. Military planning reflects a shift in focus towards broader defense aims, with a recalibration of key threats to national interests. The absence of clear national security objectives and ad-hoc planning continue to hinder effective coordination within the armed forces. The \"Cold Start\" doctrine in India aims to address escalatory problems with Pakistan's nuclear arsenal by allowing for rapid retaliatory strikes. It has faced criticism for potentially increasing tensions with Pakistan and hindering U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan. The current status of this approach in India's military strategy is unclear due to discussions on a dual-front strategy and changes in geopolitical dynamics. India's military services are undergoing reforms to meet expanding strategic horizons, focusing on network-centric organization for increased interoperability. Improvements in nuclear weapons delivery systems aim to establish a triad of land, air, and sea-based nuclear strike options by 2014. The army and air force are shifting attention to the east, preparing for a potential two-front war. The Indian Army is prioritizing security needs and infrastructure development along the Line of Actual Control. India is focusing on infrastructure development along the Line of Actual Control, with plans to raise new military units and improve air force capabilities. The goal is to transform the army into a capability-based force by 2020, capable of various types of warfare including counter-insurgency and nuclear conflict. The Indian government has authorized the construction of new airbases and landing grounds in the northeast, close to China, as part of its modernization efforts. The Indian Air Force is enhancing its capabilities to conduct network-centric operations across various conflict scenarios. It is overhauling its Air Defense network, acquiring advanced combat aircraft and precision weapons, and strengthening its transport and helicopter fleets. India is also focusing on maritime defense in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond, with a growing emphasis on naval capabilities in national security. The Indian Navy is prioritizing maritime leadership in the Indian Ocean Region, focusing on enforcing international laws, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. New Delhi's defense plan emphasizes network-centric naval platforms, expeditionary operations, and power projection capabilities. The induction of nuclear-powered submarines is a step towards achieving these ambitious defense goals. India's defense goals include operating a nuclear-powered submarine and having a three aircraft-carrier capability. The Indian Navy has increased its presence on Indian Ocean islands and is reforming its Coast Guard to police the coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone. The Indian government is implementing the National Maritime Domain Awareness Project to enhance maritime security, including infrastructure upgrades and coastal surveillance systems. The Indian Coast Guard is undergoing reforms but faces challenges with procurement. Efforts to reform land-based security forces and establish a National Counter Terrorism Center have met resistance from various intelligence agencies and state governments. India's military and domestic security forces face challenges with equipment, training, and procurement. There is frustration over lack of consultation between armed forces and civilian administration, hindering defense planning. In 2011, India ranked as the sixth largest military. In 2011, India ranked as the sixth largest military spender globally, allocating $40.5 billion for defense in its FY2012/13 budget, marking a decade of increased defense spending despite economic challenges. India's defense spending has seen robust growth despite the global economic downturn and India's own economic slowdown since 2010. The Indian Army traditionally received the bulk of the defense budget, but there has been a gradual shift towards favoring the Indian Navy in recent years. In the FY2012/13 budget, the army received half of the funding, followed by the IAF at 25% and the Navy at 19%. The IN budget alone saw a 4% increase, while the army and air force budgets decreased by 1% and 4% respectively. The Indian defense budget has grown significantly over the past 25 years, with the IN budget alone increasing 37-fold from $181 million in 1987 to $6.8 billion in 2012. The total defense budget has also increased 14-fold during the same period. The budget is divided into revenue and capital spending, with a large portion allocated for defense equipment procurement. In recent years, around 40% of the budget has been spent on capital outlays. The FY2012/2013 capital expenditure breakdown allocates 38% to the air force, 31% to the navy, and 24% to the army. India's defense budget has grown significantly over the past 25 years, with a large portion allocated for defense equipment procurement. The budget is divided into revenue and capital spending, with around 40% spent on capital outlays. The air force receives 38%, the navy 31%, and the army 24% of the capital expenditure. India's military is the world's third-largest, with a focus on modernizing naval and air assets for global reach. India has a history of conflicts with Pakistan and China, including wars over Kashmir and a brief conflict with China in 1962. India has a significant military presence, participating in numerous U.N. peacekeeping missions since 1950. The Indian army, with 1.13 million active duty personnel, operates various military equipment including tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, and helicopters. India's army has raised two mountain infantry divisions in Nagaland and Assam, totaling 40,000 personnel, for deployment along the eastern border. Plans are in place to arm two new regiments with BrahMos missiles by 2017. The navy operates 21 surface combatants, 15 submarines, and over 60 patrol vessels. The Indian Navy has over 60 patrol and coastal combatants, including missile-capable corvettes and landing ships with amphibious capacity. They are developing an indigenous nuclear-powered attack submarine for sea-based strategic deterrence. The naval air wing consists of 31 combat capable aircraft. The Indian Air Force flies 798 combat-capable aircraft, including ground attack jets like MiG-21s, Su-30 MKI Flankers, Mirage, and Jaguar. The Indian Air Force operates a fleet of 798 combat-capable aircraft, including Su-30 MKI Flankers, Mirage, Jaguar, and MiG-29 Fulcrums. They also have airborne early warning and in-flight refueling capabilities, with plans to deploy C-130J Super Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III airlifters. Additionally, they are developing a joint air defense center in the northeast region of the country. India's Strategic Forces Command oversees a significant number of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads. The country is reported to possess around 100 nuclear warheads and continues to produce weapons-grade plutonium. In 2012, India successfully launched the Agni V missile, capable of targeting China's eastern population centers. The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) announced readiness to launch Phase 1 of its anti-ballistic missile defense system, capable of targeting 2,000-km range incoming missiles. India plans to have an ABM system deployed over two cities. India plans to deploy an ABM system capable of targeting 5,000 km range missiles by 2016. Some analysts have raised concerns about the testing parameters not considering ABM-evading technology and real-time contingencies. India's defense procurement system faces challenges in identifying and approving needed equipment. The DRDO is developing anti-satellite weapons capabilities as part of the missile defense program. India is still working on building infrastructure for a well-functioning ABM system, including high-tech competencies for communication and surveillance. The defense procurement system in India has been influenced by various factors, including a focus on self-reliance after the 1962 Indo-China war. Despite efforts to enhance indigenous production capabilities, the sector still faces inefficiency and corruption. Recent debates emphasize the importance of domestic production in defense procurement, with a push for scientists to prioritize specific projects. India's defense procurement system aims to focus resources on areas where capacity has been demonstrated, but corruption and inefficiencies hinder modernization efforts. With only one-third of defense equipment produced domestically, India falls short of its self-reliance target. Despite economic growth, India remains the world's top arms importer, accounting for 10% of global imports from 2007 to 2012. India remains the world's top arms importer, accounting for 10% of global imports from 2007 to 2012. India's defense budget through 2025 is estimated at $200 billion, with projections of up to $60 billion on new defense purchases in the next six years. The defense procurement system lacks formalized national security objectives, leading to service-specific \"wish lists\" and suboptimal decision-making influenced by domestic politics. The Indian army faced equipment shortfalls, including critical ammunition and obsolete air defense systems, leading to suboptimal decision-making in the MOD. To address this, empowered committees were established to accelerate procurement, resulting in the acquisition of 145 M777 Howitzers from the United States. Plans to buy howitzers were previously derailed 25 years ago due to a corruption scandal. The Indian army is facing equipment shortfalls and has initiated major procurements for FY2012/13, including tanks, helicopters, infantry combat vehicles, and artillery guns. Despite the boost in procurement, senior army officers have expressed concerns about bureaucratic hurdles and decision-making uncertainties. The Indian Navy's procurement performance is experiencing mixed results, with a steady growth in indigenous ship-building capacity since the 1960s. The Navy plans to induct five ships annually over the next few years, but the fleet is projected to decrease before rising back to a target of 200 platforms. There are concerns about a potential decrease in the sub-surface fleet and reliance on imported naval weapons systems and aircraft. The Navy is investing in maritime reconnaissance capabilities, including Boeing's P8-I, with discussions for an additional order of Poseidon aircraft. The Indian Navy plans to acquire 500 aircraft and helicopters, including 100 combat fighter jets. Key platforms like the nuclear-powered attack submarine Arihant, French-built Scorpene submarines, and aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya are facing delays and cost overruns. The Indian Air Force is also facing challenges in modernizing its aging Russian-built fleet. The Indian Air Force is modernizing its fleet by acquiring new fighter aircraft, including the Dassault Rafale and fifth-generation fighter aircraft from Russia. They are also acquiring trainer aircraft, helicopters, and transport planes like the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules and Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The Indian Air Force is enhancing its capabilities by acquiring new aircraft like the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The Ministry of Defense is focusing on indigenous production of defense equipment, although issues like corruption and inefficiency in public sector organizations persist. Efforts are being made to improve procurement and production performance. Indian DPSUs collaborate with foreign defense firms for joint-production ventures, but face challenges in designing and building complex indigenous systems. Procurements of foreign ship designs for domestic production in the naval sector have encountered obstacles. India's missile technology production is improving with the induction of BrahMos cruise missiles and planned Agni V induction. ISRO is gradually advancing in satellite technology for network-centric warfare. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited struggles with the production of Light Combat Aircraft Tejas. The final version of Aircraft Tejas will have a General Electric engine. India's indigenous tank projects were abandoned for Russian versions. The Dhruv helicopter is a domestic success story with a French turbo-shaft. New Delhi is reforming the defense sector by allowing Indian private firms to enter through joint ventures and direct production. Domestic private firms are uncertain about privatization due to mixed signals from the government. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board in India rejects bids due to concerns over FDI restrictions. Private sector entry into defense production depends on government incentives and competitive processes. Analysts predict limited impact on armed forces modernization without policy adjustments. India's efforts to modernize its armed forces will have a marginal impact on addressing security threats. Recommendations include improving procurement processes, creating a Chief of Defense Staff position, and increasing oversight of defense research agencies. India's security objectives may not always align with the United States, but both share basic values. India prioritizes a peaceful external environment to focus on domestic issues like over-population and poverty. In a September 2012 speech, Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna emphasized that India's foreign policy aims to create a favorable external environment for collective prosperity and individual welfare. Key priorities include an equitable trading system, stable financial system, secure energy supplies, and food security. The core of Indian foreign policy includes a commitment to internationalism, independence in external relations, support for democratization, and contributions to international peace and security. India's great power aspirations hinge on managing relationships in its neighborhood for stability and prosperity. Former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao highlighted the importance of a peaceful South Asia for India's regional and global role. Without a stable neighborhood, India's economic development and global influence would be hindered. India prioritizes peaceful and stable relations with its neighbors to maintain its economic growth and global influence. New Delhi aims to establish predominant power in the region to create a peaceful environment for prosperity, considering factors like regional dynamics, China's influence, and political instability in neighboring countries. Since independence, New Delhi has faced secessionist movements and insurgencies, posing significant security threats. Current conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir, northeastern states, and the \"Red corridor\" in eastern India are pressing challenges. Communal rifts and global terrorist networks also contribute to security concerns. India's periphery plays a critical role in providing support to anti-government elements. The structural deficiencies in Indian law enforcement and security forces make the country vulnerable to security threats. India's relations with neighboring countries like Myanmar also have domestic implications due to the presence of influential tribal groups across borders. The presence of tribal groups across borders can influence developments and security in states like Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram. Relations with neighboring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are influenced by perspectives of bordering states such as U.P., Bihar, Sikkim, West Bengal, and North-eastern states. India has criticized neighboring governments for insufficient action on cross-border movements by insurgents and state-supported attacks by Pakistan-based militants. In India, attacks by Pakistan-based militants exploit grievances of the Muslim community, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. Indian authorities suspect elements in Pakistan of inciting panic among northeastern migrant workers. The country is working to enhance its counterterrorism efforts, focusing on trade and aid incentives for neighborly relations. India is working to normalize ties with Pakistan and other neighbors to counter infiltration attempts by militants. It is also collaborating with the United States on counterterrorism efforts. Concerns are rising in India about China's increasing presence in the region, particularly in strategic ports in the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. China's strengthening aid, trade, and military links with India's neighbors challenge New Delhi's regional influence. The Sino-Pakistani relationship is a contentious element, described as an \"all-weather friendship.\" Former Indian Minister Jaswant Singh warned against allowing any force to intrude in the Indian subcontinent, leading to destabilization. China's strong military and economic support for Pakistan, including aid for nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, fighter aircraft development, and naval equipment purchases, raises concerns for India. The Chinese takeover of port operations in Gwadar and plans for significant investment further fuel Indian fears of encirclement. China's strong military and economic support for Pakistan, including aid for nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, fighter aircraft development, and naval equipment purchases, raises concerns for India. China has also expressed interest in establishing military bases in northwestern Pakistan and has invested $10 billion in the Gwadar port project. Additionally, China has courted other neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, where it is the largest foreign donor and investor. India's refusal to sell heavy military equipment to Sri Lanka contrasts with China's significant military aid to the country between 2005 and 2009. In contrast to India's refusal to sell heavy weapons to Sri Lanka between 2005 and 2009 due to domestic sentiments, China supported Sri Lanka by voting against a U.N. resolution in 2012. China continues to provide diplomatic aid, with the defense minister pledging $100 million in assistance for Army welfare projects in 2012. Sri Lanka's reliance on Beijing's support has increased due to India's policy limitations. India's policy limitations in Sri Lanka have pushed Colombo towards seeking military and economic aid from Beijing, causing concern for New Delhi. China has also increased its economic engagement in Bangladesh, with Dhaka purchasing Chinese military equipment and discussing a deep-sea port project with Beijing. Nepal is seen as a buffer state between India and China, with India aiming to counter Chinese influence there. The Tibetan community in Nepal complicates the dynamic between India and China. Nepali authorities have a policy against \"anti-China\" activities and have shown ties with Chinese officials. The former and current Prime Ministers of Nepal have emphasized the need to balance security concerns between India and China. China's increasing engagement in Afghanistan includes economic investments in natural-resources extraction projects, such as the Aynak Copper Mine and plans to explore oil and gas in the Amu Darya River Basin. Beijing has shown a visible shift towards supporting Afghan reconstruction, possibly driven by security concerns and the planned NATO withdrawal in 2014. China's support for the Kabul government is driven by concerns over Uighur terrorism. In 2012, China upgraded ties with Afghanistan and promised active participation in reconstruction efforts, including training Afghan police. India is wary of China's influence in the region, but both countries aim to combat Islamist militancy in Afghanistan. China's growing diplomatic and development role in Afghanistan could hinder New Delhi's influence in the region. India downplays concerns about Chinese involvement in South Asia, while Beijing asserts it is not aimed at containing India. The Chinese defense minister emphasized the importance of relations with South Asian nations for regional security and stability, not targeting any third party. India's response to increasing Chinese influence remains cautious. India's primary response to increasing Chinese influence in South Asia has been to forge deeper ties with its neighbors, emphasizing the importance of closer relations based on geography, security, economic advantage, and shared cultural traditions. India's troubled neighborhood includes countries with political instability, militarization, and terrorist safe havens. New Delhi aims for representative political systems in neighboring countries to stabilize the region and improve relations on the Asian subcontinent. From New Delhi's perspective, Pakistan's military dominance in formulating foreign and national security policies has led to regional instability. India is increasingly concerned about political instability in Pakistan due to rising Islamist militancy. The internal security situation in Pakistan has fragmented power, resulting in multiple centers of power and cross-border infiltration. New Delhi also fears the impact of instability in Afghanistan following NATO's planned withdrawal. India is concerned about the impact of instability in Afghanistan post-NATO withdrawal, fearing vulnerability to Taliban and Pakistani influence. Indian government supports stability in Afghanistan and democratic progress in Nepal, Bhutan, and Maldives. India also encouraged an end to the civil war in Sri Lanka. India has encouraged an end to the civil war in Sri Lanka and urged post-conflict stability by reconciling with ethnic minority groups. In Bangladesh, the return to democracy with the election of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has favored India. However, India has faced criticism for working with Burma's authoritarian military regime, citing security, economic, and strategic concerns. India tends to have better relations with neighboring countries during periods of democratic leadership. India's experience with democracy and political stability anchors its position as a proponent of development and stability through representative politics. As Asian countries grow in economic influence, there are concerns about security guarantees for peaceful expansion. China's rapid rise poses a potential strategic imbalance favoring Beijing, closely watched by India and its neighbors. China's rapid rise in the last decade has led to increased influence in East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. This has prompted India to reassess its strategy towards neighboring regions and adjust its relationship with the United States. The Chinese economy plays a central role in the region's export-oriented growth, with Beijing investing in military capabilities, particularly in air defense. China's military capabilities, especially in air and naval power projection, and anti-access/area denial capabilities, have been a focus of their rapid rise. The security implications for the Indian Ocean Region may increase as China seeks a greater naval presence in the region. China's expanding influence, economic growth, and strategic presence in the Indo-Pacific region have raised concerns about potential U.S. drawdown in the future. India's regional and global power aspirations are challenged by China's presence, with tensions rising despite warming bilateral trade. The two countries have conflicting territorial claims, leading to increased militarized tensions. Speculation suggests a new \"Great Game\" is unfolding between the two nations, adding to India's sense of insecurity. China's military advancements and strategic intentions in South and Southeast Asia contribute to New Delhi's sense of insecurity. India faces challenges in building a credible military deterrent and maintaining ties with China's neighbors. The military capabilities gap between China and India has been longstanding, with China's rapid deployment capabilities highlighted during the 1962 Indo-China war. India has been trying to close the military capabilities gap with China since the 1962 war, facing obstacles like political issues, corruption, and budget constraints. Despite focusing on Pakistan and domestic security threats, India is now reorienting resources to build a credible deterrent against potential Chinese aggression, including nuclear capabilities acquired in 1974 and 1998. India is enhancing its nuclear deterrent capabilities by producing medium-range ballistic missiles and establishing a triad of launch platforms. The Indian military is focusing on areas along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LOAC) and the Indian navy is expanding its presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) amidst increased Chinese naval activity. The military reorientation is driven by concerns about China's modernizing military, despite India's claims that it is not directed against China. India's \"Look East\" policy, initiated in 1991, aims to deepen commercial and diplomatic relations with East Asia. New Delhi's efforts to deepen commercial and diplomatic relations with East and Southeast Asia have led to expanded security cooperation with countries in the region. India actively participates in various pan-East Asian economic and security structures, including ASEAN, ASEAN+3, ARF, ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting, and the East Asia Summit. India, like China and the United States, is an ASEAN Dialogue Partner and has been a member of the ARF since 1996, focusing on regional peace, security, and combating international terrorism and maritime threats. India has upgraded efforts to combat international terrorism and threats to maritime security by cultivating bilateral defense relations with countries in East Asia. Japan and South Korea have increased security cooperation with India, conducting joint naval exercises and signing a Strategic Partnership agreement. Trilateral talks have also been held with Japan and the United States, showing a significant acceleration in defense relations over the past decade. India has strengthened defense ties with South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The focus is on military training, exercises, anti-piracy, and counterterrorism efforts. ASEAN countries are increasing arms acquisitions, especially naval assets, due to territorial disputes with China. India is considering training Vietnam in submarine operations and has been approached by Malaysia for similar assistance. India has also sought training assistance from New Delhi. Defense ties with Southeast Asian countries have been revitalized amid regional tensions. India, along with defense partners in East and Southeast Asia, is cautious about appearing adversarial towards China. China's economic influence in Asia deters smaller neighboring economies from benefiting. Beijing uses coercive economic diplomacy in territorial disputes, such as with the Philippines. Internal divisions among ASEAN members hinder collaborative security approaches. New Delhi aims to strengthen ties across the region, but the security policy aspects of its Look East approach remain unclear. China's \"string of pearls\" strategy involves developing naval bases in countries surrounding India, raising concerns about encirclement. Chinese warships visiting Burma in 2010 heightened fears of naval power projection near Indian shores. Beijing's increased naval presence in the Indian Ocean Region includes escort and counter-piracy missions. India is actively strengthening its military presence in the Indian Ocean Region through bilateral and multilateral initiatives with countries in the area. The Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation focuses on maritime safety, trade, disaster risk reduction, and cultural exchanges. China's growing maritime presence in the region is seen as a challenge to India's interests. India's maritime presence in the Indian Ocean is crucial for protecting its sea-borne trade links with Southeast Asia. China's reaction to an Indian Navy vessel off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea highlighted potential disputes between India and China. Indian authorities are increasingly voicing their position on freedom of navigation issues in the South China Sea, indicating a growing trend of expanding influence beyond the Indian Ocean Region. In June 2012, an Indian diplomat emphasized the importance of the South China Sea to India due to territorial disputes in the region. India, Japan, and South Korea rely on the Sea Lanes of Communications for energy security and trade. The Indian Ocean Rim has vast Exclusive Economic Zones and untapped marine resources, similar to the potential in the South China Sea. The objective is to promote cooperation over competition in the seas and oceans. The importance of cooperation in maritime security is highlighted as India and China expand their presence in maritime regions. Maintaining open and secure sea lanes of communication is crucial for trade, but the potential militarization of these lanes poses a threat to regional stability. India's cultural, political, and economic ties with West Asia, including Iran, Israel, and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, further emphasize the need for cooperation in maritime security. India's foreign minister emphasized the strong cultural and religious links between India and West Asia, highlighting the region's significance to India's economy and security. Trade relations and political developments in West Asia have increased India's security considerations, driven by accessing hydrocarbon markets and mitigating support for extremism. West Asia supplied 64.5% of India's crude oil in 2010-2011, making it crucial for New Delhi's security calculations. India's increasing dependence on energy resources from West Asia, particularly from top exporters like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and the UAE, is shaping its future energy plans. India has signed long-term LNG contracts with Qatar and engaged in negotiations for natural gas pipelines. However, security and political challenges have caused delays in some projects. India's relations with different political blocs in the region are crucial as it aims to secure its energy needs. India's relations with rival Sunni Arab-dominated and Shia Iranian political blocs in West Asia impact its policies in the region. Despite Saudi Arabia being India's top crude oil supplier, New Delhi is cautious due to historical support for Pakistan. Tehran's role as a counterweight to Islamabad in Afghanistan and facilitator of Indian access to Central Asia through Chabbahar port are key factors for friendly relations. As NATO withdraws from Afghanistan, Iran's importance as an Indian interlocutor grows, despite New Delhi's compliance with U.S.-led sanctions in 2012. India's efforts to balance relationships in the west are evident in its 2025 energy policy. India's energy policy for 2025 aims to build strong relations with focus countries like Russia, Iraq, Iran, and North African countries. However, India's efforts to reduce dependency on Saudi Arabia have been hindered by U.S.-led sanctions against Iran. In response, India agreed to decrease hydrocarbon imports from Iran to secure an exemption from sanctions. As a result, India's reliance on Saudi Arabia for energy has increased, with Iraq surpassing Iran as the second largest crude supplier. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas reported a 14.5% decline in crude imports from Iran for the fiscal year 2011-2012. Imports from Iran are expected to decrease further in the current fiscal year. India is concerned about China's increasing influence in the region, potentially impacting its energy supplies. Additionally, non-hydrocarbon economic activities have become more important for India, with significant remittances from expatriates. India receives significant remittances of around $30 billion annually from approximately six million expatriate workers in the Gulf region, making a substantial contribution to the country's economy. These workers also play a crucial role in India's security considerations. The annual trade volume between India and West Asia amounts to about $140 billion, with energy imports being a significant component. India views the Gulf region as a growing market for its exports, particularly in value-added items like information technology services. Prime Minister Singh emphasized the importance of closer ties with West Asia, stating that India's \"look west\" policy extends beyond the Gulf to greater West Asia. The UAE is the top recipient of Indian exports, and India is in negotiations for an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council. Despite challenges related to international sanctions, India continues to explore investment opportunities in the region. India continues to explore investment and trade opportunities with Iran despite complications related to international sanctions. Trade with Israel is valued at $5 billion annually, with discussions underway for an FTA that could triple current trade levels. Israel has become a crucial defense supplier to India, providing sophisticated technologies for counterterrorism needs. India's expanding trading ties with West Asian markets require preparation for potential security challenges from the region. India's cultural links with the Islamic world, including the world's largest Muslim minority, play a significant role in shaping its security engagement. The movement of individuals for trade and religious purposes has created a network of information sharing between India and the Islamic heartland. While this connection has generally been positive, there are concerns about support for extremism and terrorism at the fringes. India's cultural links with the Islamic world have led to information sharing, but concerns about support for extremism and terrorism at the fringes have emerged. Analysts suggest that New Delhi needs to navigate relationships in West Asia to combat terrorist and extremist elements. India has made progress in this area, including signing agreements with Saudi Arabia to combat terrorism. In 2010, India expressed concerns about financial support from Saudi and Gulf entities to extremist groups in South Asia. Saudi Arabia extradited an Indian LeT operative involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks to India in 2012, signaling improved counterterrorism cooperation. However, skepticism remains about Saudi Arabia's full cooperation due to its close ties with Pakistan. The growing tension between Sunni and Shia Muslims in West Asia, exacerbated by events in Iraq since 2003, is a major concern for India due to its significant Shia population. India has a tradition of peaceful coexistence among Muslims of all denominations. The Arab Spring protests in 2011 have complicated India's relations with West Asia, leading to a need for vigilance to maintain peaceful coexistence among Muslims of all denominations. India is navigating political and economic ties with adversarial blocs in the region amidst the rise of Islamist forces and U.S. intervention. This poses challenges for India's global power aspirations and requires a careful balancing act. India's global power aspirations are driving it to seek greater influence in security issues with global scope. India aims to secure privileges similar to the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and join major arms control groups to shed its pariah status and access specialized technology and resources. Delhi's increased access to specialized technology and resources can enhance India's influence in global security issues and promote its interests worldwide. India's pursuit of permanent membership in the UN Security Council has garnered significant support, reflecting recognition of its economic and security influence on a global scale. India's efforts, along with other countries, to lobby for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council have been energetic but unsuccessful. Despite endorsements from global leaders, structural reform of the UNSC seems unlikely without concrete steps from the P5. Some observers criticize India for acting too timidly on the global stage, hindering its ability to exert influence in geopolitics. India's rising power status is hindered by domestic difficulties, leading to reluctance in taking expected policy stances on global issues. New Delhi's hands-off approach to Arab uprisings and cautious stance on conflicts like Libya and Syria have raised concerns about its willingness to fulfill global responsibilities, especially as a member of the U.N. Security Council. India's rising power status is hindered by domestic difficulties, leading to reluctance in taking expected policy stances on global issues. Nonetheless, in its current role on the U.N. Security Council, India has firmed its stand on implementing Iran sanctions and voted in favor of resolutions against Iran's nuclear program. India also controversially voted for a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka's human rights abuses. India's active engagement with the United Nations may determine its relevance in global security matters in the coming years. India's bid to increase global security relevance involves balancing nuclear disarmament advocacy with nuclear arsenal augmentation. Despite past support for disarmament initiatives, India has often retracted full support to continue its nuclear weapons program, citing strategic necessity. India's strategic approach to its nuclear weapons program is explained as necessary due to the \"nuclear apartheid\" regime. The 2008 civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the US has helped India improve its nuclear status, allowing it to apply for membership in major arms control regimes. Prime Minister Singh's 2010 commitment to implement Wassenaar safeguards in India allowed previously blocked U.S. defense sales. India's acceptance as a nonproliferating nuclear weapons state, despite not signing the NPT, grants it unique status. Joining international influential nations sets norms for India's global aspirations. The U.S.-India defense partnership has been uneven, with both convergent and divergent perspectives on security challenges. The discussion focuses on security challenges faced by the U.S. and India, highlighting converging and diverging perspectives on issues like Iran. The evolving geopolitical dynamics continue to test their defense partnership, with President Obama emphasizing the unique relationship between the two countries in a 2010 speech to the Indian Parliament. The relationship between the United States and India is unique as two strong democracies with shared values of liberty, justice, and innovation. They are indispensable partners in addressing security challenges, including perspectives on China, terrorism, Afghanistan, maritime issues, and weapons of mass destruction. The United States considers threats to maritime security in the Asia-Pacific region as a major concern for its regional interests and those of its allies. India's growing military capabilities are seen as a counterbalance to China's power in Asia, leading to calls for increased U.S. security presence in the region. While India does not openly support this, their disputes with China and military disadvantages make them tacitly welcome. China is wary of the evolving strategic relationship between India and the U.S. There is increasing Chinese wariness of the strategic relationship between the United States and India, with concerns about potential realignments in Asia. Beijing protested discussions to form a quadrilateral group with the US, Japan, Australia, and India. Analysts predict that as Beijing agitates Asia's international relations, the US and India will naturally move closer together. Many analysts believe Chinese actions have pushed the US and India closer together, especially after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The US had less experience in dealing with Islamist terrorism compared to India, who had been facing the challenge since the early 1990s. New Delhi had urged Washington to increase its counterterrorism efforts, particularly concerning Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. The 9/11 attacks focused the US government on combating Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. The US and India aligned in their interest to fight terrorism, highlighted by the 2008 Mumbai attacks by LeT. LeT's expanding focus to include attacks on the US and its presence in neighboring countries like Nepal and Bangladesh further emphasized the need for US-India collaboration in counterterrorism efforts. The United States and India are motivated to collaborate in combating terrorist networks in South Asia, particularly in Afghanistan. Both countries seek a politically stable Afghanistan to prevent safe havens for Islamist terrorist groups. Despite obstacles at the tactical and policy level, they agree on the need to encourage stability and deny safe haven to terrorist networks. Both the United States and India aim to support stability in Afghanistan by backing the government in Kabul and promoting development initiatives. India is concerned about U.S. decisions regarding Afghanistan, particularly the lack of transparency and consultation with India. Washington reassured New Delhi in 2012 that the U.S. does not plan to abandon Afghanistan. The United States reassured New Delhi in 2012 that it does not plan to abandon Afghanistan. A strategic partnership was signed with Afghanistan, and cooperation on Afghanistan has improved significantly. Both countries emphasized the importance of sustained international commitment to Afghanistan's governance, development, and security. The United States and India discussed opportunities for promoting Afghanistan's development in various sectors like agriculture, mining, energy, and infrastructure. They emphasized the importance of women's economic empowerment and agreed to hold a trilateral dialogue with the Afghan government. They also highlighted the need for increased private investment and trade in Afghanistan to support its security and development needs. The United States and India emphasized the importance of improving Afghanistan's integration within the South and Central Asia region, including the need for an Afghan-led reconciliation process. They also highlighted the necessity of eliminating safe havens for terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Additionally, they discussed safeguarding sea lanes of communication in the Asia-Pacific region through a Maritime Security Cooperation Agreement. U.S.-India naval cooperation focuses on protecting commerce, addressing maritime security threats like piracy and weapons trafficking, and conducting joint humanitarian relief efforts. Both countries are concerned about China's growing naval capabilities and assertiveness in territorial claims. There are worries about Chinese-built port facilities in the Indian Ocean region potentially being used as naval bases in the future. The alleged \"string of pearls\" involving Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Oman as potential bases for Chinese naval vessels is a shared concern for Washington and New Delhi. U.S.-India relations have improved since the 1998 sanctions, with cooperation in the civil nuclear sphere opening up space for collaboration on security issues. The agreement tacitly recognized India's nuclear weapons arsenal, despite U.S. law restrictions. India's nuclear security measures are a concern for the U.S. nonproliferation community. New Delhi has not been forthcoming about its security protocols or allowed inspections. India's decision to join the Proliferation Security Initiative is pending, with conditions on membership. Despite attending meetings as observers since 2009, India has not formally joined the initiative. India's nuclear security cooperation with the United States has not been prioritized due to New Delhi's resistance. India's stance on arms control treaties like the NPT remains consistent, deeming them discriminatory. The US has accepted the status quo, despite India remaining outside the NPT framework. India remains outside of the NPT framework and has not signed the CTBT or FMCT due to concerns about nonproliferation and universal disarmament. The US pressure for India to sign the CTBT became moot after the treaty's rejection. India has participated in FMCT discussions but has reservations about the treaty's effectiveness. Discussions on the FMCT under the Obama Administration stalled due to opposition from Pakistan. India's stance on nonproliferation and disarmament has led to its exclusion from NPT, CTBT, and FMCT agreements. Despite reservations, India has shown support for U.N. sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and has actively enforced sanctions on nuclear material transfers. This has helped narrow differences between India and the U.S. on proliferation issues. India's foreign policies often clash with the United States due to differing perspectives. New Delhi aims to strengthen regional relations for domestic development and international prestige. India's cautious approach is reactive to security threats, while also aspiring to regional and global power status. The increasing economic and security ties between the U.S. and Asia influence India's strategic decisions. India's growing power needs consolidation, narrowing historical gap in U.S.-Indian perspectives. However, practical differences persist due to divergent foreign policy views, bureaucratic obstacles, and transactional partnership aspects hindering cooperation. Major divergent interests and obstacles include strategies towards Pakistan, terrorism, stances on Iran, promotion of liberal values, mutual mistrust, and bureaucratic functioning misunderstandings. The U.S. and India aim for a stable, democratic, and prosperous Pakistan free from Islamist militant groups. Strategies for dealing with threats from Pakistan and terrorist groups remain a challenge for U.S.-India security relations. Efforts to separate U.S. policy towards India and Pakistan have led to a deeper strategic partnership between the U.S. and India, with minimal consideration of relations with Islamabad. The Bush Administration viewed Pakistan as a key ally in the \"war on terrorism,\" leading to a significant increase in U.S. military and economic aid to the country. Despite concerns about Pakistani support for terrorist groups, the U.S. maintains cooperative relations due to its military presence in Afghanistan. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack and Osama bin Laden's killing in Abbottabad, U.S. observers question the strategic partnership with Pakistan due to its support for Afghan militants and sensitivities towards India. New Delhi's policies towards Pakistan often differ from the United States. The current New Delhi government is engaged in a peace process with Pakistani military ruler General Pervez Musharraf and his successors. Indian officials believe Pakistan's security services, especially the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, are at the root of regional and global issues with Islamist extremism. This puts India at odds with the United States, which sees Pakistan's security institutions as key players in resolving such problems. Tensions between India and Pakistan impact U.S.-India security relations, particularly in defense trade and intelligence sharing. U.S. efforts to moderate India's response to terrorist attacks inside India have also been influenced by its policy towards Pakistan. In efforts to moderate India's response to terrorist attacks, New Delhi is concerned about the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and the potential for Pakistani military to use defense systems against India. The deterioration of relations between the United States and Pakistan has led India to seek Washington's patience with Islamabad for a stable Pakistan. Both the United States and India aim for a stable, democratic, and economically viable Pakistan. The U.S. and India desire a stable, democratic, and economically viable Pakistan to combat terrorism. U.S. counterterrorism cooperation with India has been hindered by its ties with Pakistan and efforts to ease tensions between India and Pakistan. Washington's focus on Afghanistan has also limited pressure on Pakistan. Some analysts feel American efforts are lacking as long as Pakistan remains important in Afghanistan. Despite awareness of LeT's presence in South Asia, India's concerns about U.S. influence in the region restrict joint efforts. India is cautious of increasing U.S. involvement despite initial capacity building by the U.S. Department of Defense. India's traditionally positive relations with Iran have caused friction with the United States, especially regarding counterterrorism efforts. However, recent political shifts have led to a narrowing of the gap between the two countries, with India voting against Tehran in the UNSC and reducing oil imports from Iran. This has helped alleviate tensions between India and the United States. India's policy towards Iran has shifted as it aligns more closely with the United States and Western countries. Despite supporting some measures against Tehran, India has been careful not to sever ties with Iran to maintain access to key resources and strategic routes. India's policy towards Iran has shifted as it aligns more closely with the United States and Western countries. Despite supporting some measures against Tehran, India has been careful not to sever ties with Iran to maintain access to key resources and strategic routes. Central Asia through Iran's Chabbahar port on the Arabian Sea. India supports Tehran's right to peaceful nuclear energy use but also aims to prevent the emergence of another nuclear-armed neighbor. India supports the IAEA's role in resolving Iran's nuclear program disagreements and has voted in favor of resolutions and sanctions. Despite this, India maintains diplomatic and trade ties with Iran to demonstrate strategic autonomy and ensure diversity. India maintains trade ties with Iran to show strategic autonomy and ensure energy resource diversity. Despite resistance to sanctions not endorsed by the UN, US pressure led India to plan a reduction in Iranian oil imports. Since 2008, imports have decreased from 16% to 10% of India's total. Secretary of State Clinton urged India to cut oil imports from Iran in 2012, resulting in a US exemption for India from new sanctions. Analysts agree that India's relations and strategic objectives with Iran influenced these actions. In light of India's strategic objectives with Iran, Washington and New Delhi have reached a temporary middle ground on the Iran nuclear issue. Secretary Clinton expressed satisfaction during the 2012 U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, highlighting India's steps to diversify its sources of imported crude by reducing purchases of Iranian oil. This progress may not continue if certain events occur. India's strong opposition to military options against Iran aligns with its broader stance on international military interventions in the Middle East. The United States and India both endorse liberal values, but differ on how to expand them internationally. The U.S. takes a proactive approach, while India, with its colonial history, has a different perspective. India, with its colonial history, prioritizes national sovereignty and opposes international intervention in foreign affairs. This stance has led to policy differences with the United States, such as on approaches towards Burma's military regime. India's opposition to international intervention in foreign affairs has led to policy differences with the United States, particularly regarding sanctions against Burma. India pursued an engagement policy towards Rangoon, facilitating talks between Washington and Burma in 2012. Additionally, India objected to U.S. intervention in Iraq and withdrew logistical support under domestic pressure. India's non-permanent seat on the UNSC has led to disagreements with the United States on sanctions and military intervention for human rights abuses. The lack of Indian activism in global democratization efforts has strained U.S.-India collaboration on democracy and human rights issues. Reconciling their divergent approaches to spreading liberal political values remains a challenge. The U.S.-India strategic partnership continues to face challenges due to lingering mistrust on both sides. India remains skeptical about being drawn into a military alliance with the United States, fearing it may antagonize China. The term \"allies\" and \"interoperability\" have also caused tensions in bilateral defense discussions, with some in India holding onto a Cold War-era \"nonalignment\" mindset. India maintains a Cold War-era \"nonalignment\" mindset with deep mistrust of U.S. intentions, especially due to close ties with Pakistan. Doubts about U.S. reliability in defense trade persist, stemming from past nuclear sanctions. Indians are wary of buying U.S. defense equipment that may be affected by future sanctions and are suspicious of U.S. arms sales monitoring as a means of intelligence gathering. Some U.S.-based India analysts express concern over a perceived lack of reciprocity in the U.S. relationship with New Delhi. They argue that Washington has given too much without receiving significant benefits from India. There are doubts about India's ability to fulfill expectations as a global power and sustain economic growth. New Delhi's slow progress in military reform is criticized, but some argue the U.S.-India relationship should be seen beyond transactional terms. Efforts are being made to enhance mutual understanding through regular meetings on security matters, indicating a maturing security relationship. Despite efforts to enhance mutual understanding, the U.S.-India relationship still faces an \"understanding deficit\" leading to frustration and high expectations. Defense trade relations are a point of contention, with New Delhi criticizing U.S. transparency and licensing processes, while Washington points to a lack of clarity in India's procurement procedures. The mismatch between the U.S. FMS system and India's L1 competitive procurement format is a key issue. The MMRCA bid in India was significant for the U.S. as it showed that the FMS system could compete in Indian procurement. It also increased U.S. understanding of the Indian procurement process. The bilateral partnership between Washington and New Delhi faces challenges due to domestic politics, which can constrain compromises. Recent coalition politics in India can strain security relations with the U.S. as some constituencies remain wary. The bilateral partnership between Washington and New Delhi faces challenges due to domestic politics, with some constituencies in the U.S. wary of India becoming a \"junior partner.\" The micromanagement of military affairs by the Indian MOD limits cooperation between the two militaries. Efforts are being made to reduce bureaucratic barriers and familiarize with each other's procedures. The U.S. Administration and Indian government are working to reduce bureaucratic barriers to enhance cooperation in defense relations. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter is focused on streamlining defense ties with India, emphasizing the importance of removing obstacles for closer collaboration. Both countries are hopeful about sincere efforts to improve cooperation. Officials in the U.S. and India stress the need for long-term patience and downplay short-term expectations. Both countries have strengthened cooperation in areas of shared strategic objectives, with potential for further unexplored collaboration. Efforts to involve India in supporting stability in Afghanistan have increased, but divergent strategic perspectives, particularly regarding Pakistan, limit the depth of the partnership. The U.S. and India have strengthened their bilateral partnership, focusing on similarities and addressing differences as they arise, including on issues like Iran. The U.S. Congress made amendments to nonproliferation laws to support India in civil nuclear and high-technology trade, leading to broader security cooperation and defense trade. The 2008 U.S.-India civilian nuclear deal aimed to boost India's electricity capacity and benefit the U.S. economy through nuclear trade. However, the broader goal was to establish strategic cooperation by building Indian trust in Washington. The Obama Administration and pro-India analysts prioritize long-term engagement over short-term gains, which can lead to raised expectations that may not be met. The failure of U.S. defense firms to secure contracts for new jets in India has led to frustrations in Washington. There is a need for more concrete actions to deepen bilateral security cooperation between the U.S. and India. Congress can play a role in guiding this process through legislative consideration and oversight of foreign relations in Asia."
