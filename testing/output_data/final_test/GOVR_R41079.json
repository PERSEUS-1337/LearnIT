    "content": "A fundamental objective of congressional oversight is to hold executive officials accountable for the implementation of delegated authority, especially given the significant expansion of executive influence in the modern era. The Founding Fathers would likely be surprised by the creation of a \"presidential branch\" of government and the establishment of numerous federal departments and agencies. The Department of Homeland Security, formed in 2002 from the merger of 22 separate units, is the newest addition to the cabinet. Contemporary presidents have expressed concerns about the size and reach of the national government. President Reagan and President Clinton both expressed concerns about the size and reach of the national government. Despite efforts to reduce government size, administrations of both parties have seen continued growth. President George W. Bush oversaw one of the largest expansions of government in history, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. President Bush expanded the DHS, increased federal spending, and imposed new rules on local and state governments. He also initiated the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to address the financial crisis. President Obama inherited a severe economic downturn and intervened with trillions of dollars to revive the economy and prevent a deeper recession. The Obama administration aimed to revive the economy and prevent a depression by expanding the role of government. Congress needs to exercise oversight to check the authority granted to federal agencies. The report's goals include discussing reasons for government expansion, defining oversight, highlighting its purposes, reviewing laws and techniques, and identifying incentives. The report discusses oversight techniques, incentives, and disincentives in congressional oversight. Founding Fathers debated the role of government, with Jefferson advocating for limited government and Hamilton for a robust national government. The essence of self-government is continuous negotiation among the public. Jefferson preferred a limited government that allows individuals to regulate their own pursuits, while Hamilton advocated for a strong national government. Jefferson used government power to double the size of the country with the Louisiana Purchase. Hamilton believed in the implied powers of government for the nation's survival and prosperity. Hamilton believed in a strong national government with the power to address common problems collectively, while Jefferson favored limited government and states' rights. The Hamiltonian view has largely prevailed over the Jeffersonian perspective in the contemporary era. The Jeffersonian view of limited government and states' rights resonates with many Americans, but their support for government programs contradicts their beliefs. Despite ideological conservatism, many individuals benefit from and welcome government expansion in various areas. Throughout American history, the national government has taken on more functions and responsibilities, leading to a significant increase in its size and power. The expansion of government has been driven by domestic and international crises, such as wars and the need for protection against threats like the Soviet Union. The government's growth is also fueled by the internationalization of issues like trade, the environment, and drug trafficking, as well as the constant emergence of new problems that require governmental action. The expansion of the federal government is driven by various factors such as domestic and international crises, trade, environment, and drug trafficking. The complexity of national programs involves multiple federal agencies and international organizations. The government's involvement in issues like civil rights, financial turmoil, and education has increased, leading to a larger federal establishment. The size and reach of the federal government have increased, making congressional oversight crucial for ensuring efficient functioning. Oversight involves legislative supervision of executive branch authority, holding agencies accountable. Different definitions of oversight impact perspectives on its adequacy. Oversight is crucial for legislative supervision of executive branch authority, ensuring efficient functioning and accountability. Definitions of oversight go beyond dictionaries, including review after the fact and investigations of past actions. Members of Congress have been urged to devote more time to oversight rather than overlooking. Oversight is a vital aspect of legislative supervision over the executive branch, ensuring efficiency and accountability. Definitions vary but generally involve reviewing past actions and holding executive officers accountable for financial transactions. Congress engages in oversight through committees and subcommittees, although the extent of this oversight is challenging to quantify due to differing definitions. Oversight on Capitol Hill occurs in various ways, including hearings, meetings, and informal settings. It is intertwined with congressional activities such as committee meetings, confirmation processes, and legislative communications with administrative leaders. The frequency and extent of oversight by Congress are difficult to measure due to methodological limitations. Undercounting likely characterizes the amount of oversight carried out primarily through committees, Members, staff aides, and legislative support units. The traditional method of congressional oversight is through committee hearings and investigations into executive branch operations. Congress has a history of conducting investigations with varying results, including successes like the Truman Committee's investigation of waste and fraud during World War II. The effectiveness of oversight may vary, but certain components contribute to quality oversight. Key components of effective oversight include a committed committee chair, involvement of members, bipartisanship, skilled staff, preparation for hearings, coordination with other committees, follow-through on recommendations, and cooperation with the Administration. If necessary, committees may use compulsory processes to obtain information. Congressional oversight is a constitutional obligation. Oversight is a constitutional obligation of Congress, with key witnesses testifying. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. noted that the power to make laws implies the power to ensure they are executed faithfully. Congress has formal powers like the purse strings and impeachment to hold the president accountable. Oversight serves programmatic, political, and institutional purposes in our system of checks and balances. Oversight serves various purposes, including ensuring cost-effective government operations, evaluating program performance, and investigating waste and abuse. It also has political objectives like generating favorable publicity for lawmakers and winning electoral support. Congressional oversight occurs within a political context that can range from cooperation to conflict with administrative entities. The oversight function of Congress involves inherent tensions with the President, especially during periods of unified government. Partisan and inter-branch conflicts are common, serving institutional purposes such as checking executive power, investigating law administration, and informing Congress and the public about executive activities. The modern era has seen a significant expansion of executive entities, leading to the term \"the administrative state.\" The rise of the administrative state has created a policymaking rival to Congress, with federal agencies staffed by specialists who write rules, enforce regulations, shape policy, and influence lawmakers. The executive branch's extensive activities highlight the importance of oversight in protecting citizens' interests. The importance of oversight in Congress is highlighted by the rise of the administrative state, which has created a policymaking rival to Congress. Congressional oversight involves continuous review of how the executive branch carries out legislative mandates, ensuring efficient and effective administration of laws. This active participation in administrative decision-making is crucial to the lawmaking process. Congress must perform oversight to ensure that laws are enforced as intended. This function allows for transparency and accountability in government actions, as highlighted by Woodrow Wilson's belief that informing the public is more important than lawmaking. Congress must perform oversight to ensure laws are enforced as intended. Woodrow Wilson believed informing the public is more important than lawmaking. To encourage legislative oversight, laws and rules have been enacted to complement monitoring techniques for executive branch performance. This demonstrates Congress's interest in strengthening oversight procedures and obtaining information from the executive branch. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the Congressional Review Act of 1996 (CRA) enhance legislative oversight by requiring agencies to set strategic goals, prepare annual performance plans and reports, and reduce duplication among federal agencies. Overlap and duplication exist among federal agencies implementing similar policy areas, leading to inefficiencies in food inspection. Lawmakers have called for restructuring due to the involvement of multiple agencies and laws in ensuring food safety. The lack of a single responsible individual for food safety was highlighted, with examples of different agencies inspecting different types of pizzas. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to review and reject agency rules, emphasizing the need to address duplication in government oversight. The Congressional Review Act requires agencies to submit major rules to Congress and the GAO before taking effect. It allows for expedited procedures in the Senate for disapproval resolutions, but has been rarely used to block agency rules. Only one rule has been rejected since its inception, with interpretive ambiguities and the President's veto power cited as reasons for its limited use. The President can veto a joint resolution of disapproval, making it unlikely for Congress to override the veto due to the two-thirds vote required. However, Congress can still express its views on agency rulemaking and repeal rules through passing statutes. The House has formal oversight rules, including a requirement for standing committees to review significant laws, programs, or agencies every 10 years. The House and Senate have rules in place for oversight. House committees must hold hearings on waste, fraud, and abuse every year, while the Senate requires evaluations of regulatory impact in committee reports. The Senate Rule XXVI, clause 11 assigns oversight authority to standing committees for specific policy areas. Committees can investigate and make recommendations in broad policy areas, even if they lack legislative jurisdiction. This rule change aims to correct the lack of comprehensive overview in certain policy areas. The House has a similar rule called \"special oversight.\" The House and Senate have rules for oversight authority in specific policy areas. The House rule is called \"special oversight,\" allowing committees to review governmental activities related to homeland security. Congress uses various oversight techniques like hearings and investigations to hold agencies accountable. Hearings and investigations in Congress focus on assessing federal program efficiency, agency response to directives, and public support. Hearings generally evaluate agency effectiveness, while investigations often delve into allegations of wrongdoing and fraud. The reauthorization process in Congress can establish, continue, or abolish federal agencies or programs. It serves as an important oversight tool, ensuring agencies receive direction, guidance, legislation, and leadership. The FCC requires direction, guidance, legislation, and leadership from Congress to establish program priorities. Oversight through the reauthorization process is crucial, as it raises significant issues and allows for effective oversight of agencies and programs. Congress's power of the purse is a key tool in this process. The power of the purse gives Congress the ability to abolish agencies or enhance federal programs by cutting or increasing funds. Appropriating panels have significant influence in shaping federal agencies and programs. The appropriating process serves as an oversight method, using both spending reductions and incentives to ensure agencies defend their budgets and improve performance. Congress has established statutory offices of inspectors general in nearly 70 federal entities to conduct investigations and audits for efficiency and accountability. Inspectors generals oversee agency operations, appointed by the President or agency heads. They report findings to the Attorney General for criminal law violations, semiannually to agency heads, and immediately for serious issues. Special inspectors generals audit specific programs like Iraq and Afghanistan Reconstruction. Congress uses inspectors generals as a defense against fraud. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was established in 1921 and functions as Congress's investigative arm with about 3,100 employees. GAO conducts financial and program audits, evaluating executive activities and programs. GAO reports to Congress on agency activities and program performance through periodic reports and testimony before committees. For example, GAO found that 19 out of 24 Federal agencies could not fully explain how they spent taxpayer money. The head of GAO is the Comptroller General. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is headed by the Comptroller General, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 15-year term. GAO conducts field investigations, prescribes accounting standards, prepares policy analyses, adjudicates bid protests, makes recommendations for legislative action, evaluates programs, and provides legal opinions. It submits hundreds of reports to Congress annually, focusing on rooting out waste and mismanagement in executive branch programs and promoting program performance. One of its traditional reports to Congress is on government programs and activities that are \"high risk.\" Numerous laws require executive agencies to submit reports periodically to Congress and its committees. Reporting requirements provide data and analysis for Congress to oversee legislation and foreign policy implementation by the executive branch, promoting agency accountability. High-ranking public officials are chosen by the President with Senate approval. Nomination hearings establish nominees' policy views and accountability. Committees may ask nominees about plans to address high-risk programs. Nominees may pledge to testify at hearings when requested. Program evaluation is an oversight approach using social science and management methodology to assess government program effectiveness. President Obama emphasized the importance of measuring program effectiveness, with input from agencies, Congress, and the public. Rigorous evaluation can determine program success. \"Lawmakers handle thousands of constituent requests yearly, ranging from Social Security issues to tax appeals. Casework is seen as nonpolitical and can highlight administrative issues. Solutions to individual problems can lead to broader legislative remedies.\" The ultimate check on the executive branch is impeachment and removal from office, vested exclusively in Congress. Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House, followed by a two-thirds vote in the Senate for conviction. This process has been used only in a limited number of instances over the past 200 years. Over the past 200 years, impeachment has been used only in a limited number of instances involving executive branch officials, judges, and Presidents. Oversight on Capitol Hill sometimes lacks continuous watchfulness due to various institutional and other developments, leading to disincentives and incentives that limit committees and lawmakers' ability to carry out their oversight function effectively. Legislative schedules, campaign fund-raising, travel, meetings with constituents, and media interviews can distract lawmakers from oversight. Unified government may discourage aggressive oversight, especially in times of partisan polarization. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized Washington for focusing on decision-making rather than implementation. Some senior House Republicans expressed reluctance to conduct oversight of President George W. Bush's Administration, preferring to avoid causing controversy unless necessary. They felt that the government operated more like a parliament than a Congress, leading to a lack of oversight. Additionally, they believed that oversight could be unproductive and tedious, preferring to focus on creating new programs. Lawmakers also feared backlash from constituents and special interests if they conducted hard-hitting investigations. One of the main reasons for legislative oversight of the executive branch is divided government, where one party controls Congress and the other the White House. Political and substantive issues drive interest in oversight. For example, when Republicans took control of the House, they issued over a thousand subpoenas to Clinton administration officials, unlike when Democrats were in power. Policy disagreements between the President and the congressional majority party, especially under divided government, contribute to the amount and scope of oversight. Members of the majority party may use oversight to highlight policy differences and embarrass the president, while electoral incentives also drive lawmakers to oversee the bureaucracy. This includes assisting constituents with federal agencies and gaining favorable publicity for resolving program flaws or inequities. Members of Congress have electoral incentives to oversee executive programs, seeking attention from the press and constituents. Public concern about fiscal challenges and inefficiencies in federal programs also drive committees to scrutinize and potentially eliminate wasteful agencies or programs. This oversight could result in significant cost savings. Congress has significant authority to oversee the executive branch through control of the purse strings, enactment of laws, investigations, and confirmation roles. Oversight can be prompted by specific events, such as the 2009 Christmas Day attempt to blow up an airplane, leading to multiple committee hearings and investigations. Congress engages in different types of oversight, including programmatic versus political, adversarial versus cooperative, formal versus informal, and police patrol versus fire alarm. Police patrol oversight is proactive and systematic, while fire alarm oversight is reactive. Congress is utilizing technology and civic-minded individuals for extra oversight assistance, leading to the democratization of the review function. Groups like Project on Government Oversight (POGO) and The Heritage Foundation, bloggers, and websites monitor federal agencies. President Obama has prioritized transparency and open government, leading federal agencies to post more information online for public scrutiny. Websites like Recovery.gov and StimulusWatch.org allow individuals to monitor projects funded by the $800 billion economic stimulus package. This increased transparency aims to elicit more informed public oversight to guide federal policies and programs. The blogosphere enhances public oversight of government spending and activities, providing millions of extra eyes. Congress plays a crucial role in ensuring that executive policies align with the values of the American people and meet the challenges of a changing nation and world."
