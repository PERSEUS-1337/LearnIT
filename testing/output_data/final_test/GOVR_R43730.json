    "content": "The U.S. government prioritized air travel safety post-9/11, leading to the creation of the TSA to secure all modes of transportation. The TSA uses the \"No Fly\" list to prevent individuals deemed a threat from boarding commercial flights. Reports suggest over 80,000 people are on the list, but some dispute their placement. Some individuals claim they were wrongly placed on the No Fly list due to government errors, leading to travel disruptions. The Department of Homeland Security offers a redress process for affected travelers, but legal challenges have arisen regarding due process rights. Recent case law addresses issues surrounding the government's watchlists and challenges to the No Fly list. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is the central information bank for the U.S. government on known and suspected terrorists. It maintains the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) containing derogatory information about suspected international terrorists. Agencies nominate individuals to be included on the list based on intelligence evaluations. As of June 30, 2016, about 1.5 million persons were included on the list. The NCTC maintains the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) with information on known or suspected terrorists. TIDE includes 1.5 million persons, with 15,000 being U.S. persons. The database is classified, but an unclassified subset is shared with the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) to operate the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). TSDB does not include derogatory intelligence information, unlike TIDE. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) manages the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) containing sensitive terrorist identity information. The TSDB receives data from TIDE for international terrorists and the FBI's ACSS for domestic terrorists. The TSC reviews each file to ensure it meets watchlist standards before adding names to the TSDB. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) manages the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) and requires biographic information to meet specific criteria for inclusion. The information must contain identifying data and meet a reasonable suspicion standard to be added to the TSDB. This standard is not mandated by statute but is based on internal Executive Branch policy and practice. The TSDB contains sensitive information about suspected terrorists, accessible to various organizations for combating terrorism. TSA receives two lists for monitoring flights: the No Fly list and the Selectee list, with different restrictions and screening procedures. The No Fly and Selectee lists have stricter requirements for inclusion than the TSDB. To be on these lists, there must be reasonable suspicion of meeting heightened derogatory criteria. Individuals on these lists will not receive notice and will be denied boarding or face enhanced screening. The failed terrorist attack by the \"underwear bomber\" led to changes in the No Fly list criteria. Following the failed terrorist attack by the \"underwear bomber\" in 2009, the NCTC and TSC were instructed to add individuals from the TIDE database to the No Fly list, even those without clear ties to terrorism. A subsequent review by the TSC, FBI, and other agencies took over two years to complete, raising concerns about the process. The government's criteria for placing individuals on terrorist watchlists, including the No Fly list, are not publicly disclosed. After the 9/11 Commission Report, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 shifted the responsibility of matching passenger data against watchlists to the TSA. The Secure Flight program was implemented in 2008 to comply with these requirements. The Secure Flight program, implemented in 2008, requires aircraft operators to collect Secure Flight Passenger Data (SFPD) from passengers, including full name, date of birth, gender, and itinerary. This information must be provided to TSA about 72 hours prior to the flight for matching against watchlists. TSA then performs manual reviews to ensure security. Since 2008, the Secure Flight program mandates airlines to collect passenger data for security checks. TSA manually reviews potential matches against watchlists and may prohibit certain passengers from boarding. Passengers can be cleared to fly, selected for enhanced screening, or barred from boarding based on risk categories. TSA has discretion to check against various watchlists as needed. TSA has discretion to check against the entire TSDB and other watchlists for security reasons, developing new lists for high-risk passengers subject to enhanced screening. Working with Customs and Border Protection, Secure Flight has developed two lists for enhanced screening based on intelligence information. TSA matches against an Expanded Selectee List since April 2011, including records in the TSDB not on the No Fly list. The TSA has the authority to screen individuals against the TSDB and other watchlists to identify known or suspected terrorists who are subject to enhanced screening. Some travelers have reported being denied boarding due to mistaken identity with someone on the watchlist. The DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) to address such issues. The DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) to efficiently resolve traveler complaints regarding government screening processes. The program centralizes the review and response process for complaints. Recently, the government revised the redress procedures following litigation on their constitutionality. Passengers previously denied boarding or subjected to additional screening could seek redress online or by mail, receiving a redress number. If a potential match to the TSDB was found, the case was referred to the TSC for further review. The agency referred potential matches to the TSC for further review. TSC determined if the person matched someone in the TSDB and decided their status on the No Fly or Selectee list. Travelers not matching the TSDB were added to the DHS TRIP Cleared List. Those on the Cleared List could be cleared by Secure Flight for boarding. DHS TRIP notified travelers when the review process was complete, without confirming their status on the No Fly list. The letter did not confirm or deny an individual's status on the No Fly list or TSDB. Travelers could seek judicial review in a U.S. court of appeals, where the court could remand the case to the agency for further consideration. Even after judicial review, travelers were never informed of their watchlist status or permission to board flights. The DHS TRIP redress process did not provide reasons for inclusion on the list or a hearing. The government's policy was to neither confirm nor deny an individual's placement on the No Fly list. The original redress process was challenged for violating the Due Process Clause, leading to revisions in the DHS TRIP procedures. The current process allows individuals denied boarding to receive a letter indicating their No Fly list status and the option to provide additional information. The DHS TRIP process allows individuals on the No Fly list to request further information and submit additional details for review. After receiving a response, the TSC Redress office evaluates the case and makes a recommendation to the TSA Administrator, who then makes a final decision on the individual's status on the list. The final decision on an individual's status on the No Fly list is made by the TSA Administrator, either removing them, maintaining their status, or requesting further information. The Fifth Amendment ensures due process for all individuals, including procedural and substantive due process to protect rights and liberty interests. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals' 'liberty' or 'property' interests. Courts have recognized that placement on the No Fly list can implicate procedural and substantive due process rights. This report primarily focuses on procedural due process claims, as they have been more extensively analyzed by federal courts. The No Fly list redress process involves allegations of deprivation of the right to international travel without due process of law. Courts assess if there has been a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest and if the procedures used comply with due process. The Supreme Court recognizes a right to travel as part of liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment. The right to international travel is considered a liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The right to international travel is a liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, subject to reasonable governmental regulations. Courts assess the scope of policies and their impact on travel ability. Not all restrictions on travel raise due process concerns. In Gilmore v. Gonzales, the court upheld TSA's ID requirement for interstate flights, ruling it did not violate the right to travel. The court ruled that the government's policy on presenting identification for interstate travel did not violate the right to travel, as the Constitution does not guarantee a specific form of transportation. Placement on the No Fly list can restrict international travel, which is considered a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Flying is often the only feasible method for international travel. Placement on the No Fly list is seen as a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest, triggering procedural due process protection. The \"stigma-plus\" doctrine allows for a due process claim if there is public disclosure of a stigmatizing statement by the government and denial of a legal right or status. Placement on the No Fly list is considered a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest, leading to procedural due process protection. The \"stigma-plus\" doctrine allows for a due process claim if there is public disclosure of a stigmatizing statement by the government and denial of a legal right or status recognized by state law. Some plaintiffs met the first prong by showing sufficient stigmatization, but failed to satisfy the second prong by not demonstrating tangible harm to their personal or professional lives attributable to their association with the No-Fly List. The \"stigma-plus\" doctrine allows for a due process claim if there is public disclosure of a stigmatizing statement by the government and denial of a legal right or status recognized by state law. Some plaintiffs met the first prong by showing sufficient stigmatization, but failed to satisfy the second prong by not demonstrating tangible harm to their personal or professional lives attributable to their association with the No-Fly List. Another district court found the stigma plus doctrine was not satisfied because the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege facts that would \"give rise to an inference that the stigmatizing statements reached the other passengers so as to cause harm to Plaintiff's reputation.\" The government must provide due process when depriving someone of a constitutionally protected liberty interest, such as the right to international travel. Due process is flexible and varies based on the situation, with procedural protections tailored to the specific circumstances. Courts consider the private interests affected and the government's interest when determining the appropriate procedural safeguards. The balancing test in Mathews v. Eldridge guides this decision-making process. In Mathews v. Eldridge, the Supreme Court established a balancing test to determine the procedural protections required when the government deprives someone of life, liberty, or property. The court considers the private interest at stake, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government's interest in order to determine the necessary procedural safeguards for due process. The right to international travel is a constitutionally protected liberty interest that can be infringed by placement on the No Fly list. When assessing a procedural due process challenge, courts consider the severity, length, and finality of the deprivation to determine the necessary procedural protections. For example, the Supreme Court has ruled that the termination of welfare benefits is more severe than the termination of disability benefits, requiring different levels of procedural safeguards. Placement on the No Fly list can restrict international travel, potentially infringing on a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Courts weigh the severity of the deprivation to determine the level of procedural protections required. The DOJ argues that there is no guaranteed right to the most convenient means of travel. The Constitution does not guarantee a right to the most convenient means of travel, including travel by airplane. Being on the No Fly list does not completely bar travel, so the deprivation is considered less significant. Courts assess the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty and the value of additional procedures in preventing errors. This includes examining the government's decision-making process for placing individuals on the list and the current procedures for travelers through DHS TRIP. The risk of error in deprivation cases is assessed based on the decisionmaker's discretion, standard of proof required, and the ability to challenge evidence. The Supreme Court distinguishes between medical assessments and decisions based on various information sources. Higher evidentiary thresholds are required for severing parental rights. In cases like security clearance revocations, the ability to challenge evidence is crucial. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of disclosing evidence to individuals in cases where governmental action results in serious harm. This allows individuals to challenge the accuracy of the government's conclusions and present their own arguments. This principle applies to various contexts, such as security clearance revocations and disability benefits, to safeguard against mistakes and ensure a fair process. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for individuals to receive fair notice and opportunity to challenge the government's factual assertions in cases involving serious harm. This principle applies to various contexts to prevent errors and ensure a fair process. Some individuals challenging their placement on the No Fly list argue that the current standard and procedure create a high risk of error and deprivation. There is discretion involved in determining someone as a danger to aviation safety, and travelers lack the opportunity to challenge their placement effectively. The No Fly list raises concerns about errors and lack of due process for individuals labeled as aviation safety risks. While the government argues improvements in the Secure Flight program and the availability of a redress process through DHS TRIP, critics point to past errors and the need for judicial review to prevent wrongful deprivations. The balance between government interests and procedural safeguards is crucial in addressing these issues. The government has a strong interest in preventing terrorism and ensuring air travel safety, with the No Fly list being a crucial tool. Protecting sensitive national security information is also a priority, as disclosing classified information could jeopardize national security. The potential danger of disclosing certain material may outweigh the benefit to the plaintiff, as it could harm intelligence sources and methods. The executive branch has argued that due process does not always require confrontation and rebuttal, especially with sensitive information. Courts have been hesitant to force the release of classified information in cases involving national security concerns. However, a federal district court suggested that allowing a plaintiff's counsel with proper security clearances to access government evidence could address some national security worries. Some courts have debated the balance between protecting national security and providing due process in cases involving sensitive information. The Seventh Circuit highlighted the risk of inadvertently revealing classified material during legal proceedings, while the Ninth Circuit has approved certain procedures. One alternative is for the government to provide unclassified summaries of information to plaintiffs. Different procedural protections may impact national security differently, such as requiring prior notice and a hearing for individuals placed on the No Fly list. The Supreme Court has recognized that a pre-deprivation hearing is not always necessary in situations involving substantial national security concerns or public safety. Federal district courts have addressed challenges to placement on the No Fly list, alleging violations of due process. In a case in the Northern District of California, a federal court ruled on a claim brought by Rahinah Ibrahim, a Malaysian national prevented from boarding a plane in 2005. In 2005, Rahinah Ibrahim, a Malaysian national under a student visa, was mistakenly placed on the No Fly list, leading to her being prevented from boarding a plane to Malaysia. The court ruled that the government must correct its lists and records of mistaken information and certify the corrections made. The judge also ordered the government to disclose if she was still on the No Fly list, stating that the current redress procedures did not meet due process in cases of mistaken placement. The court ruling was limited to cases where the government admits to mistakenly placing a traveler on the No Fly list. Other federal district courts have found government procedures violated due process even when error was not conceded. In Latif v. Holder, plaintiffs were barred from flying and government replies did not confirm or deny their No Fly list status. The court recognized the plaintiffs' constitutional right to travel internationally by air and found their liberty interests significantly affected by being on the list. The court found that the DHS TRIP process failed to provide due process for individuals placed on the No-Fly list. The procedures had a low evidentiary standard and one-sided review process, increasing the risk of factual errors going uncorrected. This led to a high risk of erroneous deprivation of the plaintiffs' liberty interests. The court found that the absence of meaningful procedures to contest placement on the No Fly list violated due process. The government was ordered to create new procedures that notify individuals of their status on the list and provide opportunities to present evidence. The court ordered the government to create new procedures for individuals on the No Fly list to contest their placement, ensuring a meaningful opportunity to respond while considering national security risks on a case-by-case basis. The adequacy of the revised DHS TRIP redress process has also been questioned for violating the Due Process Clause. The court in Latif v. Holder ruled that the prior DHS TRIP procedures violated due process. While rejecting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the revised procedures, the court noted that the new procedures appear to allow for a constitutionally adequate post-deprivation review. Substantial issues exist regarding whether DHS TRIP adequately provides for judicial review of placement on the No Fly List. The court in Latif v. Lynch ruled that the revised procedures for DHS TRIP petitions did not violate due process. The court determined that the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard is appropriate for placing individuals on the No Fly list, rather than the \"clear and convincing\" standard used in other cases. The court ruled that the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard is appropriate for placement on the No Fly list. Due process requires the government to provide reasons for placement on the list, but classified information or actual evidence is not required to be released. The court found that the revised DHS TRIP procedures met the standard by providing an unclassified summary of reasons to the plaintiffs. However, it was unclear if the disclosure to each individual plaintiff was sufficient as the record did not indicate what information was withheld. The court found that the revised DHS TRIP procedures met the standard by providing an unclassified summary of reasons to the plaintiffs, but the record was not sufficiently developed to decide the adequacy of the disclosures made to the specific plaintiffs. The lack of a live hearing with an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses was also deemed not to violate due process, citing similar procedures approved in other contexts. The court noted the substantial similarity in weight between property interest and liberty interest deprivation in cases involving national security concerns. The court concluded that a document-based hearing is sufficient for national security concerns, and the government must minimize withheld information. Some travelers challenged their No Fly list placement outside of the DHS TRIP review, facing hurdles due to governmental privileges. The government's use of privileges like state secrets, law enforcement, and deliberative process can prevent plaintiffs in No Fly list cases from accessing sensitive information during discovery, hindering their ability to challenge their placement on the list. The state secrets privilege allows the government to withhold information if it could endanger national security, with the court independently assessing the validity of the claim. The state secrets privilege allows the government to withhold sensitive information in cases challenging placement on the No Fly list, hindering plaintiffs' ability to challenge their status. In a 2015 case, the government invoked this privilege to dismiss the case entirely, preventing any inquiry into the redress process or nomination procedures. The government argued that the privileged information could be at risk of disclosure during future proceedings, leading to a motion to dismiss the case, which was denied by the court. The law enforcement privilege is invoked to protect sensitive information and prevent interference with investigations. The law enforcement privilege is invoked to protect sensitive information and prevent interference with investigations. The privilege is not absolute and courts balance the public interest in nondisclosure against a litigant's need for access to privileged information. In cases involving the No Fly list, the executive branch has asserted this privilege over information related to terrorist databases and placement procedures. The deliberative process privilege allows the government to withhold material related to decision-making processes. It is not absolute and can be challenged by a plaintiff demonstrating a need for the materials. In the context of the No Fly list, plaintiffs may access deliberative materials if their need for accurate fact-finding outweighs the government's interest in non-disclosure. The TSA can designate certain information as \"sensitive security information\" to protect transportation security, limiting public access. However, plaintiffs and their counsel can still access this information in specific circumstances. The government's No Fly list raises complex legal issues, with lower courts previously finding the redress procedures unconstitutional. The revised framework is now under litigation, with initial rulings generally favoring its constitutionality."
