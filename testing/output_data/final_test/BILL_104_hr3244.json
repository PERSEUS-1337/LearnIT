    "content": "The \"District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act\" limits income tax on residents of the District of Columbia by adding a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new part includes a limitation on tax imposed on residents of the District of Columbia. The net income tax for residents of the District of Columbia is limited under the \"District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act.\" This limitation is determined by a combination of district-sourced income exceeding an exemption amount and the average rate of non-district-sourced adjusted gross income. For District of Columbia residents, being physically present in the district for at least 183 days and filing a DC income tax return qualifies them as residents for the taxable year. The net income tax is the regular tax liability plus section 55 tax, minus credits under part IV. The exemption amount is defined as... The exemption amount for different filing statuses is $30,000 for joint returns or surviving spouses, $15,000 for single individuals or married filing separately, and $25,000 for heads of households. The average rate is calculated by dividing the sum of regular tax liability and section 55 tax by taxable income. The term 'District-sourced income' refers to adjusted gross income reduced by non-District-sourced income, net capital gain from gains and losses in DC, deductions from sections 170 and 163 for qualified residence interest. If a percentage is not a whole number, it is rounded to the nearest whole number. For tax purposes, non-District-sourced adjusted gross income is the taxpayer's income from outside DC minus deductions used to calculate adjusted gross income. Income not specified is considered from within DC, while personal service income is from DC unless it's retirement income. Services performed in the Washington-Baltimore area are treated as performed in the District of Columbia. If at least 80 percent of an individual's service hours are in the Washington-Baltimore area during a taxable year, all services are considered performed in the District of Columbia for tax purposes. The Washington-Baltimore area includes the Washington/Baltimore Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and St. Mary's County, Maryland. Interest received during the taxable year is generally treated as from sources outside the District of Columbia, with exceptions for small amounts of non-district-sourced interest. Interest received during the taxable year is generally treated as from sources outside the District of Columbia, with exceptions for small amounts of non-district-sourced interest. Businesses in the District of Columbia may have a portion of their interest payments treated as from sources within the District based on their franchise tax return. Interest may be treated as from sources within the District of Columbia if certain conditions are met, such as the interest being paid by a debtor who filed an income tax return with the District of Columbia in the prior year. Interest may be treated as from sources within the District of Columbia if paid by a debtor who filed a franchise tax return with the District of Columbia for the current taxable year. Dividends received or accrued during the taxable year shall also be treated as from sources within the District of Columbia. During the taxable year, dividends from sources outside the District of Columbia are treated as such, except for amounts under $400. Dividends paid by a corporation doing business in the district are treated as from within the District of Columbia. During the prior calendar year, dividends are sourced based on the D.C. percentage shown on the tax return. Tangible property disposition is sourced to its location at the time of sale, while intangible property disposition is treated accordingly. Intangible property disposition is sourced based on the location of income before the disposition. Rentals are sourced where the property is located, royalties are treated as from outside the District of Columbia, and income from a proprietorship is sourced accordingly. Income from a proprietorship in the District of Columbia is treated as from sources outside the District, unless the taxpayer files a franchise tax return with the District of Columbia. For partnerships, income is sourced based on the partnership's activities. Partnership income (excluding income included in net earnings from self-employment) is treated as from sources outside the District of Columbia, with exceptions for partnerships that filed a franchise tax return in D.C. or were not required to file. Income from a partnership, estate, and trust is sourced based on specific criteria, such as the partnership's filing status in D.C. and the decedent's domicile. Income from a trust is treated as from the same sources as the trust's income. Definitions for retirement income and D.C. percentage are provided for tax purposes. The section does not apply to estates or trusts. The Secretary will create necessary regulations. Conforming amendments are made to the tax code. The section on limitation of tax imposed on residents of the District of Columbia applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
