    "content": "Most economists agree that technological innovation drives long-term increases in living standards and economic output. Public and private investments in research and development are crucial for innovation. Developed countries use policies like tax incentives to boost R&D investment. The U.S. government offers tax incentives for R&D investment, including a tax credit and the option to expense research expenditures. Evidence shows that the tax credit has stimulated more private R&D investment. Companies benefiting from both incentives can have a negative effective tax rate on R&D returns. Critics argue that the Section 41 tax credit for R&D investment may subsidize projects with little social returns and provide weak incentives. They also claim that profits from patented innovations developed with the credit are being shifted to lower-tax countries, depriving the U.S. government of tax revenue. Major American-based multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have reportedly saved billions in income taxes through this practice. Major American-based multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Google have reportedly saved billions in income taxes by transferring ownership of patents to subsidiaries in low-tax countries. Some suggest using a patent box tax incentive to target profits from business R&D investments instead of input costs. Countries have adopted patent boxes to prevent the transfer of qualified IP to low-tax countries, increase domestic tax base, boost domestic investment in innovative activities, and create well-paying jobs. Tax reform is a priority in Congress, with some lawmakers considering enacting a patent box to promote domestic R&D investment and production of technologies. In July 2015, Representatives Neal and Boustany proposed a draft allowing corporations to deduct 71% of profits from intellectual property, potentially taxed at a lower rate. Interest in this proposal may resurface in the 115th Congress for tax reform efforts. Lawmakers are concerned about European nations' tax advantages from patent boxes. The report examines patent boxes, their purpose, design considerations, countries with patent boxes, elements of these boxes, and industries in the U.S. that could benefit. It also discusses the effectiveness of patent boxes and policy issues related to them. A patent box is a tax incentive for income from qualified intellectual property, taxed at a lower rate. A patent box is a tax incentive for income from qualified intellectual property, taxed at a lower rate to promote various aims such as increasing tax revenues, preventing a shrinkage in the tax base, expanding innovation investment, and stimulating job growth in a host country. Some countries have tax incentives known as patent boxes that apply to income from patented innovations, trademarks, and copyrights. Developed countries use various policies, including R&D tax incentives, to encourage domestic investment in technological innovation. Tax incentives such as patent boxes and R&D tax credits are used by countries to encourage domestic investment in technological innovation. At the end of 2015, 16 countries, mostly European, provided some form of patent box. Some countries also offered both a tax credit and super-deduction for qualified R&D expenditures. The design of a patent box involves three key elements: the tax incentive, qualifying IP, and applicable income. There are two main options for patent boxes: taxing qualified IP income at a lower rate or allowing a deduction from total income. Effective tax rates depend on the company's marginal tax rate and the percentage of IP income subject to taxation. IP that qualifies for a patent box must be registered and held in the host country. Various types of IP can be eligible, such as patents and software copyrights in certain countries. Effective tax rates on IP income depend on the company's marginal tax rate and the percentage of income subject to taxation. The patent boxes in various countries apply to different forms of intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, formulas, and industrial designs. IP developed outside the host country can qualify for patent boxes in most countries, except Turkey. Acquired IP is also eligible for patent boxes in most countries, except Israel, Portugal, and Turkey. Some countries' patent boxes apply to IP that existed before the enactment of the boxes. A patent box may apply to various forms of intellectual property and can include income from royalties, licensing fees, gains from IP disposal, sales of goods/services with IP, and patent infringement awards. The treatment of expenses incurred in earning qualified income affects the effective tax rate of a patent box. Patent boxes can target gross or net IP income, affecting the tax burden for companies with IP and non-IP income. 16 countries offered patent boxes in 2015, with half targeting gross income and the other half targeting net income. Countries like Belgium and Switzerland taxed gross IP income, while countries like France and the UK taxed net income. In 16 countries, patent boxes offer preferential tax rates for IP income. Some countries cover only royalty payments, while others include a broader range of IP income sources. Lawmakers considering a patent box should address key design issues such as what types of IP income to include, how to measure royalties, and whether to cover new or existing IP. At the end of 2015, 16 countries offered patent boxes with preferential tax rates for IP income. Key design issues include whether to cover IP developed outside the country, how to allocate expenses, and whether to cap benefits. Some OECD countries are leading locations for business R&D investment, which could serve as role models for the United States in designing a patent box. Table 1 compares key elements of patent boxes in nine OECD countries, with some offering preferential tax rates for IP income and others providing deductions or exemptions. Each country is a significant location for business R&D investment among OECD countries. Some OECD countries are leading locations for business R&D investment. Business R&D expenditures exceeded $7.8 billion in each country in 2012, totaling $167.0 billion for all nine countries. The diversity in tax incentives and scope among patent boxes is notable, with effective tax rates ranging from 5.0% to 17.1%. The average corporate rate for the nine nations was 25.8%. The patent box tax incentives in nine nations varied, with different deductions, exemptions, and preferential tax rates for qualifying income. Belgium and Italy capped the income eligible for the incentive, while six countries targeted net IP income, resulting in lower effective tax rates. The patent box tax incentives in nine nations varied, with different deductions, exemptions, and preferential tax rates for qualifying income. Six countries restricted the incentive to income from patents and related IP, while three required qualified IP to be developed and registered inside the country. Swiss-based companies could apply the patent box to income from acquired IP regardless of where it was developed, raising questions about the physical link between the country offering the incentive and R&D activities. In a rare display of unanimity, patent boxes in various countries covered new and existing IP, providing benefits for qualified IP registered before the boxes took effect. Some countries offered both R&D tax credits and patent boxes, while others allowed companies to claim R&D tax credits and super-deductions for research expenditures. Several countries modified their patent boxes in 2016 to align with recommendations for countering tax avoidance. Several countries modified their patent boxes in 2016 to align with recommendations for countering tax avoidance, including establishing a guideline known as the \"modified nexus approach\" for determining the maximum amount of IP income that could qualify for incentives. Spain, South Korea, and Turkey already had a modified nexus requirement in their patent boxes. France has not indicated whether it will enact a similar change. Companies with intellectual property across various industries can benefit from a patent box. The 2012 report by the Economic & Statistics Administration at the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office identified industries that heavily use patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and their impact on U.S. economic activity. It did not explore whether research-intensive industries, which benefit from research tax incentives, would also benefit from a patent box. The 2012 report identified IP-intensive industries and their impact on U.S. economic activity. It did not measure the contribution of IP to the economy or conclusively prove a correlation between IP-intensity and U.S. employment or exports. However, the findings suggest which industries would benefit most from a patent box if adopted by the U.S. government. IP-intensity was measured by the ratio of IP holdings to employment, with industries exceeding the average considered IP-intensive. Other indicators could have been used for comparison. The section focuses on patent-intensive industries, with utility, plant, and design patents granted by the USPTO. Utility patents protect the use and creation of inventions, design patents protect appearance, and plant patents protect new plant varieties. Utility patents, both foreign and domestic, make up 91.5% of all patents. In 2015, 91.5% of all patents granted by the USPTO were utility patents, with 52.0% being of foreign origin. Patents are categorized into over 450 technology classes based on inventive content, linked to industry codes. A mapping scheme links technology classes to manufacturing industries, measuring an industry's patent-intensity by the ratio of patents to average annual employment. However, this measure may not reflect the industry with the largest number of patents. The patent-intensity measure may not accurately reflect industries with the largest number of patents or those where patents are crucial for investment returns. It also does not consider non-manufacturing industries, which make up a significant portion of the workforce and GDP. A 2016 update identified 12 patent-intensive industries from 2009 to 2014, one less than the previous period. In 2008, Table 2 listed 12 industries for calculating patent intensity, with chemicals and electronic equipment being well-represented. The ranking of patent-intensive industries changed from 2004-2008 to 2009-2013, but the same industries appeared in both periods. There was no strong correlation between patent intensities and research intensities, possibly due to differences in reliance on R&D for patented innovations. Some industries may acquire patents rather than create innovations through their own R&D activities. Meliciani found that research expenditures were more effective in generating patents in science-based industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors compared to supplier-dominated and production-intensive industries. Some research-intensive industries may have a lower propensity to seek patents for their innovations. Peter Merrill identified the 10 U.S. industries most affected by the proposed Boustany-Neal innovation box in a 2016 report. The Boustany-Neal proposal calculates the effective tax rate on qualified IP income for corporations. It is based on a formula that considers R&D expenditures and total costs. Industries are ranked based on their R&D spending compared to total costs. There is some overlap between industries in different lists due to the proposal's broader application to IP. The Boustany-Neal proposal aims to broaden the scope of IP covered beyond just patents. Lawmakers are concerned about the effectiveness of a patent box in promoting domestic investment, creating high-paying jobs, and preventing income erosion. The design of a patent box plays a crucial role in achieving these objectives. The effectiveness of a patent box in achieving its goals depends largely on its design, specifically the nature of tax incentives and eligible IP. Implementing a patent box with incentives tied to investment in R&D related to qualified IP can lead to increased innovation and investment. Most patent boxes have been established since 2007, but their impact is still not well understood. Since 2007, patent boxes have been implemented, but their effects on indicators like employment, innovation investment, IP rights ownership, and tax revenues are not well understood. Research has focused on tax base, innovation investment, and IP registration in host countries. Irish taxpayers could exempt royalty income from patents developed through R&D in Ireland from national income tax starting in 1997. In 2010, the Irish Finance Minister announced the termination of the exemption for R&D activities from national income tax due to its ineffectiveness in promoting domestic innovation. A study in 2014 examined the impact of patent boxes on IP location and government revenues, highlighting the influence of corporate tax rates. Griffith et al. found that corporate tax rates significantly influenced patent ownership decisions, with companies preferring countries with low tax rates on patent income. However, the revenue loss from preferential tax rates in patent boxes outweighed the gain from increased patent registrations. Another study by Bradley, Dauchy, and Robinson analyzed the impact of patent boxes on innovative activities and patent registration globally from 1990 to 2012. The study by Bradley et al. analyzed worldwide new patent applications from 1990 to 2012. They found that a lower effective tax rate for patent income led to an increase in new patent applications in countries with a patent box. However, there was no significant effect on the cross-border transfer of patent ownership. The researchers concluded that patent boxes in 2012 did not impact multinational companies' incentives for booking income from intangible assets in low-tax countries. The study by Lisa Evers, Helen Miller, and Christoph Spengel examined the tax advantage provided by patent boxes in 12 European countries in 2014. They found that the average effective corporate tax rate was 17.25%, compared to -0.7% for income eligible for the patent boxes. The researchers noted that the rise in new patent applications mainly involved previously unpatented IP rather than newly developed IP. The patent box rates were calculated based on equity financing for patented technology development, resulting in a low effective tax rate of 17.25%. A 2015 study assessed the impact of patent boxes on patent applications among the largest R&D investors in 33 countries across three industries. The study examined the impact of patent boxes on local R&D activity in industries like pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles, and information and communication technology. Investors increased patent applications in host countries due to tax advantages, with high-quality patents being more sensitive to these benefits. However, patent boxes were found to deter local inventive activity. The study found that patent boxes deter local inventive activity as they offer no incentives for domestic companies to invest in new technologies. Imposing a local development requirement on income eligible for a patent box could counteract this effect. Patent registration is responsive to preferential tax rates, but there is no evidence that patent boxes increase tax revenues in host countries. The added revenue from new patenting activity may be offset by reduced tax rates for patent income, leading to potential tax competition among governments. The risk of tax competition due to patent boxes could lead to a race to the bottom in effective tax rates on patent income. Multinational corporations are willing to shift assets to countries with patent boxes, but this may not significantly lower overall tax rates. Policy issues, such as administration costs, will likely be considered in future debates on adopting a patent box in the United States. The United States should consider adopting a patent box, but key issues include defining qualified income to prevent abuse and ensuring easy administration and compliance with the rules. Some argue that to minimize compliance costs, a patent box should be limited to patents and related IP, or expanded to include a wider range of IP like the Boustany-Neal patent box. Enacting an intermediate approach with a narrow mix of IP could be the worst option. Distinguishing between qualified and unqualified IP income under a patent box for patents only is not likely to burden the IRS or large companies. Identifying income from patents, such as sales or licensing fees, is relatively easy for tax reporting. The accurate identification of income from patents under a patent box can be challenging, especially when it covers embedded royalties. Tax authorities may struggle to issue rules for companies to determine income flows attributed to specific patents. Separating qualified IP income from unqualified IP income may be even harder if the patent box targets IP with significant economic benefits. Companies may face difficulties proving the added value of their patents or qualified IP to the economy. The option for a patent box could lead to legal disputes over value-added identification and evidence required for preferential tax rates on qualified IP income. Administering a patent box is complex due to companies re-classifying income for tax incentives. Economists are divided on the economic justification of a patent box. The current federal tax subsidies for investment in R&D include an unlimited expensing allowance for qualified research expenditures under Section 174 and a nonrefundable tax credit for increases in qualified research expenditures above a base amount under Section 41. These incentives aim to correct a market failure associated with private R&D investment, where companies may not capture all the returns from their investment as competitors can exploit the new knowledge and knowhow generated. The federal tax subsidies for R&D investment aim to correct market failures by incentivizing companies to invest in research. Economists support government policies that boost private R&D investment, such as tax subsidies, as technological innovation is crucial for long-term growth. Patent boxes increase after-tax returns from successful innovations, while research tax incentives encourage private sector investment in R&D projects. A patent box rewards companies through the tax code for profiting from the commercial exploitation of IP, potentially encouraging more R&D investment. A patent box rewards companies through the tax code for profiting from the commercial exploitation of IP, providing a tax incentive to encourage valuable innovative activities. This can lower the cost of R&D investments and increase potential profits, making it a complement to R&D tax incentives in the global competition for investment in new commercial technologies. The use of tax incentives like patent boxes aims to discourage companies from moving assets to low-tax countries and promote local R&D activities. Critics argue that patent boxes subsidize company profits and may not effectively target investments in underdeveloped technologies. They suggest that lowering the corporate tax rate could be a simpler way to prevent asset transfers. The United States considering adopting a patent box to incentivize innovation and production, along with existing tax incentives for R&D investment and domestic production. The effective tax rate is a measure of the incentive effect of a tax subsidy. The incentive effect of a tax subsidy is measured by its effective tax rate, which shows how much it reduces the tax burden on eligible investments. Another way to measure this effect is by calculating how it changes the user cost of capital for an investment. Jane Gravelle estimated the incentive effect of a patent box in a 2016 report, where qualified income from qualified IP was taxed at a flat rate of 10%. A key consideration in tax treatment was how expenses for developing qualified IP were handled. Two options were available: deducting expenses from qualified IP income at $0.10 per dollar or deducting from gross income at $0.35 per dollar due to the 35% corporate tax rate. Gravelle compared tax rates for equity-financed R&D investments with and without tax credits, assuming deductions from qualified IP income. The results are summarized in Table 4, showing tax savings equal to 10% of the total deduction under current tax law. The results in Table 4 show that current tax law provides a subsidy for equity-financed R&D investments. The effective tax rate is 6.1% without the credit and -57.0% with the credit. Adding a patent box with a 10% tax rate for IP net income does not change current-law rates. However, writing off qualified research expenses over five years increases effective tax rates. The patent box does not boost the incentive to invest in R&D when expenses are expensed under Section 174, but it benefits pre-existing qualified IP. The cost of capital for the investment can be affected by different tax treatments. Adding a patent box with full expensing and a five-year amortization period for research expenses increased the cost of capital by 1.5%. Replacing the research tax credit with the patent box raised the cost by 10%. However, deducting patent box expenses at the top corporate tax rate significantly lowered the cost of capital by 25% under current law. The treatment of expenses related to qualified IP in a patent box can have a significant impact on its incentive effect. The Boustany-Neal patent box may not be effective in preventing erosion of the domestic tax base. The Boustany-Neal patent box may not effectively prevent erosion of the domestic tax base for IP income. A study found that the proposed tax rate for qualified IP income was higher than the average top corporate tax rate in OECD countries, indicating little incentive for companies to hold intangible assets in the United States."
