    "title": "AB 1094",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature finds that residential and commercial buildings in California accounted for 69% of electricity consumption in 2013, equivalent to the output of 70 500-megawatt power plants. This is projected to increase to 79 power plants by 2030. The electric power sector is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, comprising 21% of the state's total emissions. Plug-in equipment accounts for two-thirds of electricity consumption in residential buildings and a significant portion in office buildings. Current efficiency policies are inadequate to keep up with the growing number of electronic devices, hindering California's energy and climate goals. Cost-effective technologies exist to reduce electricity consumption in plug-in equipment, but are underutilized. California lacks quantified goals for reducing electricity consumption in plug-in equipment, which accounts for two-thirds of electricity usage in residential buildings and a significant portion in commercial buildings. Market barriers, such as consumer awareness and split incentives, highlight the need for efficiency programs and standards to unlock the economic potential for energy efficiency in plug-in equipment. The State of California aims to achieve zero net energy for new residential buildings by 2020 and for new and existing commercial buildings by 2030, supported by the Legislature as a key strategy for decarbonizing the economy. Challenges in evaluating program savings and focusing on short-term gains hinder the effective use of energy-saving programs that require upfront investments for future market transformation. The Legislature aims to reduce plug-in equipment energy consumption to support the state's climate and energy goals. A new section is added to the Public Resources Code to address the issue of plug-in equipment electricity consumption not being fully accounted for in zero net energy models. For the purposes of this section, \"plug-in equipment\" refers to electrical devices that plug into power outlets, excluding certain items like non-plug-in HVAC systems, lighting, infrastructure loads, and electric vehicles. The commission will analyze electricity consumption of plug-in equipment and set energy efficiency targets to reduce electricity usage before January 1, 2018. Power outlets include various mechanisms such as 110-volt AC, USB, PoE, and 24-volt DC. Develop an implementation plan with stakeholders to reduce electricity consumption by plug-in equipment. The plan should include techniques like revising appliance efficiency standards, implementing incentive programs, and public outreach efforts while considering costs and ratepayer protections. The implementation plan for reducing electricity consumption by plug-in equipment should consider costs, ratepayer protections, and use a cost-effectiveness methodology. Progress should be tracked annually, with revisions and updates made in consultation with stakeholders. The Public Utilities Commission will collaborate with stakeholders to overcome challenges in achieving energy consumption reduction targets for plug-in equipment. This includes addressing issues related to energy savings evaluation, market transformation programs, and working with equipment manufacturers, retailers, and electric utilities."
