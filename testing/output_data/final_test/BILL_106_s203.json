The Equitable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Act of 1999 amends Section 1905 of the Social Security Act to determine the federal medical assistance percentage for each state based on their taxable resources and program need. The Equitable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Act of 1999 amends Section 1905 of the Social Security Act to determine each state's federal medical assistance percentage based on their taxable resources and program need. The State's share of cost-adjusted total taxable resources is calculated using a 3-year average of total taxable resources divided by the State's geographic health care cost index. The geographic health care cost index for a State is determined by a formula involving the ratio of 3-year average annual wages for hospital employees in the State to the most recent 3-year average annual wages. The Secretary determines the geographic health care cost index for a State based on a formula involving 3-year average annual wages for hospital employees in the State and the District of Columbia, as well as in the 50 States. The fair market rent index for a State is determined based on the average annual fair market rent for 2-bedroom housing units in the State or the District of Columbia. The fair market rent index for a State is determined based on the average annual fair market rent for 2-bedroom housing units in the State or the District of Columbia. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines the fair market rent for housing units for the most recent 3 fiscal years. The state's share of program need is calculated as the ratio of the state's program need to the average fair market rent for all states for the same 3 fiscal years. The state's program need is determined based on the average income of residents below the state's cost-of-living adjusted poverty level for the most recent 5 fiscal years. The state's program determines the number of residents with incomes below the state's cost-of-living adjusted poverty level for each fiscal year. The determination of the number of residents under subclause (I) is based on data from the Current Population Survey by the Bureau of the Census. A State's cost-of-living adjusted poverty income level is calculated as the product of the United States poverty income threshold for the fiscal year. The State's cost-of-living index is determined based on the fiscal year and a specific formula involving a sum and product. The State's cost-of-living index is determined using a formula, and the Commissioner of Labor Statistics may use an alternate methodology if it results in a more accurate determination. Weighting of age categories of residents in poverty is considered to account for higher costs. The State's cost-of-living index is determined using a formula, with weighting of age categories of residents in poverty to adjust for higher costs. Residents aged 65 and older are multiplied by 3.65, while adult residents in poverty are also factored in. The equitable Federal medical assistance percentage is determined based on the number of residents in poverty in different age categories in the State or the District of Columbia for the fiscal year. Residents aged 21 to 65 are multiplied by 1.0, while residents under 21 are multiplied by 0.5. Special rules apply for the District of Columbia in calculating this percentage. The equitable Federal medical assistance percentage is determined based on the number of residents in poverty in different age categories in the State or the District of Columbia for the fiscal year. In the case of Alaska, the percentage is 59.8 percent. Amendments to the Social Security Act adjust the percentages for different states. The amendments made by this Act take effect on October 1, 1999, inserting \"50 percent.\""
