    "title": "AB 833",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish a well-funded early learning and educational support system for children up to five years old, aligning with the K-12 education system. This involves utilizing state and federal funds, engaging stakeholders, and providing affordable, high-quality services with integrated data systems. Additionally, a new Individualized County of Alameda Child Care Subsidy Plan is added to the Education Code. The County of Alameda may develop an individualized child care subsidy plan to address local needs of working families. The plan is part of a pilot project and aims to ensure subsidies are used effectively. An assessment will identify the county's goals for its subsidized child care system, examining funding structure, eligibility, and barriers. Factors considered include demographics, available child care, and types of services needed. The county's self-sufficiency income level, income eligibility levels for subsidized child care, family fees, cost of providing child care, regional market rates, standard reimbursement rate, trends in unemployment rate, and housing affordability index are factors considered in developing a local policy to prioritize lowest income families first and meet local goals for subsidized child care. The county's local policy for subsidized child care must align with state goals, identify affected policies, and allow agencies to amend contracts for benefits. Local policies can override state laws for child care subsidy programs on specific factors. Eligibility criteria, fees, and reimbursement rates are key components of the local policy for subsidized child care, including considerations for age, family size, income level, and special needs. Fees may include family fees, sliding scale fees, and copayments for families not income eligible. The local policy for subsidized child care includes reimbursement rates, efficient fund utilization methods, recognition of all funding sources, measurable outcomes for achieving child care goals, and overcoming barriers in the subsidy system. The county cannot alter regional market rate survey results. The plan for subsidized child care in Alameda County must be approved by the local planning council before being reviewed by the Early Education and Support Division within 30 days. Any modifications to the plan must also be reviewed within the same timeframe, with disapproval only for non-conformance with regulations or federal law. The county must demonstrate an increase in child care enrollment compared to the previous fiscal year. An annual report summarizing the success of the county's plan and its ability to maximize funds and improve child care must be submitted. Participating contractors may receive funding adjustments based on their involvement in the plan. The article will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for Alameda County due to high living costs, resulting in limited access to quality child care. This act aims to provide children and families in Alameda County with proper access to child care through a county subsidy plan."
