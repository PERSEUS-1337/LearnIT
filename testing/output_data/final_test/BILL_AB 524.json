    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature of California recognizes the importance of service learning in improving educational performance and character development of pupils. Research studies show that quality service learning programs lead to increased academic achievement in students. Pupils benefit from service learning by reducing dropout rates, discipline problems, and risky behaviors. They also show higher attendance, civic responsibility, cultural acceptance, and personal/social responsibility. This act aims to promote volunteer service among pupils for positive outcomes. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in 1998 found that senior pupils engaged in volunteer work have higher civics assessment scores. Community leaders believe service learning partnerships improve community attitudes towards youth. Schools supporting service learning have positive relationships with their community. The Education Code will now include curriculum standards for social studies courses with a service learning component. The Superintendent consults with various stakeholders to develop curriculum standards for social studies courses with a service learning component. The proposed standards must be submitted to the state board for review by July 1, 2016, and the board must adopt or reject them by January. The state board must adopt or reject proposed curriculum standards for social studies courses by January 1, 2017. If adopted, these standards will be implemented in the 2017-18 school year to fulfill graduation requirements. If rejected, the board must provide reasons for rejection to the Superintendent, Legislature, and Governor. The state board must adopt or reject proposed curriculum standards for social studies courses by January 1, 2017. If adopted, these standards will be implemented in the 2017-18 school year to fulfill graduation requirements. The curriculum includes specific course requirements in English, mathematics, science, and social studies. Starting with the high school class of 2020-21, students must complete a service learning component as part of their graduation requirements. Additionally, they must take a visual or performing arts course, a foreign language course (including American Sign Language), and two physical education courses unless exempted. Other coursework requirements may be set by the school district's governing board. Starting in the 2020-21 school year, high school students must complete a service learning component as part of their graduation requirements. Service learning involves active participation in community service that fosters civic responsibility. Starting in the 2020-21 school year, high school students must complete a service learning component as part of their graduation requirements. The method should be integrated into the academic curriculum and provide time for reflection. The governing board, with input from parents, administrators, teachers, and students, will adopt alternative ways for students to fulfill the course of study, including practical demonstrations, work experience, career technical education, and more. Graduation requirements and alternative completion methods will be accessible to students, parents, and the public. The section outlines that completion of a career technical education course meeting specific requirements before a certain date will fulfill graduation requirements. It also states that the section will become operative when another related section becomes inoperative. If the act results in state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made according to government code."
