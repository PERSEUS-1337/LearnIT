    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drinking Water Standards Preservation Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to drinking water standards. The Congress finds that the safety of drinking water is a national concern, with established national standards for over 100 contaminants. States can enforce these standards and set stricter ones when necessary. It is not feasible for water to be completely free of contaminants, as this would impact water supply adequacy. Setting drinking water standards is a complex public policy decision. The setting of drinking water standards is a complex public policy decision that involves analyzing factors like safe contaminant levels and affordability. This decision should be made by federal and state agencies, not individual juries. Claims for damages against public water providers should be addressed through the legal system. The common law of States threatens the national water quality regulation system. States should have flexibility in handling claims against water providers for contamination. Defending against legal claims can be financially burdensome, especially for small water systems complying with the Safe Drinking Water Act. AMENDMENTS TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. Amendments to Section 1449 of the Safe Drinking Water Act include clarifications on liability, cause of action, and defense under Federal or State law. Subsection (f) does not create a new cause of action and does not expand liability or limit defenses. Amendments to Section 1449 of the Safe Drinking Water Act clarify liability for public water systems in civil suits related to contaminated water delivery. The plaintiff must prove that the substance causing injury was regulated at the time of delivery and meets scientific criteria. The plaintiff must prove that the delivered water substance causing injury was likely to cause the claimed injury, the public water system violated regulations, the violation was negligent, and it directly caused the injury. For unregulated contaminants, the plaintiff must meet specific criteria. The plaintiff must prove that the delivered water substance caused the injury, was likely to cause the claimed injury, and that the public water system was negligent in violating regulations. The injury must be directly caused by the water containing such a substance. The court will determine if the public water system was negligent in allowing a substance in the drinking water that caused injury, and if it was feasible for the supplier to remove the contaminant to prevent such harm. The court will adopt findings of State agencies regarding drinking water quality requirements and compliance by public water systems."
