    "content": "This report outlines the purpose and legislative background of survivor benefits for deceased members/retirees of the uniformed services. It describes the categories of eligible beneficiaries, formulas for computing income levels, integration with other federal benefits, and costs incurred by retirees and beneficiaries. The Survivor Benefit Plan allows a portion of a military retiree's monthly pay to be withheld to provide a monthly survivor benefit to a spouse or eligible recipient after the retiree's death. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was created in 1972 to ensure surviving dependents of military personnel have a reasonable income after retirement or death. It replaced the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP) due to unpopular features. The cost is shared by the retiree, government, and possibly the beneficiary. The Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSFPP) was designed to be actuarially neutral, with costs fully covered by participants. Military retirees had to decide on RSFPP coverage before their 18th year of service, but costs and benefits could change over time. Participation never exceeded 15% of eligible retirees in its 19-year history. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was expected to be a significant improvement over the RSFPP. The SBP is an improvement over the RSFPP, offering better participation rates, lower costs to retirees, and increased benefits for survivors. There are six types of coverage available under the SBP for military retirees, with costs shared with the government in most cases. The type and amount of coverage chosen determine the cost to the retiree, who is automatically enrolled in the SBP at retirement unless they opt out. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows military retirees to provide benefits to their surviving spouse and dependent children. Retirees can choose to participate at a reduced level of coverage, with the maximum benefit being 55% of their base amount of retired pay. If a retiree elects not to participate or chooses reduced coverage, their spouse must be notified. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows military retirees to provide benefits to their surviving spouse and dependent children. Retirees can choose to participate at a reduced level of coverage, with the maximum benefit being 55% of their base amount of retired pay. The retiree's spouse must be notified and must concur with the election for it to be effective. A retiree who is unmarried at the time of retirement can elect to provide SBP benefits for a new spouse within one year of marriage, with a one-year waiting period. The spouse of a post-military-retirement marriage must be notified if the retiree does not elect to provide an SBP benefit or elects to provide it at a reduced level. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent children of military retirees. The intended SBP beneficiary must meet specific criteria, and the benefit is calculated based on the retiree's base amount of retired pay. The computational formulas for determining the amount withheld depend on the member's entry into service and retirement type. Military personnel who entered service on or after March 1, 1990, are eligible for Spouse Only coverage. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent children of military retirees. For military personnel who entered service on or after March 1, 1990, and are not entitled to retired pay under certain chapters, their SBP withholdings are computed using the \"Flat-Rate Formula.\" Those who first became a member before March 1, 1990, or have their retired pay computed under specific chapters will have their SBP withholdings calculated based on whichever method is more financially advantageous. The reduction in retired pay does not apply when there is no eligible spouse beneficiary. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent children of military retirees. The retiree's contribution to the total cost of providing the SBP benefit is calculated as a percentage of their base retired pay. For example, a retiree with 20 years of service may have $83 deducted from their monthly retired pay to ensure their surviving spouse receives a monthly survivor benefit. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent children of military retirees. The retiree's contribution to the total cost of providing the SBP benefit is calculated as a percentage of their base retired pay. If the retiree receives more than $1,388 per month in total military retired pay but elects to provide less coverage, the costs and benefits remain the same. Any increase in retired pay due to cost-of-living adjustments will also increase the potential SBP benefit to the designated survivor. Costs and benefits are based on retired pay rates at the time of retirement, with subsequent changes reflecting cost-of-living adjustments. Line six represents the cost of survivor protection under Spouse Only coverage, with the beneficiary receiving 55% of the base amount. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to surviving spouses and dependent children of military retirees. The payment to the beneficiary is 55% of base amount military retired pay, or $763, indexed for inflation. P.L. 101-189 revised the computational formula for SBP withholdings to be 6.5% of the base amount of retired pay. Regardless of the formula used, a surviving spouse may become ineligible to receive SBP benefits. A surviving spouse (or eligible former spouse) may lose eligibility for SBP benefits if they remarry before reaching certain ages. Remarriage before age 60 prior to November 14, 1986, or before age 55 on or after that date, can result in ineligibility. However, if the second marriage ends, the original SBP benefit can be reinstated with restrictions. The SBP benefits can be reinstated with restrictions for surviving spouses of multiple deceased military retirees. A special rule allows surviving spouses who remarry after age 57 to receive both full SBP and DIC benefits. The \"paid-up\" provision stops reductions in retired pay when the retiree reaches age 70 and has participated in SBP for 360 months. These provisions took effect on October 1, 2008. Upon the retiree's death, SBP benefits are first paid to the surviving spouse. If the spouse predeceases the retiree or becomes ineligible, benefits go to the designated child or children in equal shares. The cost is determined by the ages of the retiree, spouse, and youngest child. Under Child(ren) Only coverage, SBP benefits are paid directly to the surviving child(ren) of a deceased military retiree regardless of whether or not there is a surviving spouse. Eligibility under this coverage is subject to the same restrictions as a child is, or children are, under Spouse and Child(ren) coverage. The cost of coverage under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is calculated on an actuarial basis and can be adjusted. For example, a military retiree with a child age 10 and maximum coverage would have 2.5% of their retired pay withheld to provide a survivor benefit for the child upon their death. Child Only coverage is cheaper as it only lasts until the child reaches age 18 or 22 in most cases. Insurable Interest coverage is an option if there is no spouse. Insurable Interest coverage is a more expensive option under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) as it must be elected at the maximum level. It is available if there is no spouse or dependent child at the time of retirement. The beneficiary must have an insurable interest in the retiree, which can include relatives like parents, siblings, or children who do not qualify under other SBP provisions, as well as non-relatives like business partners. The cost of Insurable Interest coverage is 10% of the base amount of military retired pay plus 5% for each full 5 years the beneficiary is younger than the retiree, not exceeding 40% of total retired pay. Insurable Interest coverage under the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) is a more expensive option that must be elected at the maximum level. The cost is 10% of the base amount of military retired pay plus 5% for each full 5 years the beneficiary is younger than the retiree, not exceeding 40% of total retired pay. The total cost to the retiree cannot exceed 40% of total military retired pay. Insurable Interest coverage can be voluntarily discontinued except in cases where a former spouse is being covered. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows retirees to provide survivor protection for beneficiaries, including former spouses. The cost of coverage under the Insurable Interest category is 10% of retired pay plus 5% for each 5 years the beneficiary is younger. Retirees can discontinue this coverage voluntarily, except when covering a former spouse. If a retiree remarries or acquires dependents, they can rejoin SBP under a different beneficiary category. Federal law before November 14, 1986, prohibited courts from ordering SBP coverage for former spouses in divorce cases. A retiree can provide Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) protection for a former spouse by voluntarily electing to do so in writing. If divorced before November 14, 1986, the retiree can switch to Former Spouse coverage within one year of the divorce becoming final. After November 14, 1986, a court may order SBP protection for a former spouse as part of a divorce. The FY1986 DOD Authorization Act allowed military retirees and former spouses to switch to spouse coverage within one year. Those electing Former Spouse coverage after March 1, 1986, have the cost and benefit amount computed similarly to Spouse Only coverage. Retirees can only provide one type of SBP coverage for one beneficiary category, potentially denying SBP protection to a second or future beneficiary. The FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act addressed the issue of dividing SBP benefits between former and current/subsequent spouses in cases where a retiree agreed to provide SBP coverage to a former spouse but died shortly after. The FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act addressed dividing SBP benefits between former and current/subsequent spouses when a retiree dies shortly after agreeing to provide SBP coverage to a former spouse. Former spouses of retirees are deemed covered effective November 5, 1999, with coverage for former spouses and children available since March 1, 1986. Reserve Component members may elect SBP protection for their survivors, with a unique structure for Reserve Component SBP (RCSBP) due to eligibility for retired pay at age 60. The Reserve Component SBP (RCSBP) structure differs from active duty members, allowing reservists to provide survivor protection before age 60. Legislation in 1978 permits Reserve Component members to choose RCSBP participation upon retirement eligibility, even before reaching age 60 or earlier based on active duty credit. \"Gray area retirees\" can elect SBP protection before receiving retired pay. \"Retirement eligible Reserve Component members can choose from three RCSBP options within 90 days of retirement notification: Option A allows declining RCSBP protection, Option B provides survivor payments upon death or eligibility for retired pay, and Option C offers immediate RCSBP benefits.\" Under option A, retirees can choose to provide an RCSBP benefit that starts immediately after their death, regardless of age. Options B and C involve cost-sharing between the retiree, the Government, and the beneficiary, with costs varying based on coverage type and the ages of the retiree and beneficiary. RCSBP benefits can be paid to surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of Reserve Component members who pass away. The RCSBP provides benefits to surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of Reserve Component members who pass away. The income payable is equal to 55% of retired pay the member would have received if retired and at least age 60 at the time of death. Congress created a special annuity for certain surviving spouses in 1997. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to eligible surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of deceased members. The SBP benefit may be paid to various eligible recipients following the death of an active duty member, subject to certain eligibility criteria and restrictions. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to eligible surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of deceased members. The SBP benefit is equal to 55% of the amount of retired pay that the deceased service member would have been eligible for had he or she elected maximum coverage and retired on the day of his or her death. Recent legislation has expanded coverage to survivors of individuals who die while on active duty and are not retirement-eligible. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to eligible surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of deceased members. The annuity for an active duty member is based on the amount of disability retired pay the servicemember would have received. The spouse's share is 55% of that amount, calculated based on the member's highest rate of basic pay. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to eligible surviving spouses, dependent children, or former spouses of deceased members. The amount of monthly disability pay is calculated based on the member's basic pay and years of service. Congress allowed for these benefits to be paid to surviving children of active members who die. The effective date for this provision was changed to October 7, 2001. SBP benefits for children prevent offsets from Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. The FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act made significant changes to the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for those aged 62 and over, eliminating the two-tier benefit structure and Social Security offset. This change increased survivors' benefits but was criticized for potentially allowing \"double dipping\" by receiving overlapping payments from Social Security and SBP. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) was established in 1956. The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) was established in 1956 by the Servicemen's and Veteran's Survivor Benefit Act. DIC is paid to survivors of servicemen or veterans who died from a disease or injury incurred in line of duty while on active duty or active duty training. Surviving spouses or former spouses of retirees are entitled to DIC payments from the VA if the retiree dies from complications resulting from a service-related disease or injury. The surviving spouse or former spouse of a retiree is entitled to DIC payments from the VA if the retiree dies from a service-related disease or injury. However, the SBP benefit is offset by the amount of DIC received, with certain limitations. If the surviving spouse or former spouse remarries, they lose DIC payments but can have their full SBP benefit restored under specific conditions. If the SBP is offset by DIC, a portion of the deceased retiree's contributions to the SBP will be refunded to the surviving spouse or former spouse. SBP payments can be restored if the beneficiary becomes ineligible for DIC but remains eligible for SBP, with refunded payments needing to be returned. Surviving spouses who remarry after age 57 can receive both full SBP and DIC, known as the \"Special Rule Concerning DIC Offset.\" In recent years, Congress has addressed the issue of military retired pay for retirees who qualify for disability compensation from the VA. The law previously prevented the concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability compensation, but changes have allowed for concurrent receipt for certain disabled military retirees. In FY2004, Congress authorized concurrent receipt for all retirees with at least a 50% disability, regardless of the cause. 100% disabled retirees were entitled to immediate concurrent receipt effective January 1, 2005. Critics argue that allowing concurrent receipt to retirees or their survivors is a form of \"double dipping\" according to Congress. The Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 contained a provision that would eliminate the SBP-DIC offset entirely, but this language was dropped by the conference committee prior to final passage. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 initially aimed to eliminate the SBP-DIC offset, but the provision was removed before final passage. Similar attempts were made in subsequent years, with estimated costs of $7.0 billion to eliminate the offset. Critics argue that removing the offset would result in \"triple dipping\" for survivors, receiving multiple government benefits based on the same military career. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was created in 2009 to provide additional monthly benefits to survivors subject to the SBP-DIC offset. The amount increased annually until reaching $310 in 2017, after which the benefit ended. Critics labeled SSIA as \"triple dipping,\" but it was seen as a generous increase at no cost to retirees. Certain retirees and organizations claim that the government has increased retirees' share of the cost of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) to more than 73%, compared to the expected 40%. They argue for increased government payments into the SBP to improve benefits, such as eliminating the reduction in benefits when the surviving spouse reaches age 62. The government has not reduced its contribution to the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) despite claims that retirees are paying more. Congress has actually expanded eligibility, increased benefits, and made other improvements to the SBP over time. The argument that retirees are living longer and paying more ignores the fact that survivors are also living longer and collecting more. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) costs have increased over the years, with payments to families growing significantly from 1973 to 2005. Despite claims that retirees are paying more, the government has not reduced its contribution to the SBP. The FY2005 costs to retirees were reported to be $1,099,363,000, while payments to families surged to $2,253,728,000. The cumulative cost to retirees from 1973 to 2005 was $22,597,064,000, while payments to families totaled $30,923,249,000. The government paid $8,326,185,000 more in benefits to families than it received. The cost to retiree/family payment gap is expected to increase as certain provisions are phased out. In FY2009, 874,613 individuals were making payments into the Survivor Benefit Plan, with a cumulative cost to retirees of $27,340,043,000 and payments of $43,084,459,000. The Government Accountability Office issued a report on the actuarial soundness of the plan in 2006. The Government Accountability Office report in 2006 highlighted significant changes in the Survivor Benefit Plan, resulting in increased DOD payments to maintain the Fund's actuarial soundness. Changes to SBP coverage have led to the elimination of reductions in surviving spouses' benefits. The reduction in surviving spouses' SBP benefits due to eligibility for Social Security benefits increased SBP liability by $25.2 billion. Treasury and DOD will be responsible for $23.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. DOD's liability includes costs for active duty and reservists. Congress has allowed open seasons for SBP enrollment, with the latest in fiscal year 2006. The estimated increase in SBP liability from the open season is between $31 million to $86 million. Retirees aged 70 or older are no longer required to pay SBP premiums. SBP liability increased by $2.5 billion due to premiums paid by retirees aged 70 or older for 30 years. Treasury will cover $2.4 billion, and DOD $0.1 billion. Extending SBP benefits for personnel killed in the line of duty not eligible for retirement increased liability by $72 million. Treasury will cover $28 million, and DOD $44 million. Potential changes in SBP benefits from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 may increase DOD and Treasury costs. The DOD OOA calculated that allowing retirees to choose a second insurable interest as the SBP beneficiary would increase liability by $2.2 million. Treasury would be responsible for $2 million, and DOD for $231,000. Of DOD's portion, $211,000 is for normal costs related to full-time employees and $20,000 for part-time employees. Under current law, survivors of retired veterans receiving DIC benefits are entitled to SBP benefits, which are offset by the DIC payments. Eliminating this offset requirement would increase SBP liability by an estimated $12.9 billion, with Treasury and DOD responsible for $12.3 billion and $645 million, respectively. DOD's portion includes $617 million for full-time employees and $28 million for part-time employees. Enactment of these changes would require adjustments to DOD and Treasury payments to offset increased costs, without negatively affecting the Fund's actuarial soundness. Enactment of changes will not harm Fund's actuarial soundness. DOD had no objections to the report and provided technical suggestions."
