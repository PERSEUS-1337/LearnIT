Section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a provision for repayment if a recipient of a Federal Pell Grant fails to complete the program within the maximum timeframe. The grant amount will be treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan and will be subject to repayment with interest. The provision allows for repayment of a Federal Pell Grant if the recipient fails to complete the program within the maximum timeframe, with the grant amount treated as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan subject to repayment with interest.

To qualify, the student must have a Federal Pell Grant. An individual may lose eligibility for a Federal Pell Grant if they default on repayment obligations or drop out of a program for the second time.
