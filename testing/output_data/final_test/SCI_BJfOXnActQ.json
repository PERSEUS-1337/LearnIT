In few-shot learning scenarios, explicit use of label structure can help reshape the representation space to reflect class dependencies. A meta-learning framework called Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) transforms feature representations based on a metric space to capture inter-class dependencies, leading to more disentangled representations and competitive results on miniImageNet. In few-shot learning, utilizing label structure can be crucial for capturing class dependencies. This approach leads to more disentangled representations and competitive results on miniImageNet. While traditional classification assumes a categorical distribution over labels, exploiting label structure explicitly can improve learning systems. Meta-learning, specifically Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), is a gradient-based algorithm that enables rapid adaptation by optimizing initial parameters for fast generalization in few-shot learning tasks. The key concept involves a meta-learner that learns across multiple tasks and a base-learner that optimizes for each task. The Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) model utilizes a metric space to encode label structure regularities, improving gradient-based meta-learning techniques for fast generalization in few-shot learning tasks. This approach allows for learning more disentangled representations by imposing global class dependencies on the model. The Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) model uses a metric space to model class dependencies and reshape representations in few-shot learning tasks. It aims to incorporate a global sense of class structure by conditioning activations on auxiliary meta-information. The contributions include a meta-learning framework utilizing structured class information, class-aware grouping for improved statistical strength, and the use of Euclidean geometry to shape the representation landscape. The CAML model utilizes class-aware grouping to enhance few-shot learning tasks, aiming to learn disentangled representations. It follows a meta-learning formulation where a meta-learner learns across tasks and a base-learner operates within each task. The goal is to improve statistical strength and achieve competitive results on the miniImageNet benchmark. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a meta-learning algorithm that aims to learn representations for fast adaptation across different tasks. The meta-learner is trained on a meta-training set, validated on a meta-validation set, and evaluated on a meta-test set. The meta-learner and base-learner share the same network structure, with the meta-learner's parameters used to initialize the base-learner on a new task. Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) involves a meta-learner optimizing a representation \u03b8 for task-specific adaptations \u03b8 i with few gradient steps. It supports fast learning on new tasks by performing slow learning across many tasks at the meta-level. At meta-test time, the base-learner is initialized with the meta-learned representation \u03b8 * for gradient-based fine-tuning. CAML consists of four components: an embedding function f \u03c6, a base-learner f \u03b8, an adaptation function f c, and a metric space mapping inputs. The main contribution of this paper is to incorporate metric-based conditional transformations (f c) into the meta-learning framework at the instance level. This involves using an embedding function f \u03c6 to map inputs onto an embedding space, which then modulates the base-learner f \u03b8 through a conditional transformation f c. The approach aims to enable fast learning on new tasks by leveraging meta-learning across different tasks. The proposed method incorporates metric-based conditional transformations into a meta-learning framework at the instance level. It utilizes an embedding function f \u03c6 to map examples onto a semantically meaningful metric space, providing structured information to the base-learner f \u03b8. This global view of the label space improves gradient-based meta-learning, with predictions made using a conditional transformation f c in contrast to a regular base-learner. The model is trained using MAML to meta-learn f c and f \u03b8, with the metric space pre-trained using a distance-based loss function. The text discusses encoding label structure information in a metric space using a loss function. A convolutional network is used to calculate centroids for each class, serving as prototype representations. The goal is to optimize the mapping function to minimize negative log-probability by minimizing the Euclidean distance between examples and their class centroids. In relation to prototypical networks, the loss function for metric learning is used to optimize the mapping function for label assignment. The metric space imposes distance-based constraints to learn embeddings following semantically meaningful distance measures. The metric space is pre-trained on meta-train data and not updated during meta-learning. The conditional transformation block uses the metric space to inform the base-learner about label structure. It employs Conditional Batch Normalization to predict scale and shift operators for feature modulation. The model utilizes Conditional Batch Normalization to predict scale and shift factors for feature modulation based on the inherent relationship between examples belonging to the same class in the metric space. The conditional bias transformation with \u03b2 i,c is similar to concatenation-based conditioning, providing multiplicative interactions between metric space and feature maps. The goal is to capture global and local views of a classification task simultaneously. The metric space is pre-trained independently of the current task, while the base-learner develops representations for the current classification task. The text discusses parameter sharing for CBN learning and class-aware grouping to enhance few-shot learning by leveraging shared representations and exploiting properties of the metric space. This approach aims to provide more statistical strength for effective learning from limited examples. In N-way 1-shot learning, gradient-based optimization may lead to irrelevant features coinciding with class labels. Class-aware grouping guided by metric space is used to address this issue, related to transduction in MAML-based methods. This involves using group-based mean and variance for normalization based on distance measures in the metric space. The base-learner in CBN is guided by class-aware grouping in a metric space, using group-based mean and variance for normalization. It consists of 4 layers of convolutions with skip connections to improve gradient flow for meta-learning. The proposed model in CBN utilizes skip connections in a computational graph with 30 channels per convolutional layer. The metric space is learned using a ResNet-12 pre-trained on a meta-training dataset, while the meta-learner is trained separately. CBN functions are implemented with 3 dense layers, and MAML is used for meta-learning with varying gradient steps depending on the shot learning scenario. The proposed model in CBN utilizes skip connections in a computational graph with 30 channels per convolutional layer. MAML is used for meta-learning with varying gradient steps for shot learning scenarios. Meta-learning, also known as \"learning-to-learn,\" has become important for few-shot learning, with approaches aiming to learn universal learning procedures or generate model parameters conditioned on training examples. Our work focuses on gradient-based meta-learning methods like MAML and REPTILE, which aim to enable fast adaptation to new tasks. We introduce a novel approach that utilizes structured label information, unlike existing methods. Additionally, our work is related to metric-based meta-learning using Siamese networks to learn a similarity measure between inputs. Our approach utilizes structured label information for gradient-based meta-learning, focusing on class structure representation in the metric space to improve generalization during meta-learning. This differs from metric-based methods like TADAM, which scale the metric space based on tasks. Our method focuses on instance-based conditioning in the metric space, utilizing precise representations of each example. In contrast, TADAM scales the metric space at the task level. Both approaches use additional input sources to conditionally transform network representations. Our proposed approach utilizes the metric space for concept-level representation to modulate intermediate features of the base-learner. The Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning algorithm is evaluated on miniImageNet BID30, consisting of 84\u00d784 colored images from 100 classes. Results show comparable performance on the state-of-the-art miniImageNet 5-way 1-shot classification task and competitive results on the 5-way 5-shot task. Unlike LEO (Rusu et al., 2018), our algorithm does not rely on pre-trained representations. Our proposed approach, CAML, utilizes a metric space for concept-level representation to modulate intermediate features of the base-learner. It does not require co-training like TADAM BID21 and shows improved performance compared to MAML on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. The learned metric space in Figure 5 demonstrates clustering of examples from meta-validation classes based on class membership. Incorporating class dependencies in the metric space can enhance gradient-based meta-learning. Our proposed CAML framework utilizes a metric space for concept-level representation to modulate intermediate features of the base-learner. It shows improved performance compared to MAML on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. The performance improvement is attributed to CAML rather than changes in the base-learner's architecture. The CAML framework outperforms MAML on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks by utilizing a metric space for concept-level representation. Results show that CAML's ability to fast-adapt representations leads to better performance, especially in 1-shot tasks. The CAML framework outperforms MAML on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks by utilizing a metric space for concept-level representation. Comparing activations before and after conditional transformation helps understand how it modulates feature representations. PCA projections in the last convolutional layer show that conditional transformation separates classes like \"tile roof\" from others, confirming its effectiveness in few-shot learning. Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of multitask learning and class-aware grouping on 1-shot learning sensitivity. Results in TAB0 show that 1-shot learning is sensitive to multitask learning and class-aware grouping, while 5-shot learning is not affected. The lack of statistical strength in 1-shot learning requires more explicit guidance in training. The proposed Conditional class-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) incorporates class information to reshape representations for improved meta-learning. Experiments demonstrate that the conditional transformation can modulate convolutional feature maps towards a more disentangled representation. The proposed approach in the current study introduces class-aware grouping to improve few-shot learning results, achieving competitive performance on miniImageNet benchmark. Results suggest that 1-shot learning benefits from multitask learning and class-aware grouping, while 5-shot learning is less sensitive to these techniques due to a lack of training examples. Class-aware grouping alone can enhance performance by 3% in 1-shot learning, indicating the value of exploiting metric-based channel mean and variance for gradient-based meta-learning. The study found that more than half of the predicted \u03b2c values are negative, consistent with previous findings. Training Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN) with both \u03b3c and \u03b2c yielded the best results, with \u03b3c playing a more significant role due to its multiplicative interactions with convolutional feature representations."
