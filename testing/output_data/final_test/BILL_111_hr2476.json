    "content": "The \"Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act of 2010\" enables snow-sports on National Forest System land under ski area permits issued by the Secretary of Agriculture. It also clarifies the authority to permit additional recreational activities and facilities on the land. The National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 is amended to broaden the scope of recreational activities allowed on ski areas and associated facilities. The Secretary may authorize skiing, snow-sports, and other recreational activities associated with mountain resorts. The Secretary may authorize ski area permit holders to offer additional recreational activities on National Forest System land, besides skiing and snow-sports, to promote outdoor recreation and harmonize with the natural environment. The Secretary may authorize additional recreational activities on National Forest System land for ski area permit holders, as long as they are located within developed ski permit areas, consistent with forest management plans and laws, and subject to appropriate terms and conditions. No activity can be authorized if it would compromise the primary recreational purpose of the land. The Secretary may authorize additional recreational activities on National Forest System land for ski area permit holders, as long as they are located within developed ski permit areas and generate revenue primarily from skiing and other snow-sport activities. The Secretary may authorize additional recreational activities on National Forest System land for ski area permit holders, focusing on skiing and snow-sport activities. Boundary changes for ski area permits should not consider activities other than skiing and snow-sports. Existing authorized activities and facilities under ski area permits are not affected by this subsection. The Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act of 2010 amends the time frame for implementing changes within ski area permits on National Forest System land. The Act does not affect the Secretary of Agriculture's authority under Federal law, except for the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, and does not impact the Secretary's duties under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
