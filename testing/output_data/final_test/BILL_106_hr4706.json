    "content": "For subsection (a)(1), a joint resolution of Congress calls upon the President to negotiate amendments to specific provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreement based on a report from the WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission. The joint resolution submitted to Congress by the Commission states that due to the failure to address issues identified in reports and negotiations, it is no longer in the national interest for the United States to be a member of the WTO. Congress withdraws its approval. The Congress withdraws its approval of the WTO Agreement as defined in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Procedural provisions require the joint resolution to be enacted within a 90-day period after receiving an affirmative report from the Commission. The joint resolution must be enacted within a 90-day period after receiving 3 affirmative reports from the Commission. If the President vetoes the resolution, Congress must override the veto within the 90-day period. The joint resolution must be enacted within a 90-day period after receiving 3 affirmative reports from the Commission. A joint resolution can be introduced after the Commission transmits an affirmative report to Congress, before the end of the 90-day period mentioned in paragraph (1)(A). The expedited procedures for introducing a joint resolution described in subsection (b) allow any member of Congress to introduce it in either House. These procedures follow the provisions of subsections (b), (d), (e), and (f) of section 152 of the Trade Act of 1974. The expedited procedures for introducing a joint resolution allow any member of Congress to introduce it in either House. If a committee has not reported the joint resolution within 45 days of its introduction, the committee will be automatically discharged from further consideration. The Senate must have the resolution reported by the Committee on Finance or be discharged, while the House of Representatives must follow similar procedures. The House of Representatives must consider a joint resolution reported by the Committee on Ways and Means or discharged under specific rules. A motion to proceed with a joint resolution in the House can only be made on the second legislative day after announcement. It is not allowed to consider a second resolution in either the House of Representatives or the Senate if the House has not received it from the other House. The Congress enacts rules for the House of Representatives and Senate regarding joint resolutions. These rules supersede other rules if inconsistent and can be changed by either House. SEC. 7.
