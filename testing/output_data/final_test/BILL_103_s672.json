    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tobacco Health and Safety Act\" and any reference to amendments or repeals in this Act shall be considered in relation to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Congress finds that cigarette smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco products are major health hazards to the American public, with tobacco products containing hazardous additives and nicotine. The tobacco industry claims smoking is for adults only, yet 60 percent of new smokers are under 14, costing the US over $60 billion in lost productivity and healthcare costs. In 1990, the tobacco industry spent over $4 billion on promoting its products. The US Congress plays a crucial role in discouraging tobacco use, and creating a separate chapter for tobacco under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ensures effective regulation without banning the product. The definitions of 'tobacco product', 'tobacco additive', 'constituent', and 'tar' are clarified in the amendment to Section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Enforcement measures are outlined in Section 4. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Amends Section 301 to include violations related to the sale, distribution, manufacture, importation, or packaging of tobacco products. SEC. 5. REGULATION. Adds a new chapter VII on tobacco products and outlines prohibited acts. Sec. 701 prohibits the sale of tobacco products containing nicotine or additives to individuals under 18 years old. It also prohibits distribution of misbranded or adulterated products, as well as free samples or products obtained through coupons. States must enact laws and regulations to ensure compliance with the prohibition of selling tobacco products to minors. If state laws are insufficient, the Secretary may impose federal regulations on the sale of tobacco products to enforce this requirement. Tobacco products sold or distributed in violation of specific subsections are considered misbranded. \"misbranded tobacco products\" A tobacco product is considered misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading, fails to include required statements, or does not contain the statement 'Federal Law Prohibits Sale to Minors'. Additionally, if in package form, it must include the manufacturer's information and an accurate statement of the quantity of contents. The Secretary may require tobacco product manufacturers to provide consumers with information on tobacco additives and constituents, and failure to do so may result in the product being considered misbranded. The Secretary may require tobacco product manufacturers to provide consumers with additional information about the adverse effects of tobacco products, warnings, directions for use, and necessary information. Manufacturers are allowed to provide extra information beyond what is required by law. The Secretary has the authority to modify warning labels as needed. The Secretary can modify warning labels required by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act without weakening the health message. The Secretary can modify warning labels for adulterated tobacco products without weakening the health message. A tobacco product is considered adulterated if it violates additive requirements, harmful constituent levels are not established, contains poisonous substances, filthy or decomposed substances, prepared under unsanitary conditions, or packaging contains harmful substances. The curr_chunk states that a product may be considered adulterated if it contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that could harm health. The curr_chunk mentions tobacco additives. The text discusses regulations on tobacco additives, including the requirement for manufacturers to provide a list of additives and their quantities to the Secretary. The Secretary can impose restrictions or prohibitions on additives deemed unsafe for public health. The Secretary can restrict or prohibit tobacco additives after consulting experts qualified to evaluate their safety. The Secretary can restrict or prohibit tobacco additives like nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, and other constituents. The Secretary can regulate tobacco products by requiring testing for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide levels, and other constituents. Disclosure requirements may be imposed to inform the public about these levels and any educational activities to clarify that reduced levels do not necessarily mean reduced health risks. The Secretary is required to report annually on tobacco additives, levels of harmful constituents in tobacco products, and legislative recommendations to reduce health risks associated with tobacco use. Sections 701 through 709 are redesignated as sections 801 through 809, sections 801 and 802 are redesignated as sections 901 and 902, and sections 901 and 902 are redesignated as sections 1001 and 1002. SEC. 6. WARNING LABELS.\n\nAmends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to change warning labels on cigarette packages to emphasize the addictive nature of smoking.\n\nSEC. 7. NONTOBACCO NICOTINE CONTAINING PRODUCTS.\n\nProducts containing nicotine but not meeting the definition of tobacco products are classified as drugs.\n\nSEC. 8. MISCELLANEOUS. SEC. 8. MISCELLANEOUS. The amendments made by this Act shall be effective 6 months after date of enactment."
