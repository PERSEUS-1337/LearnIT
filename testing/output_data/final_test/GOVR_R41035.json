    "content": "A handful of terrorists have been prosecuted in federal court for attacks on commercial airlines or their passengers, often charged with multiple crimes based on various factors. For example, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the alleged Christmas bomber, faced charges including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States. The offenses terrorists may be charged with fall into several categories. The offenses terrorists may be charged with fall into several categories, including crimes committed aboard an aircraft, crimes committed against an aircraft, crimes using dangerous instrumentalities like a bomb, crimes of terrorism, crimes against certain classes of individuals, and crimes for which accomplices may be liable. These offenses are outlined with the penalties they may face and the jurisdictional circumstances for federal prosecution, regardless of where the crimes are committed. There have been no proposals to expand upon these criminal proscriptions yet. Chapter 465 of title 49 of the United States Code prohibits offenses such as murder, manslaughter, attempted murder or manslaughter, and assault within the special aircraft jurisdiction. Chapter 465 of title 49 of the United States Code prohibits murder, manslaughter, assault, and aircraft piracy within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, which includes any aircraft in flight within the country or operated by American carriers worldwide. The United States Code prohibits various offenses related to aircraft piracy, including violently taking over an aircraft in flight, interfering with security screening personnel, assaulting flight crew members, and possessing dangerous items on board. These offenses also include threatening to commit or providing false information about them. Terrorists who have attacked commercial aircraft are prosecuted under chapter 465 or its air piracy predecessor 49 U.S.C. App. 1472. The air piracy statute was one of the first federal laws addressing terrorism on commercial airlines, used to convict individuals like Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq and Fawaz Yunis for hijacking and murder attempts. Congress added more on-board crimes to the section before separating them into chapter 465. The air piracy statute was used to convict individuals like Mohammed Rashed for placing a bomb on a Pan Am flight, leading to casualties. The components of the original statute have been divided into chapter 465, which has been used to prosecute various terrorists. Crimes against aircraft are under chapter 2 of title 18, primarily 18 U.S.C. 32, which outlaws damaging or destroying an aircraft. The statute 18 U.S.C. 32 prohibits damaging or destroying an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States by fire or destructive device, providing protection for foreign flagged aircraft as well.

Prosecutors charged him under 18 U.S.C. 1993 for terrorist attacks on mass transit systems, but the court dismissed the charge as it did not protect air travel. Congress amended the proscription to protect commercial air travel under section 1992. The federal prohibitions under 18 U.S.C. 1993 involve acts such as placing destructive devices on mass transportation vehicles, damaging equipment, interfering with operations, using dangerous weapons, collecting information for offenses, communicating false information, and attempting or conspiring to commit these offenses. These prohibitions are implicated when terrorists use destructive devices in connection with mass transportation systems. Destructive devices are implicated in terrorist attacks on commercial air carriers, with specific laws prohibiting their criminal use. These laws outlaw the use of weapons of mass destruction, explosive and incendiary devices, and damage or destruction of property used in interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, using explosive or incendiary devices during a federal crime of violence is also prohibited.

Accomplices aiding in a terrorist attack on a commercial airline may also face federal criminal liability. Aiding and abetting in a federal crime requires intent and contribution to the criminal endeavor, with criminal liability as an accessory after the fact possible for conduct committed post-offense. An accessory after the fact under federal law is someone who assists an offender to hinder their apprehension, trial, or punishment. The elements of the offense include knowledge of the crime, assistance to the principal, and specific intent to prevent apprehension. Aiding and abetting statutes also hold those who command a federal offense or recruit others for a crime liable, even if the crime is not committed. Conviction for solicitation of a crime of violence requires intent for another to commit the crime and actively persuading them to do so. Conspiracy statutes outlaw conspiracies to commit federal offenses, with punishments often matching the underlying offense. Congress has enacted provisions specifically targeting those complicit in terrorist attacks, including outlawing conspiracy to commit violent acts overseas and providing material support for various terrorist activities. The laws outlined in 18 U.S.C. 2339 and 18 U.S.C. 2284 target individuals who harbor or provide transportation for terrorists involved in crimes such as violence against aircraft, use of weapons of mass destruction, and air piracy. The laws in 49 U.S.C. outline federal crimes related to terrorism on commercial airlines, including assaulting flight crew members, bombs on aircraft, and murder within special aircraft jurisdiction. Special procedures apply to those accused of terrorist attacks.

The statute of limitations is tolled for fugitives. Suspects of federal terrorism crimes are subject to preventive detention laws. Upon conviction, these crimes are subject to escalated penalties. Federal crimes of terrorism are subject to escalated sentencing guidelines and the possibility of lifetime supervised release.
