    "content": "The \"Domesticated Salmonid Broodstock and Seedstock Act of 1996\" defines terms such as salmonid, domesticated, broodstock, seedstock, and Secretary. The Act aims to regulate the breeding and use of domesticated salmonids for reproductive purposes. The Congress finds that US breeders of domesticated salmonids play a crucial role in producing broodstock and seedstock for domesticated salmonids globally. The production and interstate commerce of salmonid broodstock and seedstock create jobs, income, and support exports. Foreign nations, including the EU, require inspection and certification of salmonid seedstock imported from the US. Federal and State programs exist for inspecting and certifying the health status of salmonid broodstock. The Congress recognizes the importance of inspecting and certifying the health status of salmonid broodstock and seedstock for the economic well-being of the industry in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture is designated as the authority for this purpose. The competent authority oversees health inspection and certification of salmonid broodstock and seedstock for domesticated salmonids, promoting fair trade and reducing disease transmission in interstate commerce. SEC. 4. PREVENTION OF INTRODUCTION AND SPREAD OF CONTAGION. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a program for domesticated salmonid broodstock and seedstock to provide diagnostic services, set health criteria, and facilitate interstate commerce. To regulate the production, transportation, and exportation of domesticated salmonid broodstock and seedstock for disease control and export promotion, the Secretary may use various provisions of law related to livestock and poultry. Public Law 87-516 (21 U.S.C. 134-134h) and Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Public Law 91-239 (21 U.S.C. 135-135b) are relevant laws that may be utilized by the Secretary to regulate the production, transportation, and exportation of domesticated salmonid broodstock and seedstock for disease control and export promotion. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Establishment of an advisory committee by the Secretary within 180 days of the Act, consisting of members from the salmonid broodstock and seedstock industry, Department of Agriculture, and chaired by a Department of Agriculture officer. The Committee's function is to advise on the development and implementation of the program for the domesticated salmonid industry, including diagnostic services, certification, rules, fair trade facilitation, and dissemination of domesticated salmonid information. The Committee established by the Secretary will advise on the development and implementation of the domesticated salmonid industry program, including fair trade facilitation and dissemination of seedstock. Committee members will not be considered US employees but may have travel expenses covered for meetings. The Secretary of Agriculture certifies the health status of domesticated salmonid seedstock for export. The Secretary of the Interior and Commerce are responsible for salmonids in their facilities."
