    "content": "A bipartisan immigration reform bill (S. 1639) stalled in the Senate in 2007. It aimed to increase H-1B visa caps to 115,000, drawing on labor market protections from other bills. The 1990s economic boom led to a push for more employment-based immigration. In response to the high demand for H-1B visas in the information technology sector, Congress raised the annual ceiling to 195,000 for three years in the early 2000s. The economic downturn in the sector later reduced the demand for H-1B workers, leading to concerns about layoffs of nonimmigrants. The H-1B annual numerical limits were debated in the 108th Congress as admissions surpassed the statutory limit. The FY2004 and FY2005 limits were reached, sparking additional debate due to national security concerns. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 exempted up to 20,000 aliens with a master's degree from the H-1B cap. USCIS announced that enough petitions were received for FY2006, raising concerns in the business community about a scarcity of qualified workers. Efforts to increase H-1B visas in the 109th Congress included exemptions for advanced degree holders in STEM fields from numerical limits, raising the annual cap to 115,000, and establishing a formula for future admissions. Nonimmigrant visas are for aliens in the US temporarily for specific purposes. The H visa is a major nonimmigrant category for temporary workers, with the largest classification being H-1B workers in specialty occupations. Employers must attest to the Department of Labor that they will pay H-1B workers prevailing wages, provide suitable working conditions, and not have any strikes or lockouts. H-1B dependent firms must post applications to hire nonimmigrants at the workplace. Firms classified as H-1B dependent must show efforts to recruit U.S. workers and not lay off U.S. workers before or after hiring H-1B nonimmigrants. The Department of Labor (DOL) reviews the Labor Condition Application (LCA) for accuracy. DOL investigates only if a complaint is filed. Noncompliant employers may face fines, restrictions on hiring H-1B workers, and other penalties. Prospective H-1B workers must prove their qualifications to USCIS for approval of up to three years. An H-1B visa allows aliens to stay in the U.S. for up to six years, with screening for controlled technologies. Foreign students can change their status to H-1B without a new visa. H-1B nonimmigrants are not the same as permanent employment-based immigration. Employers can sponsor aliens for permanent employment-based immigration in the U.S. H-1B nonimmigrants with similar qualifications may qualify for certain employment-based preference categories. Employment-based immigrants applying through the second and third preferences must have job offers with labor certification to show they are not taking jobs from U.S. workers. The process involves the employer petitioning USCIS and DOL on behalf of the immigrant, who must meet job qualifications and preference category requirements. If there is a labor shortage, certification is issued; otherwise, the employer must. Firms are opting to bring in foreign professional workers on L-1 visas rather than H-1B visas. Intracompany transferees in executive or managerial positions are admitted on L-1 visas, with their immediate family on L-2 visas. The alien must meet job qualifications and have been employed by the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. The INA does not require firms to meet labor market tests for L intracompany transfers into the US. H-1B petitions approved peaked in FY2001 at 331,206, dropped to 197,537 in FY2002, and only 79,100 fell under the cap. Most H-1B petitions are now exempt from the ceiling due to statutory changes. In FY2002, 79,100 H-1B approvals fell under the cap, with 103,584 petitions approved for newly arriving H-1B workers and 93,953 petitions approved for continuing employment. In FY2001, 163,200 petitions counted under the cap, with 201,079 approved for newly arriving H-1B workers and 130,127 for continuing employment. In FY2005, 72,000 H-1Bs came in under the cap, higher than the 65,000 limit. The INA sets a numerical limit on H-1B visas, which was reached for the first time prior to the end of FY1997. In FY1997, the H-1B visa ceiling was reached for the first time before the end of the fiscal year. The ceilings for FY1998 and FY1999 were also reached early, with cases being rolled over into the following years. Thousands of visas were approved beyond the ceiling in FY1999 due to issues with the automated reporting system, leading to an audit by KPMG Peat Marwick. The FY2000 ceiling of 115,000 was projected to be reached by June. In FY2000, INS announced that the H-1B visa ceiling of 115,000 would be reached by June. Ultimately, 136,787 petitions for newly arriving H-1B workers were approved. USCIS data show that 217,340 H-1B petitions were approved in FY2003, with only about 78,000 subject to the cap of 195,000. The FY2004 limit of 65,000 was reached in mid-February. USCIS announced on October 1, 2004, that it had reached the cap of 58,200, including visas set aside by Free Trade Agreements. The USCIS has been consistently reaching the H-1B cap for various fiscal years, with petitions being filed and accepted quickly. The agency also receives enough petitions for exemptions from the cap for foreign workers with U.S.-earned master's degrees. The final receipt date for cap-exempt petitions was determined for FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008. In FY2005, 45.3% of H-1B new arrivals were employed in computer-related fields, followed by educators at 11.2%. Other notable occupations included architects, engineers, surveyors (11.1%), administrative specializations (9.5%), and those in medicine, health (6.2%), and life sciences (3.3%). Nonimmigrants must demonstrate eligibility to obtain H-1B visas. In FY2005, the majority of H-1B new arrivals had highly specialized knowledge in fields requiring at least a bachelor's degree. Most had bachelor's degrees (42.5%), followed by master's degrees (39.3%) and professional degrees or doctorates (17.1%). India was the leading country of origin for new H-1B workers, accounting for almost half of all new arrivals. Data also showed that nearly three-fourths of systems analysts and programmers were from India in FY2005. In FY2005, the majority of H-1B new arrivals had specialized knowledge in fields requiring at least a bachelor's degree. India was the leading country of origin for new H-1B workers, with nearly three-fourths of systems analysts and programmers coming from India. China followed with 9.16% of new arrivals, and Canada was third at 3.6%. The median annual compensation for newly arriving H-1B nonimmigrants fluctuated but was $50,000 in FY2005. Fashion models had the highest reported median compensation at $100,000 annually, while law and jurisprudence occupations had the second highest at $76,000. Newly arriving H-1B nonimmigrants in computer-related occupations had median annual salaries of $50,000 in FY2005. The median compensation for H-1B workers approved for continuing employment in FY2005 was $60,000 annually, with those in computer-related occupations earning $68,000. The H-1B visa often leads foreign students to become legal permanent residents through employment-based immigration categories. Some view the \"F-1 to H-1B to LPR\" pathway as a way to retain talented foreign students, while others see it as an abuse of nonimmigrant status. Research shows that around 7% of foreign students directly adjust to LPR status, with an additional 7% to 8% doing so after working as H nonimmigrants. In 2000, about half of H-1Bs who became LPRs did so at that time. In 1995, 43% of those adjusting status were either H-1Bs or accompanying H-4 immediate family. In FY1994, 43% of those adjusting status were H-1Bs or accompanying H-4 family members. The increase in H worker adjustments to LPR status was over 225% from FY1988 to FY1994. Data quality issues exist in collecting last nonimmigrant status information for LPR adjustments. The Migration Policy Institute analyzed limited data on foreign students adjusting status, showing a flat or decreasing trend. H nonimmigrant worker adjustments have increased, especially from FY1998 to FY2002. Proponents of expanding H-1B admissions argue it is crucial for U.S. global competitiveness and job creation. They emphasize the need to hire the best talent quickly, as many STEM graduates are foreign students. Opponents of further H-1B visa increases argue against a labor shortage in professional areas, advocating for prioritizing the education and training of U.S. students and workers. They believe that salaries would rise if there was a true shortage and that employers should focus on attracting qualified U.S. workers. Critics also question the need for more visas by pointing out inconsistencies in LCA applications. Critics of H-1B visa increases argue that many employers pay visa holders below median wages, leading to concerns about attracting qualified U.S. workers. They believe that more stringent protections for U.S. workers are needed, rather than increasing the H-1B visa cap. Some propose strengthening anti-fraud provisions, broadening recruitment requirements, and reforming labor attestation processes for H-1B workers. GAO reports recommend more controls to protect workers and streamline visa services. Critics argue for more stringent protections for U.S. workers instead of increasing the H-1B visa cap. Some trade agreements, like the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), reference H-1B visas and commit the US to admitting 65,000 H-1B visa holders annually. Concerns have been raised that these agreements could limit future changes to H-1B visas and other nonimmigrant worker categories. Critics argue that the US Trade Representative may have overstepped its authority by negotiating immigration provisions. The U.S. Trade Representative is being criticized for negotiating immigration provisions in trade agreements, with concerns about limiting future changes to H-1B visas and nonimmigrant worker categories. Proponents argue that these agreements reflect current immigration law and are essential for economic growth. Concerns have also been raised about monitoring H-1B workers with access to controlled technologies. In 2001, 15,000 foreign nationals changed their immigration status to H-1B visas to access jobs involving controlled technologies without Department of Commerce screening. Legislation in the 110th Congress aims to revise H-1B visas, building on past actions. Supporters argue that current safeguards are sufficient, as foreign nationals are screened for security risks by the Department of State and Homeland Security. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 proposed raising the H-1B visa limit to 115,000 and increasing it by 20% annually after reaching the cap. It also included exemptions for H-1B holders with advanced degrees from US universities and changes to the qualifications for the exemption. Additionally, a bipartisan bill for comprehensive immigration reform (S. 1639) was being discussed in the Senate, which included revisions to H-1B provisions in the INA. S. 1639 proposed raising the H-1B cap to 115,000 for FY2008 and up to 180,000 in subsequent years. It also required submission of W-2 forms for H-1B renewal. The bill stalled in the Senate on June 28, 2007. S. 1035 aimed to prevent H-1B visa fraud and abuse by requiring employers to make efforts to hire U.S. workers first and prohibiting outsourcing of H-1B employees. S. 1035 aims to prevent H-1B visa fraud and abuse by requiring employers to hire U.S. workers first and prohibiting outsourcing of H-1B employees. Additionally, S. 1035 would give the Department of Labor (DOL) authority to review H-1B applications for fraud and conduct employer investigations. Senator John Cornyn and Representative John Shaddeg introduced companion bills, S. 1038 / H.R. 1930, which would exempt certain individuals from the H-1B visa cap based on education and experience criteria. Senator Susan Collins has introduced S. 31 to increase labor condition application penalties, provide H-1B alien with whistle-blower protections, and require USCIS to submit a fraud risk assessment of the H-1B visa program to Congress. Senator Chuck Hagel introduced S. 1092, which would amend the INA to increase annual H-1B visas to 115,000 in FY2007 and 195,000 in FY2008, eliminating the 20,000 cap on aliens with master's degrees. Senator Judd Gregg introduced S. 1351 to modernize the H-1B visa program by increasing visas to 150,000 in FY2008. The Visa Program Modernization Act of 2007 aims to increase H-1B visas to 150,000 in FY2008 with labor market protections for U.S. workers. Senator Joseph Lieberman's Skilled Worker Immigration and Fairness Act (S. 1397) would exempt certain aliens from H-1B ceilings based on education and experience, raising annual limits to 115,000 for FY2007. The bill includes enforcement provisions addressing application fraud, employer penalties, and DOL investigations. H.R. 1758 would provide H-1B visas for individuals with master's or Ph.D. degrees from FY2008 to FY2012. Employers of these workers must make scholarship payments. H.R. 2538 requires employers of H-1B nonimmigrants to determine wages using specified methods. The bill aims to improve the H-1B nonimmigrant program by extending the period for nondisplacement of U.S. workers, requiring active recruitment efforts, and prohibiting outsourcing of H-1B workers. It also eliminates the exemption for certain aliens with U.S. master's degrees from numerical admission limitations. Representative Tom Feeney introduced H.R. 3194 to enhance information exchange between the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security. The H-1B visa program underwent revisions over the years, with the Immigration Act of 1990 establishing the current features. This included replacing \"distinguished merit and ability\" with \"specialty occupation,\" adding labor attestation requirements, setting a numerical limit of 65,000 visas annually, and allowing for \"dual intent.\" The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 raised the H-1B visa ceiling by 142,500 over three years and added new attestation requirements for recruitment and lay-off protections. It mandated firms to offer H-1Bs benefits and wages comparable to U.S. workers, with education and training funded by a $500 fee per H-1B worker hired. The new law set the H-1B visa cap at 115,000 for FY1999 and FY2000, 107,500 for FY2001, and would revert back to 65,000 in FY2002. The House and Senate proposed raising the H-1B visa ceiling, with differing approaches. Both bills included protections for whistle blowers and increased penalties for violations. Controversial provisions in H.R. 3736 aimed at protecting U.S. workers, while S. 1723 penalized firms laying off U.S. workers for H-1B employees. Amendments requiring employers to attest they weren't laying off U.S. workers failed in the Senate. The Senate rejected amendments to protect U.S. workers and recruit U.S. workers, leading to a compromise between House and Senate Republicans on key points. The compromise did not fully address the Clinton Administration's concerns about education and training for U.S. workers. After a veto threat, a compromise was reached with the White House, resulting in the passage of the substitute language in H.R. 3736 on September 24, 1998. The House-passed language from September 24, 1998, was included in P.L. 105-277. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (S. 2045) was passed by both chambers of Congress on October 3, 2000, and signed into law by President Clinton on October 17 as P.L. 106-313. The Senate debated the legislation, focusing on procedural issues and amendments related to legalizing certain aliens. The House passed S. 2045 with a substitute version offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, which included similar features as the Senate Judiciary Committee's version. The bill, known as the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (S. 2045), increases the number of H-1B visas by 297,500 over three years. It adds 80,000 visas for FY2000, 87,500 visas for FY2001, and 130,000 visas for FY2002. The law also eliminates per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants and allows for the portability of H-1B status. The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (S. 2045) increases H-1B visas by 297,500 over three years, eliminates per-country ceilings for employment-based immigrants, and allows for H-1B status portability. The new law reallocates H-1B fees for education and training in information technology shortage areas and includes a grant program for K-12 math, science, and technology education. Additional legislation increases the H-1B fee from $500 to $1,000, with an authorization for employers to pay an expedited petition servicing fee. The House Judiciary Committee had a different approach to the H-1B issue before the passage of S. 2045. They had ordered Chairman Lamar Smith's bill, H.R. 4227, reported with amendments, which would have eliminated the numerical limit on H-1B visas for FY2000 and allowed temporary increases in FY2001 and FY2002 under certain conditions. These conditions included demonstrating a net increase in median wages for U.S. workers and adding a $40,000 minimum salary requirement for H-1B workers. H.R. 4227, like S. 2045, proposed new requirements for H-1B workers, including a $40,000 minimum salary and reporting obligations. It exempted universities, schools, and nonprofit research facilities. The bill mandated W-2 forms, anti-fraud measures, and full-time employment for H-1B workers, funded by fees. It also allowed for portability of H-1B status and instructed the GAO to study recruitment and training efforts by employers. The House Judiciary Committee issued a bill report on H.R. 4402, which directed the Secretary of Labor to use 75% of funding from the H-1B education and training fee account for training in skilled shortage occupations. H.R. 4402 also transferred 25% of the funds to the Department of Education for a student loan forgiveness program for teachers of mathematics, science, and reading. Additionally, Representatives David Dreier and Zoe Lofgren introduced H.R. 3983, which aimed to add 362,500 more. Representatives Dreier and Zoe Lofgren introduced H.R. 3983 to increase the H-1B visa cap by 200,000 for three years and allocate 60,000 visas annually for individuals with master's degrees. The bill would eliminate per-country ceilings for employment-based admissions, require employers to file W-2 forms for H-1B workers, allow Internet recruiting, and establish an online tracking system for immigration petitions. It also proposed raising the education and training fee to $1,000, with modifications to scholarship and training programs, including student loan forgiveness in special cases. Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee introduced H.R. 4200 to set H-1B visa caps at 225,000 annually for FY2001-FY2003, with adjustments based on unemployment rates. The bill allocated visas for nonimmigrants with master's and Ph.D. degrees, retroactively provided additional visas, and proposed a sliding fee scale for firms hiring H-1B workers. The bill introduced by Lamar Smith, H.R. 3814, aimed to increase H-1B visas by 45,000 for FY2000 with certain conditions. It proposed raising fees for scholarships and training to $1,000, with revenue going towards merit-based scholarships. The bill also included provisions for expedited processing of H-1B petitions and anti-fraud measures funded by additional fees. It would have given the Secretary of State responsibility for maintaining records on H-1B nonimmigrants. Several bills were introduced to address H-1B visa issues. The New Workers for Economic Growth Act aimed to raise the H-1B admissions ceiling to 200,000 annually, exempting certain individuals based on education and salary. Other bills proposed initiatives such as eliminating the H-1B ceiling and increasing the annual cap for those with advanced degrees. The Bringing Resources from Academia to the Industry of Our Nation Act and the Helping Improve Technology Education and Competitiveness Act proposed creating a new \"T\" nonimmigrant visa category for foreign students with bachelor's degrees in math, science, or engineering, securing jobs earning at least $60,000. S. 1645 included provisions to protect U.S. workers similar to the H-1B visa regulations. Legislation in the 107th Congress addressed H-1B visa numerical limits. Bills like H.R. 2984 aimed to ensure only H-1B visa holders starting employment count towards the cap. H.R. 3222 by Rep. Tom Tancredo proposed a 65,000 limit, decreasing by 10,000 for every quarter percentage point the US unemployment rate exceeded 6%. Concerns about a shortage of healthcare workers led to discussions on H-1B use in the healthcare sector. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration held hearings on healthcare needs. The 107th Congress did not change H-1B admission levels but included provisions for H-1B visas. The 107th Congress did not change H-1B admission levels but included provisions for H-1B visa holders to extend their stay while their applications for legal permanent residency are pending. Senator Orrin Hatch introduced legislation to extend H-1B status for aliens with lengthy adjudications. President Bush signed the Department of Justice Reauthorization Act into law on November 2, 2002. President Bush signed the Department of Justice Reauthorization Act on November 2, 2002 as P.L. 107-272. Legislation in the 108th Congress introduced Free Trade Agreements implementing the Chile and Singapore FTAs. The House and Senate passed laws amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to create the H-1B-1 visa for professional workers entering through the FTAs, with similar educational requirements to the H-1B visa. The H-1B visa requires highly specialized knowledge, while the FTA professional worker visa only requires specialized knowledge. The bills S. 1416 / H.R. 2738 and S. 1417 / H.R. 2739 set numerical limits for new entries under the FTA professional worker visa from Chile and Singapore. Unlike H-1B workers, FTA professional worker visa holders are not limited in the number of times they can renew their visa annually. The FTA professional worker visa allows for indefinite stay in the US, unlike the H-1B visa which has a six-year limit. Proposed legislation aimed at H-1B reform includes the USA Jobs Protection Act of 2003, which would make changes to H-1B visa laws and the L visa category. Proposed legislation aimed at H-1B reform includes broadening the law to cover all employers hiring H-1B workers, extending lay-off protection to 180 days, giving DOL authority to investigate H-1B employers, and introducing H.R. 4166 for permanent attestation requirements and filing fees for H-1B petitioners. Proposed legislation includes H.R. 4166 for permanent attestation requirements and filing fees for H-1B petitioners. H.R. 4166 would exempt up to 20,000 aliens with a master's degree from the H-1B numerical limitation. Bills introduced in 2003 aimed at suspending or repealing H-1B visas. Title IV of P.L. 108-447 exempts 20,000 aliens from the H-1B cap in FY2005. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 exempts up to 20,000 aliens with a master's degree from the cap on H-1B visas. It reinstates attestation requirements for H-1B-dependent employers, filing fees for H-1B petitioners, and the Secretary of Labor's authority to investigate labor attestation conditions. Additionally, a fraud prevention fee is imposed on H-1B or L petitioners for combating fraud. Legislation in the 109th Congress Emergency Supplemental includes provisions related to H-1B visas. The legislation in the 109th Congress included provisions for H-1B visas, such as adding 10,500 visas for Australian nationals under a new E-3 temporary visa and recapturing up to 30,000 unused H-1B visas with an additional fee of $500. The Senate passed the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005, including provisions for H-1B visas. The House did not include these provisions in their version of the bill. The final Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 did not include the Senate's visa recapture provisions. The bill was signed into law on February 8. The House passed the amended measure into law on February 8, 2006, as P.L. 109-171. Title IV of S. 2454 and Title V of the Chairman's mark aimed to provide exemptions for H-1B visas for advanced degree holders in STEM fields. These provisions also included extending practical training for foreign students from 12 to 24 months and creating a new \"F-4\" student visa for advanced degree candidates in math and engineering. The Senate debated immigration reform in 2006, with proposals including a new \"F-4\" student visa for advanced degree candidates in math, engineering, technology, or physical sciences. The visa would allow students to stay in the US for up to one year after their studies to seek employment. Efforts to pass immigration reform legislation failed. The Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act (S. 2611) in 2006, which aimed to increase legal permanent immigration and restructure visa allocations. The bill raised the H-1B visa limit from 65,000 to 115,000 and included provisions for annual increases. Senator John Cornyn also added revisions to the H-1B visa during floor amendments. The Senate-passed S. 2611 aimed to increase legal permanent immigration and restructure visa allocations. It included provisions to raise the H-1B visa limit and exempt certain H-1B visa holders from numerical limits based on their education and employment. S. 2611 aimed to exempt aliens with advanced degrees in STEM fields from numerical limits on permanent admissions and create visa categories for advanced degree candidates. It also proposed allowing eligible students to seek employment in their field of study in the US for up to one year before adjusting to LPR status. Additionally, H.R. 3322 introduced changes to H-1B visas and the L visa category. Several changes were proposed to current law on H-1B visas and the L visa category. H.R. 3322 aimed to broaden lay-off protection provisions for all employers hiring H-1B workers, expand the lay-off protection period to 180 days, and give the DOL authority to investigate H-1B employers. The Defend the American Dream Act of 2005 (H.R. 4378) would have required employers of H-1B nonimmigrants to use specified methods to determine wages, engage in recruitment efforts, and make other reforms to the H-1B visa program. The proposed changes to H-1B visas included requiring employers to actively engage in recruitment efforts, submit W-2 statements for previous H-1B employees, extend nondisplacement period to 180 days, prohibit outsourcing of H-1B workers, reduce authorized admission period to three years, and eliminate exemptions for U.S. master's degree holders. The Secretary of Labor would be responsible for investigating wage complaints and fraud allegations. The proposed changes to H-1B visas included requiring active recruitment efforts by employers, submission of W-2 statements for previous H-1B employees, extending nondisplacement period to 180 days, prohibiting outsourcing of H-1B workers, reducing authorized admission period to three years, and eliminating exemptions for U.S. master's degree holders. Additionally, H.R. 1325 introduced by Representative Tom Tancredo aimed to repeal the authority for H-1B nonimmigrants in the INA."
