    "title": "AB 1412",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 34191.4 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to transfer real property to the Community Redevelopment Property Trust Fund of a successor agency upon approval by the Department of Finance, unless the property is subject to existing enforceable obligations. Loan agreements between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county can be deemed enforceable obligations if approved by the oversight board and found to be for legitimate redevelopment purposes. If the oversight board deems a loan as enforceable, the interest on the remaining principal amount will be recalculated from origination at the Local Agency Investment Fund's interest rate. The loan must be repaid to the city, county, or city and county over a defined schedule at an interest rate not exceeding that of the Local Agency Investment Fund. Repayments are subject to specific limitations. Loan repayments shall not be made before the 2013\u201314 fiscal year. Starting in the 2013\u201314 fiscal year, the maximum repayment amount allowed each fiscal year for repayments under this section shall be half of the increase between the amount distributed to taxing entities in that fiscal year and the amount distributed in the 2012\u201313 base year. Repayments under this section are second in priority to other repayments. The maximum repayment amount allowed each fiscal year for repayments under this section shall be half of the increase between the amount distributed to taxing entities in that fiscal year and the amount distributed in the 2012\u201313 base year. Repayments under this section are second in priority. Repayments received by the city, county, or city and county from the former redevelopment agency will first retire outstanding amounts owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. Twenty percent of any loan repayment will be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund. Loan agreements between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin with an outstanding balance of $1,250,000 or less can be enforced if certain conditions are met, as approved by the oversight board. The previous fiscal year saw less than $250,000 distributed to taxing entities as per Section 34183. Repayments of loans are exempt from certain requirements, with interest recalculated at 0.25 percent. Bond proceeds from bonds issued before December 31, 2010, must be used for their intended purposes. Bond proceeds in excess of approved enforceable obligations can be used for reserves or project completion, consistent with original bond covenants. Excess bond proceeds obligations must be listed separately on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule. If bond proceeds cannot be spent as per bond covenants, they must be used to defease the bonds or buy them on the open market for cancellation. A special law is deemed necessary for the health and safety of San Joaquin residents."
