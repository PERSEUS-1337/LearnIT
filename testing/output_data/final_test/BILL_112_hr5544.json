The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct a land exchange with Minnesota to acquire the lands.

The acquired land will be added to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and managed according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The acquisition of land by the United States under subsection (b) for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness will not affect existing fishing and hunting rights. Land acquired by the State of Minnesota will be deemed State trust lands held for the public school system. The State of Minnesota should make acquired land available for various recreational uses when not used for revenue-generating activities. The Secretary will adjust the boundaries of the Superior National Forest accordingly. The modified boundaries will be considered as of January for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The land exchange in the Superior National Forest as of January 1, 1965, is not considered a major federal action. The Secretary will not consider the acquired lands in determining the value of National Forest System lands in Minnesota for payments under the Thye-Blatnik Act. This exchange does not impact other ongoing land exchanges involving National Forest System land in Minnesota. The Secretary must complete a land exchange in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota within 18 months of the enactment of this Act. If not completed, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the delay and providing a new completion date. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
