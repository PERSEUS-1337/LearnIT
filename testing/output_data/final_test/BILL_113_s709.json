    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Outcomes, Planning, and Education for Alzheimer's Act\". Congress finds that many Americans with Alzheimer's disease have not been diagnosed, but early diagnosis and access to care planning services lead to better outcomes. Combining Medicare benefits for diagnosis and care planning would ensure individuals receive appropriate care and information, leading to improved outcomes and better management of chronic conditions. The purpose of this Act is to increase diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, leading to better care and outcomes for Americans living with these conditions. Undertaking the diagnostic process potentially allows cognitive impairment to be reversed, as some cases are due to reversible causes like depression or vitamin deficiency. The Act aims to expand Medicare coverage for comprehensive Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and services, enhancing care for individuals with the condition. The term 'comprehensive Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and services' refers to services provided to individuals without a prior Alzheimer's diagnosis, who show signs of cognitive impairment or dementia and require a diagnostic evaluation. These services include a diagnostic evaluation and referral for further assessment. The comprehensive Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and services include a diagnostic evaluation, referral to a specialist if needed, care planning services for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and medical record documentation. Payment for comprehensive Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and services under the Social Security Act will be 80 percent of the determined fee. The amendments made by this section will apply to services furnished on or after January 1 of the year following the year of enactment."
