    "content": "On November 9, 2012, CIA Director David Petraeus resigned due to an extra-marital affair. Congressional intelligence oversight committees were not notified before the public announcement. The FBI investigation into possible hacking of Petraeus's email raised concerns about national security. Senator Dianne Feinstein called for an investigation into why the oversight committees were not informed. Senator Dianne Feinstein called for an investigation into the lack of notification to oversight committees regarding the FBI's investigation of Director Petraeus, citing it as an \"operationally sensitive matter.\" The \"Gang of Four\" intelligence notification procedure, although not based in statute, has been informally used by the executive branch to provide limited notification of sensitive intelligence activities to congressional intelligence committees. Initially, limited notifications were used to inform congressional committee leadership of sensitive intelligence matters, including covert action and intelligence collection programs. The process was oral, cursory, and limited to committee chairmen, ranking Members, and senior staff. In 1980, the \"Gang of Four\" notification procedure was limited to non-covert action intelligence programs, while the \"Gang of Eight\" process was established for particularly sensitive covert action programs. Congress also mandated full notification to the intelligence committees, except for covert action programs. The intelligence community must inform congressional intelligence committees of all activities and provide information while protecting classified information. In rare cases, sensitive aspects may be withheld to safeguard intelligence sources and methods. Congress established notification procedures for sensitive intelligence matters, including covert action programs. In 1991, Congress added language to protect intelligence sources and methods, including \"other exceptionally sensitive matters\" such as military deployments and diplomatic contacts. This was in response to past misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies, leading to tighter oversight by Congress. Congress established intelligence committees in the House and Senate to tighten oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA. The committees were tasked with being fully informed of all intelligence activities, including collection and covert action programs. These obligations were set out in resolutions, emphasizing the executive branch's responsibility to keep the committees informed. The Senate established an intelligence committee to oversee intelligence agencies, requiring them to inform the committee of all activities. Despite the directive, the executive branch continued to limit notification of sensitive intelligence operations. The Gang of Four, consisting of the committees' chairmen and ranking Members, were informed of certain sensitive intelligence activities, while other operations were kept secret from the committee and its chairman. The House Intelligence Committee leaders have occasionally shared information with their party leaders. The Gang of Four committee members agreed to share sensitive information with their party leaders. Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Reyes expressed frustration at not being able to have legal counsel or experts present during restricted briefings in the past. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Bayh accepted the practice but was upset when not informed in advance of covert efforts in 1980. Director of Central Intelligence Stansfield Turner briefed the intelligence committees after covert operations to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran. Senator Bayh expressed frustration at not being informed in advance, citing a lack of trust from the executive branch. Other committee members understood the need for secrecy to protect lives. Senator Bayh suggested a more limited notification process for future administrations to address disclosure concerns regarding covert action programs. In 1980, Congress approved the Gang of Eight notification procedure, requiring prior notice to the intelligence committees' leadership and key congressional leaders for sensitive programs. The Gang of Eight notification procedure was established in 1980 for sensitive programs, allowing limited access in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests. The procedure should be invoked for covert actions of extraordinary sensitivity or risk to life, restricting knowledge to as few individuals as possible. Gang of Four and Gang of Eight notifications differ in various ways. The Gang of Four notification procedure is informal and accepted by intelligence committees, while the Gang of Eight procedure is statutory and imposes legal obligations on the executive branch. The President must determine vital U.S. interests are at stake to restrict notification to the Gang of Eight, providing written reasons. Advance notice of covert actions must be given to the Gang of Eight, recognizing the President's authority to withhold prior notification. The President's constitutional authority allows for withholding prior notice, with a requirement to provide access to intelligence committees within 180 days. If continued limited access is needed, a statement of reasons must be issued. Gang of Four notifications are limited to non-covert action intelligence activities. The Gang of Eight notifications are limited to sensitive covert action programs, while there are no statutory restrictions on sharing information with committee members beyond the leadership. The access of committee staff to classified information is not governed by statute, and there have been instances of informing the full committee of certain notifications. The impact and debate surrounding limited congressional intelligence notification procedures like Gang of Four and Gang of Eight are ongoing. Supporters of Gang of Eight notifications argue that they serve to protect the operational security of sensitive intelligence activities. Members receiving these restricted briefings can raise concerns directly with the President and congressional leadership. They also have legislative remedies available if they oppose specific actions. Some critics argue that limited congressional intelligence notification procedures like Gang of Eight may hinder effective oversight, as members are restricted in their ability to discuss issues with colleagues. Critics also claim that these notifications have been overused and question the legality of procedures like Gang of Four. The Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the CIA announced limitations on notifying certain sensitive intelligence activities to the intelligence committees. They emphasized the need to protect classified information while still fulfilling the statutory requirement to inform the committees. The DNI stated that in rare cases, it may be appropriate to brief only the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the intelligence committee on particularly sensitive matters. The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the intelligence committee should be notified in exceptional circumstances to protect classified information, as stated by Clapper, Panetta, and Petraeus during pre-nomination hearings. Discussions with committee leaders are crucial to determine how sensitive information should be handled within their respective committees. David Petraeus made commitments during his confirmation hearings as DCIA in June 2011, noting that limited notifications must be reconsidered within 180 days. The Gang of Four notification procedure is an informal process used to notify intelligence committee leaders of sensitive activities. The Gang of Eight notification procedure is based in statute and is limited to sensitive covert actions where limited notification is deemed essential by the President. Congressional intent was for the full membership of the intelligence committees to determine necessary procedures, rather than just the chairmen and ranking Members. The balance between oversight and security is a challenge for Congress and the executive, especially in cases involving sensitive collection and covert action programs. Trust between branches is crucial for effective notification procedures, with more trust leading to greater flexibility and less trust prompting tighter notification requirements for effective oversight."
