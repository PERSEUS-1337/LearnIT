FINDINGS.\" Congress recognizes the Upper Mississippi River System as a significant ecosystem and navigation system. Inaction on new locks and ecosystem restoration will lead to economic and environmental decline. The system plays a crucial role in the export of corn and soybeans, benefiting the nation's trade balance. The Upper Mississippi River System supports the movement of over 100,000,000 tons of products, creating 400,000 jobs and generating billions in income and economic activity. Midwestern utilities rely on coal for cost-efficient energy production. Competitive transportation costs benefit U.S. farmers in global agricultural exports. Farm and trade policies aim to open world markets and promote U.S. exports. The resource policy provides a low-cost transportation alternative, benefiting farmers and rural communities by increasing income. It also supports the growth of corn and soybean exports through the Gulf of Mexico and Port of New Orleans. The construction of new locks will further enhance transportation efficiency. The construction of new locks and lock extensions will provide significant employment opportunities over 10 to 15 years. Foreign competitors have improved their transportation infrastructure to compete with the US. The inland waterway system moves a large percentage of US freight at a low cost. The Department of Transportation predicts a doubling of freight congestion on roads and rails in the next 25 years, emphasizing the need for water transportation. The current capacity of the Upper Mississippi River System is declining by 10 percent annually due to unplanned closures of aging infrastructure, reducing potential for growth. The 600-foot lock system was designed for steamboats when 4,000,000 tons moved on the river. The 600-foot locks on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway are operating at 80 percent capacity, unable to handle the increasing demand for corn exports. Lock modernization is crucial over the next 30 years to prevent loss of export sales and maintain national competitiveness. The Corps of Engineers is assessing the necessary upgrades. The Corps of Engineers has been studying the national investments needed for the Upper Mississippi River System for 15 years, based on the best available information. The ecosystem includes various habitats and is home to a diverse range of species. Over 40% of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds in North America rely on the river for food and shelter during migration. The Upper Mississippi and Illinois River ecosystems require significant Federal investment for restoration. The Upper Mississippi River System attracts more visitors annually than most National Parks, with its ecosystems and wildlife being the main attractions. The system includes 284,688 acres of National Wildlife Refuge land managed as habitat for migratory species. The Upper Mississippi River System includes over 975,000 acres of land protected by levees and requires a balanced ecosystem restoration program that considers existing flood control infrastructure. Enhanced navigation capacity improvements and ecosystem restoration plan for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway system. The definitions in this section include the meaning of \"Plan\" as the integrated plan for the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Army, and the scope of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System projects authorized by Congress. Authorization is given for the construction of navigation improvements along the Illinois Waterway and Mississippi River, including mooring facilities, switchboats, and appointment scheduling system, funded by the general Treasury and Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Authorization is given for the construction of new locks on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway, funded by the general Treasury and Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Mitigation measures will also be conducted for ecosystem restoration. The Secretary will modify the operation of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway System to address environmental impacts and improve ecological integrity. Ecosystem restoration projects will be carried out to attain and maintain sustainability. Ecosystem restoration projects in the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River aim to achieve sustainability through various activities like island building, fish passages, floodplain restoration, water level management, backwater restoration, and more. Ecosystem restoration projects in the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River include topographical diversity, dam point control, use of dredged material for environmental purposes, tributary confluence restoration, spillway modification, land easement authority, and land acquisition. The Federal share of the cost for these projects is typically 65 percent. Ecosystem restoration projects may have the Federal share of the cost at 100 percent if located in specific areas or on federally owned land. Nongovernmental organizations can contribute to non-Federal cost-sharing requirements for these projects. The Secretary may acquire land for ecosystem restoration projects from willing owners through fee title or flood plain conservation easements. Specific projects are authorized with a total construction cost of $1,460,000,000, with a limitation of $35,000,000 available for each fiscal year. The Secretary may acquire land for ecosystem restoration projects with $35,000,000 available annually. Implementation reports must be submitted every 4 years to the Senate and House committees, detailing project goals and progress. An advisory panel is also required. The Secretary appoints an advisory panel for each implementation report, including representatives from State resource agencies, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Transportation. The Department of Transportation appoints representatives from various agencies and advocacy groups for each implementation report, including the United States Geological Survey, Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency, affected landowners, conservation and environmental advocacy groups, and agriculture and industry advocacy groups. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior will co-chair the advisory panel. Sums are authorized for fiscal years 2006 through 2020, with special rules for funds post-2020."
