    "content": "The Act titled \"Commonsense Consumption Act of 2005\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purpose of the Act. Congress finds that the food and beverage industries significantly impact the economy and interstate commerce. Weight gain and obesity are influenced by various factors, not solely by food consumption. Promoting personal responsibility is crucial for addressing health issues related to weight gain. The purpose of this Act is to allow Congress, State legislatures, and regulatory agencies to determine appropriate laws, rules, and regulations to address weight gain, obesity, and related health conditions. Lawsuits blaming food and beverage providers for weight-related issues are legally frivolous and harmful to society. SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS. A qualified civil liability action cannot be brought in any Federal or State court. Pending actions of this nature must be dismissed immediately. Discovery proceedings in cases involving liability based on accumulative acts of consumption of a qualified product are stayed until a motion to dismiss is filed. During the pendency of a motion to dismiss, parties must comply with rules regarding the treatment of documents and tangible objects. Failure to comply may result in remedies under applicable rules. In actions seeking liability based on accumulative acts of consumption of a qualified product, the complaint must state each element of the cause of action, laws allegedly violated, specific facts of the violation, and facts causing the injury. This Act does not create a cause of action or remedy. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"engaged in the business\" refers to a person involved in manufacturing, marketing, distributing, advertising, or selling a qualified product. A \"manufacturer\" is someone lawfully manufacturing a qualified product. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, and governmental entities. A \"qualified product\" is defined as a food under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term \"qualified civil liability action\" refers to a legal action against a manufacturer, marketer, distributor, advertiser, or seller of a qualified product for damages related to weight gain, obesity, or associated health conditions. A qualified civil liability action excludes actions based on breach of contract or warranty unrelated to weight gain, obesity, or associated health conditions. An action can be taken against a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product if they knowingly violated a Federal or State statute related to marketing, advertising, or labeling with the intent for someone to rely on that violation, and if that reliance caused injury related to weight gain, obesity, or associated health conditions. The term \"seller\" refers to a person engaged in marketing, distributing, advertising, or selling a qualified product. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States and its territories. The term \"trade association\" refers to any association or business organization not operated for profit, with 2 or more members who are manufacturers, marketers, distributors, advertisers, or sellers of a qualified product. It includes territories and possessions of the United States and political subdivisions."
