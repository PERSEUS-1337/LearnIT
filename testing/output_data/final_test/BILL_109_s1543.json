    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clinical Research Act of 2005\". The Congress recognizes the importance of strong academic health centers for clinical research, driven by breakthroughs in biomedical sciences. Translating basic discoveries into clinical practice requires robust clinical research institutions and career programs to sustain health advancements. Without a solid infrastructure, data translation may be hindered. The clinical research environment faces challenges such as incompatible databases, shortage of qualified investigators, rising costs, inadequate funding, and regulatory burdens. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"clinical research\" refers to patient-oriented studies with human subjects, research on disease causes and consequences in human populations, epidemiologic or behavioral studies, outcomes research, health services research, and development of new technologies or therapeutic interventions. The terms defined in the Act include Director (referring to the Director of the National Institutes of Health), Eligible academic health center (referring to academic institutions conducting clinical research), and Secretary (referring to the Secretary of Health and Human Services). SEC. 4. CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR ADVANCEMENT GRANTS. The Director will provide clinical investigator advancement grants to eligible academic health centers for career development programs and research translation purposes. Grants must be used efficiently to support clinician-investigators in academic clinical research careers. The Director may conduct or support career development programs for clinical researchers and medical personnel. Funds cannot be used to increase pay beyond a certain level. The Director allocates appropriated funds among academic health centers based on their investment in clinical research. Centers must submit applications for grants and report on how the funds were used. The Director allocates funds to academic health centers based on their investment in clinical research. Recipients must report on how the grant was used. $40,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2010. SEC. 5. CLINICAL RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. The Director will provide clinical research infrastructure grants to eligible academic health centers for fostering the use of information technology in research and supporting new technologies for clinical investigators to improve safety, ensure data confidentiality, and streamline regulatory processes. The Director will provide clinical research infrastructure grants to academic health centers to improve technology use, data confidentiality, and regulatory processes. This includes addressing obstacles like outdated IT systems, incompatible databases, lack of connectivity between institutions, and underrepresentation in research. Sharing infrastructure across centers is also emphasized. The Director will provide grants to academic health centers for clinical research infrastructure, promoting cross-center collaborations. Recipients must submit annual reports detailing grant usage. Eligible centers must apply for grants as per Director's requirements. $125,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006-2010. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM ON PARTNERSHIPS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. The Secretary may grant up to 5 academic health centers to partner with healthcare providers for clinical human subject research, with a maximum grant amount of $5,000,000. Centers must submit applications for grants, and $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006 through 2010."
