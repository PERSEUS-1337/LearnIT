    "content": "Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the federal government recognized the need for new medical countermeasures to respond to CBRN agents. The pharmaceutical industry cited the lack of a commercial market as a barrier to developing these countermeasures. In response, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act in 2004, allocating $5.6 billion for acquiring countermeasures from FY2004 to FY2013. Subsequent Congresses have assessed the implementation of Project BioShield. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response were created in response to issues with Project BioShield procurement. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 extended Project BioShield through FY2018 with appropriations of up to $2.8 billion. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 was proposed by President Bush and passed by the 108th Congress. It provided $255 million for medical countermeasures and is related to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Policy issues for congressional policymakers and related legislation in the 113th Congress are discussed. The Project BioShield Act of 2004, modified by the Reauthorization Act of 2013, provides authorities for the development and acquisition of medical countermeasures against CBRN attacks. It allows the HHS Secretary to purchase countermeasures in advance and temporarily use unapproved ones in emergencies. Project BioShield contracts support the development of CBRN medical countermeasures for government use. Project BioShield contracts assure developers of CBRN countermeasures that the government will purchase their product once developed. These contracts specify milestone payments during development and can be used for countermeasures deemed a national security threat. They can also stockpile unapproved countermeasures and provide economic value, reduce market and development risks, and offer revenue through milestone-based payments. The U.S. government, through Project BioShield contracts, assures developers of CBRN countermeasures that their products will be purchased for the Strategic National Stockpile. These contracts define the minimum value of the government market for medical countermeasures and provide milestone-based payments during development. Project BioShield contracts provide milestone-based payments to countermeasure developers to mitigate the risk of product failure during development. These contracts define the minimum economic value of a successfully developed product and offer payments for meeting development milestones. Developers can also market products to increase economic value beyond the contract. Under Project BioShield, HHS may purchase unapproved and unlicensed countermeasures for CBRN agents posing a material threat to national security. The HHS Secretary must ensure sufficient clinical data to support future approval. Larger awards are possible for approved products. The HHS utilizes Project BioShield to acquire unapproved countermeasures for potential threats like anthrax, smallpox, and botulinum toxin. The FDA's standard approval processes aim to safeguard against ineffective or harmful treatments. The Project BioShield Act grants the HHS Secretary the authority to temporarily permit the use of medical products not yet approved by the FDA, known as emergency use authorizations (EUAs), during emergencies or material threats to national security. The HHS Secretary has issued several EUAs, including two related to CBRN agents. One allows the distribution of antibiotic kits to Postal Service employees, while the other permits distributing doxycycline hyclate to prevent inhalational anthrax. Active EUAs also allow the use of diagnostic tests for diseases like H7N9. Congress funded the first 10 years of Project BioShield acquisitions with $5.593 billion in FY2004 to secure medical countermeasures against CBRN threats. The Project BioShield Act specified that the funds were to be used for CBRN countermeasures from FY2004 through FY2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 transferred remaining funds to the HHS Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The Project BioShield portion of the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also known as the \"special reserve fund,\" has had consistent annual appropriations of $560 million. The Project BioShield Act initially authorized $5.593 billion in appropriations through FY2013. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 authorized up to $2.8 billion for Project BioShield for FY2014 through FY2018. Congress rescinded or transferred approximately $2.3 billion of the $5.6 billion advance appropriation, with HHS obligating the remaining $3.3 billion for CBRN medical countermeasures. The average obligation rate during this period was $330 million annually. Requested and appropriated funding has been lower since the expiration of the advance appropriation. The President requested $250 million for Project BioShield in FY2014, with Congress providing $255 million. For FY2015, the President requested $415 million. Congress has the power to adjust the special reserve fund amount through rescission, transfer, or additional appropriation, with approximately 40% of the FY2004-FY2013 advance appropriation rescinded or transferred. Congress has removed funds from the Project BioShield account through rescissions and transfers in various appropriations acts. For example, in FY2010, $305 million was transferred to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development, and $304 million was allocated for basic research on biodefense and emerging infectious diseases at NIAID. In FY2011, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act transferred $415 million to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development. In FY2012, the Consolidated Appropriations Act transferred $415 million to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development and administrative costs. In FY2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act transferred $415 million to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development and administrative costs. HHS obligated $3.3 billion of the Project BioShield advance appropriation to acquire medical countermeasures against CBRN agents, awarding contracts for 12 countermeasures including vaccines, antibodies, antivirals, and chemical compounds. The Project BioShield countermeasures include vaccines, antibodies, antivirals, and chemical compounds. The first contract was with VaxGen, Inc. for 75 million doses of anthrax vaccine, terminated in 2006. $1.454 billion was used to acquire anthrax countermeasures, with $700 million for Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed and $530 million for Raxibacumab. The HHS used Project BioShield funds to acquire various countermeasures, including $1.1 billion for smallpox, $476 million for botulinum toxin, and $235 million for radiological or nuclear countermeasures. This included purchases of Raxibacumab, anthrax immune globulin, Modified Vaccinia Ankara smallpox vaccine, Arestvyr, and botulinum antitoxin. The HHS obligated $235 million of Project BioShield funds for radiological or nuclear countermeasures. $195 million was allocated for blood cell growth factors to treat acute radiation syndrome, with $157 million going to Amgen USA, Inc. for Neupogen and $37 million to Sanofi US, LLC for Leukine. Additionally, $22 million was allocated to Akorn, Inc. for DTPA and $18 million to Fleming Pharmaceuticals for pediatric potassium iodide. $58 million was used to acquire nerve agent countermeasures, including autoinjectors and muti-dose vials of Midazolam from Pfizer, Inc. The HHS used Project BioShield funds to acquire various countermeasures, including vials of Midazolam from Pfizer, Inc., to treat seizures caused by nerve agents. Some products acquired lacked FDA approval for stockpile use, while others had FDA approval for specific uses but not intended stockpile use. Countermeasure developers were required to seek FDA approval for stockpile use, with some products receiving approval after acquisition. The FDA approved Raxibacumab and botulinum antitoxin for the Strategic National Stockpile. During emergencies, non-FDA approved countermeasures may be used under an EUA. Project BioShield is part of federal efforts to acquire medical countermeasures against CBRN attacks. HSPD-18 and HSPD-21 provide policy frameworks for this effort. The PHEMCE coordinates interagency activities to address federal countermeasure needs. The PHEMCE, headed by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, coordinates federal countermeasure needs efficiently. BARDA, under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, manages Project BioShield contracts to develop medical countermeasures against CBRN agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. BARDA can contract with companies through Project BioShield to develop and commercialize potential countermeasures, with contracts specifying development activities and extending over multiple years. BARDA supports advanced development of CBRN countermeasures through two mechanisms: countermeasure advanced development contracts and Project BioShield acquisition contracts. HHS can contribute to all phases of countermeasure development, purchasing them using Project BioShield or Strategic National Stockpile funds. The 113th Congress has enacted laws impacting Project BioShield, including the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. Congress is also considering the WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2014. Key authorities related to Project BioShield were reauthorized and modified through PAHPRA. The House passed H.R. 307, while the Senate passed an amended version. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA) extended the Project BioShield procurement program, modified countermeasure development processes, and authorized appropriations of $2.8 billion for FY2014-FY2018. PAHPRA also allowed the HHS Secretary to redirect Project BioShield funds to BARDA for advanced countermeasure development. The PAHPRA extended Project BioShield procurement program, allowing redirection of funds to BARDA for advanced development. The HHS Secretary can redirect up to $1.4 billion from FY2014-FY2018. This new authority grants flexibility in procurement contracts, including development costs and signing contracts up to 10 years before delivery. New planning activities and reporting requirements are mandated. The PAHPRA law extends Project BioShield, allowing funds to be redirected to BARDA for advanced development. The HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response must develop an annual 5-year budget plan for countermeasure activities and update the PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan annually. Plans must include specific information on CBRN threats, countermeasure development efforts, progress evaluation, and prioritized needs. Timelines, metrics, and intended uses for each countermeasure under development must be provided. The PAHPRA law extends Project BioShield, allowing funds to be redirected to BARDA for advanced development. It requires annual plans to report progress on awards, the amount in the BioShield fund, stakeholder input, and the need for pediatric countermeasures. Congress modified HHS emergency use authority for medical countermeasures through PAHPRA, allowing the HHS Secretary to issue an EUA for public health emergencies. EUAs now expire when the emergency no longer exists, and the Secretary can modify active EUAs. The PAHPRA law extends Project BioShield, allowing funds to be redirected to BARDA for advanced development. It requires annual plans to report progress on awards, the amount in the BioShield fund, stakeholder input, and the need for pediatric countermeasures. Congress modified HHS emergency use authority for medical countermeasures through PAHPRA, allowing the HHS Secretary to issue an EUA for public health emergencies. The Secretary can now issue an EUA for countermeasures against agents posing a national security threat without a separately declared emergency. The law also allows for mass dispensing of approved medical countermeasures during emergencies without individual prescriptions and permits pre-positioning or stockpiling of unapproved countermeasures for future emergencies. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $255 million for Project BioShield acquisitions and $415 million for BARDA in FY2014. This marked the first new appropriation for Project BioShield since its inception in FY2004. The WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2014 introduced provisions related to Project BioShield and BARDA. H.R. 4034, referred to multiple House Committees, aims to establish a new White House Special Assistant for Biodefense to coordinate federal biodefense policy and develop a National Biodefense Plan. This bill builds on previous legislation related to Project BioShield and BARDA. The plan aims to address biological risks, identify activities, assets, and gaps in biodefense, define roles, and incorporate stakeholder input. It will be delivered to the President and Congress, updated as needed, and include an annual biodefense budget analysis covering various departments and agencies. H.R. 4034 would require DHS to review CBRN agents for national security threats. Congress will decide on Project BioShield funding and limits on fund usage. Other issues include funding for expiring countermeasures. The 113th Congress will consider funding for Project BioShield acquisitions and whether to prioritize countermeasures. Policy makers may choose not to fund Project BioShield due to uncertainty about its effectiveness or may redirect funds to other countermeasure procurement methods. Congressional policy makers face decisions on funding for Project BioShield, including how much to provide and whether to use advance appropriations. The 108th Congress allocated $5.6 billion over 10 years, but actual spending has been slower. HHS could have used other funding sources for some purchases, potentially supporting funding below authorized levels. Since 2001, HHS has spent over $15 billion on biodefense research. Up to 12 new medical countermeasures may be ready for Project BioShield contracts by 2018, potentially leading to an increase in funding. In FY2014, Congress appropriated $255 million for Project BioShield acquisitions, slightly exceeding the President's budget request. The President's budget request for FY2015 is $415 million, 25% more than the historic obligation rate. The 113th Congress and the Administration have chosen to use annual appropriations for Project BioShield, affecting both private developers and federal planners. Developers argue that a multiyear advance-funded account is crucial for developing countermeasures. The switch to annual appropriations for Project BioShield may complicate long-term planning for countermeasure development and acquisition at HHS. While some developers argue that advance appropriations are essential for obtaining capital, other agencies like the Department of Defense and NASA successfully use annual appropriations for complex acquisitions. The federal countermeasure development process may result in uneven acquisition opportunities, with some years seeing significant funding for countermeasures under Project BioShield contracts, while other years may see no funding allocated. Congress may address the issue of Project BioShield contracts by allowing funds to remain available until expended or until the appropriation authority expires. The President has requested this for FY2015. Alternatively, Congress could use advance appropriations to provide funding for multiple years, which may help developers and HHS plan acquisition programs. However, providing advance appropriations during the current fiscal environment may be challenging. Increasing the duration of advance appropriations may also increase the likelihood of future Congresses transferring money out of the account for other purposes. Congress has used funds appropriated for Project BioShield acquisitions for other purposes, transferring approximately one-third of the advance appropriation to fund BARDA activities. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 allows the HHS Secretary to transfer up to $1.4 billion of Project BioShield appropriations to BARDA for countermeasure advanced development. The HHS Secretary can transfer Project BioShield appropriations to BARDA for advanced development, with Congressional oversight to ensure proper use. Biomedical countermeasures in the SNS have a finite shelf-life, requiring replacement to maintain preparedness. Increasing the number of countermeasures would lead to higher costs. The HHS has used funding from the SNS annual appropriations and Project BioShield advance appropriations to purchase replacements for expiring countermeasures. The National Biodefense Science Board projected increasing strain on SNS funding due to countermeasure replacement costs. Strategies to mitigate costs include better planning, contracting with vendors, developing countermeasures with longer shelf lives, and broad spectrum countermeasures. The federal government could reduce replacement costs through improved planning, as highlighted by NBSB and a 2010 HHS review. The HHS has implemented a five-year countermeasure budget plan process that includes considering replacement costs, as required by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act. For countermeasures like antibiotics, the government can reduce replacement costs by contracting with vendors to store and rotate stock, ensuring countermeasures do not expire. BARDA utilizes a vendor-managed-inventory approach to ensure countermeasures do not expire and reduce life-cycle management costs. The FDA Shelf Life Extension Program extends the shelf life of stored countermeasures, including a more stable smallpox vaccine supported by BARDA. The program tests and approves new expiration dates for stored drugs meeting criteria. The FDA Shelf Life Extension Program extends the shelf life of stored countermeasures meeting criteria, but it is only available for drugs, not biologics like vaccines and antitoxins acquired through Project BioShield. HHS may reduce the number of products in the SNS by acquiring countermeasures addressing multiple threats, which could have a commercial market. Project BioShield contracts have not been used to acquire countermeasures against all material threats identified by DHS. Project BioShield allocated $3.3 billion for acquiring countermeasures against material threats identified by DHS, with 90% focused on anthrax, smallpox, and botulinum. However, no countermeasures were obtained for the other eight threats. The procurement planning process is complex, and factors like the availability of existing commercial countermeasures and the potential impact of an attack must be considered for a balanced countermeasure portfolio. Countermeasures for material threats must consider the impact of an attack, deployment effectiveness, time and cost for stockpile addition, and cost-benefit analysis. Congressional oversight and detailed reporting requirements can ensure effective use of Project BioShield funds."
