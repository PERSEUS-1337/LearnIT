The group has killed over 10,000 people since the early 2000s, displacing more than 1 million internally. State Department officials suggest Boko Haram is escalating attacks to influence the elections. The elections, originally scheduled for February 14 and 28, were delayed by six weeks on February 7. The elections in Nigeria, initially set for February 14 and 28, were postponed by six weeks due to security concerns related to a major military operation against Boko Haram. The delay is seen as an opportunity to improve conditions for voters in the northeast and address poll preparation concerns. It remains uncertain how the Nigerian public will perceive the postponement. The delay in the Nigerian elections has sparked mixed reactions, with the opposition calling it a setback for democracy and concerns raised about political interference. Former President Obasanjo expressed alarm, while Secretary of State Kerry and the UK criticized any further delays and warned against using security concerns as an excuse to impede the democratic process. The United Kingdom and former President Obasanjo expressed concern over the delay in Nigerian elections, warning against using security concerns as an excuse for impeding the democratic process. The upcoming presidential elections in Nigeria are expected to be closely contested, with potential for political tensions and violent protests if results are disputed. This could further hinder the government's ability to address post-election violence and counter the Boko Haram threat. The All Progressives Congress (APC) poses a strong challenge to the ruling party in Nigeria, drawing support from dissatisfaction with government performance, Boko Haram response, and corruption. The party has selected former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari as its candidate. Inter-faith relations in Nigeria have worsened, with religious and ethnic identities overlapping in political messages, leading to tensions in the country. In Nigeria, religious and ethnic affiliations play a significant role in electoral politics, with Muslims tending to vote for Muslims and Christians for Christians. Both political parties emphasize religion in their campaigns, with the PDP labeling the APC as \"Nigeria's Muslim Brotherhood\" in 2014. Buhari's running mate is a Yoruba Pentecostal pastor from the southwest. The potential for violence around the elections in Nigeria is high, with previous elections marred by violence. Analysts suggest that the prospects for electoral unrest have never been greater, with an estimated 800 people killed in violence following the last elections. The post-election protests in Nigeria highlighted grievances and mistrust of the government, exacerbated by the Boko Haram insurgency. Northern opponents view President Jonathan's candidacy as illegitimate due to legal questions and a belief that it is the north's \"turn\" to hold the presidency. Tensions are further fueled by communal violence and economic pressures, leading to concerns about the country's trajectory. Nigeria is facing economic pressures with uncertainty around elections and security conditions deterring investors. The Nigerian naira has dropped against the dollar, and the government is struggling to balance budget demands amidst a sharp decline in oil prices. Nigeria is a key country in Africa due to its size, economic weight, and population. Lagos, a major commercial center, is one of the world's largest cities. Nigeria was a significant source of imported oil for the United States until 2011, but U.S. purchases have decreased due to increased domestic energy supply. The Obama Administration views its relationship with Nigeria as crucial, despite reports of deteriorating relations. Disagreements over Boko Haram and concerns about human rights and corruption have strained diplomatic engagement. Nigerian political life is marked by ethnic, geographic, and religious conflicts, as well as decades of corruption. Nigeria has long been plagued by ethnic, geographic, and religious conflicts, as well as corruption and misrule. These issues have led to divisions among ethnic groups, north-south disparities, and tensions between Christians and Muslims. The country has experienced localized clashes resulting in thousands of deaths, with a large displaced population and social unrest. In the oil-rich Niger Delta region, criminality and corruption have hindered economic development and contributed to piracy. Despite having Africa's largest economy, Nigeria's human development indicators are among the lowest. Nigeria's economy is the largest in Africa, but its human development indicators are among the world's lowest, with high income inequality and a majority living in extreme poverty. The country lags behind South Africa on the U.N. Human Development Index, with challenges such as political instability, security issues, poor infrastructure, and electricity shortages. Decades of economic mismanagement, corruption, and instability have hindered investment in education and social services, but debt relief in 2005 has opened up opportunities for social development. Experts emphasize the need for action to prevent a relapse. The World Health Organization declared Nigeria free of Ebola virus transmission in October 2014, highlighting the country's successful efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Nigeria's swift response included declaring a national public health emergency, creating an operations center, and implementing contact tracing and public education. Lessons learned from Nigeria's experience with polio eradication were applied to the Ebola outbreak response. Nigeria benefited from applied epidemiology experience in polio eradication efforts with support from the U.S. CDC and WHO. The country has made progress in reducing malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV prevalence among pregnant women. However, Nigeria still faces significant health sector challenges, including having the largest HIV-positive population in the world after South Africa. The upcoming elections are crucial for the country's political leaders, security forces, and people, especially after a history of flawed elections. The 2011 elections in Nigeria were viewed as more credible by international observers, but still faced protests and violence, indicating a lack of faith in the electoral process. Donors and advocacy groups have urged the government to improve electoral procedures and prosecute cases of fraud and violence to build public confidence. While the election commission has made efforts to enhance credibility, delays in voter card distribution and training of poll workers have raised concerns. The upcoming 2015 elections in Nigeria are facing challenges such as the distribution of voter cards, training of poll workers, and concerns about the internally displaced population's voting rights. The race between Jonathan and Buhari is expected to be close, with allegations of disenfranchisement potentially affecting the credibility of the results. The election will require a candidate to gain an absolute majority of votes and at least 25% in two-thirds of the states, with predictions of a tight race that could be decided by less than 1 million votes. Concerns about disenfranchisement and rigging are significant. Concerns about disenfranchisement and rigging are significant in the upcoming 2015 elections in Nigeria. The presidential candidates' commitment to the Abuja Accord will be tested, with high stakes around the state gubernatorial races. The opposition has urged calm in response to the poll delay, emphasizing the need to avoid violence that could further complicate security challenges in the country. Nigeria faces a \"crisis of credibility\" due to decades of corruption and electoral fraud, with low confidence in the electoral process among its citizens. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, only 13% of Nigerians have confidence in the electoral process. Independent efforts like the \"Quick Count\" by the Transition Monitoring Group may boost voter confidence. The legitimacy of the process and results will be crucial in preventing protests and violence. Nigeria's security forces, already strained by Boko Haram, face the challenge of securing 120,000 polling stations without appearing to interfere. Northern perceptions of security forces are low due to alleged abuses during Boko Haram operations and accusations of the PDP using security agencies. Boko Haram's increased activity and violence in Nigeria since 2010 have raised concerns about security for the upcoming elections. The group, with an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 fighters, has called for an uprising against secular authority and a war against Christianity. Allegations of military officials using insecurity to delay polls and keep Jonathan in office could further hinder security forces' ability to ensure stability during the elections. Boko Haram has shifted towards establishing an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria by force, targeting key infrastructure and seizing territory. Estimates suggest the Nigerian government may have lost significant portions of Borno state to the group. By early 2015, Boko Haram held approximately 30,000 square km of territory. Boko Haram held 30,000 square km of territory in mid-January 2015, roughly the size of Maryland. Recent military offensives by Nigeria and Chad have reclaimed some territory, but cooperation between the two countries is crucial. The group gained international attention in 2014 after abducting school girls from Chibok, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Boko Haram also deployed its first female suicide bomber and conducted an attack in southern Nigeria. Boko Haram has evolved its tactics and strategy in 2014, using women and children as weapons and launching large-scale attacks to take territory. They have targeted various locations in Nigeria, including markets, bus stations, schools, and government facilities. The group's deadliest attack in Baga in January 2015 was seen as retribution against communities cooperating with Nigerian forces. While most attacks are in northeast Nigeria, they occasionally strike beyond that area. Boko Haram, based in northeast Nigeria, has expanded its activities into neighboring countries like Cameroon. The group has shown support for Islamic State and Al Qaeda, with its leader pledging allegiance to Islamic State in 2015. Nigerian security forces' response to Boko Haram has been hindered by mismanagement and corruption. The Nigerian military faces challenges such as mismanagement, corruption, and inadequate resources to counter the insurgency. Despite a significant defense budget, soldiers, especially in the northeast, struggle with low morale and are outmatched by well-armed insurgents. Corruption within the army is deeply ingrained, with funds being siphoned off. Government responses to the Boko Haram threat have been criticized for being out of touch with reality, such as a failed cease-fire announcement in 2014. The Nigerian government's response to the Boko Haram threat has been met with skepticism due to a series of attacks and questionable actions. Security officials have been criticized for downplaying the threat posed by Boko Haram while overplaying their own success. The delay of the February 2015 election has raised doubts about the military's ability to make progress against Boko Haram and ensure a secure environment for the polls. Nigerian security officials claim they will have enough troops by March 28 to secure the elections, citing improved military cooperation with neighboring countries. Nigeria's national security advisor vows to dismantle all known Boko Haram camps during the election period. Boko Haram poses a threat to stability in northern Nigeria and neighboring countries. U.S. intelligence officials warn of a potential regional crisis if the group's territorial offensive continues. Boko Haram and its splinter faction, Ansaru, are designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the State Department. The United Nations Security Council condemned Boko Haram's activities and added them to the Al Qaeda sanctions list in 2014. The Council expressed concern over the escalating attacks and resulting humanitarian crisis, undermining peace in West and Central Africa. Efforts to create a multinational joint task force have been hindered by lack of cooperation and capacity among affected countries. Positive U.S.-Nigeria relations have been significant, especially in the context of Nigeria's role on the U.N. Security Council and global dialogues. Nigeria is an important U.S. trading partner and the second-largest beneficiary of U.S. private investment in Africa. The U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission was established in 2010 for strategic dialogue. The U.S.-Nigeria Binational Commission (BNC) was established in 2010 for strategic dialogue, covering topics like terrorism. Human rights issues, including gay rights, have been contentious. Nigeria is a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance in Africa, with the U.S. providing around $700 million annually. The State Department's FY2016 foreign aid request for Nigeria is over $607 million, focusing on democratic governance, agricultural productivity, education, health services, job creation, and clean supplies. The U.S. provides assistance to Nigeria in various areas such as education, health services, job creation, clean energy, and security force reform. Support for upcoming elections includes technical assistance, voter education, violence mitigation, and funding for observation missions. Nigeria benefits from programs like PEPFAR, PMI, Power Africa, and Feed the Future initiative. Private sector partnerships for exports, employment generation, trade, and energy are also encouraged. The Obama Administration's economic growth initiatives include trade, energy, and bilateral cooperation on global health issues. U.S. humanitarian assistance in response to emergencies in Nigeria has totaled almost $25 million in recent years. U.S. security assistance to Nigeria ranges from $15 million to $20 million annually. Nigeria acquires U.S. defense materiel through various channels. Nigeria has also played a significant role in peace efforts. Nigeria receives substantial U.S. security assistance for maritime security initiatives and counterterrorism cooperation, with improvements seen after the 2009 airliner bombing attempt. The Nigerian government has strengthened security systems in coordination with U.S. agencies. Nigeria has enhanced security measures, including full body scanners at international airports. The country receives $2 million annually in Anti-Terrorism Assistance and is part of the Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership. In 2014, Nigeria received $5 million for counter-terrorism efforts, including counter-IED training and civil-military relations. The U.S. deployed a team to support Nigerian efforts after the 2014 Chibok kidnapping. The Department of Defense (DOD) offered advisors to assist Nigerian forces in countering Boko Haram and sharing intelligence. A new $40 million Global Security Contingency Fund program aims to enhance regional capabilities to combat the threat, but the extent of Nigeria's benefit remains unclear. The United States seeks to balance security and human rights concerns in Nigeria. The United States has long sought to balance security and human rights concerns in Nigeria, with State Department reports highlighting serious human rights violations by Nigerian security forces since 1999. U.S. security assistance to Nigeria has been constrained by law and policy concerns, and the security relationship has been hampered by a lack of cooperation from Nigerian officials and systemic problems within its military. Security forces' abuses in countering Boko Haram have complicated efforts for greater cooperation, with roughly half of Nigerian army units implicated in security force abuses. The State Department has cleared over 1,000 members of the Nigerian security forces for U.S. assistance, despite concerns about reported abuses. U.S. officials stress the importance of the U.S.-Nigeria relationship but remain worried about the impact of these abuses on the military's credibility and support for the insurgency. Secretary of State John Kerry raised the issue with Nigerian officials during a visit to Ethiopia in 2013. Nigerian officials are frustrated with perceived U.S. interference in internal affairs and have turned to Russia and China for defense equipment. This has strained the relationship between U.S. defense officials and certain branches of the Nigerian armed forces. In 2014, Nigeria suspended advanced infantry training by U.S. Special Forces for an elite Nigerian army unit due to slow adaptation to new strategies. U.S. officials have urged Nigeria to take a more comprehensive and less brutal counterterrorism approach. The aim of DOD engagement is to convince Nigeria to change tactics in line with lessons from counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nigerian army has taken steps to develop civilian protection and human rights monitoring. Nigerian officials are working on a counterterrorism strategy that includes security, political, and economic solutions. However, the military faces challenges such as mass desertions and lack of proper training and resources. The Obama Administration has pledged support for Nigeria's efforts against Boko Haram, including assistance to the military. The USAID, State Department, and Broadcasting Board of Governors oversee programs to counter radicalization in Nigeria. The State Department and DOD are discussing how to support Nigeria's shift to a comprehensive strategy against Boko Haram. Secretary Kerry emphasized the need for credibility and transparency in cooperation during his visit. The postponement of elections may delay progress in counterterrorism cooperation. Several commentators, including former U.S. officials, have offered recommendations for improved counterterrorism cooperation with Nigeria after the elections. Suggestions range from expanded assistance to neighboring countries, direct U.S. military action against Boko Haram, and new approaches to enhance the effectiveness of the Nigerian army. Former DOD official Alice Friend notes challenges due to the government's focus on re-election efforts and regional biases in combatting Boko Haram. Low voter turnout in the northeast, exacerbated by population displacement, may further strain tensions. U.S. officials are working to improve counterterrorism coordination between Nigeria and its neighbors, including Cameroon, Niger, and Chad, to contain the impact of Boko Haram. Nigeria's neighbors have expressed concerns about Nigerian military leaks to Boko Haram and have been hesitant to cooperate. Chad has recently increased support to Cameroon and Niger in countering violent extremists. The U.S. is supporting regional efforts to combat Boko Haram, with troops deployed to Cameroon and Niger. Senior officials have discussed the crisis with French and British counterparts, endorsing a multinational military response at the African Union Summit. Authorization is being sought from the U.N. Security Council to establish a regional force. The U.S. is supporting regional efforts to combat Boko Haram by establishing a force with troops from Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. France is providing logistical support and aerial surveillance. The Obama Administration may seek congressional support for additional aid to the African-led operation. The upcoming months in Nigeria are crucial for its democracy and security. Concerns over election delays and potential fraud could lead to unrest. Former U.S. diplomats warn that these issues, along with the threat of Boko Haram, could make parts of the country \"ungovernable.\" The threat posed by Boko Haram in Nigeria is increasing, with no national consensus on how to deal with the insurgency. U.S. government leverage with the Nigerian government is limited, causing anxiety as elections approach. Experts warn of a possible \"less than perfect outcome\" and the prospect of election delays being unacceptable to the opposition and international donors. Jonathan may win a narrow victory with incumbency advantage, while voters in the northeast face challenges. Some opposition politicians in Nigeria threaten to form a parallel government if they believe the upcoming polls are rigged. Concerns arise that the election campaign may divert attention from counterinsurgency efforts against Boko Haram, potentially leading to post-election unrest. Limited Nigerian cooperation could hinder international efforts to combat the group's impact within the country."
