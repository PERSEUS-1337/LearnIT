    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 22358.4 of the Vehicle Code allows local authorities to adjust speed limits based on engineering and traffic surveys. If the 25 mph limit is deemed unsafe, the authority can set a limit of 20 or 15 mph. The new limit must be supported by a survey and appropriate signs must be posted. Local authorities can set a 15 mph speed limit in a residence district near a school, when children are present, regardless of the posted speed limit on the highway. In a residence district near a school, a 25 mph speed limit is enforced when children are present, within 1,000 feet of the school grounds, and a school warning sign indicates the reduced speed limit. The speed limit of 25 mph is enforced within 1,000 feet of school grounds when children are present, and a school warning sign indicates the reduced speed limit. This limit applies to highways meeting specific conditions, including two traffic lanes and a 30 mph speed limit before and after the school zone. The limit applies to all lanes in both directions, and local authorities must consider Section 627 when deciding to lower the speed limit. An ordinance or resolution must have appropriate signs erected on the highway and be approved by the Department of Transportation for the speed limit to be effective. School warning signs indicating speed limits of 15 mph or 25 mph can be placed at specific distances from school grounds. Local authorities are responsible for reimbursing the Department of Transportation for costs incurred. Local authorities can extend the maximum distance for establishing speed limits near schools up to one mile based on engineering and travel surveys. This allows for the placement of school warning signs at specific locations consistent with the survey findings. No reimbursement is required by this act for local agencies or school districts as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes or infractions."
