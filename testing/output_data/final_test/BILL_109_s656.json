The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2005\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to become lawful permanent residents, with certain conditions and exceptions. The \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 2005\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to become lawful permanent residents, with certain conditions and exceptions. An alien may be ineligible for adjustment of status if convicted of aggravated felonies or multiple crimes involving moral turpitude. States under the Immigration and Nationality Act may apply for adjustment of status without needing a separate motion if qualified. The Secretary of Homeland Security can cancel the order if the application is granted, or the order remains effective if the application is denied. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under the Immigration and Nationality Act must be nationals of Liberia and have been continuously present in the United States from January 1, 2005, through the date of application. This provision also applies to spouses, children, or unmarried sons or daughters of qualifying aliens. An alien can maintain continuous physical presence in the US even with absences totaling up to 180 days. The Secretary of Homeland Security can allow an alien facing deportation to seek a stay of removal by filing an application. The alien cannot be removed during exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings under certain circumstances. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize an alien applying for adjustment of status to work in the US during the application process, lasting up to 180 days. Upon approval of an alien's application for adjustment of status, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish a permanent residence record. Applicants will have the right to administrative review similar to other adjustment of status applicants or aliens in removal proceedings. The Secretary of Homeland Security's determination on adjusting an alien's status under section 240 is final and not subject to judicial review. If an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply, with definitions from that Act being used unless specified otherwise. The Secretary of Homeland Security's powers in enforcing immigration laws are not affected by this Act. Eligibility for permanent residence status does not prevent an alien from seeking other forms of legal status."
