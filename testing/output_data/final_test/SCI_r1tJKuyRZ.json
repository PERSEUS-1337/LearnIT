    "content": "The set autoencoder is a model for unsupervised representation learning for sets of elements, related to sequence-to-sequence models. Sets are permutation invariant, and the model considers this by using a content-based attention mechanism for input and a stable marriage algorithm for output alignment in the learning phase. The model trained on synthetic data sets of point clouds shows smooth changes with translations, preserves distances, and directly represents set size. It outperforms models not considering permutation invariance in classification tasks, especially with small training sets. Autoencoders are feed-forward neural networks used for dimensionality reduction and unsupervised pretraining. In this paper, the set autoencoder model is proposed to embed a set of elements in a fixed-size representation using unlabeled training data. The model utilizes a recurrent encoder to create a fixed-length embedding from a set of inputs and a recurrent decoder to generate output based on the embedding. The proposed set autoencoder model utilizes a recurrent encoder with an attention mechanism to create a fixed-length embedding from input elements. The model re-orders the output to align with the input using a stable matching algorithm, yielding a differentiable loss. The model can be trained without labeled data and experiments show the embedding is distance-preserving and smooth. The proposed set autoencoder model utilizes a recurrent encoder with an attention mechanism to create a fixed-length embedding from input elements. The embedding is smooth and distance-preserving, which can improve performance on supervised tasks. The paper is organized into sections discussing preliminaries, related work, details of the set autoencoder, experimental setup and results, and a conclusion. Sequence-to-sequence models, commonly used in tasks like automatic translation, speech recognition, and image captioning, consist of an encoder and a decoder, typically implemented as recurrent neural networks. The encoder processes input sequences to create a fixed-size embedding, which is then used by the decoder to generate output sequences. The encoder creates a fixed-size embedding of the input sequence, known as the thought vector. The decoder uses this thought vector to generate the output sequence token by token. The model is trained using backpropagation by calculating loss on the output sequence. Sequence autoencoder BID5 focuses on reconstructing the input as the output. Researchers have explored neural networks for sets of elements without using explicit set representations like bag-of-words-model BID12. The sequence-to-sequence architecture can be adapted to handle sets by using a content-based attention mechanism in the encoder. A pointer network as decoder can then be trained to sort input sets, outperforming models without a permutation-invariant encoder. Another approach introduces a permutation-equivariant layer in standard neural networks to tackle sets of fixed size, aiding in tasks like point cloud classification and set anomaly detection. These models can handle complex supervised tasks on sets of elements. The proposed set autoencoder aims to create a fixed-size, permutation-invariant embedding for input sets using unsupervised learning with unlabeled data. Unlike sequence autoencoders, set autoencoders require permutation invariance in both input and output sets, achieved through a recurrent encoder architecture with content-based attention. The proposed set autoencoder aims to achieve permutation invariance in the output set. Training the model requires presenting the desired outputs in some order, but all possible orders should be equally good. However, including all permutations in the data set is not feasible due to exponential growth. Therefore, a different approach is needed to handle random permutations in the outputs while maintaining effectiveness. The encoder in the proposed set autoencoder aims to create a permutation-invariant latent representation of the input set. It uses a content-based attention mechanism with an LSTM network to calculate cell and hidden states iteratively. The proposed set autoencoder uses a content-based attention mechanism with an LSTM network to calculate cell and hidden states iteratively, leading to a fixed-size embedding of the input set X. The attention mechanism calculates a scalar value based on the similarity between memory values and hidden states, resulting in a weighted combination of memory locations. The output of the set is defined as [c t , h t , r t ]. The set autoencoder uses an LSTM network to generate a fixed-size embedding [c t , h t , r t ]. The decoder LSTM calculates internal cell state \u0109 t and hidden state \u0125 t in each step. The decoder's output o t is calculated using a linear function f out. The set autoencoder utilizes an LSTM network for generating a fixed-size embedding. The decoder LSTM computes internal cell state and hidden state in each step, with the output calculated using a linear function. The function f out is the reverse of f inp, allowing encoder and decoder LSTMs to work on similar representations. The function f eos calculates the probability that an element is part of the set, determining when to stop sampling. To ensure the correct number of outputs and permutation invariance, a mapping layer is introduced between the decoder output and the loss. The mapping layer D reorders decoder outputs to match input set X, minimizing distance between elements. Autoencoder loss function L(x_i, d_i) decreases distance between matching elements by minimizing L. The mapping layer D reorders decoder outputs to minimize distance between elements. Cross-entropy loss is calculated for discrete elements, while the norm of vectors is used for real numbers. The whole set autoencoder is trained using gradient descent, with methods like the iterative closest points algorithm used for point cloud correspondence. The Gale-Shapely algorithm is used to find matching pairs of men and women in two sets, similar to the stable marriage problem. The algorithm has a run time complexity of O(n^2). Synthetic data sets of point clouds are used for unsupervised experiments, each consisting of sets of up to k items with d dimensions. In unsupervised experiments, data sets consist of up to k items with d dimensions. Random data sets have k values drawn from a uniform distribution. Shapes data sets include point clouds forming circles, squares, or crosses. Each set contains at least 10 points and has 500k examples in the training set. The set contains 500k examples in the training set, 100k examples in the validation set, and another 500k examples in the test set. Autoencoders are trained on each data set to minimize reconstruction error. Mean euclidean distance of reconstructed elements is shown for random and shapes data sets, with error increasing with dimensions and number of elements for random sets. Shapes data set has lower error and decreases with more elements. The error decreases with the number of elements in the set, suggesting that points become more evenly distributed along shapes' outlines, making reconstruction easier. Embeddings of the set autoencoder show strong correlation with set size, almost explicitly encoding it. The embeddings appear smooth and shifting a 2d-element in the plane results in observable changes in embeddings. The embeddings of a set autoencoder show strong correlation with set size, almost explicitly encoding it. Moving an element smoothly in the 2d-plane results in observable changes in embeddings, with discontinuities at the center region. Similar sets tend to yield similar embeddings, and the order of input sequences and output sets matters for model performance. The proposed set autoencoder is invariant to the order of elements in input and target sets. Despite this, the decoder tends to output elements in a specific order, as observed in sets with 8 random 2-dimensional elements. The decoder has learned to output elements in a particular order, with the first element typically in the center right area, the second in the lower-right region, and so on. The decoder in the set autoencoder outputs elements in a specific order, with the distribution of the first element becoming more peaked as the set size increases. This behavior may be influenced by the cosine similarity function used in the attention mechanism of the encoder. The decoder in the set autoencoder outputs elements in a specific order, with the distribution of the first element becoming more peaked as the set size increases. This behavior may be influenced by the cosine similarity function used in the attention mechanism of the encoder. The alignment of elements using the Gale-Shapely algorithm before calculating distances may cause discontinuity in the output. Classification and regression tasks are derived from the data sets, including binary classification tasks on random data sets. Sets are partitioned into different areas based on their dimensions, with specific criteria for defining class 1 sets. The set autoencoder defines two regression tasks on random data sets: maximum distance between elements and volume of bounding box. For shapes data, classification infers prototypical shape. Set-AE is compared to standard neural network for results. The study compares the set autoencoder (set-AE) to two vanilla sequence autoencoders (seq-AE) in terms of training methods and accuracy on the test set for the i-of-j-areas. The training methods include direct training, pretrained fashion (pre), and fine tuning setting (fine). The study compares the set autoencoder to vanilla sequence autoencoders in terms of training methods and accuracy on the test set for i-of-j-areas classification tasks. The set autoencoder outperforms other models for more difficult tasks, with pre and fine training modes leading to better results. Unsupervised pretraining of encoder weights helps in mastering classification tasks with a low number of labeled examples. The study compares set autoencoder to vanilla sequence autoencoders for classification tasks. Unsupervised pretraining is useful for larger training sets, but not for sequence elements. Results for regression and shapes classification tasks are shown in tables. Ordered sequence autoencoder performs well for small dimensions, but set-aware model is better for higher dimensions. Unsupervised pretraining helps set model in regression task for small dimensions. The study compares the set autoencoder to vanilla sequence autoencoders for classification tasks. The ordered sequence autoencoder with fine tuning outperforms other models, especially for tasks requiring knowledge of individual element locations. The set model struggles with permutation invariance. Direct training is more effective for tasks needing precise element subset locations. The failure of the set-aware model in shapes classification may be due to simple linear mapping functions. The set autoencoder is a model that reconstructs sets of elements using a fixed-size latent representation. It achieves permutation invariance with a content-based attention mechanism and stable marriage algorithm. Despite output permutation invariance, the model learns to output elements in a specific order. Experiments show it learns useful representations for tasks with few labeled examples. Future research directions include using non-linear functions for better capturing non-linear relationships. The set autoencoder uses non-linear functions for input and output to capture non-linear structures in 3D data sets like ShapeNet BID4. Changes to encoder/decoder structure and investigating alternative methods for alignment are needed. Research is required to understand when permutation invariance is beneficial, and unsupervised pretraining can be advantageous. The model architecture includes LSTM with peephole connections and simple linear functions for input and output mappings. For supervised experiments, a two-layer neural network is added on top of the embedding with ReLu activations. Different output neurons and loss functions are used based on the type of problem. Parameters are initialized using Xavier initialization and minibatches are used for efficiency. The encoder processes sets in a batch with varying sizes efficiently using minibatches. The number of LSTM cells is determined by input dimensionality and maximum set size. The embedding contains complete set information. Dimensionality of memory cells and read vectors is simplified for all models. The dimensionality of memory cells and read vectors is simplified for all models using Adam BID16 optimization. Training hyperparameters include minibatch training with a batch size of 100 and reducing the learning rate based on optimization objective. The learning rate decrease/early stopping mechanism is coupled to the missclassification error for classification tasks. The training hyperparameters include minibatch training with a batch size of 100 and reducing the learning rate based on optimization objective. The supervised learning scenarios have higher stalled-epochs-before-X values due to smaller training sets. Regularizing encoder weights may improve results for supervised training with fine tuning."
