The \"Comprehensive Long-Term Care Act of 1999\" expands Medicare services to include long-term care services for dependent individuals. An individual entitled to benefits under the Comprehensive Long-Term Care Act of 1999 can have payments made for long-term care services if they are dependent and services are provided according to a case management plan. Long-term care services include in-home care and extended care for chronically dependent individuals, with payment determined by a fee schedule established by the Secretary. The Comprehensive Long-Term Care Act of 1999 allows for payments for long-term care services for dependent individuals based on a fee schedule established by the Secretary. A dependent individual is defined as someone unable to perform certain daily activities without assistance due to physical or cognitive impairment. The Comprehensive Long-Term Care Act of 1999 allows payments for long-term care services for dependent individuals who require substantial direction or supervision to perform daily activities or remain in the community without causing harm. A chronically dependent individual is defined as someone unable to perform at least three activities of daily living without assistance. The term 'activities of daily living' include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring in and out of bed or chair. In-home care refers to the items and services needed for individuals with disabilities. In-home care includes nursing care, homemaker/home health aide services, personal care services, medical social services, and physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy provided in a person's residence. The in-home care services covered under this plan include physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy, speech-language pathology, medical supplies, durable medical equipment, patient and caregiver education, community care services, and other approved home-based items and services. Case management requirements involve requests for assessment for individuals entitled to benefits under this plan. The case management agency can assess if an individual is dependent or chronically dependent and create a written plan of care based on their needs. The agency is defined as a nonprofit or public organization. The agency certified by the Secretary must be experienced in conducting assessments, establishing case management plans for nursing facility services and in-home care, coordinating and reviewing the quality of services, capable of efficiently performing duties, and should not provide nursing facility services or in-home care. The Secretary allows case management agencies to contract out assessments and case management plans to nonprofit or public organizations not affiliated with entities providing nursing facility services or in-home care. The U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1) is amended to include new subsections (P) and (Q) regarding expenses for services described in section 1861(s)(2)(P).

The amendments made by this section apply to items and services furnished on or after January 1, 2000."
