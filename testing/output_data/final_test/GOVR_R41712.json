While the number of factory workers has decreased, production of technologically advanced goods has increased. Despite some factory closures, the overall manufacturing capacity of the U.S. economy remains strong, according to the Federal Reserve Board. However, recent data suggest that the future of the manufacturing sector may not be as promising. The manufacturing sector in the United States is facing challenges as domestic value added in factory output decreases, leading to concerns about \"hollowing out\" and the loss of high-skilled, high-wage jobs. Despite a large manufacturing sector, economic data may not fully capture this trend, raising questions about the future of advanced manufacturing in the country. The U.S. manufacturing sector has rebounded since the 2007-2009 recession, with output reaching high levels in 2013. However, concerns remain about the sector's health as the number of manufacturing sites and employment have decreased. Only 5.4% of the civilian labor force is now engaged in factory production work. Labor productivity in U.S. manufacturing has increased significantly since 2005, with a 16% rise in output per work hour. This trend is attributed to manufacturers shifting towards more efficient and technologically sophisticated production methods, resulting in minimal job creation despite expanding manufacturing output. Adjustments for improvements in the quality of high-technology products are crucial for accurately measuring economic indicators like gross domestic product and labor productivity. Government statistical agencies make technical adjustments to account for the rapid increase in capabilities of products like computers. This raises questions about whether reported improvements in manufacturing are real changes or just the result of statistical adjustments. The manufacturing sector in the U.S. is facing challenges despite government output and productivity measures indicating resilience. Recent cyclical upturns have not led to increased jobs in manufacturing, with factory output rising significantly without a corresponding increase in employment. This trend has persisted since the 2007-2009 recession, raising concerns about the sector's overall health. The value added by U.S. manufacturing establishments is declining as a share of factory shipments, leading to concerns about the sector's health. Value added is a measure of the contribution of U.S. workers to the final products, with components including employees' pay, depreciation, taxes, and returns to business owners. Two metrics, including the growth rate of \"real\" value added, are used to assess value added. The ratio of value added to shipments in manufacturing may not be meaningful for individual firms due to production processes, but it could be significant at the industry or sector level. Since 2006, the ratio of value added to shipments in U.S. manufacturing has remained below 44.8%, indicating potential challenges such as diminished profitability, rising input costs, and increased use of imported parts. This decline began in 2003 and continued through 2011, with the ratio reaching 41.7%, well below the average of the past two decades. The Census Bureau reported a value-added ratio of 41.7% in 2011, below the average of the past two decades. BEA's data showed a similar trend, with a ratio of 31.95% in 2011 and 32.5% in the first half of 2012, below the 34.3% average since 1987. Discrepancies in measurement methods, such as accounting for purchased services, complicate interpretation and lead to controversy among economists. The Census Bureau's measurement of value added is typically 9 to 12 percentage points higher than the BEA's due to differences in how services purchased by manufacturers are treated. Research and development costs are included in value added, sparking debate on whether they should be considered as investment instead. This accounting change could have slightly increased the annual growth rate of value added in private industry between 1995 and 2007. The BEA will start treating corporate research and development spending as investment in 2013, which could have caused growth in high-tech sectors like pharmaceutical, instrument, and aerospace manufacturing to be higher than official statistics show. Intellectual property exports are also a significant factor, with U.S. companies conducting research and development domestically and then using or licensing the resulting intellectual property abroad. However, the measurement of value added can be unclear if foreign-made products are imported back into the U.S. for incorporation into other goods. The complexities of U.S. manufacturing value added may not be accurately reflected in data due to factors like offshoring of assembly work and the licensing of intellectual property within multinational companies. Some companies, like Apple Inc., focus on design, distribution, or service rather than physical production, leading to a trend of factoryless manufacturing. The rise of \"factoryless manufacturers\" who focus on design, distribution, or service rather than physical production may lead to inaccuracies in data on U.S. manufacturing value added. New statistical procedures may change the treatment of outsourcing by basing measurement of goods exports and imports on transfer of ownership. The value of assembly work in Mexico would count as a U.S. import of manufacturing services rather than goods. Statistical agencies are evaluating measuring trade this way. Reclassifying \"factoryless manufacturing\" as manufacturing activity would increase total manufacturing shipments and U.S. value added. Import price indexes are crucial for measuring value added in manufacturing, with around 40% of imports being business inputs. Government statistics may understate input price declines if manufacturers switch from domestic to foreign inputs quickly. Manufacturers shifting to cheaper foreign inputs may lead to overestimation of U.S. manufacturing output and productivity. This could result in undervaluing the use of imported components in U.S. factories, affecting the reported value added in the manufacturing sector. The impact of these measurement issues on value added is uncertain, as they may either increase or decrease it relative to shipments, and alter the growth rate of value added in manufacturing. The globalization of supply chains in manufacturing is leading to a decline in the share of domestic value added in certain industries. Businesses are now focusing on using global supply chains to achieve economies of scale by sourcing inputs from different countries. This trend is evident in the increased use of imported intermediate inputs by manufacturers, with 24% of inputs being imported in the United States in 1998. The trend of increased reliance on international supply chains is evident in the United States, with 34% of intermediate inputs being imported in 2006. This shift has led to a decline in the use of domestic components and materials, while the use of imported ones has increased. Globally, there has been a decrease in the value added content of exports since 1992. The value added content of exports has decreased globally since 1992. In the United States, domestic value added in exports remains relatively high compared to other major trading nations, ranking third among 40 countries in 2009. The value of imported services in foreign value added is important to consider, along with imported components and raw materials. Uncertainty exists in determining the extent of value added in inputs imported into the United States from other countries. A study on the automotive seat industry highlights the complexity of analyzing the impact of global supply chains on national economies. U.S. imports of automobile seats have decreased since 1994, raising questions about the effects of these changes. Imports of automobile seats in the U.S. have declined since 1994, indicating increased use of U.S. content. However, detailed analysis reveals a rise in imports of seat parts, mainly from Mexico, such as fabrics and temperature-control devices. These imports reduce measured U.S. content in seats and vehicles. The value of U.S. intellectual property in these imported components may impact the reported decline in domestic content. Data on U.S. content in imported products is relatively new and changes over time are not easily tracked. The United States is similar to other major manufacturing countries in the share of import value attributed to domestic production. China's exports of \"advanced technology products\" to the U.S. increased due to processing foreign components in Chinese factories owned by foreign investors. U.S. exports to China were lower than Chinese exports to the U.S. A recent study found that U.S. exports to China consist of high-end equipment and devices, while Chinese exports to the U.S. are mainly low-end products. The study may not fully capture trade within global supply chains, as imported inputs into U.S. manufacturing are often developed domestically. In 2012, the U.S. exported $43 billion of industrial process fees compared to $23 billion of imports. In 2012, the U.S. exported $43 billion of industrial process fees compared to $23 billion of imports. 73% of reported exports of industrial process royalties and fees in 2012 were from sales by a U.S. company to an affiliated company abroad. U.S. manufacturers often assign licenses to their affiliates abroad, resulting in a one-time U.S. export of industrial process. The flow of funds related to intellectual property used in manufacturing has major implications for the measurement of value added. For example, an industrial process developed by a U.S. manufacturing firm may be licensed to its Irish affiliate, and then further licensed to a Chinese manufacturer. This results in the Chinese manufacturer making payments to Ireland instead of the United States, impacting how U.S.-origin value added is captured in international trade statistics. The flow of funds related to intellectual property used in manufacturing has implications for measuring value added. For example, a U.S. manufacturing firm may license an industrial process to its Irish affiliate, which then licenses it to a Chinese manufacturer. This can result in payments going to Ireland instead of the United States, affecting how U.S.-origin value added is reflected in trade statistics. Additionally, services exports connected to manufacturing may not be fully captured in U.S. data, with approximately $94 billion of U.S. exports in 2011 likely incorporating U.S.-origin value into foreign-made products. Increased use of imported components in some U.S. manufacturing industries may lead to higher value added than officially reported. Industries like pharmaceuticals and medical instruments show declining ratios of domestic value added to shipments. These industries are vulnerable to mismeasurement issues due to imported inputs. The report highlights concerns about U.S. manufacturers being dependent on foreign inputs, especially in industries like pharmaceuticals and medical instruments. Traditional views of manufacturing are outdated as modern production processes involve more than just physical production activities. Many countries rely even more on foreign value added than the United States in international trade. The manufacturing process has shifted towards activities like design, product development, marketing, and distribution, rather than physical production. Global supply chains have both positive and negative effects on the U.S. economy, contributing to lower consumer prices but also raising concerns about dependence on foreign inputs. This shift is not limited to the United States and has implications for job creation within the country. The growth of manufactured imports from China has led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, impacting some workers and communities. There is debate on the broader impact on the U.S. labor market, with some studies suggesting that trade drives out low-tech firms and accelerates technical change. The growth of manufactured imports from China has led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, impacting some workers and communities. Trade with low-wage countries increases the rate of technological change, contradicting the belief that declining factory employment is solely due to technology. This transformation in manufacturing poses challenges for public policies aimed at the sector. The Small Business Administration's 504/CDC Loan Guaranty Program aims to help manufacturers upgrade technology and compete globally. The effectiveness of policies promoting factory production in the US, such as tax incentives and \"Buy American\" rules, is uncertain due to shifts in manufacturing value added and the decoupling of employment and economic growth from production. The changes described in this report question the adequacy of government statistics, particularly in capturing the evolving nature of manufacturing and services. Despite efforts to improve data collection, existing data may not fully reflect the interconnectedness of manufacturing and services in the economy."
