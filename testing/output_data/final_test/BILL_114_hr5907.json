    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Mortgage Lender Regulatory Act of 2016\". It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that responsible community mortgage lenders were not responsible for the recent mortgage crisis, provide valuable services to consumers, do not pose substantial risks, and are subject to governmental oversight. Responsible community mortgage lenders are overseen by various governmental authorities and nongovernmental actors to ensure safe and transparent business practices. They are burdened by increasing regulations despite not being responsible for the recent mortgage crisis. Responsible community mortgage lenders seek relief from Dodd-Frank regulations to prevent market consolidation and preserve competition. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should prioritize resources for examinations by creating exclusions for smaller, responsible mortgage lenders to prevent market consolidation and preserve competition. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term 'community mortgage lender' is defined as a lender with assets of less than $2,000,000,000 and who originated fewer than 25,000 mortgage loans or a gross mortgage loan origination volume of less than $5,000,000,000 in the preceding calendar year. The term 'community mortgage lender' is defined as a lender with assets of less than $2,000,000,000 and who originated fewer than 25,000 mortgage loans or a gross mortgage loan origination volume of less than $5,000,000,000 in the preceding calendar year. This lender must also have mortgage loan originations in the preceding three calendar years that consisted of 95 percent qualified mortgages. The term 'responsible community mortgage lender' refers to a lender with a clean record in mortgage loan originations for the past two years or since they started, if less than two years. A 'mortgage loan' is defined as a loan secured by a first lien on a 1-4 unit family residence. The term 'qualified mortgage' includes loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Agriculture. During calendar year 2016, the computation of mortgage loan originations under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 will be based on the preceding two calendar years instead of three. SEC. 4. PRIORITIZATION OF BUREAU EXAMINATION AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY RESOURCES. Amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to include a new section regarding exclusion for responsible community mortgage lenders. The Bureau may not audit or investigate responsible community mortgage lenders unless requested by specific agencies or regulators. The section does not modify any Federal or State laws or affect the authority of any other agencies. SEC. 5. STREAMLINED VENDOR AUDITS. The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 is further amended by inserting section 1031B regarding vendor audit requirements for responsible community mortgage lenders. The Bureau and Federal banking agencies can require audits of vendors for community mortgage lenders only with reasonable cause to suspect violations of the law. Additionally, a clerical amendment adds section 1031B for vendor audit requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act."
