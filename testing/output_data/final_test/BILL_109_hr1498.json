The Chinese Currency Act of 2005 includes findings that highlight the importance of a vibrant manufacturing base for the economy and national security of the United States. It also addresses China's currency manipulation practices, specifically pegging the yuan to the US dollar at a fixed rate since 1994. The undervaluation of the renminbi by the People's Republic of China, estimated at 40 percent or more, is evidenced by trade surpluses, foreign-direct investment, and growing foreign-currency reserves. This undervaluation acts as a subsidy for Chinese exports and a barrier against imports, harming the US manufacturing industry despite China's international legal obligations against such practices. The GATT 1994, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and IMF's Articles of Agreement proscribe subsidization of exports and exchange-rate manipulation.
