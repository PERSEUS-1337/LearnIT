    "content": "The \"Debt Reduction Priority Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) with $700 billion to purchase toxic assets from banks. The Department of Treasury changed the program's purpose to inject capital into financial institutions through the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). Despite spending $250 billion, lending did not increase as intended. The Department of Treasury is facing challenges with the expenditure of $250 billion in TARP funds. Recipients of CPP funds are now subject to additional restrictions, with some banks wanting to return the funds. The Treasury should not decide unilaterally on the use of returned funds, and Congress should have a say in future spending decisions. The Secretary of the Treasury must deposit any repayments or interest on financial assistance received under TARP into the Public Debt Reduction Payment Account within 30 days. Additionally, a Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is to be established. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay off government obligations held by the public. Amounts in the account can only be used for this purpose and any obligation paid with these funds must be canceled and retired. Amounts received under section 137 of the law must be deposited into the account. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay off government obligations held by the public. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are required to promptly carry out this section in accordance with sound debt management policies. Reducing the debt pursuant to this section shall not interfere with the debt management policies or goals of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account, established to pay off government obligations, will not affect debt management policies. The account's receipts and disbursements are excluded from budget calculations. SEC. 7. Removing Public Debt Reduction Payment Account from Budget Pronouncements. The Public Debt Reduction Payment Account shall be excluded from budget statements and publications by government agencies. Its outlays and receipts will be presented separately in budget documents."
