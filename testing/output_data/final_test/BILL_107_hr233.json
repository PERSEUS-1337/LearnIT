    "content": "The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 2001\" aims to address the issue of unintentional deaths related to firearms among children. Statistics show that ignorance and carelessness are major causes of firearms accidents, with a significant number of accidents involving individuals not following basic safety rules. To reduce these incidents, it is crucial to practice and enforce firearms safety rules. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 2001\" defines a locking device as a mechanism on a firearm that prevents discharge without the proper key or combination. This aims to reduce unintentional deaths related to firearms among children by enforcing safety measures. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 2001\" mandates that licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers must provide a locking device and a warning with any handgun sale to prevent unauthorized use. The packaging of handguns should include a warning about responsible firearm storage, emphasizing the need to store them unloaded, locked, separate from ammunition, and inaccessible to children to avoid legal consequences. Exceptions to this rule apply to specific entities like the United States government or its agencies. The text discusses civil penalties related to locking devices and warnings for firearms. It mentions amendments to Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, regarding penalties for not complying with firearm storage regulations. The text discusses penalties for violations of firearm locking device regulations, including license suspension, revocation, and civil penalties up to $10,000 for each violation by a licensee. Actions taken by the Secretary can only be reviewed as provided in section 923(f). The availability of any other administrative authority with respect to the conduct of a licensee shall not be affected. SEC. 201. REGULATION OF TRIGGER LOCK DEVICES. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to regulate trigger lock devices to prevent accidental handgun discharges. Regulations must establish a minimum safety standard for these devices, considering non-detachable options. The standard aims to ensure quality and construction to prevent access by children. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue a standard within 12 months to prevent children under 18 from operating a handgun and ensure that the device cannot be removed without specific access methods. The standard will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 202. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of trigger lock devices that violate regulations. They can also require manufacturers and dealers to provide notice of associated risks and how to mitigate them. The Secretary can order dealers to bring devices into compliance, repair, replace, refund, recall, or submit a plan for action. Compliance is verified through inspections. The Secretary can conduct inspections to ensure compliance with regulations for trigger lock devices, including entering manufacturing and storage facilities and inspecting conveyances used for transportation. SEC. 203. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary may assess civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations of this title, revoke federal firearms licenses for violations of the Child Safety Lock and Community Protection Act, and impose criminal penalties on those who knowingly violate regulations regarding trigger lock devices.
