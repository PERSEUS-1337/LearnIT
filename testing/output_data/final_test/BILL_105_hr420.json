    "content": "The \"Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1997\" is the short title of the Act. Any reference to amending or repealing a section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is considered to be made to that specific section. The Congress recognizes the importance of encouraging investments in small business venture capital stock due to the risks and benefits involved. The exclusion of gain on such stock serves as a vital incentive for individuals and corporations to invest in it. Tax incentives for capital assets should be complemented with effective incentives for small business venture capital stock investments. Modifications to the exclusion of gain on certain small business stock are proposed. The amendment increases the exclusion percentage from 50% to 75% and reduces the holding period from 5 years to 3 years for certain small business stock. Additionally, the exclusion is now available to corporations. The exclusion percentage for small business stock has been increased to 75% and the holding period reduced to 3 years. The exclusion is now also available to corporations, with certain restrictions on stock held within controlled groups. Additionally, the minimum tax preference has been repealed. The exclusion percentage for small business stock has been increased to 75% and the holding period reduced to 3 years. The exclusion is now also available to corporations, with restrictions on stock held within controlled groups. The stock of larger businesses eligible for exclusion has a new inflation adjustment of the asset limitation, increasing the amount to $100,000,000. The exclusion percentage for small business stock has been increased to 75% with a 3-year holding period. Amendments include rounding amounts to the nearest $10,000 and repealing the per-issuer limitation in Section 1202. Other modifications involve extending the holding period to 5 years, waiving redemption rules for business purposes, and disregarding stock purchases by the issuing corporation. The amendments to Section 1202 involve disregarding stock purchases by the issuing corporation if there was a business purpose and not to avoid limitations. Effective dates apply to stock issued after specific dates mentioned in the legislation. The amendments made by subsections (b), (c), and (e) of the Act apply to qualified stock issued after August 10, 1993, if the taxpayer elects to apply them. Qualified stock refers to stock held by the taxpayer on the enactment date that was not initially qualified small business stock but would be if the amendments applied. The amendments apply to qualified stock issued after August 10, 1993. Any qualified stock under the election shall be treated as sold and reacquired on the enactment date for its fair market value. This treatment does not affect the stock's qualification as small business stock. Any resulting gain is also addressed. Any gain from subparagraph (A) is recognized on the enactment date, regardless of the Internal Revenue Code provisions. Loss from subparagraph (A) is not allowed. An election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary, specifying the stock, and once made, it is irrevocable. SEC. 1045 allows for the rollover of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock to another qualified small business stock. SEC. 1045 allows for the nonrecognition of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock, with eligible gain only recognized if the amount realized exceeds the cost of stock purchased within a 60-day period. This section does not apply to gain treated as ordinary income. Section 1202(c) defines eligible gain as any gain from the sale of qualified small business stock held for over 3 years. It also discusses basis adjustments for determining gain or loss on such stock purchased within a 60-day period. Special rules for treatment of replacement stock are also outlined. For purposes of this chapter, gain from the disposition of replacement qualified small business stock held more than 3 years is treated as gain from qualified small business stock sale. If replacement stock is sold before 3 years, the gain is eligible for deferral. The term 'replacement qualified small business stock' is defined in this subsection. For tax purposes, gain from selling replacement qualified small business stock held over 3 years is treated as gain from qualified small business stock sale. Amendments were made to section 1016(a)(23) and the table of sections for part III of subchapter O of chapter 1. The amendments allow for the rollover of gain from qualified small business stock to another qualified small business stock. Effective for stock sold or exchanged after the enactment of this Act."
