    "content": "The \"Education for Democracy Act\" is an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, focusing on civic education. It includes a section on findings related to this act. The Congress finds that college freshmen in 1997 showed high levels of disengagement academically and politically, with the lowest interest in politics in 20 years. Additionally, US secondary school students had low interest in politics and economics in a 1999 survey. According to a survey by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, only 59 percent of Americans believe that schools play a significant role in developing good citizenship. Many teachers lack expertise in the subjects they teach, with half of secondary school history students being taught by teachers without a history background. Secondary school students also scored poorly on a national test of economic knowledge in 1999. The National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that students only have a superficial understanding of the material. Progress showed that students lack a deep understanding of civics, which is crucial for citizenship competencies and political stability. International education exchange programs have been proven to enhance educational quality in the US and other democracies. A survey revealed that over three quarters of Americans have limited knowledge of the US Constitution. The US Constitution is often seen as a historical document rather than a living one that influences current events. The purpose of this part is to improve civics and government education by educating students about the history and principles of the US Constitution, foster civic competence and responsibility, and enhance civic and economic education through exchange programs with other democratic nations. The Secretary has the authority to award grants and contracts for civic and economic education activities. The grants are awarded in consultation with the Secretary of State.
