    "content": "The \"Vessel Conveyance Act\" allows for the conveyance of United States vessels for public purposes. The conveyance of a US Government vessel to an eligible entity for public purposes is subject to conditions set by the Secretary to ensure proper maintenance and use. This includes restrictions on selling or conducting commercial activities without approval. The conveyance of a US Government vessel to an eligible entity includes a condition that prohibits commercial activities without approval. The vessel may revert to the United States if it ceases to serve its intended public purpose. The conveyance of a US Government vessel to an eligible entity includes conditions such as maintaining the vessel as agreed, not selling or engaging in commercial activities without approval. Failure to comply may result in the vessel reverting to the United States. The Secretary must provide records for each vessel conveyed, including registration and terms, to the Administrator. The Administrator will monitor the vessel's use for at least 5 years to ensure compliance with the conveyance purpose. The Administrator will create and maintain records of monitoring activities for vessels conveyed, including registration and terms. The Secretary may provide cost estimates for maintaining and operating conveyed vessels to eligible entities. Additionally, the Secretary may issue guidance on permissible commercial activities related to the conveyed vessels. The Secretary may approve services related to the purposes of conveyed vessels. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of Transportation will establish a working group with representatives from the Maritime Administration, Coast Guard, and U.S. Navy to review and recommend conditions for conveying U.S. vessels to eligible entities. The Secretary may involve senior representatives from other federal departments or agencies. Civil enforcement of conveyance conditions is also addressed. The Secretary may impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for each violation on eligible entities failing to comply with vessel conveyance terms. The penalties can be compromised, modified, or remitted by the Secretary without Attorney General involvement. The Secretary has the authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents, administer oaths, and enforce compliance through district courts in case of contempt or refusal to obey subpoenas. Witnesses are entitled to fees and mileage as in federal courts. The court may punish contempt under this Act. District courts have jurisdiction over actions related to conveyed vessels. American Samoa is included in the jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States for the District of Hawaii. Failure to pay a civil penalty may result in collection after a final order. If a civil penalty remains unpaid after final judgment, the Attorney General can pursue collection with interest. The validity of the penalty cannot be challenged. Failure to pay on time incurs additional fees, including attorney's fees, costs, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty. Unpaid penalties can be pursued by the Attorney General with interest. Process serving can occur in any district where the defendant is located, resides, does business, or has an appointed agent. Civil cases can also be served outside the US according to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.
