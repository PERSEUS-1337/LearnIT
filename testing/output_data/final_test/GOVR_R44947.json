    "content": "Under Article III of the Constitution, Congress has the power to establish federal courts below the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created federal district and circuit courts, including the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) in 1789. The ATS was modified in 1873 and 1911 before its current version in 1948. The ATS aims to provide foreign plaintiffs a remedy for international law violations to maintain harmony in international relations. During the early years of the Republic, the United States struggled to meet its foreign affairs obligations under the Articles of Confederation. Only Connecticut passed legislation to address violations of international law, despite an affirmative obligation for the US to redress such violations. The Framers and the First Congress provided jurisdiction to federal courts in various circumstances related to foreign relations concerns, including suits involving foreign diplomats, admiralty and maritime cases, and disputes between U.S. citizens and citizens of foreign nations. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was included to allow federal courts to hear claims for violations of international law that could impact U.S. foreign relations. In the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats highlighted the potential for conflict. In the 1780s, a French diplomat was assaulted by Julien de Longchamps in Philadelphia, leading to a conflict in international relations under the Articles of Confederation. Longchamps was convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by a Pennsylvania court, but Pennsylvania officials refused to deliver him to French authorities, causing tension with the Confederation Congress. French requests to deliver Longchamps to French authorities led to tensions with the Confederation Congress. The federal government apologized to Marbois for its limited ability to provide redress. Similar incidents occurred when a New York constable arrested a Dutch Ambassador's servant, highlighting the U.S. government's inability to adjudicate such matters. These incidents were not minor diplomatic quarrels and showcased the challenges faced by the United States in providing judicial relief to foreign officials. Assaults on ambassadors during the founding era were considered just causes of war if not redressed. The ATS was interpreted by the Supreme Court as a response to the federal government's inability to protect the rights of foreign diplomats. Despite its original purpose, the ATS was rarely used for federal jurisdiction for the first 190 years. Only two reported cases successfully invoked the ATS for jurisdiction between 1789 and 1980. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for federal jurisdiction for the first 190 years until it gained prominence in 1980 with the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case involving Paraguayan citizens suing the former Inspector General. The ATS was described as an old and little-used section, with only two reported cases invoking it between 1789 and 1980. In the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case, Paraguayan citizens sued the former Inspector General for kidnapping, torturing, and killing a relative. The defendant, living in New York on an expired visa, was accused of violating international law by the Second Circuit court. The Fil\u00e1rtiga court's decision on the ATS established that human rights violations by a foreign official against a citizen can be actionable under international law. This landmark case led to an increase in civil claims for human rights abuses in U.S. federal courts, even if the events occurred outside the country. However, subsequent court decisions placed limits on ATS jurisdiction, such as the Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic case raising conceptual questions about the ATS. In Tel-Oren, the D.C. Circuit questioned whether the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) solely provides jurisdiction or also creates a cause of action for plaintiffs. The case involved Israeli citizens suing the Palestinian Liberation Organization for a terrorist attack. The court unanimously dismissed the case without fully resolving the issue. In Tel-Oren, the D.C. Circuit judges issued separate opinions for dismissing the case. Judge Bork argued that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not create a cause of action for damages, while Judge Edwards believed the ATS does create a statutory cause of action but still concurred in the dismissal due to lack of official state action and insufficient recognition of terrorism as a violation of international law. Judge Robb found the case raised nonjusticiable political questions. In Tel-Oren, Judge Bork and Judge Edwards disagreed over the cause-of-action question regarding the ATS. The broader doctrinal disagreement between them eventually led to the landmark Supreme Court decision in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. Congress later passed the Torture Victim Protection Act in 1992, creating a civil cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing. The TVPA was designed to establish a basis for causes of action recognized in Fil\u00e1rtiga and respond to Judge Bork's argument in Tel-Oren. It differs from the ATS as it creates a civil cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing, while the ATS only refers to federal court jurisdiction. The TVPA allows actions by and against individuals, including U.S. and foreign nationals but not corporations. It also imposes limitations on civil actions not found in the ATS, such as requiring plaintiffs to exhaust all options. The TVPA requires plaintiffs to exhaust all remedies in the place where the claim occurred. The relationship between the TVPA and the ATS is debated in courts, with some viewing the TVPA as supplementing the ATS while others see it as occupying the field. The TVPA provides a cause of action for claims that were argued under the ATS. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question regarding the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The case involved a Mexican doctor accused of participating in the torture and murder of a DEA agent. The DEA hired Mexican nationals to apprehend the doctor and bring him to the US for trial, leading to legal challenges based on \"outrageous governmental conduct\" and extradition treaty violations. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question regarding the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) in a case involving a Mexican doctor accused of participating in the torture and murder of a DEA agent. The court rejected arguments based on \"outrageous governmental conduct\" and extradition treaty violations, leading to a civil case where ATS claims were asserted against the Mexican nationals responsible for the doctor's abduction. The Sosa Court agreed that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action, originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act. While not intended to create statutory causes of action, the Court held that a \"modest number of international law violations\" would have been actionable under the ATS without the need for a separate statute. Sosa held that the ATS allows federal courts to recognize a narrow set of causes of action as judicially developed common law, based on violations of the law of nations. This includes offenses like violations of safe conducts, infringement on the rights of ambassadors, and piracy, but is not limited to these claims. Federal courts can also recognize common law claims for violations of the present-day law of nations under the ATS, as long as they meet certain limitations. The ATS allows federal courts to recognize limited causes of action based on violations of the law of nations. Claims must be defined by international norms accepted worldwide and show specificity comparable to 18th-century paradigms. Sosa emphasized judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action. The Court dismissed Alvarez's claim for arbitrary arrest and detention as it did not meet the newly described requirements for an ATS claim. The Supreme Court has since interpreted Sosa to establish a two-step framework for addressing ATS liability questions. The ATS allows federal courts to recognize limited causes of action based on violations of the law of nations. Sosa emphasized judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action. The Supreme Court established a two-step framework for addressing ATS liability questions, involving determining the violation of specific international law norms and exercising judicial discretion. Despite warnings of caution, the use of ATS for human rights abuses continued, but slowed after restrictions were recognized in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum in 2013. The ATS suit against Dutch, British, and Nigerian oil companies for human rights abuses in Nigeria was dismissed by the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court initially focused on corporate liability but later questioned the jurisdiction of the ATS for violations outside the US. The Kiobel Court ruled that the ATS does not apply to conduct solely in a foreign sovereign's territory. The ATS does not reach conduct that occurred entirely in a foreign nation, following the \"presumption against extraterritoriality\" to avoid clashes between U.S. and foreign law. Federal courts presume statutes do not apply to claims in foreign territory unless there is a clear indication of extraterritorial application. The Kiobel Court found no evidence that the First Congress intended the ATS to have extraterritorial reach, as it was designed to avoid diplomatic strife. The Kiobel Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), barring Nigerian plaintiffs' claims for violations of the law of nations in Nigerian territory. The Court suggested that the presumption might be displaced if future ATS cases \"touch and concern\" the United States with sufficient force. It emphasized that mere corporate presence in the U.S. does not automatically trigger extraterritorial application. The Kiobel Court's decision on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) emphasized that future cases must \"touch and concern\" the United States to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito expressed the need for further clarification on how litigants can satisfy this requirement. Justice Alito's \"broader standard\" requires that for a claim to \"touch and concern\" the United States, the conduct violating the law of nations must occur domestically. Justice Breyer, along with Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, concurred in dismissing the case but disagreed with the reasoning, arguing that the ATS should not be limited by the presumption against extraterritoriality. Instead, they suggested limiting ATS jurisdiction to cases involving certain factors like the alleged tort occurring on American soil. Justice Breyer's test for ATS jurisdiction includes factors such as the alleged tort occurring on American soil, the defendant being an American national, or the defendant's conduct substantially affecting an important American national interest. This test aims to prevent the US from becoming a safe harbor for violators of international norms. In the case of Kiobel, Justice Breyer agreed that there were not enough ties to the US for ATS jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has been seen as limiting the scope of ATS jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has significantly limited the ATS as a tool for addressing human rights abuses in U.S. courts. It precludes \"foreign cubed\" cases but cases with a connection to the U.S. are less easily resolved. Different interpretative frameworks have been adopted for the \"touch and concern\" test, creating a split among the circuits. Five circuits have considered this test, with the Fifth and Second Circuits adopting a bright-line approach similar to Justice Alito's concurrence in Kiobel. The Fourth Circuit has a flexible approach to the \"touch and concern\" test under the ATS, requiring extensive U.S. contacts and a strong connection to the U.S. for a case to proceed, even allowing a case involving American employees of a U.S. corporation to move forward. The Eleventh Circuit has held that an ATS claim must have a U.S. focus and relevant conduct in the United States to satisfy the \"touch and concern test.\" Factors like defendants' citizenship and U.S. national interests are considered, but alone may not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Ninth Circuit also considers a defendant's U.S. citizenship as a factor in establishing a connection to the United States for an ATS claim. The Eleventh Circuit requires an ATS claim to have a U.S. focus and relevant conduct in the United States. The Ninth Circuit also considers a defendant's U.S. citizenship in establishing a connection to the United States for an ATS claim. Disparity among circuits arises from their interpretation of Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., a pre-Kiobel Supreme Court decision on the extraterritorial application of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality defeated the plaintiffs' claim in Morrison because the focus of Section 10(b) is on the purchase and sale of securities, which occurred in Australia. The application of Morrison's \"focus\" analysis in ATS cases may complicate plaintiffs' efforts to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. Courts have varied opinions on whether Morrison applies to the ATS. The Ninth and Fourth Circuits believe Morrison should not control in ATS cases, while the Fifth and Second Circuits follow Morrison's analysis. The Eleventh Circuit takes a hybrid approach, requiring a U.S. focus and relevant conduct in the United States for an ATS claim. The Eleventh Circuit adopted a hybrid approach merging Kiobel's standards with Morrison's focus test. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community may help resolve conflicts regarding extraterritoriality. The Court explained a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues, focusing on whether the statute applies extraterritorially and if the case involves a domestic application of the statute. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco clarified a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues under the ATS. While some courts have adopted Morrison's \"focus\" test, others have held that it does not apply to the ATS. The impact of RJR Nabisco on lower courts' interpretive frameworks for extraterritoriality under the ATS remains uncertain. The Fifth Circuit's interpretation of RJR Nabisco in ATS cases may lead to a rule that plaintiffs must show conduct violating the law of nations occurred in the US. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC may further limit extraterritorial ATS claims, especially regarding corporate liability. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC involved claims by foreign nationals injured by terrorist groups in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank aided terrorist organizations, but the Court ultimately decided the case on extraterritoriality grounds. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank facilitated terrorist actions by maintaining accounts for organizations and identifying victims' families for compensation. The court dismissed the ATS claims due to lack of corporate liability, despite growing consensus among circuits allowing for it. Despite a growing consensus among circuits allowing for corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the Supreme Court in Jesner v. Arab Bank declined to overturn its prior precedent. The Court ruled that foreign corporations are not subject to liability under the ATS, but left open the possibility for U.S. corporations to face claims. Justice Kennedy, writing for the majority, placed the decision in the context of the two-part inquiry from Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain for evaluating violations of international norms under the ATS. In Jesner v. Arab Bank, the Supreme Court ruled that foreign corporations are not liable under the ATS, citing separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns. The Court emphasized judicial restraint in extending ATS liability to foreign corporations, stating that Congress is better positioned to consider imposing such liability. The Jesner Court ruled that foreign corporations are not liable under the ATS due to foreign relations concerns. Claims against Arab Bank had caused diplomatic tensions with Jordan. The Court concluded that only the political branches should weigh foreign policy concerns, leading to a bright-line rule against foreign corporations as ATS defendants. Several Justices had differing rationales for this decision. The Jesner Court ruled that foreign corporations are not liable under the ATS due to foreign relations concerns. Justice Kennedy authored the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas. Justice Alito concurred in part, stating courts should avoid recognizing ATS claims that do not advance diplomatic objectives. Justice Gorsuch argued against recognizing new ATS causes of action, while Justice Thomas emphasized the statute's original intent to apply only to claims against U.S. defendants. The Jesner Court ruled that foreign corporations are not liable under the ATS due to foreign relations concerns. Justice Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion agreeing with Justice Kennedy's opinion but also with Justices Alito and Gorsuch. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the corporate form itself does not raise foreign policy concerns that require immunity for foreign corporations under ATS. She suggested resolving tensions through other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The Jesner Court's ruling on foreign corporations not being liable under the ATS has sparked a debate on the ATS's viability for human rights abuse lawsuits. Some believe very few cases will meet the Supreme Court's requirements for ATS jurisdiction, while others see significance in the ability to sue U.S. corporations and individual employees of foreign companies. The dissenters argued against immunity for foreign corporations, suggesting other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The Jesner Court's ruling on foreign corporations not being liable under the ATS has raised concerns about the future scope of ATS jurisdiction. Some Justices expressed a desire to revisit the discretion of federal courts to recognize new causes of action under the ATS. If federal courts were to lose this discretion, ATS jurisdiction could be limited to specific types of claims, potentially relegating the statute to its previous state of rarely being invoked. The ATS gained prominence for human rights and terrorism litigation after the Fil\u00e1rtiga decision, but the Supreme Court has never ruled in favor of a plaintiff in an ATS case. The Court's decisions in Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner have placed significant limitations on viable ATS claims, leading some to believe the statute's importance may be diminishing. Others see potential for limited cases against natural persons or U.S. corporate defendants, with the Jesner Court calling for further action from Congress before expanding ATS jurisdiction. The future of ATS litigation may be determined by Congress rather than the courts, as further action from Congress is needed before expanding ATS jurisdiction."
