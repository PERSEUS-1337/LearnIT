    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2017.\" It amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act by adding a section on State Energy Security Plans. Federal financial assistance under this part can be used by States to develop energy security plans to protect infrastructure, mitigate supply disruptions, and ensure reliability. The plans must address all fuels, including petroleum products. The State energy profile must address all fuels, provide risk assessments for energy infrastructure, and promote coordination among states and tribes for cyber and physical response plans. The State energy security plan should encourage mutual assistance in cyber and physical response plans. Coordination with public utility commissions, private energy providers, and entities responsible for fuel or electric reliability is required. States must submit a plan meeting specific requirements to be eligible for federal financial assistance. The Governor must submit any necessary revisions to the State energy security plan or certify that no revisions are needed. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to States upon request. The section will expire on October 31, 2022. Amendments authorize $90,000,000 in appropriations from 2018 to 2022. Technical and conforming amendments are also made. Amendments are made to various sections of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, including redesignating subsections, removing subsections, and updating references. Amendments to title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act include adding new provisions at the end. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act was amended to include new provisions, such as Sec. 367 on State energy security plans, passed by the House of Representatives on July 18, 2017."
