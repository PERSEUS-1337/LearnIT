    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Patient Access to Cancer Treatment Act of 2013\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2012, approximately 13.7 million Americans had a history of cancer, with 8 million being over age 65. National spending on cancer care in 2010 was $125 billion, and by 2020, the total cost is expected to reach $206 billion. A 2010 study reported that cancer patients receiving chemotherapy incurred average costs of $111,000 in 2007. The cost of cancer care in the United States is approximately $111,000, three times higher than for coronary artery disease patients and six times higher than for diabetes patients. The country has been praised for its high-quality cancer care, with survival rates surpassing Europe and Canada for 13 out of 16 types of cancer. There has been a shift from community to hospital outpatient care, with some practices referring all patients elsewhere for treatment. Over the last 3 years, over 1,000 oncology clinics or practices have been impacted in the United States. A study found a 150 percent increase in chemotherapy administered in hospital outpatient settings for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries compared to community cancer clinics. The Moran study revealed a shift in Medicare patients receiving care from community cancer clinics to hospital outpatient settings. Medicare payments for chemotherapy in hospital settings tripled since 2005, while payments to physician community cancer clinics decreased by 14.5 percent. Medicare fee schedule rates for common drug administration codes are higher in hospital outpatient settings compared to physician community clinics. The hospital outpatient prospective payment system (HOPPS) fee schedule in 2012 is 50 percent higher at $208. Medicare pays hospital outpatient departments 25 percent more for radiation therapy services than physicians' offices, with significant differentials for specific treatments. One third of US hospitals purchase chemotherapy drugs at a discount through the section 340B program. The curr_chunk discusses the cost savings for hospitals treating cancer patients in community-based settings compared to hospital outpatient departments. It mentions a discount of up to 50 percent on drugs, Medicare reimbursing 70 percent of hospital bad debt, and the impact of sequestration cuts on Medicare services reimbursement. The sequestration cuts in Medicare part B drugs have led to operational changes in community oncology practices, with many forced to send Medicare patients elsewhere for treatment. The disparities in payment across outpatient settings need to be addressed quickly according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The disparities in payment across outpatient settings should be addressed quickly to prevent hospitals from buying physician practices, driving up costs for Medicare and beneficiaries. Congress believes Medicare reimbursement for cancer care should be equal regardless of where the service is provided. Equalizing Medicare reimbursement for cancer care services in hospital outpatient departments and physicians' offices is crucial to prevent disparities in payment across outpatient settings and to avoid hospitals buying physician practices, which could drive up costs for Medicare and beneficiaries. The amendment to Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act ensures consistent payment for cancer care services in hospital outpatient departments and physicians' offices, preventing payment disparities and cost increases for Medicare and beneficiaries. The amendment to Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act ensures consistent payment for cancer care services in hospital outpatient departments and physicians' offices, preventing payment disparities and cost increases for Medicare and beneficiaries. The payment amount for services provided after January 1, 2014, will be a budget-neutral combination of amounts payable under different subsections. Cancer care services are defined as covered outpatient services or physicians' services related to the diagnosis or treatment of cancer. The amendment to Section 1848(a) of the Social Security Act ensures consistent payment for cancer care services provided by physicians, effective from January 1, 2014. The payment amount for these services will be determined under a specific section of the Act."
