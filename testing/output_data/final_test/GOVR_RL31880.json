CBO's duties include preparing reports on economic and budget outlook, cost estimates of legislation, and assessments of unfunded mandates. The CBO, established in 1974, provides nonpartisan budget analysis and information to Congress. It is subject to directives in annual budget resolutions, such as preparing deficit impact estimates for legislation. Nine individuals have served as CBO director, with Keith Hall currently in the role since 2015. Eleven individuals have served as deputy director, with Robert A. Sunshine currently in the position since August 2007. The CBO director is appointed by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate based on fitness for the role, regardless of political affiliation. The process is outlined in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The CBO director is selected by the House and Senate Budget Committees through informal practices, with the Speaker and President pro tempore following their recommendations. The director serves a four-year term starting before a presidential election year and can be reappointed multiple times. The CBO director serves a four-year term and can be reappointed multiple times. The director may appoint a deputy director who serves until a successor is appointed and can act as director in case of resignation or absence. Nine individuals have served as CBO director since 1975, including Alice Rivlin and Rudolph Penner. The CBO director serves a four-year term and can be reappointed multiple times. Nine individuals have served as CBO director since 1975, including Rudolph Penner, Robert Reischauer, June O'Neill, and Dan Crippen. Penner served from 1983 to 1987, Reischauer from 1989 to 1995, O'Neill from 1995 to 1999, and Crippen from 1999 to 2003. Dan Crippen served as CBO director from 1999 to 2003. Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Peter Orszag also served as CBO directors for shorter periods before resigning. Douglas Elmendorf and Keith Hall served as directors of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Elmendorf took over from Peter Orszag in 2009, having previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the White House. Hall began his term in 2015 after working at the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The current deputy director of CBO is Robert A. Sunshine, who succeeded eleven other individuals in the role. The appointment process for directors has varied in terms of timing, with Peter Orszag being appointed 15 days after his term began, while others were appointed within three months. The appointment process for directors at CBO has varied in timing, with some being appointed within three months of their terms beginning. However, there have been instances where directors were not appointed until several months after their terms had started, leading to incumbent directors staying in office past their terms or CBO operating with an acting director. For example, Alice Rivlin remained in office for nearly eight months before Rudolph Penner took over, who then left before a new director was appointed. Edward Gramlich and James Blum served as acting directors for nearly two years before Robert Reischauer took over for almost two months. Several directors at CBO have had gaps in their appointments, with some serving past their terms or being succeeded by acting directors. For example, June O'Neill stayed in office for a month after her term ended, while Douglas Elmendorf served for two months before being succeeded. Appointment gaps also occurred when directors resigned before their terms ended, such as Douglas Holtz-Eakin resigning a year before his term was completed. Donald B. Marron served as acting director until Peter Orszag was appointed over a year later. Peter Orszag served as the acting director of CBO until his appointment a little over a year later, followed by Robert A. Sunshine who also served in that capacity until Douglas Elmendorf was appointed about two months later."
