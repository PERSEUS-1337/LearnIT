    "content": "The Constitution and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure dictate that federal crimes must be tried in the state and district where the crime occurred, ensuring the accused's right to a trial by an impartial jury. The government determines the venue for prosecution, with the burden of proof on them to show it is permissible. Venue is not considered jurisdictional, and if not objected to before trial, it is waived. If venue is incorrect on the charging document, the court can still proceed if objection is waived. Venue for prosecution is determined by the government, with the burden of proof on them to show it is permissible. If the failure of proper venue is not apparent on the charging document, objection can be raised at the close of the government's case. The location of the offense must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the acts constituting it. The words Congress uses in drafting a criminal proscription establish where the offense occurs and the proper venue. The \"verb test\" was used to determine where an offense was committed, but it is not the only factor. The Supreme Court emphasized in United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno that the test should not limit the inquiry into the nature of the offense. Venue is only an issue when a crime occurs in more than one district or outside of any district. Section 3237 governs venue for certain multi-district crimes, including continuing offenses, offenses involving the mails or interstate commerce, and tax offenses. Originally enacted during Reconstruction, it allows for prosecution in any district where the offense began, continued, or was completed. The Supreme Court has had varying interpretations of the venue requirements under Section 3237, which governs venue for multi-district crimes. In earlier cases, the Court allowed prosecution in districts where the offense began, continued, or was completed, even if the accused acted outside of the district. The Supreme Court has had differing interpretations of venue requirements for multi-district crimes. In a 1998 case, the Court ruled that money laundering and the crimes that generated the laundered funds did not automatically form one continuous criminal episode. This decision impacted the prosecution of offenses like laundering drug proceeds in a different district from where the drug trafficking occurred. The Supreme Court has had differing interpretations of venue requirements for multi-district crimes. In a 1998 case, the Court ruled that money laundering and the crimes that generated the laundered funds did not automatically form one continuous criminal episode. This decision impacted the prosecution of offenses like laundering drug proceeds in a different district from where the drug trafficking occurred. In a subsequent case, the Court confirmed that venue is proper in any district where a conduct element of the offense occurs, such as in cases of conspiracy with multiple players and roles. The crime of conspiracy is not complete until an overt act is committed in furtherance of the criminal scheme, which may determine the proper venue for prosecution. The Supreme Court has ruled that venue for conspiracy charges can be proper in any district where an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is committed, regardless of whether the conspiracy statute requires proof of an overt act or not. Lower federal appellate courts have consistently followed this interpretation. The Supreme Court has clarified that venue for conspiracy charges can be established in any district where an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs, even if the conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act. This interpretation has been consistently upheld by lower federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court has ruled that those who aid and abet a federal crime can be punished as principals. Venue for criminal offenses can be established in any district where an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs. The Court has upheld convictions for continuous offenses committed in multiple districts. In United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, venue for a continuing offense can be where the new offense is committed or where the predicate offense occurs. The defendant was tried in New Jersey for using a firearm in Maryland during a kidnapping that started in New Jersey. The Court explained that a defendant can be tried where any conduct element of a crime is committed, such as in the case of kidnapping which continues until release. The appended gun charge can travel with the kidnapping offense. Venue for a continuing offense can be where the new offense is committed or where the predicate offense occurs. The appended gun charge can travel with the kidnapping offense, as explained by the Court. Other offenses like failure to pay child support, unlawful possession of a firearm, false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and violent crimes in aid of racketeering have also been found to have proper venue based on their continuing nature. Venue for continuing offenses can be where the new offense is committed or where the predicate offense occurs. The issue of proper venue based on the effects of a defendant's conduct in another district was not addressed in Rodriguez-Moreno. The government argued that venue can also be based on the effects of a defendant's conduct in another district. The Hobbs Act outlaws obstruction of interstate commerce through violence or extortion. Venue for a Hobbs Act violation can be in any district with obstruction of commerce. Earlier cases suggested obstruction of justice could be tried where proceedings were conducted, even if obstruction occurred elsewhere. Venue could be based on the impact of the crime within a district, especially with substantial contacts. After Rodriguez-Moreno, courts refer to the \"effects\" of a crime for venue determination. The courts use an \"effects\" or \"substantial contacts\" test for venue determination after Rodriguez-Moreno. There is a debate on whether venue can be proper based solely on effects or substantial contacts in a district. The second paragraph of Section 3237(a) allows prosecution for offenses involving interstate commerce, mail use, or importing in any district where these activities occur. This provision was added in the 1948 revision of Title 18. The Reviser's Notes accompanying Section 3237 explain that it was a response to the Johnson decision, which required trials to be held where the mail was sent. Subsection 3237(b) allows for limited transfer of trials to the district where the accused resided at the time of the offense, specifically for tax-related prosecutions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. In 1958, Congress added Subsection 3237(b) to allow for trials to be held in the district where the accused resided at the time of the offense, specifically for tax-related prosecutions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. The defendant must file a request to be tried in his home district within 20 days, and the court cannot grant a request that is not timely. Sections 3235 and 3236 provide special venue requirements in murder cases, with Section 3235 stating that trials for offenses punishable with death shall be held in the county where the offense was committed. Section 3235 provides venue requirements for offenses punishable by death to be held in the county where the crime occurred, unless there is great inconvenience. The accused must move to dismiss for improper venue to benefit from this section, as the trial court has discretion to deny it in cases of inconvenience. Factors for inconvenience include the absence of a federal courthouse in the county, government witnesses located elsewhere, and overburdening court resources. Section 3236 dictates venue for murder and manslaughter cases based on where the death-causing act occurs. It was enacted in response to a Supreme Court ruling on federal murder cases. Case law is limited, with differing interpretations on its application. One court ruled it only applies to \"unitary\" murder cases, while another stated it yields to Section 3237 in multiple districts. An appeals court allowed trial in a second district where a father's negligence led to his daughter's death. Congress has enacted special venue provisions for specific crimes, dictating venue decisions unless they violate constitutional requirements. The list includes various offenses such as immigration violations, obstruction of justice, money laundering, harboring terrorists, and manufacturing controlled substances abroad for importation into the United States. Special venue provisions for specific crimes dictate where offenses are prosecuted, replicating Rule 18 features. Certain crimes like piracy may be prosecuted beyond federal judicial districts as per the Constitution. The First Congress established venue rules for trials of crimes committed on the high seas or outside any state's jurisdiction. In the early 1960s, Congress amended the provision to allow for single trials of overseas crimes by scattered offenders and toll the statute of limitations. Section 3238 now dictates that trials for offenses committed outside any state's jurisdiction shall be held in the district where the offender is arrested or brought. Section 3238 dictates that trials for offenses committed outside any state's jurisdiction shall be held in the district where the offender is arrested or brought. Federal appellate courts disagree on whether this applies to offenses committed partially within the United States. The Ninth and Second Circuits believe it only applies to offenses not committed in any district, while the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits believe it applies to offenses begun or committed elsewhere. Section 3238 applies to offenses begun or committed elsewhere, dictating that trials for such offenses should be held in the district where the offender is first arrested. Venue in a particular district is proper regardless of where the defendant was initially arrested or indicted. Conversely, venue is not proper in a second district after the accused has been arrested for the extraterritorial offense in another district. Venue for extraterritorial offenses under Section 3238 is based on the \"last known address\" or District of Columbia, only if the offender has not been arrested in another district first. In cases with multiple co-defendants, venue is proper for all offenders in any district where it is proper for one of them. Another venue statute, Section 3239, applies to certain espionage cases involving offenses committed outside the jurisdiction of any specific state or district. Section 3239 allows the government to bring an extraterritorial espionage case in the District of Columbia if the offender's residence is unknown, or if their last address in the country is known, the case must be brought there or in the district where the offender was last located. Section 3239 allows the government to bring an extraterritorial espionage case in the District of Columbia if the offender's residence is unknown or if their last address in the country is known. This provision expands the options for venue in such cases, addressing potential limitations under Section 3238. The committee's report on Section 3239 of the Act of 1994 indicates that it clarifies extraterritorial jurisdiction without expanding venue options. Rule 21(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows for a change of venue when prejudice against the defendant makes a fair trial impossible, typically due to pre-trial publicity. Transfers are only granted when no other measures can address the prejudice effectively. Rule 21(a) allows for a change of venue when media coverage creates prejudice that hinders an impartial trial. Courts may reject transfer requests if factors suggest a fair trial is possible, such as a large and diverse jury pool or less pervasive and inflammatory coverage. In cases where media coverage creates prejudice, a change of venue can be requested under Rule 21(a) to ensure an impartial trial. Rule 18 allows the court to set the trial location within the district, and in rare instances, a change of venue may be granted. Rule 21(b) permits the transfer of proceedings to another district for convenience and justice, with courts considering factors like defendant and witness locations. The defendant in a case can request a change of venue based on factors like the location of witnesses, events, and documents, as well as the potential disruption to their business. The decision to transfer the case lies with the trial court, which will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion. The defendant must prove that convenience and justice warrant a transfer. Courts typically prefer to hold the trial in the original district unless compelling reasons exist for a change. The defendant charged with an indictable offense in another district can request a transfer of venue to plead guilty in their own district. Both prosecutors must agree, and if the plea is not accepted, the transfer is revoked. Juveniles can also waive federal delinquency proceedings with similar benefits. The merger of venue and vicinage is unique to the American legal system. Venue and vicinage, unique to the American legal system, have historical roots dating back to the Magna Carta. The concept of the jury coming from the neighborhood where the crime was committed was emphasized, with jurors relying on their knowledge of the offense, defendant, and witnesses. During the colonial period, the English jury evolved into an impartial panel drawn from the county where the offense occurred. Grievances over venue and vicinage arose during the American Revolution, leading to measures allowing misconduct trials in England or Canada, denying colonial suspects the advantages of local jurors. During the American Revolution, grievances arose over the loss of vicinage and venue for colonial suspects. The Virginia House of Burgesses protested the hardships of trial in distant locations and the difficulty of securing witnesses. The First Continental Congress echoed these objections, citing the transportation of colonists to England for trial as a violation of their rights. The colonies protested against British acts that deprived them of a fair trial by jury in their own vicinage. The Declaration of Independence also criticized the King for subjecting them to foreign jurisdiction. The colonies protested against British acts that deprived them of a fair trial by jury in their own vicinage. The Declaration of Independence also criticized the King for subjecting them to foreign jurisdiction. The men who drafted the Constitution never seriously questioned the proposition that became Article III, \u00a72, cl.3, but vicinage was nowhere mentioned. Some delegates objected to the omission, and James Madison proposed an amendment to address this issue. The Sixth Amendment originally proposed to have criminal trials by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, but a compromise led to the current language ensuring a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury from the state and district where the crime occurred. This compromise aimed to balance fairness for the accused without being too parochial. Congress established federal courts with a single district for each state, except in Virginia and Massachusetts. In federal capital cases, trial had to be held in the county where the offense occurred, with jurors drawn from there. The county venue requirement in capital cases remains, but the distinct vicinage component was repealed in 1862. Other vicinage components occasionally surfaced when Congress divided districts. The venue and vicinage requirements, which were occasionally seen when Congress divided districts, were eliminated in the Judicial Code revision of 1911. However, divisional vicinage practices continued in some districts until 1966 under Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The elimination of the division clause in 1966 led to the merging of venue and vicinage questions into one, determining where venue is proper under federal law."
