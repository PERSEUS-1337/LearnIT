    "content": "Federal financial reporting involves recording executive department-level financial and performance information to show the government's financial health and performance. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board defines financial reporting as recording, reporting, and interpreting an entity's financial transactions and events with economic consequences. Reporting in the federal government also includes nonfinancial information about service efforts, resources used, goods and services provided, program outcomes, and relationships among entities. Federal financial reporting is crucial for governmental accountability and stewardship of public money. FASAB emphasizes the importance of providing reliable financial information for informed decision making and monitoring waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. Various stakeholders, including Congress, the President, and citizens, rely on different types of federal financial reports to evaluate government performance. Federal financial reporting is essential for governmental accountability and stewardship of public funds. Stakeholders like Congress, the President, and citizens use federal financial reports to assess the government's performance in collecting and distributing public money. FASAB outlines four objectives of federal financial reporting: budgetary integrity, operating performance, stewardship, and systems and control. Each mandated report addresses these objectives to varying degrees. The federal financial report must address the budgetary integrity objective by providing information on budgetary resources, obligations, and outlays. It should also meet the operating performance objective by including details on program costs, accomplishments, and management of assets and liabilities. Additionally, the report should address the stewardship objective concerning the government's management of public funds. The stewardship objective in federal financial reporting focuses on the government's financial position and condition, evaluating if it has effectively managed the nation's resources. The Financial Report of the United States Government documents changes in financial position, sustainability of budgetary resources, and key indicators of financial health. The systems and control objective in federal financial reporting ensures that financial reports help determine if management systems and controls are sufficient. Management's assertions on internal controls fulfill this objective by documenting control over financial reporting. Federal financial reports have various audiences like Congress, the President, and citizens, each finding different uses for the information. Financial reports are used by Congress, the President, agency heads, program managers, and citizens for oversight, decision-making, program evaluation, resource allocation, and accountability. The U.S. Constitution serves as the foundation for federal financial reporting, linking appropriations to accountability through regular reports of public money receipts and expenditures. Congress holds the \"power of the purse\" and is responsible for overseeing the treasury in accordance with Article I, Section 9, paragraph 7. The U.S. Constitution mandates regular reports of public money receipts and expenditures to ensure accountability in federal financial reporting. Congress, as the guardian of this responsibility, requires transparency in spending to uphold the checks and balances system. In 1791, the House of Representatives passed a resolution for the Secretary of the Treasury to provide statements of receipts and expenditures. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to present an annual statement of public money receipts and expenditures to the House of Representatives. This includes details on receipts by state and expenditures by appropriation. Legislation during the Progressive Era expanded federal financial reporting requirements. The Dockery Act of 1894 and the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 expanded federal financial reporting requirements. The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 authorized changes to federal reporting requirements, laying the foundation for present-day financial reporting. The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 established accounting standards and requirements for executive agencies, including integration with the Treasury Department. Agency heads were mandated to maintain accounting systems for financial disclosure, management purposes, control over funds, property, and assets, internal audit, budget preparation, and integration with Treasury accounting. The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 established accounting standards for executive agencies, including integration with the Treasury Department. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 further developed federal financial reporting. The CFO Act is considered the most comprehensive financial management improvement legislation since 1950. The CFO Act of 1990 established leadership structure, long-range planning, audited financial statements, and accountability reporting. It created the Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) within OMB and designated CFOs in executive departments and agencies. CFO agencies must prepare and audit annual financial statements for funds and accounts, with 10 agencies directed to prepare audited financial statements for all agency accounts. The OMB director must produce an annual financial management status report. The GMRA expanded the CFO Act's reporting provisions to cover all CFO agencies, requiring them to submit audited financial statements to the OMB. It also mandated the preparation of audited financial statements for all accounts and activities of the U.S. government, to be submitted to the President and Congress starting from FY1997. The ATDA further expanded the CFO Act's reporting requirements to include all executive branch agencies submitting audited financial statements to OMB and Congress. Non-CFO agencies may be exempt if budget authority is under $25,000,000 and no risks are present. The Senate committee report on ATDA noted that GMRA's financial reporting requirements have improved federal financial accountability. The reporting requirements of GMRA have led to better federal financial accountability, with most CFO Act agencies receiving clean audit opinions. Different agencies produce various financial reports with different data for internal or external use. These reports, like the ones listed in Table 1, offer valuable insights into agencies' financial performance. The enactment of the CFO Act in the previous year aimed to upgrade federal financial reporting, addressing agency-wide problems with internal control and outdated accounting systems. Despite significant achievements, challenges remain in improving financial management within government agencies. The lack of an auditability requirement for executive departments has led to poor financial information provided by contractors and grantees. Auditable financial statements are crucial for enhancing reliability and aiding stakeholders in identifying issues early. Incomplete disclosures of financial information can hinder informed policymaking, as noted by the GAO before the enactment of the CFO Act. The GAO recommended a permanent federal financial management structure to address these issues and urged Congress to pass legislation mandating auditable agency financial statements. The CFO Act, passed less than four years ago, has had a significant impact on federal financial reporting. It requires annual audited financial statements, which have proven valuable in highlighting agencies' true financial conditions, identifying inefficiencies and weaknesses in management, and uncovering potential savings. The audits have also improved financial management indicators like timeliness and consistency. The CFO Act has improved financial management indicators like timeliness, consistency, and auditability. Agencies have accelerated the delivery of auditable financial statements, with 21 out of 24 CFO agencies receiving unqualified audit opinions in FY2012. This has increased credibility and confidence in government finances. The number of agencies receiving unqualified audit opinions has increased over time, reaching a high of 21 in the current year. The CFO Act, along with other legislative frameworks, has enhanced federal financial reporting, but challenges persist at both agency and government-wide levels. Unqualified audit opinions may not fully reveal underlying financial management issues, with some agencies like DHS and DoD facing material weaknesses. Some agencies, including DHS and DOD, have never received unqualified audit opinions, indicating ongoing financial problems. Despite some agencies receiving unqualified overall audit opinions, auditor-identified financial weaknesses could signal underlying costly financial management issues. GAO notes that many CFO Act agencies have clean audit opinions but still face serious financial system and control problems. For example, DOL received an unqualified audit opinion but had three material weaknesses identified in its FY2011 financial statements. The auditor identified weaknesses in financial controls, budgetary accounting, and security controls at DOL. Discrepancies in general ledger transactions ranged from $30 billion to $47 billion. OMB suggests that material weaknesses increase the risk of financial misstatements. Unreliable financial information can hinder program management. DHS and DOD have never achieved unqualified audit opinions. DHS received a qualified audit opinion in FY2011, showing improvement over previous disclaimers. The qualified audit opinion for DHS in FY2012 marked an improvement from previous disclaimers, with most balance sheet items being materially correct for the first time since FY2003. DHS aims to achieve an unqualified audit opinion by using risk assessments, modernizing financial systems, establishing internal controls, and obtaining a clean audit opinion for FY2012. In contrast, DOD's focus is on auditability, as its annual financial statements have received disclaimers of opinion since 1997. The DOD has received a disclaimer of opinion on its annual financial statements since 1997. Deputy Inspector General Blair identified data quality, internal controls, and financial systems as obstacles to auditability. Between FY2007 and FY2011, DOD's OIG issued 89 reports citing data quality issues. An example cited was inaccurate information provided to Congress on Guam realignment costs in 2009. Poor internal controls have also led to financial repercussions, such as incorrect coding of contractors. Vendor Services incorrectly coded domestic contractors as foreign and failed to file federal information returns to the IRS for approximately 316 payments totaling $351.92 million. The OIG identified 13 areas of material weakness in DOD's financial reporting for FY2012, including issues with the Logistics Modernization Program and the Army Working Capital Fund's system. The Logistics Modernization Program, costing $1.1 billion over 10 years, did not produce a compliant system. Deputy Inspector General Blair emphasized that auditable financial statements indicate improvements in data quality, internal controls, and financial systems for DOD. The deputy inspector general highlighted impediments to auditability in DOD, including data quality, internal controls, and financial systems. Improvements in these areas are crucial for accurate financial information to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Despite reform efforts, DOD's financial management remains on the high-risk list due to deficiencies in processes, systems, and controls. This hinders management's ability to assess resources, track costs, ensure accountability, and reduce the risk of fraud. DOD spends billions annually on business operations to support the warfighter. The Department of Defense spends billions annually on business operations to support the warfighter, including systems and processes related to financial management. These operations are directly impacted by financial management problems, hindering the ability to undergo a financial statement audit. Congress has shown sustained interest in addressing these issues to ensure reliable financial information for budget decisions. The House Armed Services Committee Panel on Defense Financial Management and Auditability Reform evaluated DOD's financial management challenges and plans for audit readiness. GAO has identified financial management problems at DOD as a barrier to auditing the U.S. consolidated financial statements. The U.S. consolidated financial statements have received a disclaimer of opinion every year since they were first required under GMRA. GAO was unable to express an opinion on the FY2012 U.S. consolidated financial statements due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. The Comptroller General's transmission letter in the FY2012 Financial Report of the United States Government highlighted three major impediments to rendering an opinion on the federal government's accrual-based consolidated financial statements: financial management problems at DOD, inability to account for intragovernmental activity, and ineffective process for preparing the statements. These issues have hindered GAO's ability to provide an opinion on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements. GAO identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting for FY2012, including issues with property, plant, and equipment reporting, liabilities estimation, net cost of operations, and budget deficit discrepancies. These weaknesses hinder the federal government's ability to safeguard assets, record transactions accurately, and measure costs effectively. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting for FY2012, hindering the federal government's ability to safeguard assets, record transactions accurately, and measure costs effectively. GAO found additional material weaknesses in the U.S. consolidated financial statements, including improper payments, information security control deficiencies, tax collection issues, and problems with federal grants management. Recommendations are provided for resolving these weaknesses, which are tracked over time to determine implementation status. The GAO report highlighted 48 prior year recommendations that were not implemented by the end of FY2011, with 31 remaining open through FY2012. Steps are being taken to implement these recommendations. The 2011 joint report by the CFO Council and CIGIE noted that federal financial statements may not be easily understood by stakeholders due to their technical nature and complexity. Understanding government accounting principles is necessary to analyze financial statements effectively. The financial management community should make government financial reports more relevant to all stakeholders, including decision-makers, program managers, and the public. Federal financial reports use terms that may be difficult for non-experts to understand, leading to challenges in navigating government-wide financial reports. The government-wide financial report was found to be difficult to navigate by task force members and federal executives. Many believe that financial reports are not easily understood by non-experts and may not be accessible to Congress. A survey showed that federal financial statements are costly to prepare and audit, with little useful information for decision-makers. Representative Edolphus Towns expressed concerns about the complexity and lack of information in federal financial documents. Understanding federal government financial statements can be challenging, even for experts. Simplified and readily available financial information is needed for the legislative branch and the public. Accessible information allows for better understanding of government operations, aids in establishing policy positions, provides a historical perspective on budgets and spending, enables comparison of agencies' fiscal results, and facilitates program evaluations. Congress has been considering legislation related to audits of federal financial statements. In the 113th Congress, Representative Barbara Lee introduced legislation (H.R. 559) that would require a 5% reduction in a federal agency's budget for failure to produce an annual financial statement or receive an audit opinion. The 112th Congress also considered similar legislation, including the Audit the Pentagon Act (S. 3487) introduced by Senator Tom Coburn, which aimed to mandate auditable financial statements by DOD for FY2017. The Audit the Pentagon Act (S. 3487) aimed to mandate auditable financial statements by DOD for FY2017. Failure to obtain an unqualified opinion on its financial statements would result in consequences such as the cessation of authorities on reprogramming and a reorganization of the CMO position. The legislation was not enacted by the 112th Congress. Representative Lee introduced H.R. 6528 in the House on September 21, 2012, which aimed to impose a 5% reduction in discretionary budgetary authority for agencies failing to produce auditable financial statements. The bill allowed for exceptions for certain accounts and the President could waive the reduction if it jeopardized national security. H.R. 6528 was not enacted by the 112th Congress. In the 113th Congress, Representative Lee introduced the Audit the Pentagon Act of 2013 (H.R. 559), which is similar to legislation proposed in the 112th Congress. Senator Scott Brown introduced the DHS Audit Requirement Target Act (DART, S. 1998) to address issues at the Department of Homeland Security. The DART Act aims for DHS to obtain an unqualified audit opinion starting with its FY2013 financial statements. The DART Act of 2012 was signed into law on December 20, 2012, with a plan for meeting deadlines and improving financial management, as required by Congress for enhanced monitoring and oversight."
