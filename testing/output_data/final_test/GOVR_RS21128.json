    "content": "The OECD was formed in 1961 to build strong economies, improve efficiency, expand free trade, and assist developing countries. In 2011, the organization celebrated its 50th anniversary and broadened its focus to include global development efforts. The OECD has shifted its focus to assess how policy issues impact a broad range of countries, including the effects of globalization on world trade, wages, and industrial development. The organization is structured around the Council, Committees, and Secretariat, with the Council holding decision-making power. Committees consist of representatives from member countries, and the Council sets the work agenda through unanimous consent. Ministerial-level meetings are held annually to discuss issues and set priorities for the OECD's work. The OECD Council, comprised of senior government officials and representatives from member countries, sets priorities and reviews work conducted by the Secretariat. The Council determines the OECD's budget, which is about \u20ac354 million or $460 million, funded through shared expenses, sales of publications, member assessments, and voluntary contributions. The United States contributed 21.58% of the budget in FY2012. The OECD Secretariat, with a staff of about 2,500 professionals, is organized into 13 directorates focusing on various areas such as employment, environment, trade, and biotechnology. The U.S. contributed 21.58% of the OECD's budget in FY2012, but this share is expected to decrease to 19.53% in 2018 due to financing reforms. The OECD Secretariat, with 13 directorates, focuses on areas like employment, environment, trade, biotechnology, and more. They collect data, analyze economic trends, research social changes, and assess quality of life through the \"better life initiative\". The OECD produces economic outlook reports and comprehensive reports on various topics. The OECD provides economic growth forecasts, comprehensive reports on member countries, and a wide range of statistical data for analysis. They also coordinate the International Collaborative Initiative on Trade and Employment (ICITE) to study the impact of international trade on labor. The ICITE project aims to enhance knowledge through empirical analysis and publications. The OECD plays a key role in coordinating international agreements on bribery, money laundering, and corruption. It also promotes corporate codes of conduct for multinational firms and analyzes the role of state-owned enterprises in the global economy. Additionally, the OECD is involved in developing international standards for the Internet. The OECD is leading the development of international standards on the Internet. In 2011, OECD members updated the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to include a new chapter on human rights, due diligence, responsible supply chain management, and changes in areas like combating bribery, employment, environment, and taxation. They also provide clearer guidance for National Contact Points. Additionally, the OECD sponsors initiatives in international investment, such as the Freedom of Investment roundtable. The OECD sponsors initiatives in international investment, such as the Freedom of Investment roundtable, Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains, and Policy Framework for Investment to improve conditions for domestic and foreign investment. The OECD promotes free flow of goods, services, and capital to support world economic growth and welfare through globalization. The OECD focuses on good governance, addressing issues like low growth and high government debt post-2008 financial crisis. They aim to create jobs, provide equal opportunities, and restore trust among citizens. The organization has shifted its focus to the \"New Approaches to Economic Challenges\" initiative to enhance analytical frameworks and policy advice. The OECD aims to improve policy advice for economic growth, well-being, and sustainable resource use. They focus on inclusiveness, growth, and structural reforms in areas like competition, education, labor, innovation, and energy efficiency to make growth more inclusive and improve living standards. The initiative aims to address structural reforms to reduce unemployment, improve job stability, and enhance career prospects. It will assess necessary skills for global competition and the impact of the global economy on local economies, including migration and youth unemployment. Additionally, it will focus on changing labor market skills, income inequality, and issues in developing countries such as food security, illicit financial flows, governance of tax incentives, and sustainable economic development. The OECD initiative aims to analyze the global economy's interconnectedness and complexity, focusing on keeping markets open for trade and investment. It seeks to assist governments in boosting economic growth by leveraging opportunities like knowledge-based assets, global value chains, trade in value added, and green growth. The OECD and WTO are creating a database on trade in value-added to study job generation and the role of knowledge-based capital in global value chains. The OECD emphasizes the importance of investment in knowledge-based capital and income in global value chains. It also highlights the role of regional trade agreements in promoting growth among participating countries and their impact on the rest of the world. The OECD suggests that restoring public confidence in markets, governments, and businesses requires strong political leadership and building trust among citizens through smarter governance, better regulation, resource efficiency, and innovative decision-making methods. The OECD advocates for methods and technology to support better planning and decision-making, improving financial transparency, and making government more open and inclusive. They stress the need for taxation policies to maintain sound public finances and for businesses to enhance corporate governance. The OECD also calls for addressing systemic vulnerabilities in large banks' business models and supports efforts to improve financial education and consumer protection. They aim to partner with governments at national and sub-national levels to implement public policies effectively. The OECD aims to strengthen its role as a partner to national and sub-national governments in implementing public policies by enhancing impact, focusing on policy implementation, and increasing exposure to national leaders. It also intends to become a more effective and inclusive global policy network by working with partner countries to identify priority areas for collaboration, strengthening data exchanges, fostering coordination, and encouraging exchanges. The OECD aims to enhance global policy coordination by building on regional initiatives, improving accession processes, addressing global governance issues, and playing a leading role in global standard-setting. Since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the OECD has collaborated with the G-20 on economic recovery, global imbalances, and structural reforms. It supported the G-20 in developing a framework for growth, assisting with social responses to the crisis, and reforming the international monetary system. The OECD collaborates with the G-20 on economic recovery, global imbalances, and structural reforms. It promotes financial integration, consumer protection, tax evasion combat, anticorruption efforts, and reinvestment in agriculture. The OECD collaborates with the G-20 on economic recovery, global imbalances, and structural reforms, including reinvesting in agriculture, combating price volatility, and promoting food security. The OECD is involved in developing policy responses for price volatility in food and agricultural markets, supporting the G-20 fossil fuel subsidy initiative, and making recommendations for agricultural productivity and private investment in agriculture. The OECD collaborated with the G-20 on economic recovery, global imbalances, and structural reforms, including reinvesting in agriculture, combating price volatility, and promoting food security. They also contributed to the Inventory of Estimated Budgetary Support and Tax Expenditures for Fossil Fuels and worked on implementing the Seoul consensus on development. At the G-20 St. Petersburg summit in June 2013, the OECD focused on global value chains. The OECD, in collaboration with the G-20, delivered reports on global value chains and long-term investment financing at the St. Petersburg summit in June 2013. They also published a bi-annual report on regional economies in December 2013, analyzing economic performance and efforts to revive growth post-financial crisis. The OECD, in collaboration with the G-20, provided region-by-region indicators on policy fields to support national growth and well-being. The crisis highlighted the importance of tailored approaches for individual regions. The OECD was tasked by the G-8 to assist Arab countries in transition through the Deauville Partnership, offering political and economic support for reforms in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Jordan. The OECD, in collaboration with the G-20, supports national growth and well-being by providing region-specific indicators. The OECD is involved in governance, anti-corruption efforts, and assisting transitioning countries in joining the Open Government Partnership. G-8 finance ministers expressed support for OECD initiatives in the Middle East/North Africa to improve investment policies and governance. The OECD co-sponsored conferences on transparent government and increasing private investment in Partnership countries. The U.S. State Department provided $1.5 million to the OECD for open governance and political participation in the Middle East and North Africa. The OECD has addressed tax havens since 1961, updating its conventions in 1963, 1977, and 1991 to reflect changes in international business activities and relations. The United States, as an OECD member country, follows the OECD model tax convention but also has its own model income tax convention. It has signed bilateral tax treaties with nearly 70 countries, including one with Malta in 2010. The U.S. has reservations with the first 12 articles of the OECD model tax convention regarding differences in identifying terms and applying taxes to various forms of income. Tax havens have attracted increased attention from policy makers due to efforts to curtail tax avoidance and track financial flows. Policy makers are targeting tax havens to increase government revenues and improve the integrity of the financial system. The G-20 Summit in 2009 announced measures to curtail tax havens and target \"non-cooperative jurisdictions.\" The G-20 Summit in 2009 and 2010 addressed tax havens and corruption, with a focus on cracking down on illegal tax evasion and ensuring fair competition in financial markets. President Obama proposed measures to prevent tax code loopholes and promote job creation in the United States. At the 2010 Seoul summit, the G-20 leaders adopted the Anti-Corruption Action Plan to address tax havens and tax evasion. The plan includes implementing the U.N. Convention Against Corruption, enforcing measures against bribery, preventing corrupt officials from accessing the global financial system, and strengthening international cooperation in extradition and asset recovery. The G-20 leaders adopted the Anti-Corruption Action Plan at the 2010 Seoul summit to address tax havens and tax evasion. Measures include preventing corrupt officials from accessing the global financial system and strengthening international cooperation in extradition and asset recovery. The OECD released a progress report on jurisdictions complying with the internationally agreed tax standard in 2012. The OECD released a progress report in 2012, stating that all key countries have endorsed transparency and exchange of information standards. Nearly 800 agreements were signed by jurisdictions previously identified as non-compliant. The United Nations has incorporated the OECD standard into the U.N. Model Tax Convention. The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes was restructured and strengthened to monitor effective information exchange. It consists of 119 members, including G-20 and OECD countries, and offshore jurisdictions. The Forum conducts peer reviews on members and other jurisdictions, with 113 reviews completed by September 2013. Recommendations are provided to improve transparency and information exchange standards. The OECD has also worked on building international support for these standards. The principles of transparency and exchange of information in tax matters are essential to combat tax fraud and evasion. The 2002 Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters was jointly produced by OECD and non-OECD countries. These standards were later adopted by the G-20 Finance Ministers in 2004 and the U.N. Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters in 2008. A group of OECD members have also adopted a gentleman's agreement on the use of export credits. The Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, adopted in 1978, promotes open competition and market forces in export credit policies. It aims to provide external resources to countries in need, ensuring value for money, minimizing trade distortion, and promoting effective resource utilization. The agreement covers export credit guarantees, direct financing, and interest rate support. The Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, adopted in 1978, promotes open competition and market forces in export credit policies. It covers export credit guarantees, direct financing, and interest rate support. Specific sector understandings in areas like ships, nuclear power plants, civil aircraft, and renewable energy projects are included in the Arrangement. The OECD revised the Arrangement on October 1, 2013, due to concerns about gaps in tax rules and friction between countries over tax revenues, compliance, sovereignty, and fairness. Globalization has led to erosion of national tax bases through profit-sharing transactions across borders, impacting governments, taxpayers, and businesses. The OECD noted that current international tax standards may not be keeping pace with global business practices. The OECD highlights gaps in national tax systems that allow non-resident taxpayers to profit from cross-border activities. Nations need to adjust laws on transfer pricing, source and residence taxation, and intra-group financial transactions to address these issues. A comprehensive, globally supported approach is necessary, especially in the digital economy challenging traditional tax standards. The OECD addresses challenges in taxation posed by the digital economy, focusing on business practices that separate taxable income from generating activities. G-20 finance ministers have tasked the OECD with studying globalization's impact on tax bases and developing an action plan. The OECD presented an action plan to the G-20 in 2013 to address base erosion and profit shifting. The plan includes 15 items, such as addressing tax challenges of the digital economy and neutralizing mismatches in international tax conventions. The OECD presented an action plan to the G-20 in 2013 to address base erosion and profit shifting, including developing model treaty provisions, strengthening rules on interest expenses, and countering harmful tax practices through transparency and preventing treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. The OECD presented an action plan to the G-20 in 2013 to address base erosion and profit shifting by developing rules to prevent artificial avoidance of taxation through transfer pricing and enforcing the arm's length principle. This includes preventing firms from moving intangibles among their corporate group, transferring risks, and engaging in transactions that would not occur between third parties. Establish methodologies to collect and analyze data on base erosion and profit shifting, develop recommendations for mandatory disclosure rules, transfer pricing documentation, and improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The OECD aims to make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective by addressing obstacles in treaty-related disputes under mutual agreement programs. Some critics express concerns over the economic impact of globalization and question the OECD's role in promoting free trade. There are also concerns about the U.S. government budget deficit and the OECD's potential threat to national sovereignty. The OECD is seen by some as a body that exceeds national governments' authority and is accountable to no one. Critics argue it is dominated by the United States, promotes free trade at the expense of the poorest countries, worsens income disparity, and favors multinational corporations over national interests. The OECD claims to reflect the interests of its member countries and denies having a hidden agenda, stating that its agenda is set by its members. The OECD's agenda is set by its members, promoting free trade and open markets for economic development. The United States plays a leading role within the OECD, contributing to policy decisions and facing criticism for its actions. The OECD, chaired by the United States, conducts various activities and research on trade agreements, agricultural policies, labor mobility, trade barriers, and national economies. U.S. delegates actively participate in strengthening competition policies, extending the Anti-Bribery Convention, and promoting regulatory reform for improved market openness. In 2002, U.S. delegates pushed for greater support for OECD's Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits, merging and updating agreements to restrict tied aid in promoting exports. They also proposed applying rules to untied aid and reviewing the use of \"market windows.\" U.S. negotiators opposed shifting export credit controls to the WTO. The U.S. delegates opposed shifting export credit controls to the WTO and instead focused on international investment issues in the OECD. Each OECD member has designated national contact points to monitor implementation of guidelines, with the U.S. national contact point being the Director of the Office of Investment Affairs. The U.S. also contributed to clarifying expropriation obligations in international investment agreements. The U.S. focused on international investment issues in the OECD, clarifying expropriation obligations and addressing overcapacity in the global steel market. Efforts were made to reduce trade-distorting subsidies in steel and establish a joint trade capacity building database. Concerns were also raised about tax havens and efforts were made to curtail their use for illicit tax purposes. Countries initiated efforts to curtail the use of tax havens for illicit tax purposes, defining them as attempts to attract foreign investment through preferential tax treatment that excludes local residents or limits access to the local market. Concerns about anticompetitive tax competition for internationally mobile capital led to a focus on improving transparency and establishing effective exchange of information for tax purposes. U.S. delegates played a key role in advancing these efforts. The OECD, led by U.S. delegates, refocused on promoting information exchange for tax purposes due to concerns about bribery and tax havens. Globalization has led to increased capital flows and challenges for member countries, including the U.S. This has resulted in the use of industry-specific codes of conduct by multinational corporations and nations. The OECD, led by U.S. delegates, focuses on combating bribery and promoting information exchange for tax purposes. The Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions has been implemented by 39 countries, including the U.S. Efforts have also been made to update studies on counterfeiting and piracy, improve law enforcement, and address money laundering mechanisms. The FATF revised its recommendations to combat money laundering and issued new guidelines on terrorist financing. It broadened its mission to focus on combating terrorist financing and encouraged all countries to abide by the new guidelines. In 2012, the FATF adopted updated recommendations to include the financing of weapons of mass destruction in its surveillance efforts until 2020. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats. The FATF revised its recommendations to combat evolving criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and support global efforts to raise standards, especially in low capacity countries. The new standards also address terrorist financing by integrating measures throughout the Recommendations. The FATF members adopted a new mandate in 2012, extending its mission through December 31, 2020."
