    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act\". The Congress finds that Alaska has lost less than one-tenth of 1 percent of its wetlands since the 1780s, with more wetlands in Alaska than all other states combined. 88 percent of Alaska's wetlands are publicly owned. Approximately 98 percent of Alaskan communities are located in or near wetlands, with a significant portion of federally designated wilderness, park, and refuge lands in Alaska. 104,000,000 acres of land were granted to Alaska at statehood for economic development, while Alaska Natives received around 43,000,000 acres for their use. Approximately 75 percent of nonmountainous areas in Alaska are wetlands, causing delays in infrastructure development. The 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act regulated dredge spoils in navigable waters but not wetlands. The Clean Water Act expanded federal jurisdiction over wetlands by redefining \"navigable waters.\" The wetlands regulatory program was expanded to include isolated wetlands, leading to burdensome intrusions on property rights in Alaska. This expansion goes beyond what Congress intended when passing the Clean Water Act. The current wetlands regulatory program in Alaska goes beyond what Congress intended with the Clean Water Act, causing unnecessary burdens on property owners, businesses, and governments, while providing minimal environmental benefits. Alaska, with substantial conserved wetlands and limited private land ownership, faces obstacles to community growth and resource development due to the program. Villages, municipalities, and Native organizations in Alaska are increasingly frustrated with the constraints of the wetlands regulatory program. The wetlands regulatory program in Alaska has caused significant property value loss for individual landowners and a decrease in tax base for Alaskan communities. This is due to regulations that do not consider the large percentage of conserved wetlands in Alaska. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are being proposed. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act include a new national policy to achieve a balance between wetlands conservation and economic interests, eliminate regulatory taking of private property, encourage localized wetlands planning, and provide flexibility for wetlands permits issuance. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act aim to provide greater flexibility for wetlands permits issuance in states with conserved wetlands. Compensatory mitigation for wetlands development in these states shall not be required, but reasonable requirements for minimizing adverse impacts may be included in discharge permits. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allow for general permits on a statewide basis for activities in states with conserved wetlands. These permits apply to discharge of dredged or fill material into disposal sites up to 10 acres in size, with limitations on guidelines for disposal sites. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allow for general permits on a statewide basis for activities in states with conserved wetlands, including specific provisions for airport safety, log transfer facilities, and tailings impoundments for treatment facilities. The amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act allow for general permits on a statewide basis for activities in states with conserved wetlands, including provisions for airport safety, log transfer facilities, and tailings impoundments for treatment facilities. Definitions for \"conserved wetlands\" are specified for wetlands located in various federal conservation systems. The term 'economic base lands' refers to lands owned by Alaska Native entities or the State of Alaska under specific acts. The term 'State with substantial conserved wetlands' refers to states with a ratio of conserved wetlands to converted wetlands. The Secretary of the Army may issue a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters on economic base lands in Alaska if it complies with guidelines. The Secretary may issue a permit for discharge on economic base lands in Alaska if it complies with guidelines that are not more stringent than those for disposal sites in states with conserved wetlands. The guidelines must consider the Act's standards and policies while allowing economic activity on the lands. The Secretary can issue permits for activities on economic base lands in Alaska, prioritizing the social and economic needs of Alaska Natives and considering the value of conserved wetlands. General permits can be issued for infrastructure development without requiring a determination of minimal adverse environmental effects. The Secretary consults with Alaska Natives and the State of Alaska on policies and regulations for activities with minimal adverse environmental effects."
