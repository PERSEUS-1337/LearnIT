    "content": "The \"Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters Act of 2002\" aims to increase the number of firefighters to meet industry standards for protection from terrorism and hazards. It establishes a grant program for funding salaries and benefits for firefighters in local, state, and tribal jurisdictions for 7 years. Additionally, it introduces the Office of Grant Management under the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974. A new office will be established within the United States Fire Administration to administer the SAFER Firefighter grant program. Grants will be provided to various entities to increase career firefighter presence and enhance their emergency response capabilities. Grantees must commit to retaining hired firefighters for at least one year beyond the grant termination. The SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 establishes a grant program to increase career firefighter presence and enhance emergency response capabilities. The Administrator may prioritize applications for hiring additional firefighters with non-Federal contributions exceeding 25 percent. Technical assistance may be provided to States and local governments. Each qualifying State and its grantees must receive a minimum of 0.5 percent of the total grant amount annually until all applications are funded. The SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 establishes a grant program to increase career firefighter presence and enhance emergency response capabilities. A qualifying State must meet requirements to receive a grant, with costs not exceeding 75 percent unless waived by the Administrator. Grants can be used for hiring additional career firefighters. The SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 allows grants for hiring additional career firefighters, which will expire after 10 years. The Administrator must report to Congress before the grant authority lapses, with possible recommendations for amendments. Applications for grants must be approved by the Administrator. Applications for grants under the SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 must be submitted in the prescribed form with detailed information. The application should include a long-term strategy, implementation plan, community consultation, explanation of need for Federal assistance, and demonstration of community support. The SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 requires grant applicants to provide tangible commitments, plans for post-Federal support, and efforts to recruit minority and women firefighters. The Administrator may waive requirements for smaller jurisdictions to facilitate their applications. The SAFER Firefighter Act of 2002 allows for expedited processing of grant applications and limits the use of funds for hiring new firefighters to prevent supplanting of state or local funds. States and local governments can also use assets received through equitable sharing. The Assets Forfeiture equitable sharing program allows assets to be used for the non-Federal share of funding programs. Funding for hiring firefighters is capped at $90,000, with a waiver option available. The cap is adjusted for inflation starting in fiscal year 2003. Performance evaluation is required for all funded programs. Each program, project, or activity funded under this section must have a monitoring component as per Administrator guidelines. Evaluation of grant recipients can be done locally or nationally, with assessments of program implementations. Outcome evaluations may be required in jurisdictions supporting them. The Administrator may require grant recipients to submit monitoring results, evaluations, and necessary data. Funding may be revoked or suspended if a recipient is not in compliance with grant terms. The Administrator has access to grant recipient documents for audit purposes. The Administrator has the authority to access documents of grant recipients for audit purposes, including records of State and local governments, businesses, and other entities involved in funded programs. The Administrator may also issue regulations and guidelines to implement this section, and definitions such as 'firefighter' are provided. The Fair Labor Standards Act defines an Indian tribe as a group of Indians eligible for special programs. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2002-2006 is specified. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2006, 2008, and 2009 is set at $1,126,000,000, $1,159,000,000, and $1,194,000,000 respectively."
