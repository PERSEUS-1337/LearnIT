    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Grain Trade Settlement Act of 1994\". It includes findings related to grain trade between the United States and Canada. The Congress finds that unfair provisions in trade agreements have led to increased Canadian grain exports to the US, causing financial losses to American farmers and difficulties in implementing support programs. Canadian grain exports are increasing without bounds, causing damage to US farmers. The Congress approved the CFTA with conditions related to consultations with Canada on the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board. The President has not resolved consultations with Canada regarding the exclusion of agricultural goods from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. US trade negotiators agreed not to revisit the CFTA during NAFTA negotiations, assuming that the Uruguay Round talks would address subsidy and dispute resolution concerns. Imports of wheat and barley have significantly increased due to changes in Canada's support programs, some of which were intended to boost exports to the United States. This has led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the provisions of the NAFTA related to selling agricultural goods at fair prices. The increase in imports to the United States is grounds for import restrictions under Article 705.5 of the CFTA. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS AND IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL DUTIES. The President shall notify Canada of the intent to terminate NAFTA and CFTA, unless Congress receives a certification. A duty of 50 percent ad valorem or a specific rate shall be imposed immediately. The President will impose a duty of 50 percent ad valorem or a specific rate on certain Canadian grain imports. Negotiations will be pursued with Canada to establish pricing methods for Canadian grain exports to the United States. The President will impose a duty on Canadian grain imports and negotiate pricing methods for Canadian grain exports to the United States. Procedures will be established to obtain necessary data, eliminate transportation subsidies on Canadian agricultural goods, and clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in trade agreements. The President may terminate duties on Canadian grain imports if the Government of Canada agrees to certain requirements. This agreement will supersede provisions in the CFTA and NAFTA."
