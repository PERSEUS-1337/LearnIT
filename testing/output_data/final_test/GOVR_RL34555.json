    "content": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has found no evidence that energy prices are not being set by supply and demand fundamentals. Analysts debate whether recent price increases are justified by market fundamentals or by financial speculation in energy futures markets. Hedgers and speculators participate in these markets to manage price risk and profit from price movements. In energy futures markets, hedgers lock in prices for future transactions while speculators aim to profit from price trends. Their trading decisions determine commodity prices, with speculators playing a significant role. This should not drive prices away from fundamental levels, as traders with superior information can correct any faulty assumptions. In energy futures markets, speculation can lead to artificially high prices, creating a \"speculative premium\" according to some observers. This premium suggests that prices could fall significantly without speculation, indicating a potential breakdown in the price discovery function of the energy derivatives market. Price manipulation is one possible explanation for this phenomenon. Price manipulation in energy markets can involve short-lived price spikes caused by false information or concerted buying/selling. The CFTC has brought enforcement cases involving manipulation since 2002, but these usually result in short-term spikes rather than explaining long-term price trends. Rarely, a market can be rigged over a longer period when a trader or group amasses enough market power to dictate prices. Examples include the Hunt brothers' attempt to corner the silver market and Yasuo Hamanaka's manipulation of the copper market. The CFTC has not found evidence of grand-scale manipulation in energy prices, suggesting prices are set competitively. Speculative bubbles, like the dot-com stock boom, may lead to prices above fundamental levels before eventually returning to normal. George Soros and others predict a similar outcome for energy prices. This bubble explanation is similar to the speculative premium argument, where mistaken ideas about fundamentals can influence prices. Market participants may set prices above the true price due to mistaken ideas about fundamentals, leading to a speculative premium. Policy options to discourage speculation driven by irrational exuberance are limited, as actions like increasing margin requirements may not reduce trading volumes or lower price volatility. There is uncertainty in determining the true price, with no clear method available. In recent years, institutional investors like pension funds, endowments, and foundations have increased their allocation to commodities, potentially creating a bubble effect. Legislative proposals aim to regulate institutional investment in energy markets and improve derivatives market regulation to prevent price manipulation by excessive speculation. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 aimed to close regulatory loopholes in the commodities market, including the \"Enron loophole,\" \"London loophole,\" and \"swaps loophole.\" These loopholes allowed for unregulated trading in off-exchange markets, hindering the CFTC's ability to oversee transactions and gather comprehensive information. The Act exempted certain contracts based on \"exempt commodities\" from CFTC regulation, contributing to concerns about price manipulation and excessive speculation in the market. The CFMA of 2000 exempted energy derivative markets involving \"exempt commodities\" from CFTC regulation. These markets include bilateral transactions between counterparties and trades on electronic trading facilities, restricted to eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities. This exemption has led to a significant volume of over-the-counter energy trading, including energy swaps by investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan. The energy swaps market, led by investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, has evolved towards an exchange model with rapid electronic trading on platforms like Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE). The OTC market for natural gas contracts is comparable in size to Nymex. Concerns about market transparency and fraud led to calls for legislative action to increase oversight in energy markets. The Farm Bill of May 2008 (H.R. 2419, P.L. 110-234) aimed to increase transparency in energy markets by potentially bringing part of the OTC market under CFTC regulation. Electronic trading facilities handling contracts in exempt commodities, such as energy or metals, would need to register with the CFTC and comply with core principles to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation. The Farm Bill of May 2008 aimed to increase transparency in energy markets by potentially bringing part of the OTC market under CFTC regulation. The provisions of the Farm Bill do not affect the unregulated status of energy contracts not entered into on a trading facility. Some bills propose to end the statutory exemption for OTC energy trades altogether, putting energy commodities on the same regulatory basis as agricultural commodities. The CFTC is authorized to grant exemptions for derivatives contracts based on farm commodities on a case-by-case basis. Other bills would authorize the CFTC to impose reporting requirements and position limits. The \"London loophole\" refers to differences in oversight of regulated markets in different countries, specifically regarding ICE Futures Europe in the UK offering energy futures contracts in the US without registering with the CFTC. ICE Futures Europe in the UK has waived the requirement to register with the CFTC for offering energy futures contracts in the US, citing existing regulation in the UK. The market initially offered electronic access to US traders for Brent Crude oil futures, but after being acquired by ICE, introduced a similar contract to Nymex's West Texas Intermediate crude oil future. This has raised concerns about speculative trading activities in the US. ICE Futures Europe in the UK has raised concerns about speculative trading activities in the US. The CFTC is considering closing the London loophole to ensure comparable regulatory requirements for foreign exchanges offering contracts that can be settled in the US. The CFTC amended a no-action relief letter for ICE Futures Europe, requiring them to adopt equivalent U.S. position limits on their crude oil contract. This agreement complements a 2006 memorandum of understanding with the FSA for sharing trading information. The CFTC has also granted regulatory waivers to foreign markets like the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. The CFTC modified a no-action letter for the Dubai exchange similar to the agreement with ICE Futures Europe, allowing them to offer contracts in the United States. There is a debate on whether speculation is driving up energy prices, with some pointing to institutional investors allocating funds to commodities as a factor. Investment in commodities is attractive for fund managers due to low returns on stocks and bonds. Commodities have been performing well, and their risk does not necessarily increase overall portfolio risk. Institutional investors may take positions in commodities in various ways, avoiding direct trading on futures exchanges. Index traders, institutional investors in commodities, use intermediary methods like commodity index funds or OTC swap contracts to match commodity price returns. This strategy has been criticized for overwhelming commodity markets with excessive speculation, particularly due to the \"swaps loophole\" in index trading legislation. Legislative proposals focus on index trading, specifically the \"swaps loophole.\" Position limits are maintained by the CFTC and exchanges for speculative traders to prevent manipulation and market impact. Hedgers, who use futures markets to offset price risk, are exempt from position limits as long as their positions align with their commercial interests. The rationale for exempting hedgers from position limits is that they have no incentive to manipulate the market when they have a hedged position. Hedgers use futures markets to lock in today's price, offsetting gains in futures with losses in physical transactions. The definition of hedger has broadened to include swaps dealers using futures exchanges to hedge price risk from financial contracts with institutional investors. Investors, such as pension funds, can use swaps to invest in commodities by entering into contracts that pay returns based on commodity price index increases. Swap dealers take the short side of the trade and may hedge price risk by purchasing exchange-traded futures contracts. They are exempt from position limits as they use futures markets to offset risks from swaps, similar to traditional hedgers. This exemption is based on the rationale that swap dealers have no incentive to manipulate futures prices. The \"swaps loophole\" allows institutional investors to take larger positions in commodity futures than they would on exchanges, leading to excessive speculation. Proposed bills aim to limit this loophole by defining \"bona fide hedgers\" as those dealing in physical commodities or prohibiting OTC energy trading for non-physical commodity traders. Some bills call for raising margins on oil futures to curb speculation. Nymex has raised the initial margin requirement for crude oil futures contracts in 2008 to cover losses during periods of price volatility. Traders falling below the minimum requirement must post additional margin or risk having their positions closed out at a loss, leading to higher trading costs. Higher margins may lead to increased trading costs and reduced trading volume. There is no evidence that higher margins dampen price volatility. Bills are calling for additional appropriations for the CFTC to hire more employees to monitor energy and agricultural derivatives markets. Some bills direct the CFTC to use its emergency authority to curb excessive speculation in energy markets. Several bills propose studies on market aspects like margin effects, international regulation adequacy, speculation impact, and index trading effects on prices. Legislation summaries on energy speculation regulation are provided in Table 1. A detailed comparison of H.R. 6604 and S. 3268 is presented in Table 2, both bills failed in July 2008 procedural votes."
