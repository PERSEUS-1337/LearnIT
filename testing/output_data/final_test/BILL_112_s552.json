Questions arise about prioritizing tax breaks for executives and oil companies over essential programs like energy assistance and Pell Grants for students. The Senate debates whether to cut Pell Grants by $5.7 billion, delay Social Security benefits, deny children access to Head Start, or tax hedge fund managers more to address deficit reduction. The Senate debates deficit reduction measures, including cutting Pell Grants, delaying Social Security benefits, and taxing hedge fund managers. A $1.3 billion cut in community health centers could deny 11 million Americans access to quality healthcare. A proposed emergency deficit reduction surtax on income over $1 million aims to reduce the deficit fairly. Income over $1 million can help reduce the deficit fairly by increasing revenue from those who can afford it the most. Big oil companies have made huge profits but paid no federal income taxes, ending unnecessary tax credits for them can raise revenue. Middle-class families have suffered during the recession, it's time for the wealthiest and most profitable corporations to contribute to deficit reduction. To address the deficit crisis, America must raise revenue from the wealthy and eliminate tax breaks for big oil companies. Emergency deficit reduction surcharge on high income individuals is being introduced as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to address the deficit crisis by imposing additional taxes on wealthy individuals. A tax of 5.4 percent is imposed on taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for joint filers). Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by reducing adjusted gross income by certain deductions. Special rules apply to nonresident alien individuals. The tax imposed on taxpayers with high income is 5.4 percent for individuals exceeding $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for joint filers). Special rules apply to nonresident alien individuals, with specific deductions and exclusions taken into account. Charitable trusts are exempt from this tax. The tax imposed under this section is not considered as tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining credits or under section 55. Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not apply to the amendment regarding a surcharge on high-income individuals. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2010. Additionally, there is a repeal of expensing and 60-month amortization of intangible drilling costs, as well as a repeal of percentage depletion for oil and gas wells. SEC. 5. REPEAL OF PERCENTAGE DEPLETION FOR OIL AND GAS WELLS. This section terminates percentage depletion for oil and gas properties starting after December 31, 2010. SEC. 6. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF OIL, NATURAL GAS, OR PRIMARY PRODUCTS THEREOF. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the production, refining, processing, transportation, or distribution of oil, natural gas, or any primary product thereof. The term 'primary product' is defined as in section 927(a)(2)(C). The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to focus on electricity production by removing references to natural gas. Amendments also include renumbering paragraphs. Effective date for these changes is after December 31, 2010."
