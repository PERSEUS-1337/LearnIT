    "content": "The global economic downturn has put pressure on international oil prices, revealing vulnerabilities in Iran's economy. Despite being isolated from the international financial system, Iran has been somewhat shielded from the financial crisis. However, accessing financing for trade and investment has become more challenging due to the decline in international credit markets. Economic discontent influenced the 2009 presidential elections, leading to protests and political unrest. President Ahmadinejad's future economic policies are uncertain, with speculation that he may implement more populist measures to secure his political base. In January 2010, the Iranian parliament approved a subsidy reform plan to cut government subsidies on fuel and other goods. Implementation may improve Iran's financial sustainability, but concerns exist about inflation and political unrest. International oil companies are reducing gasoline sales to Iran. Proposed bills would impose sanctions on companies supporting Iran's petroleum industry. Iran is a central focus of U.S. national security. The United States views Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing force in the Middle East. Concerns include Iran's uranium enrichment for potential nuclear weapons, support for Shiite militias in Iraq, Hezbollah, and Hamas, and inflaming sectarian strife. This report discusses Iran's economy, U.S. policy concerns, and policy options for Congress. Iran's economy is evaluated in the context of U.S. economic sanctions for national security reasons. Iran has significant petroleum and gas reserves, the second largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the second largest population in the region. However, the country faces challenges such as dependence on oil export revenues, vulnerability to oil price fluctuations, high inflation, unemployment, and poverty levels. The 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran led to significant changes in the country's political and economic landscape. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini transformed Iran into an Islamic state with a public sector-dominated economy. The Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s resulted in negative economic growth, declining oil production, and high inflation, reversing the economic prosperity of the 1960s and 1970s. Iran's post-war economic growth included recovery in oil output, but faced a severe downturn in the 1990s due to a drop in international oil prices. Since the 1979 U.S. embassy hostage crisis, Iran has been subject to various U.S. economic sanctions motivated by concerns over its nuclear program and support for terrorist organizations. The United States has focused on targeted financial measures to isolate Iran from the U.S. financial system in order to change its nuclear policies. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran to change its nuclear policies and support for terrorist organizations. This includes curbing Iran's petroleum sector and financial resources, as well as pressuring foreign countries and companies to limit business with Iran. The United Nations has also imposed sanctions on Iran, with the UNSC passing Resolution 1803 in March 2008 for stricter monitoring of international shipping to and from Iran. In June 2008, the UNSC and Germany offered to suspend sanctions against Iran if it halted uranium enrichment. Iran opposed U.S. and U.N. sanctions, claiming its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The Iranian government asserts its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and questions the justification of sanctions. A 2007 U.S. NIE stated Iran halted nuclear activities for weapons in 2003. Iran and the IAEA agreed on a work program in 2007, but a 2008 IAEA report raised new questions. Iran's economic growth slowed in 2009 due to oil price decline and economic mismanagement, but is expected to pick up in 2010. Iran's economy experienced broad-based growth in the earlier part of the decade, driven by government spending, expansionary policies, and increased credit. Despite high oil prices, the oil sector's contribution to growth has been modest due to low production and investment. Sanctions and a poor business environment have hindered investment, while high inflation has also hampered economic growth. Iran has one of the highest inflation levels among oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was above 25% in 2008, dropping to above 13% in 2009. Budgetary constraints are expected to further reduce inflation in 2010, but implementing subsidy reforms may cause it to rise again. Factors contributing to inflation include government economic policies, consumption demands, international sanctions, and rising food and energy prices. Inflation levels have been linked to efforts to lower banking interest rates, opposed by the Central Bank. The Iranian economy faces challenges with high inflation levels and unemployment rates. The Central Bank opposes efforts to lower banking interest rates, while the government struggles to generate new jobs for a young population entering the labor market. Iran also grapples with a high poverty rate and significant \"brain drain\" as skilled individuals emigrate. Reform efforts to shift towards a market-oriented economy have faced resistance from political elements. Reform efforts in Iran faced resistance from political elements. Under the Khatemi administration, significant strides were made towards trade liberalization, economic diversification, and privatization. The government implemented structural reforms such as tax policy changes and new foreign investment laws to integrate Iran into the global market. The exchange rate reform in 2002 improved Iran's trading environment and public sector transparency. President Ahmadinejad pursued more populist economic policies, promising to bring oil money to the people's tables. President Ahmadinejad's populist agenda led to expansionary fiscal policies in Iran, with extensive subsidies on gasoline, food, and housing. Energy subsidies alone make up about 12% of Iran's GDP, with total subsidies estimated to reach over 25% of GDP. Cash handouts to the poor were also provided, but criticized as untargeted and ineffective. In 2010, a massive overhaul of Iran's subsidy system was passed by Parliament, reducing state subsidies by $20 billion. The overhaul of Iran's state subsidies aims to reduce overconsumption by cutting $20 billion in subsidies. Economists argue that reducing subsidies is necessary for long-term economic sustainability, but there are concerns about potential inflation and political unrest. Despite past public backlash, a gasoline rationing system implemented in 2007 led to a drop in consumption. Iran's supreme leader supports President Ahmadinejad's subsidy reform efforts, but political unrest following the 2009 elections may impact implementation. Ahmadinejad's government has implemented expansionary monetary policies, providing low-interest loans for various sectors and creating social programs. The $1.3 billion Imam Reza Mehr Fund assists youth with marriage, housing, and education. Some economists criticize Ahmadinejad's efforts to lower interest rates, citing excessive liquidity and inflation. The government also offers interest-free loans for marriage through the fund. The government in Iran has been using oil export revenues from the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) to support expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including public subsidies, cash handouts, and low-interest loans. Concerns have been raised about the OSF's ability to cushion against global economic downturns, as it may not contain sufficient funds. Iran's economy heavily relies on state-controlled revenues from crude oil exports. There are also concerns about the alleged use of oil revenues to finance Iran's nuclear program and support for terrorist groups. The Iranian economy heavily relies on state-controlled revenues from crude oil exports, with quasi-state actors like bonyads and the IRGC playing significant roles. Bonyads, also known as \"Islamic conglomerates,\" are semi-private charitable foundations with immense political and economic power in Iran. They report directly to the Supreme Leader, are not subject to parliamentary oversight, and do not disclose their financial activities, making the extent of their wealth unknown. The Foundation of the Oppressed and War Veterans (MJF) is the largest Iranian charitable trust with over $10 billion in assets. It provides financial assistance, medical care, and recreational opportunities to Iran's poor and war veterans. The MJF has investments in various economic sectors domestically and internationally since 1991. The MJF, a large Iranian charitable trust with over $10 billion in assets, is involved in various economic activities globally. Allegations suggest it is used for Iranian intelligence activities and enjoys advantages over private companies. Critics argue that reforming bonyads like the MJF is crucial for significant economic and political reform in Iran. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran, founded in 1979, has become a key player in the economy through involvement in various sectors like construction, oil, gas, and telecommunications. They have acquired a 51% stake in Iran's largest telecommunications operator for nearly $8 billion. The IRGC, with significant control over Iran's borders and airports, frequently acquires business contracts for new projects at the expense of private sector businesses. It is also a leading investment tool for Iran's leaders, but faces criticism from elements of the private sector for alleged involvement in smuggling activities and benefiting from Iran's economic isolation. The Revolutionary Guard, facing less competition for contracts, sometimes subcontracts to international companies due to lack of technical expertise. The United States accuses the IRGC of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with profits from its activities funding illicit actions. Under E.O. 13382, the U.S. can sanction entities for proliferation concerns, prohibiting transactions and freezing assets. In 2007, the U.S. designated the IRGC for proliferation concerns. The U.S. Department of State designated the IRGC under E.O. 13382 for proliferation concerns, marking the first time the U.S. sanctioned a foreign country's military. Nine companies and five individuals associated with the IRGC were also identified for proliferation concerns, all tied to Iran's energy sector. Companies include Khatam al-Anbya Construction, Oriental Oil Kish, Ghorb Nooh, Sahel Consultant Engineering, Sepasad Engineering Company, and Omran Sahel. The U.S. Department of State designated the IRGC under E.O. 13382 for proliferation concerns, along with nine companies and five individuals associated with the IRGC in Iran's energy sector. The Treasury also took action against the IRGC, designating General Rostam Qasemi and four subsidiary companies owned or controlled by Khatam al-Anbiya. The United States sanctioned four subsidiary companies owned or controlled by Khatam al-Anbiya for supporting mining and engineering projects. The U.S. also designated the IRGC-Qods Force for terrorist activities, providing assistance to Hezbollah. Iran's private sector declined significantly after the 1979 revolution. Iran's private sector declined significantly after the 1979 revolution under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini. Foreign participation in Iran's economy was prohibited, with state and quasi-state institutions taking over most private sector companies. In an effort towards more private sector development, Iran initiated a major privatization initiative in July 2006, allowing up to 80% of shares in strategic industries to be issued through the stock market. However, some members of the private sector are skeptical of the government's privatization efforts, perceiving them as a means of redistributing assets to other parts of the state, such as the IRGC. Iran's private sector competes with state-run businesses like the bonyads and the IRGC, which have advantages. Critics question the government's heavy involvement in the economy and suggest investing oil revenues in the private sector. The bazaari class historically dominated trade in Iran, importing goods for profit. The bazaaris in Iran rely on low costs, free trade, and minimal regulation to operate profitably. They are wary of foreign investment due to potential competition and have faced challenges with international sanctions affecting their ability to access trade financing. Iran's economy relies heavily on key sectors like industry, services, and agriculture. The country has turned to banking partners in Gulf Cooperation Council countries to avoid international pressure. Concerns have been raised about the overemphasis on the oil and gas sector, potentially hindering diversification and investment opportunities in other sectors. Iran's economy heavily relies on the state-dominated sectors, with some privatization efforts underway. Iran holds 10% of global proven oil reserves, ranking third after Saudi Arabia and Canada. The country is the second largest oil producer in OPEC, producing 3.8 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2008. However, Iran's oil production levels are limited due to natural decline in mature oil fields and low recovery rates, leading to annual loss of millions of barrels of oil. Iran faces challenges in its oil sector due to reservoir damage, natural declines, aging infrastructure, and limited access to new technologies. Investment in structural upgrades and enhanced oil recovery efforts has been hindered by U.S. sanctions. Iran planned to invest $200 billion under its fifth five-year development plan to increase oil and gas production, aiming to boost oil production capacity to five million barrels per day by 2014. Gas production capacity was also set to increase significantly. Iran's natural gas production increased from 552 million cubic meters in 2008 to 996 million cubic meters in 2013. The country requires about $125 billion in foreign investment for its natural gas sector, with an additional $45 billion to $50 billion from domestic sources. Despite having the second largest natural gas reserves globally, Iran was a net importer of natural gas until 2005. The country aims to use its natural gas production for domestic consumption, exports, and the development of its petrochemicals industry. Iran is seeking international investment to enhance its natural gas sector, but U.S. sanctions have limited access to necessary technologies for liquefied natural gas plants. Iran's oil and gas sector is predominantly state-controlled, with plans to privatize nearly 50 state-run companies worth $90 billion by 2014. Iran plans to privatize 50 state-run oil and gas companies worth $90 billion by 2014 through the Tehran Stock Exchange, allowing both domestic and foreign investors to buy shares. This privatization may help investors bypass U.S. sanctions. Additionally, Iran is set to open a privately-owned bank with a minimum capital of $200 million to fund oil industry projects. The country is a major exporter of caviar and pistachio nuts, with a diverse agricultural sector that faces challenges from climate change and past conflicts. Iran's agriculture sector has faced setbacks due to the 1979 revolution, war with Iraq, overfishing, and environmental degradation. The country relies on oil export revenues to pay for agricultural imports, but rising food prices and population growth have strained the economy. Iran is working to strengthen its manufacturing sector, including steel, automotives, food products, and petrochemicals, but faces challenges such as a decline in competitiveness due to the high exchange rate from oil revenues and international sanctions. Manufacturing units in Iran depend on imported parts and services from Europe. Iranian manufacturing heavily relies on imported parts and services from Europe, but access to these goods has been complicated due to European banks scaling down financial transactions with Iranian businesses. Despite being a major global steel producer, Iran is a net importer of steel. There is a growing demand for steel in the Middle East driven by energy project investments and construction activities. The Iranian Privatization Organization plans to privatize several steel companies in FY2010. Iran is also a significant player in the automotive industry, with production increasing by 5.4% in 2008. Iran Khodro and Sapia are the country's largest automakers, but auto plants often have outdated technology. Iran's automotive industry is significant, with Iran Khodro and Sapia being the biggest automakers. Despite outdated technology in auto plants, Iran imports various vehicles and reduced tariff rates on auto imports in 2006. Plans to privatize Iran Khodro and Saipa were announced, and joint ventures with foreign companies like Peugeot, Citroen, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Kia Motors, Proton, and Chery have been established. Foreign companies have entered cautiously due to concerns about U.S. reaction and reputational risks. The German automaker Daimler has restricted its business activity in Iran due to perceived reputational risks, selling its stake in a subsidiary of Iran Khodro and withdrawing an application to export commercial vehicles. Foreign companies like Nestle, Coca Cola, and Pepsi have signed production deals with local Iranian businesses. Iran is the second largest manufacturer of petrochemicals in the Middle East, with about half of its sales for the domestic market. Foreign subsidiaries of American companies can still engage in business in Iran under U.S. sanctions regulations. Iran is working to diversify its petrochemical exports despite challenges from state intervention and international sanctions limiting financing. The financial sector in Iran has seen some privatization efforts, with the Central Bank approving licenses for private banks in 2001. However, privatization has been hindered by the Guardian Council. The Iranian government has control over lending and investment activities in the commercial sector. The Iranian government controls lending and investment activities of commercial banks, limiting Bank Markazi's ability to conduct a proactive monetary policy. State-owned banks are seen as poorly functioning, while private banks face obstacles due to extensive regulations and government policies. Interest rates set below inflation have strained commercial banks financially. Loan portfolios mainly consist of low-return loans to state-owned enterprises and quasi-government agencies. The Iranian financial system is struggling with a high level of non-performing loans, particularly in sectors where the government is involved in directed lending. This has hindered domestic business growth and foreign investment attractiveness. The Tehran Stock Exchange was established in 1967 and now lists over 300 companies, with foreign investors allowed to participate since 2005, holding a maximum of 25% of shares. Foreign investors can hold up to 25% of shares in the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), but their activity is low, accounting for less than 2% of investments. Concerns about Iran's nuclear standoff, liquidity, transparency, and legal environment hinder foreign participation. The TSE experienced a 38% drop between July 2008 and April 2009 due to global economic downturn and declining oil prices, but rebounded by 58% by the end of 2009. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed financial measures against Iran to isolate it from international financial markets. The United States is working to isolate Iran from the international financial system to push for policy changes regarding its nuclear program and alleged terror financing. Iranian banks are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions, with entities designated for supporting terrorism. Iran is accused of using the international financial system to fund terrorist organizations, with Bank Saderat being designated by the Treasury in 2007. The Treasury designated Iranian banks like Bank Saderat, Bank Sepah, Bank Melli, and Bank Mellat for supporting terrorism and WMD proliferation. The European Union also sanctioned Bank Melli in June 2008. In March 2008, Treasury sanctioned Bahraini Future Bank B.S.C. for assisting Iran's nuclear and missile programs, believed to be controlled by Bank Melli. In October 2008, Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) was designated for providing financial services to Iran's Ministry of Defense. Treasury also sanctioned three financial institutions associated with EDBI. In November 2009, First East Export Bank (FEEB), a subsidiary of Bank Mellat in Malaysia, was sanctioned for being owned or controlled by Bank Mellat. The Treasury revoked the \"U-turn\" license for U.S. financial institutions on November 6, 2008, to restrict Iran's access to the U.S. financial system. U.S. and European countries claim that certain Iranian banks are trying to evade international financial sanctions for proliferation-related activities and terrorist financing. Iranian officials deny these allegations, stating that financial sanctions have impacted Iranian banks' profitability. Iranian banks have been affected by financial sanctions, damaging credit ratings and profitability. Financial intermediaries struggle to finance development projects like oil infrastructure. Iran is safeguarding foreign assets by moving funds from European to Iranian and Asian banks, as well as investing in gold and equities. Concerns exist about the reliability of Asian banks due to their ties to Europe's economy. Iran's financial system faces money laundering risks, with efforts to combat it dating back to 2002. The country passed its first anti-money laundering law in January 2008, but critics warn of vulnerabilities that could threaten international security. Iran adopted implementing regulations for the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law in 2009 to align with international standards. The U.S. Treasury expressed concerns about Iran's money laundering and terrorism financing activities through state-owned banks, using deceptive practices to evade detection. Iran's central bank and commercial banks have requested to be removed from international transactions to make tracking more difficult. The U.S. Treasury advisory identified 59 major Iranian banks posing threats in international financial cities, including Iran's central bank. None of these banks are currently sanctioned by the U.N. or U.S. The advisory urged financial institutions to assess risks when dealing with these Iranian banks. The FATF called on its member states to monitor financial interactions with Iran due to concerns about money laundering and terror financing. Iranian officials claim their central bank follows international standards and regulates domestic financial institutions closely. Many Iranian businesses and individuals rely on hawala for transactions. Many Iranian businesses and individuals use hawala, an informal money transfer system, due to increased U.S. and U.N. financial sanctions on Iran. Hawala is seen as a cost-effective way to transfer money compared to formal banking channels. Iran utilizes hawala to transfer money to dealers in China via Dubai, potentially circumventing international sanctions. The use of hawala may indicate the effectiveness of sanctions in hindering Iran's financial transactions. Iran's trade saw significant growth between 2004 and 2007, reaching $147 billion in 2007, but faced a decline in trade surplus due to falling oil prices. Despite a current account surplus in 2008, it decreased from 12% to 7% of GDP in 2008. Iran's trade balance and current account balance improved due to a rebound in oil prices in 2010, despite higher import prices from sanctions. International financial sanctions have raised trade costs for Iran by 5-10% annually. Iran's major exports include oil, gas, petrochemicals, carpets, and fruits, with top destinations being UAE, Iraq, China, Japan, and India. Major imports include gasoline, raw materials, capital goods, food, and consumer goods. Iran is the fourth largest exporter of crude oil globally, with net revenues of $73 billion in 2008. The country exports mainly to Asian and European OECD countries, with top markets including Japan, China, India, South Korea, and Italy. The oil revenue accounts for about 80% of export earnings and 40% of government revenue, making it a crucial source of foreign exchange. The narrow Strait of Hormuz, along Iran's border, is a vital chokepoint for global energy security, through which over 40% of the world's oil is traded. Iran heavily relies on oil export revenues, accounting for about 40% of government revenue and being a crucial source of foreign exchange earnings. The recent decline in oil prices has raised concerns about the country's economic vulnerabilities, potentially leading to reduced government revenue, increased susceptibility to sanctions, and impacting the private sector due to reliance on imports for capital and machinery goods. This economic downturn may also exacerbate political dissent among Iranians already facing high unemployment. The economic downturn in Iran, exacerbated by high unemployment and inflation, may lead to increased political dissent. Despite having vast oil reserves, Iran imports nearly half of its refined petroleum products. In 2009, the country imported 130,000 barrels of gasoline per day, with suppliers including companies from Switzerland, China, Kuwait, Russia, Malaysia, India, France, and China. Venezuela also occasionally supplies gasoline in solidarity with Iran to counter U.S. influence. In recent years, major oil traders like Vitol, Glencore, and Trafigura have stopped supplying gasoline to Iran due to political and commercial risks. India's Reliance also terminated gasoline sales to Iran in January 2009. In January 2009, Reliance agreed to stop gasoline sales to Iran. Members of Congress called for the cancellation of loan guarantees to RIL. Malaysia's Petronas, Russia's LUKOIL, and Royal Dutch Shell also halted gasoline sales to Iran. Iran's European gasoline suppliers are being replaced by Dubai-based and Chinese companies. China's ZhenHua Oil now provides one-third of Iran's gasoline imports. Iran's high gasoline consumption is attributed to energy subsidies. Iran's high energy subsidies in Iran lead to increased vehicle sales of fuel-inefficient models and high import levels due to limited domestic refinery capacity. Analysts predict Iran could become a net exporter of gasoline by 2013 if subsidies are eliminated. Oil consumption is declining as consumers shift to natural gas. Iran is increasing strategic reserves of gasoline and importing more to build up reserves, possibly in preparation for a potential international embargo. Iran's trading relations have shifted from Western countries to the developing world due to international concern over Iran's nuclear program. China, Japan, India, and Turkey are significant export markets for Iran, while major merchandise suppliers include China, Germany, the UAE, and South Korea. Germany remains Iran's top trading partner. Germany, Iran's top trading partner in Europe, has seen a decline in trade due to pressure from the United States. Export credits have decreased significantly, with repayment terms shortened. Iranian companies can no longer receive export credit guarantees for large-scale projects and must repay loans within 360 days. Germany is conducting extra scrutiny of export authorizations and evaluating financial risks more closely when doing business with Iran. German exports to Iran increased by about 22% from 2007 to 2008, while German imports from Iran increased by about 3%. Some European financial institutions, including Germany's Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, as well as the UK's HSBC and Standard Chartered, have reduced or stopped business with Iran. In February 2010, Germany's Allianz and Munich Re announced they would curb their business operations in Iran due to the political situation. Iran's trade relationships with Western countries have been affected as companies like Siemens, Allianz, and Munich Re have decided not to write new policies or renew existing contracts with Iran. In response, Iran has strengthened ties with Asian countries, particularly China, which has become its largest trading partner. China's exports to Iran include equipment and arms, benefiting Iran with low-cost imports. Iran's trade with Middle Eastern partners accounts for 6% of its total trade. Iran's trade with Middle Eastern partners increased from 6% to nearly 13% of its total trade with the world by 2008. The UAE is a major trading partner for Iran, with trade dominated by UAE exports to Iran. Arab nations value trade relations with Iran despite concerns over its nuclear ambitions. The UAE serves as a central re-exporting and distribution center for products imported from foreign markets to Iran. The UAE is a key re-exporting hub for products destined for Iran, benefiting from low tax rates and free trade zones. Dubai serves as Iran's economic gateway to the world, allowing for indirect imports due to sanctions. Despite US restrictions on business with Iran, many companies use Dubai as a loophole. The US has urged the UAE to tighten export controls, leading to recent efforts to regulate trade with Iran more strictly. The UAE has implemented restrictions on dual-use technologies, chemical and biological weaponry, and military equipment. This new law was used to impound a vessel at Jebel Ali delivering merchandise to be transshipped to Iran. Efforts to reduce trade with Iran have led to the closure of about 40 Iranian companies in 2007. UAE financial institutions are limiting Iran's access to credit, freezing assets of Iranian firms, and reducing letters of credit to Iranian businesses. Iranian businesses are shifting to other regional banks or engaging in cash-based transactions, raising the costs of goods for end-users. The UAE has imposed restrictions on trade with Iran, leading to concerns in the Iranian business community about potential trade diversion. US trade with Iran has been limited since the 1987 ban on imports and the 1995 embargo on exports and investments. Despite this, there has been some growth in US-Iranian trade in recent years. There has been notable growth in U.S.-Iranian trade in recent years. Top U.S. exports to Iran include soybeans, pharmaceutical preparations, wheat, wood pulp, and medical equipment. Major U.S. imports from Iran include textile, artwork, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Iran is able to obtain embargoed U.S. goods through re-export trade, mainly through Dubai. U.S. sanctions may curtail economic activity, imposing costs on American workers and businesses. U.S. businesses have concerns about measures against companies unable to control re-exports of high-technology goods to Iran. Some believe U.S. policies in Iran may deprive the United States of significant business opportunities. Europe, China, India, and Russia are capitalizing on Iran's market potential as the United States faces risks in doing business with Iran due to sanctions. U.S. trade with Iran is limited, but sanctions could impact Iran's trade with major partners. Iran has sought WTO membership since 1995, making it a priority. Iran has been seeking WTO membership since 1995, with the United States previously blocking its bids due to concerns about its nuclear program and support for terrorism. However, in 2005, the U.S. agreed to stop blocking Iran's attempts to join the WTO as part of economic incentives to resolve the nuclear issue. Despite challenges from Asian countries and support from the EU and developing nations, recent negotiations for Iran's accession have stalled due to political reasons. Iran has been seeking WTO membership since 1995, with the United States previously blocking its bids due to concerns about its nuclear program and support for terrorism. Recent negotiations for Iran's accession have stalled due to political reasons. Iran's international reserves grew from $60.5 billion in FY2006 to $82.9 billion in FY2007, but may shrink due to the recent drop in oil prices. There is concern that domestic economic mismanagement has reduced funds available through the Oil Stabilization Fund to smooth economic vulnerabilities facing Iran in the present global economic environment. Iran's foreign reserves composition changed in December 2007, shifting away from U.S. dollars for oil export purchases to other currencies like the euro and yen. Iran urged OPEC members to switch from the dollar, but only Venezuela supported the move. The Central Bank is reducing its dollar reserves and diversifying to other currencies. Despite being the most populous country in the Middle East with vast resources, foreign direct investment in Iran has been historically low due to political and structural factors. Foreign direct investment in Iran has been historically low due to political and structural factors. The stringent domestic regulatory environment and government reluctance to allow foreign investment have contributed to this. In the energy sector, foreign investment is limited due to Iran's buy-back system, where international oil companies pay a fee for entitlement to oil or gas. Iranian officials have encouraged foreign companies to enter the market, but many contracts have been won by quasi-state actors. International sanctions and political uncertainty have made some foreign investors wary. International sanctions and U.S. pressure have clouded Iran's economy, making foreign business wary of investing in Iran. Sanctions target Iran's oil and gas sectors to limit resources for uranium enrichment and alleged terrorist financing. Foreign companies struggle to obtain financing and limit investments to avoid U.S. opposition. International investors have withdrawn from projects in Iran, leading to significant domestic capital flight. Iranian investors seek more profitable opportunities overseas, like property investment in the UAE. International energy companies like British Petroleum, Total, and Shell have suspended development projects in Iran due to international concerns over Iran's nuclear program. European companies have scaled down projects, leading Iran to seek partnerships with Asian countries like China and Pakistan, as well as Russia and Central Asian countries. Deals with these partners have been slow to finalize due to the specter of sanctions. The GAO report states that U.S. sanctions have hindered foreign investment in Iran's hydrocarbon sector. Iran disputes this claim, stating that sanctions have not affected foreign investment in its gas sector. Iran has received $3.1 billion in World Bank loans, with $2.7 billion already disbursed for projects focused on the environment and poverty alleviation. World Bank loans to Iran come from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Iran is unable to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Agency due to its GDP. The United States has not contributed to the IBRD since 1996. Lawmakers debate reducing U.S. contributions in protest of IBRD lending to Iran. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation has invested $5 million in a joint venture in Iran. Iran has joined the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. Major donor countries to Iran include Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Japan. In 2008, major donor countries to Iran included Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Japan, providing a total of $63 million in ODA. The United States offers humanitarian assistance to Iran, such as disaster relief after the Bam earthquake in 2003. There is a divided opinion in Congress on how to approach Iran, with some advocating for harsher measures due to concerns about Iran's uranium enrichment program and terrorism financing, while others suggest positive engagement through diplomatic ties and economic cooperation. Some lawmakers debate whether the United States should pursue more sanctions against Iran unilaterally or through the United Nations. There are concerns that unilateral efforts may hinder building multilateral consensus for punitive measures. It is noted that pursuing multilateral action can be challenging due to differing foreign interests. The United Nations passed sanctions against Iran after addressing Chinese and Indian concerns regarding energy supply and trade relations. Some lawmakers see the resolution as a first step and advocate for more punitive action. Analysts debate the impact of sanctions on Iran's economy. The impact of sanctions on Iran's economy is debated due to international tensions related to its nuclear program and alleged support for terrorist organizations. Analysts point to challenges in foreign investment, trade finance, and oil and gas sector development as evidence of the sanctions' effects. However, some reports suggest that Iran's global trade ties and energy production make it difficult for the United States to isolate Iran effectively. Sanctions have become less successful as globalization allows embargoed countries to find alternative trade partners. Sanctions on Iran may not cripple its trade and financial interactions with the world, as Iran can bypass trade bans by using other countries for transshipment. Some analysts believe sanctions could lead to Iran shifting its trade to countries that do not enforce sanctions. Lawmakers question the effectiveness of sanctions, noting little impact on government policies and instead hurting the population. The recent enforcement of targeted financial measures aims to avoid the drawbacks of broader trade sanctions, focusing pressure on key actors. There is uncertainty on how sanctions affect the elite and spill over into government policy. Congress may require data collection to assess the economic impact of sanctions on Iran, as per a recent GAO report. The GAO notes challenges in assessing the impact of sanctions due to lack of data collection. In the 110th Congress, House-passed bills tightened sanctions against Iran without indicating support for military action. Major legislation included H.R. 957 and H.R. 2347, aimed at expanding sanctions and encouraging divestment from certain companies.

It supports divestment actions taken by state and local governments and education institutions from persons and companies investing in Iran's energy sector.

Introduced on March 5, 2009, the bill was referred to the Senate committee on October 15, 2009. The bill targeting Iran's energy sector was referred to the Senate committee on October 15, 2009.
