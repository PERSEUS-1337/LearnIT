    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Employment Transition Assistance Act of 1993\" introduces assistance for environmental employment transition under the Job Training Partnership Act. The Act defines \"adversely affected employment\" as work in industries experiencing economic harm due to species listing or environmental regulations. The National Forest Management Act of 1976, Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resource Planning Act of 1974, and Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 are referenced in defining an \"adversely affected worker\" as someone who has been separated from adversely affected employment within a 3-year period. To be eligible for assistance under this section, an individual must be determined as an adversely affected worker within a 3-year period. The term 'affected State' refers to states with adversely affected employment. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, establishes criteria for eligibility. The Secretaries of various departments will determine if an individual meets the eligibility requirements. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with other officials, will certify industries or occupations with adversely affected employment. The Secretary of Labor certifies industries or occupations with adversely affected employment, with a conclusive presumption that layoffs are due to compliance with environmental protection laws. The Secretary of Labor certifies industries or occupations with adversely affected employment, with a conclusive presumption that layoffs are due to compliance with environmental protection laws. Grants may be awarded to States for this purpose. The Secretary may award grants to provide training, adjustment assistance, and employment services to adversely affected workers, as well as needs-related payments. Grant amounts are based on the per capita incidence of affected workers in each State. Rural areas are also eligible for grants. The Secretary may award grants for training, adjustment assistance, employment services, and needs-related payments to adversely affected workers in rural areas. To be eligible for a grant, applicants must submit an application with required assurances to the Secretary. The applicant must submit the application for review to the private industry council and the State, offer local labor organizations the opportunity to provide comments, and maintain documentation of consultations. The Secretary will not approve a grant application unless it includes assurances for needs-related payments. Grants under subsection (c) must include assurances for needs-related payments and may be used for various purposes under section 314, including job search allowances for adversely affected workers. The job search allowance reimburses up to 90% of necessary expenses or $800, as regulated by the Secretary. The Secretary approves the need for a greater amount in job search allowances for adversely affected workers who have been totally separated and cannot secure suitable employment in their commuting area. Regulations are prescribed for needs-related payments to help workers complete training or education programs. Regulations for needs-related payments require that payments are provided to adversely affected workers who qualify for emergency or extended unemployment benefits, are participating in training programs, and have a total family income below a certain threshold. The regulations for needs-related payments ensure that adversely affected workers can receive payments if they qualify for emergency or extended unemployment benefits, participate in training programs, and have a family income below a certain threshold. This includes provisions for not disqualifying workers who terminate temporary or part-time employment to join a training or education program. The regulations for needs-related payments ensure that adversely affected workers enrolled in training programs can receive payments based on special needs, with levels equal to the higher of applicable unemployment compensation or the official poverty line. The Community Services Block Grant Act outlines provisions for needs-related payments to adversely affected workers, including adjustments based on total family income. Grantees must provide counseling and referrals to training programs within 45 days of qualifying for unemployment benefits. The Secretary of Labor may reserve up to 5% of awards for administrative expenses, including technical assistance for grant applications. Priority is given to nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. The Job Training Reform Amendments authorize $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and additional funds for the following years up to a total of $500,000,000. Amounts appropriated will remain available until expended. The Secretary must establish regulations within 180 days of enactment. The Comptroller General will assess the employment effects of compliance with environmental policies. The provisions of various environmental acts will be assessed for their impact on employment, with a report due to Congress four years after enactment. The Job Training Partnership Act's table of contents is amended to include assessments required under paragraph (1) regarding the impact of environmental acts on employment. Sec. 327 of the Job Training Partnership Act addresses environmental employment transition assistance. Section 3(b) is amended to include references to both sections 326 and 327."
