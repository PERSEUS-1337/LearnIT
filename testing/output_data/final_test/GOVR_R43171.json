    "content": "Head Start is a federal program providing early childhood development services to low-income children and families since 1965. Services include education, health, nutrition, and social services to enhance school readiness. Administered by the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Head Start program provides early childhood development services to low-income children and families through local grantees. A 2007 law introduced a five-year designation period for grantees, requiring high-quality services or re-competition. This report gives an overview of the Designation Renewal System (DRS) established by HHS. The report outlines the milestones leading to the early implementation of the DRS, focusing on indicators for re-competition and legal challenges related to the Head Start program. Congress showed interest in increasing competition in Head Start, leading to the 2007 law introducing the DRS. The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-134) required HHS to implement a Designation Renewal System to identify low-performing grantees for re-competition, reauthorizing Head Start through FY2012. The Designation Renewal System (DRS) was mandated by the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 to identify low-performing grantees for re-competition. The DRS aims to assess if Head Start agencies are delivering high-quality programs meeting educational, health, nutritional, and social needs, along with program and financial management standards. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for developing the DRS in consultation with experts, using various criteria such as budget data, program monitoring reviews, audits, and classroom quality assessments. The Designation Renewal System (DRS) was established by the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 to identify low-performing grantees for re-competition based on criteria such as budget data, program monitoring reviews, audits, and classroom quality assessments. The DRS does not expect the majority of Head Start programs to re-compete, as most are believed to deliver high-quality services. The 2007 reauthorization law established the Designation Renewal System (DRS) to identify low-performing Head Start grantees for re-competition. An advisory committee recommended a system with automatic and key quality indicators to improve program performance. The advisory committee recommended using automatic indicators for serious problems that would require grantees to compete for renewal, such as bankruptcy or license revocation. Key quality indicators would trigger competition for poor performance across multiple areas like program management and financial management. In September 2010, HHS proposed re-competing at least 25% of Head Start and Early Head Start grantees based on performance indicators for program quality, licensing, operations, and fiscal controls. The proposal aimed to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality service providers. The NPRM proposed automatic re-competition for low-performing Head Start grantees based on performance indicators. The final rule eliminated the 25% requirement and sought feedback on identifying additional low-performing grantees. Approximately 16,000 comments were received from stakeholders during the public comment period. The final rule on the Designation Renewal System (DRS) was published by HHS in November 2011, becoming effective on December 9, 2011. It established seven indicators for identifying low-performing Head Start grantees who must compete for continued funding. The Designation Renewal System (DRS) established indicators for identifying low-performing Head Start grantees who must compete for continued funding based on deficiencies, lack of school-readiness goals, low CLASS scores, or license revocation. The final rule for the Designation Renewal System (DRS) outlines seven indicators that may require Head Start grantees to compete for funding, including license revocation, operations suspension, debarment from receiving funds, and being at risk of ceasing operations. The main difference between the proposed and final rule is the elimination of certain criteria. The final rule for the Designation Renewal System (DRS) eliminated a provision from the NPRM that would have required 25% of grantees to compete for continued funding. Instead, grantees must compete if they fail to meet quality thresholds on CLASS: Pre-K assessments. HHS estimated that about one-third of all programs would need to re-compete. Special provisions are included for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Head Start programs that fail to meet minimum standards. The Head Start and Early Head Start programs must meet minimum standards or face a quality improvement plan. If they still do not deliver high-quality services, a competition may be held for their area, with preference given to AIAN programs. The Head Start program must meet standards and undergo monitoring reviews every three years to ensure compliance. Agencies with deficiencies are subject to follow-up visits and unannounced site inspections. The Head Start program requires compliance with performance standards, and deficiencies are identified through monitoring reviews. A deficiency may result from misuse of funds or failure to ensure the safety of children and staff. Grantees must correct deficiencies promptly or through a Quality Improvement Plan within one year. Under the Head Start program, grantees must promptly correct deficiencies identified through monitoring reviews to comply with performance standards. Failure to do so within one year may lead to termination or denial of refunding. Deficiencies related to health and safety issues trigger re-competition, regardless of how quickly they are corrected. In FY2009, 4.6% of grantees had deficiencies, mainly concerning threats to the health and safety of children or staff. The Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) is used to measure classroom quality, specifically designed for preschool children aged 3-5. It assesses Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. CLASS observations are conducted by trained \"CLASS Observers.\" CLASS Observers, certified and trained, code classroom interactions using a 7-point scale across domains. Grantees facing re-competition score below thresholds in Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, or Instructional Support. The CLASS: Pre-K component does not apply to Early Head Start or home-based programs serving infants and toddlers. According to the final rule, HHS will incorporate a measure of teacher-child interaction in Early Head Start and Home-based programs. New grants awarded after December 9, 2011, will be designated for a five-year period. Existing grantees will transition to the new rule over a three-year period, with evaluations conducted on specific indicators. HHS planned to evaluate grantees against DRS indicators over three years. Two cohorts of grantees were notified to re-compete for funding based on assessment results. Once designated for re-competition, funding availability is announced for a new competition. HHS began posting Funding Opportunity Announcements for DRS competitions in 2012, with funding opportunities opened to applicants serving families within the same service areas as current grantees. Service areas are defined as unique geographic areas where Head Start services are provided, requiring individual competitions for each grantee's slot to ensure coverage. DRS competitions may lead to larger service areas being divided based on applicant interest and capacity. HHS established a grant application toolkit to support agencies applying for Head Start competitions. The toolkit provides information on how to apply, evaluation criteria, and FAQs. Grants were awarded to 153 successful applicants from Cohort 1 competitions in July 2013, with some grants split among multiple agencies for effectiveness. In April 2013, HHS announced that roughly 80 of the original Cohort 1 grantees would continue to receive funding, 25 would be replaced, and 14 would have their grants split. Three-quarters of Cohort 1 grantees will retain their grants. Some competitions had no successful applicants, requiring new competitions. Six grants were included in the Birth-to-Five Pilot competition. Funding opportunity announcements for Cohort 2 grantees were issued in July 2013. Opportunity announcements for Cohort 2 grantees were issued on July 25, 2013. Grantees designated for re-competition do not have the right to appeal DRS decisions, as stated in the final rule. HHS did not adopt a policy for appeals despite some comments requesting it. Non-profit associations filed a lawsuit challenging the lawfulness of the \"single deficiency trigger\" in the final rule. In Ohio Head Start v. Dep't. Health and Human Serv., associations sued over the \"single deficiency trigger\" in final regulations for Head Start grants. They argued it was retroactive, deprived grantees of due process, and was arbitrary and capricious. The court dismissed the challenges, stating the trigger applied to future grants, not current ones. The court ruled that the DRS applies to future grants, not current ones, and is not retroactive. It also found that the plaintiffs did not show a protected property or liberty interest that needed protection, and the agency provided sufficient due process. Additionally, the court held that the rule was not arbitrary or capricious, allowing the Secretary to choose a single deficiency trigger instead of re-competing programs with specific deficiencies. The plaintiffs sought an injunction to halt the DRS implementation, but the district court denied it. The district court denied the injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to show likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, which was affirmed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. HHS is evaluating the DRS for program quality improvement. HHS awarded an evaluation contract in 2012 to improve the quality of Head Start programs through competition, running through 2015."
