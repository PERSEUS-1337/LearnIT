    "content": "To determine constitutional limits on Congress delegating authority, courts must first classify the entity as private or governmental. This distinction is crucial for reviewing constitutional issues related to delegation. The public-private divide is fundamental, with constitutional provisions like the Due Process Clause applying only to governmental entities. The nondelegation doctrine is relevant when Congress improperly delegates to private entities. Federal agencies are typically considered governmental entities. Courts struggle to classify government-created corporations as public or private entities, as legislative declarations are not definitive. Various tests are used to determine their status, especially for \"boundary agencies\" with mixed government and private involvement. The judiciary's approach to these entities' constitutional status remains uncertain. In Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, the Supreme Court reviewed a determination by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that concluded Amtrak was a private entity regarding Congress's power to delegate regulatory authority. The D.C. Circuit invalidated joint regulations established by Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration under the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. These regulations set performance metrics and standards to enforce Amtrak's statutory priority over other trains. The Supreme Court reviewed a case involving Amtrak's priority over freight trains on railroad tracks. The D.C. Circuit initially ruled against Amtrak, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision, stating that Amtrak is a governmental entity, not a private one. The Supreme Court determined that Amtrak is a governmental entity based on federal control and supervision, despite Congress's disclaimer of its governmental status. The Court considered factors such as ownership, political branches' supervision, statutory goals, day-to-day management, and federal financial support in reaching this conclusion. Amtrak, despite Congress's disclaimer, is considered a governmental entity due to its ties to the Government, extensive supervision, and substantial funding by the political branches. The Court emphasized Amtrak's control, creation, and operation for the Government's benefit, leading to the conclusion that it acted as a governmental entity in joint issuance of metrics and standards with FRA. The Court highlighted the need for Amtrak's exercise of governmental power to align with the Constitution's separation-of-powers provisions. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider the nondelegation, due process, and other constitutional claims raised by the plaintiffs in light of the determination that Amtrak is a governmental entity. It is difficult to predict how the Association of American Railroads test will apply to other government-created corporations or entities performing government functions. Courts have typically taken a holistic approach when applying this multifactor test. In a holistic manner, courts use a multifactor test to determine the governmental status of entities. For example, in a 2016 case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit examined factors to establish that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) was a government entity. The court considered law enforcement participation, government officials on its board, and government funding. Once NCMEC's status was determined, the court addressed Fourth Amendment violations in a warrantless email search. Congress's authority to delegate and privatize governmental functions is limited by constitutional principles such as the nondelegation doctrine, Due Process Clause, and Appointments Clause. Courts have applied these principles in legal challenges regarding the scope and manner of delegation, types of entities involved, nature of delegated powers, and authority to appoint individuals exercising certain powers. The Supreme Court has defined legislative power as the power to make laws, prohibiting Congress from delegating this authority. The nondelegation doctrine limits Congress's authority to delegate legislative power to other governmental entities, based on the separation of powers principle. The Supreme Court allows limited delegation of authority to governmental entities if Congress provides an \"intelligible principle\" to govern the delegation. The Supreme Court allows limited delegation of legislative authority to governmental entities based on the \"intelligible principle\" test. Congress must provide a legal framework to guide and constrain the authority of the delegatee, such as a federal executive agency. Congressional delegation often includes the authority for rulemaking by federal agencies. The Court has upheld broad congressional delegations to federal agencies under the \"intelligible principle\" test, only invalidating federal laws twice under this test. The Supreme Court limits delegation of legislative authority to private entities, as seen in Carter v. Carter Coal Co where a law granting authority to regulate coal industry was invalidated. The Supreme Court has limited delegation of legislative authority to private entities, as shown in Carter v. Carter Coal Co where a law regulating the coal industry was invalidated. In Currin v. Wallace, the Court upheld a law allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations for the tobacco market only if two-thirds of growers in that market approved. This shows that private parties can have a limited role in the regulatory process. In Carter Coal, the Supreme Court upheld Congress's legislative authority in making regulations for the coal industry. Similarly, in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, private coal producers could propose standards for coal prices, but the government had the final say through the National Bituminous Coal Commission. This shows the limited role private entities have in the regulatory process. The Sunshine Anthracite Court upheld the validity of the statutory scheme, emphasizing that the commission, not private industry entities, set final industry prices. In Currin and Adkins, the Supreme Court focused on whether private entities had legislative or regulatory authority, determining that as long as their responsibilities were administrative or advisory, the nondelegation doctrine was not violated. Other courts have used this precedent to support limited delegation of authority to private entities. The nondelegation doctrine allows limited delegation of authority to private entities as long as the government retains oversight. Courts have ruled that private entities can perform administrative or advisory functions with government oversight without violating the doctrine. This doctrine aims to prevent Congress from giving away its legislative power. The nondelegation doctrine allows limited delegation of authority to private entities with government oversight to prevent Congress from giving away its legislative power. Delegations of authority may raise constitutional concerns if they deny due process, ensuring fairness and unbiased decision-making. Issues can arise when profit-seeking corporations are delegated coercive regulatory power, potentially violating the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Delegations of authority to private entities with coercive regulatory power may raise Due Process concerns, as seen in the Carter Coal case. The Supreme Court highlighted the issue of providing regulatory authority to private entities, emphasizing the difference between private activities and governmental functions. Delegating regulatory power to private entities can raise Due Process concerns, as seen in the Carter Coal case. The Supreme Court emphasized the distinction between private activities and governmental functions, stating that conferring such power interferes with personal liberty and private property, violating the nondelegation doctrine and the Due Process Clause. The Carter Coal case raised concerns about delegating regulatory power to private entities, violating the nondelegation doctrine and Due Process Clause. The Court was primarily concerned with the self-interested nature of the delegatees, who may have conflicting interests. This issue has also arisen in cases involving government-created corporations with both private and governmental aspects, as Congress creates different types of corporations to support legislative objectives and provide government services. Congress has established for- and nonprofit \"private corporations\" managed by boards of directors, not declared as \"agencies\" or \"instrumentalities\" of the Government. For example, Amtrak was created in 1970 to provide railroad passenger service as a for-profit corporation. The use of corporations with public and private aspects has complicated court analysis of challenges to delegated authority. The D.C. Circuit has scrutinized government-created corporations for potential violations of the Due Process Clause. In American Railroads II, the court reviewed whether delegating authority to Amtrak, a for-profit corporation, violated due process. This case followed a Supreme Court ruling that Amtrak is a governmental entity. The D.C. Circuit reviewed the delegation of authority to Amtrak as a \"public-private enterprise\" for potential violations of the Due Process Clause. The court highlighted concerns about the increasing reliance on public-private partnerships and the delegation of coercive power to private parties, emphasizing the need to curb the misuse of public power. This decision does not prevent Congress from exploring innovative approaches like the Amtrak experiment. The court ruled that Congress must choose for its chartered entities to either compete in the market or regulate as official bodies, as doing both violates due process. Giving a self-interested entity regulatory authority over its competitors is deemed unconstitutional. The court emphasized the importance of preventing self-interested entities from having rulemaking power over others. The D.C. Circuit court found that delegating regulatory authority to a self-interested entity with power over its competitors would violate due process. This distinction between a self-interested governmental entity and an official governmental body is crucial in preventing unconstitutional interference with personal liberty and private property. The court viewed Amtrak as a separate government entity subject to different scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. Amtrak's regulatory power over competitors was highlighted, with non-compliance increasing the risk of enforcement. The court invalidated the provision of joint regulatory authority to Amtrak under PRIIA, citing fairness concerns. Future judicial decisions will likely further define the American Railroads II due process test as courts apply it to different types of government-created corporations. Privatization of government services may also raise concerns regarding the Appointments Clause. Clear rules are needed for the application of constitutional principles to privatization forms utilized by Congress. The applicability of constitutional principles to \"private\" entities created by Congress can be complex. The key question is whether the entity exercises the sovereign authority of the United States. For example, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) created by Congress in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 operates like private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry. The essential issue for constitutional purposes is whether the entity is charged with carrying out the government's sovereign power. The PCAOB was established by Congress as a private entity but its members are considered government officers due to their delegated governmental duties. In Free Enterprise v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, it was determined that the PCAOB is a governmental entity. In Association of American Railroads, concerns were raised about the appointment method for the president of Amtrak violating the Appointments Clause. The Appointments Clause of the Constitution requires officers of the United States to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. This clause ensures a separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Congress passed legislation to remove the voting powers of Amtrak's president, reducing the position's authority. The Appointments Clause ensures accountability for executive branch actions by vesting decision-making in individuals accountable to the President. The Constitution prohibits Congress from appointing officers and limits the diffusion of appointment power. The degree of authority determines officer status under the Appointments Clause. The Buckley Court examined the appointment of FEC members charged with regulating federal elections. They distinguished three types of powers the members exercised, including functions related to information flow, implementation of the statute, and enforcement of the statute. The Court held that investigative and informative duties were not executive in nature. The Buckley Court distinguished between different types of powers exercised by FEC members, including functions related to information flow, implementation of the statute, and enforcement of the statute. While investigative and informative duties were not considered executive in nature, duties related to implementation and enforcement were deemed to require officers appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause. In Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Supreme Court determined that special trial judges of the U.S. Tax Court qualify as officers of the United States due to the significance of their duties. Unlike special masters, special trial judges have specific duties, salary, and means of appointment outlined in statute, and they exercise significant discretion in their roles. The Supreme Court ruled that special trial judges of the U.S. Tax Court are considered officers of the United States due to their significant duties and authority granted by statute. The constitutional status of Administrative Law Judges at the SEC remains uncertain, as shown by a circuit split among federal courts of appeals. The SEC is responsible for enforcing federal securities laws through administrative proceedings and federal court. ALJs preside over administrative actions similar to a trial, with decisions appealable to the Commissioners and federal court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit found that ALJs at the SEC qualify as officers under the Appointments Clause due to their discretionary duties and statutory establishment. ALJs at the SEC have discretion similar to officers in Freytag, including taking testimony, ruling on evidence, issuing subpoenas, and making credibility determinations. They can render initial decisions and issue sanctions, which can become final. ALJs can also enter default judgments, control proceedings, and modify temporary sanctions. The D.C. Circuit has a different view on the significance of their authority based on the matters resolved, discretion exercised, and finality of decisions. The D.C. Circuit court determined that SEC ALJs do not meet the finality requirement as their decisions are subject to review by the Commission. This means that ALJs do not qualify as officers under the Appointments Clause. The distinction between principal officers and inferior officers based on significant authority is less clear. The distinction between principal and inferior officers under the Appointments Clause is not clearly defined. The Supreme Court has used different tests to determine this distinction, including evaluating the degree of authority exercised and the level of supervision and control by a principal officer. In Edmond v. United States, the Court emphasized that the key factor is whether the officer is subject to supervision by a principal officer. The Appointments Clause distinguishes between principal and inferior officers based on the level of supervision and control. The President's power to remove executive officers is essential, as outlined by the Supreme Court in cases like Myers v. United States. The President must retain some control over officers appointed by Congress to uphold the Constitution's vestment of executive power. The Supreme Court's decision in Myers v. United States granted the President the power of appointment and removal of executive officers without Senate approval. However, this broad holding was limited in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, where Congress was found to have the authority to limit the President's ability to remove members of certain agencies like the Federal Trade Commission. The Court distinguished between purely executive departments and agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions, allowing for decreased presidential control in the latter. The Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on the removal of certain inferior officers, as seen in Morrison v. Olson. The Court examined restrictions on the removal of executive officers to determine if Congress interfered with the President's executive power. The statute in question allowed for the appointment of an independent counsel who could only be removed for cause by the Attorney General. The Court acknowledged the counsel's independence but ultimately upheld the statute. The Supreme Court has set limits on Congress's ability to shield executive branch officers from removal. In Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, the Court ruled that dual \"for cause\" removal protections impaired the President's ability to execute the laws. This decision was a departure from previous cases like Morrison v. Olson, where restrictions on the removal of inferior officers were upheld. Efforts to privatize governmental functions must respect the limits set forth by the Appointments Clause, ensuring that positions with significant authority comply with its requirements. Restrictions on the President's power to remove such officers should not impair his duty to execute the laws of the United States."
