The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a 5-year pilot project under the Medicare program to test models for providing payment for training primary care residents at medical education entities not eligible for such payments. The pilot project under the Medicare program will test models for funding primary care residency training programs at medical education entities collaborating with hospitals. One model involves a community-based corporate entity working with hospitals, while another model includes a corporate entity established by hospitals with community representation on the governing board. The pilot project under the Medicare program will test models for funding primary care residency training programs at medical education entities collaborating with hospitals. One model involves a community-based corporate entity working with hospitals, while another model includes a corporate entity established by hospitals with community representation on the governing board. The models include a hospital subsidiary or independent corporation operating primary care residency programs with community participation in governance, and an independent medical education entity collaborating with a hospital to operate residency programs. Under the pilot project, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may prioritize testing models of medical education entities to improve primary care physician quantity and quality, especially in rural and underserved areas. Payments will be made to participating medical education entities for direct graduate medical education. Under the pilot project, participating medical education entities may receive payments for direct graduate medical education costs related to primary care residents in a residency program. Payments will be made instead of the usual payments for indirect and direct graduate medical education costs under the Social Security Act. The primary care graduate medical education residency program under the pilot project will receive payments based on the 95th percentile of payment amounts for direct gme and additional payment amounts for indirect gme received by hospitals. The pilot project for primary care graduate medical residency training programs may receive additional payments for serving underserved areas and changing training sites. The Secretary will allocate payments from Medicare trust funds to medical education entities. The Secretary will allocate payments from Medicare trust funds to medical education entities for training primary care residents in appropriate settings. The primary care graduate medical residency training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association cover topics such as patient care, care management, teamwork, supervision, and quality improvement. Payments for training primary care residents are limited to initial board certification, except for geriatric medicine where fellowship training after certification is also covered. Medical education entities participating in the pilot project can increase the number of full-time equivalent primary care residents by up to 50 percent. After the pilot project, participant hospitals of medical education entities will receive payments under section 1886 of the Social Security Act based on the number of full-time equivalent primary care residents. The funding for primary care residency training programs will be based on the number of full-time equivalent residents enrolled, regardless of any increases. Medical education entities participating in the pilot project will continue to receive funding for each primary care resident enrolled during the project to ensure completion of training. The pilot project for primary care residency training programs limits payments to medical education entities to seven years. The Secretary will adjust payments under specific sections of the Social Security Act to maintain budget neutrality during the project. The Secretary may waive requirements of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act for the pilot project. An agreement with the Institute of Medicine will conduct a study on the pilot project's results, with a report due to Congress within 1 year of completion. The pilot project aims to evaluate the impact on primary care physicians' quality, quantity, and distribution. Recommendations will be made for expanding the project to all primary care residents. If successful, similar training projects may be initiated. Definitions for the project are provided for clarity. Definitions for the pilot project include terms like direct and indirect graduate medical education costs, medical education entity, and Medicare beneficiary. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to participant hospitals, primary care graduate medical residency training programs, and primary care residents. These terms are crucial for understanding the operation of a primary care graduate medical residency training program under a specific model. A resident is defined as an individual enrolled in an approved medical residency training program in family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, or geriatric medicine."
