    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to needlestick safety. The Congress acknowledges the occupational risks of bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, to workers. Despite OSHA's 1991 standard reducing these risks, accidental sharps injuries in healthcare settings still pose a threat. Accidental sharps injuries in healthcare settings remain a serious problem, with an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 needlestick injuries occurring annually among healthcare workers in the United States. Since the implementation of the bloodborne pathogens standard in 1991, there has been a significant increase in effective engineering controls, including safer medical devices, to prevent such injuries. Numerous stakeholders responded to a 1998 Request for Information by OSHA on controls to reduce occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Studies show that using safer medical devices can effectively reduce accidental sharps injuries. In March 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 62 to 88 percent of sharps injuries can be prevented by using safer medical devices. Healthcare facilities have adopted surveillance systems to better reflect injuries involving bloodborne pathogens. Training in safer medical device use and work practices is crucial for prevention. The prevention of percutaneous exposure incidents and reduction of sharps injuries are crucial in healthcare settings. Staff involvement in device selection and modification of the bloodborne pathogens standard to require the use of effective safer medical devices are key elements in achieving this goal. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard is outlined in Section 3. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) will be revised to include safer medical devices like sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems. \"Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections\" will be defined as nonneedle sharp or needle devices with built-in safety features. \"Needleless Systems\" will be defined as devices that do not require needles for procedures. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) will be revised to include safer medical devices like sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems. The revised standard defines \"Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections\" as devices without needles for fluid collection or administration, and \"Needleless Systems\" as devices that do not require needles for procedures. Additionally, exposure control plans must reflect technological changes to reduce exposure and consider implementing safer medical devices annually. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard will include a requirement for employers to establish and maintain a sharps injury log for recording percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. The log must include details such as the type and brand of device involved, the department where the incident occurred, and an explanation of how it happened. This requirement does not apply to employers who are not required to maintain an occupational injury log. An employer not obligated to keep a log of work-related injuries must maintain a sharps injury log as per 29 CFR 1904.6. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard now mandates employers to involve non-managerial employees in selecting controls for sharps injuries in the Exposure Control Plan. SEC. 4. EFFECT OF MODIFICATIONS. The modifications under section 3 will be in force until superseded by regulations from the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. They will be enforced similarly to any other rule or regulation under the Act. SEC. 5. PROCEDURE AND EFFECTIVE DATE. The modifications to the bloodborne pathogens standard, as prescribed in section 3, will take effect without following the usual procedural requirements. Within 6 months of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor will publish the modifications in the Federal Register, and they will become effective 90 days after publication. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \n\n\"Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States.\""
