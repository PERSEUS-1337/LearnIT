The \"HIV/AIDS Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2007\" authorizes $30 billion for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, with additional funding as needed in subsequent years. Section 403(a) of the Act is amended to allocate at least 50 percent of funds for programs focusing on preventing sexual transmission of HIV through abstinence, fidelity, and condom use, while excluding new prevention technologies like medical male circumcision or pre-exposure prophylaxis from compliance calculations. Section 403(b) of the Act is amended to extend Orphans and Vulnerable Children Funding Requirement from 2008 to 2013. SEC. 4. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that President George W. Bush announced a $30 billion proposal to fight global HIV/AIDS, exceeding the original commitment. After 3 years, PEPFAR has supported treatment for over 1 million people in Africa and is on track to meet its goals. PEPFAR in Africa is on track to meet its 5-year goals, including treatment for 2,000,000 people, prevention of 7,000,000 new infections, and care for 10,000,000 people. The success of PEPFAR is attributed to country-owned strategies, commitment of resources, and partnerships with various organizations. United States efforts to address global HIV/AIDS are enhanced through partnerships with countries and multilateral partners like the Global Fund. President Bush aims to double the United States' commitment to combat global HIV/AIDS, urging developed and developing countries to increase their contributions. The purpose of this Act is to expand PEPFAR, including life-saving treatment. HIV/AIDS is a global crisis that requires a collective response. In the next 5 years, the United States plans to expand life-saving treatment, prevention programs, and care for orphans and vulnerable children to support global efforts in addressing health crises. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL FUND. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria receives increased proportional support from the United States, the largest contributor to the Fund. The President may increase proportional support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria if benchmarks for performance, accountability, and transparency are met, and if the Fund remains committed to its founding principles. The United States Global AIDS Coordinator should consider specific benchmarks in assessing the annual contribution of the United States Government to the Fund. Increased proportional support for the Fund is contingent upon meeting benchmarks for transparency and accountability, including establishing standardized expectations for Local Fund Agents' performance, conducting systematic assessments, and making performance data publicly available. The Fund requires transparency and accountability, including audits by an independent Inspector General, standard indicators for all program areas, and a database tracking funds disbursed to sub-recipients. The Fund Board has established penalties to offset tariffs on goods and services, terminated its Administrative Services Agreement with the World Health Organization, and transitioned the Fund Secretariat to a fully independent status. The Fund has established benchmarks related to its founding principles, including maintaining its status as a financing institution and focusing on programs related to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Fund Board must also adhere to a Comprehensive Funding Policy requiring confirmed pledges to cover new grants before approval. The Fund must maintain its multi-sectoral approach through Country Coordinating Mechanisms and in grant implementation. Section 202(d) of the Act is amended to extend authorization from 2008 to 2013."
