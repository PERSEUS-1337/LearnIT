    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Homeland Security Information Sharing Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. The \"Homeland Security Information Sharing Act\" finds that the Federal Government must protect every State from invasion, including terrorist attacks. It relies on State and local personnel for protection and manages sensitive information for national security. State and local personnel need access to homeland security information to combat terrorism while preserving the protected status of the information. Granting security clearances to State and local personnel facilitates sharing specific terrorist threat information among different levels of government. Methods exist to declassify classified information for sharing without additional clearances. State and local personnel have unique capabilities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats. This information sharing benefits the intelligence community and governments at all levels. Federal, State, and local governments, along with intelligence, law enforcement, and emergency response agencies, must collaborate to gather and analyze information to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Information systems like the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System allow for rapid sharing of sensitive information. Efforts to share homeland security information should not duplicate existing systems. Congress believes that sharing homeland security information among Federal, State, and local entities should be maximized. SEC. 3. FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SHARING PROCEDURES.
