In 2012, 23.9 million Americans aged 12 or older were current drug users, including users of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana, and prescription drugs. President Obama identified 17 Western Hemisphere countries as major drug transit or producing countries in 2013. Drug trafficking from Andean countries like Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, as well as Colombia and Mexico, fuels violence, instability, and corruption. In transit countries like Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean, organized criminals use drug trafficking to threaten law enforcement, political institutions, and citizen security. Mexico continues to face drug trafficking-related violence. Between December 2006 and December 2012, an estimated 70,000 people died in Mexico and 25,000 disappeared due to drug trafficking and organized crime-related violence. In 2013, over 11,500 more deaths occurred in Mexico. Foreign Terrorist Organizations like FARC and Hezbollah have used drug trafficking to fund their activities in the Western Hemisphere. The United States allocated around $15.7 billion for counternarcotics programs in Latin America and the Caribbean from 1980 to 2012.
