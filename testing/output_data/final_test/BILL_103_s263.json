    "content": "DEDUCTION FOR STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PRACTICING IN RURAL AREAS. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code allows for the deduction of qualified medical education interest for medical professionals practicing in rural areas. The term 'qualified medical education interest' is defined as the interest paid on qualified educational loans by an individual under a qualified rural medical practice agreement. The total amount of qualified medical education interest that can be claimed in a taxable year is limited to $5,000. A qualified rural medical practice agreement is a written agreement for medical professionals practicing in rural areas. A 'medical practice agreement' is a written agreement between an individual and a rural community where the individual agrees to work full-time as a medical professional in the rural community for 24 consecutive months after completing their residency or education. An applicable rural community can choose a 36-month agreement instead of 24 months. To meet the requirement, an individual must work full-time as a medical professional in the community for 9 months in each 12-month period within the chosen timeframe. The term 'applicable rural community' refers to a political subdivision with a population of 5,000 or less and a per capita income of $15,000 or less, or an Indian reservation with a per capita income of $15,000 or less. A 'qualified educational loan' is defined as indebtedness for qualified tuition, related expenses, and reasonable living expenses. Qualified educational loans for medical students include expenses for courses necessary for certification as a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant at eligible educational institutions. These expenses must be paid within a reasonable timeframe before or after the student incurs the debt. Failure to fulfill a rural medical practice agreement results in the disallowance of deductions related to the agreement. The Internal Revenue Code allows deductions for interest on student loans of rural health practitioners, including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician's assistants. Definitions for these terms are based on the Social Security Act. The deduction for interest on student loans of rural health professionals, including medical professionals practicing in rural areas, applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
