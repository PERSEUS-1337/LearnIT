    "content": "Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution and the Twenty-Seventh Amendment address the compensation of Members of Congress. The most recent pay adjustment for Members of Congress was in January 2009, with most receiving $174,000 annually, except for the Speaker of the House who receives $223,500. Members of Congress receive a salary of $174,000 annually, with exceptions for certain leadership positions. Historical tables on pay rates since 1789, details on legislation prohibiting automatic pay adjustments, and comparisons of projected vs. actual adjustments are provided in this report. Additional information on pay and benefits for Members of Congress is available in other CRS products. Former Members of Congress may be eligible for retirement benefits after their service, as discussed in CRS Report RL30631. Health insurance options for Members are detailed in CRS Report R43194, while compensation, benefits, and limitations are outlined in CRS Report RL30064. Member pay can be adjusted through specific legislation or recommendations from the President. The salary of top-level federal officials, including Members of Congress, can be changed through recommendations from the President or specific legislation. In 1967, Congress established a commission to recommend salary increases, which was later replaced by the Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation. Annual adjustments were also made based on comparability increases for General Schedule federal employees until 1990. The salary of top-level federal officials, including Members of Congress, can be changed through recommendations from the President or specific legislation. In 1975, a procedure was established for General Schedule federal employees' salary increases, with Congress accepting some and declining others. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 changed the method for determining annual adjustments for Members and senior officials based on private sector wages. The adjustment automatically goes into effect unless Congress prohibits or revises it, or GS employees' adjustment is lower. Under the revised method, annual adjustments for Members were accepted 13 times and denied 16 times. Discussion of Member pay adjustments occurs during consideration of annual appropriations bills, which do not contain funds for salaries or pay adjustments. Provisions prohibiting automatic pay adjustments for Members can be offered in any bill or introduced separately. The maximum potential Member pay adjustment for January 2020 was 2.6% or $4,500, based on data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The adjustment takes effect automatically unless denied or modified by Congress, limited by the General Schedule base pay adjustment. Similarly, the maximum potential Member pay adjustment for January 2019 was 2.3% or $4,000, based on ECI data released by the BLS. The 2019 GS base pay adjustment was 1.4%, limiting any Member pay adjustment to $2,400. The FY2019 legislative branch appropriations bill included provisions to prevent this adjustment. P.L. 115-244 enacted a pay freeze provision. The maximum potential January 2018 member pay adjustment was 1.8%, or $3,100. Each year, the adjustment takes effect automatically unless modified by Congress. In 2018, the GS base pay adjustment was 1.4%, limiting Member pay adjustment to $2,400. The FY2018 legislative branch appropriations bill aimed to prevent this adjustment, but was not enacted before the start of FY2018. The FY2018 legislative branch appropriations bill aimed to prevent a Member pay adjustment of 1.6% or $2,800 in FY2017, as specified in P.L. 115-56 and subsequent CRs. The maximum potential pay adjustment for 2018 was limited to $2,400 due to a 1.4% GS base pay adjustment. The FY2018 legislative branch appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit a Member pay adjustment, limiting it to a 1.6% increase in FY2017. This provision was carried over from previous bills and was included in the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017. The maximum potential pay adjustment for Members of Congress in 2018 was limited to $2,400 due to a 1.4% increase in GS base pay. The FY2016 legislative branch appropriations bill prohibited a pay adjustment for Members of Congress, limiting it to a 1.0% increase. This provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The maximum potential pay adjustment for Members in January 2015 was 1.6%, or $2,800, but was limited by law to match the increase in base salaries for GS employees. The FY2015 legislative branch appropriations bill prohibited a pay adjustment for Members of Congress, limiting it to a 1.0% increase in base salaries for General Schedule employees. This provision was included in the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. President Obama issued an alternative pay plan for federal civilian employees on August 29, 2014, calling for a 1.0% increase in base salaries for General Schedule employees. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 prohibited the scheduled 2014 pay adjustment for Members of Congress, limiting it to a 1.0% increase in base salaries for General Schedule employees. The maximum potential 2014 pay adjustment of 1.2% was known when the BLS released data for the change in the ECI. The President issued an alternate pay plan for civilian federal employees in August 2013, calling for a 1.0% pay increase in January 2014. Legislation did not prohibit the GS adjustment, resulting in a 1.0% increase for GS employees. If not prohibited, Members of Congress would have had a salary adjustment of 1.0%. The maximum potential pay adjustment for 2013 was 1.1%. The President's budget proposed a 0.5% adjustment for GS employees in February 2012. President Obama later extended the federal pay freeze until FY2013 budget negotiations were finalized in August 2012. The freeze was further extended through a continuing resolution in September 2012. President Obama signed an executive order on December 27, 2012 (P.L. 112-175) that included a 0.5% increase for GS base pay, affecting Member pay adjustments. This order listed the pay rates for Members of Congress for the upcoming year, with an annual adjustment set to take effect after the freeze included in the legislation. The executive order signed by President Obama in December 2012 automatically lowered Member pay adjustments by establishing the GS pay adjustment at a lower rate. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 froze Member pay at the 2009 level for 2013, which was reflected in Executive Order 13641 signed in April 2013. This was the second time Member pay was statutorily frozen for only a portion of the following year.

The projected 2011 pay adjustment of 0.9% was prohibited by H.R. 5146 in May 2010. Legislation introduced in Congress prevented the scheduled 2011 pay adjustment and froze Member pay until December 31, 2012. Members of Congress were originally set to receive a 2.1% pay adjustment in January 2010, but this was denied by Congress. The pay remained at $174,000, with no adjustments allowed beyond the GS base pay increase.

Bills were proposed to prohibit or reduce pay for Members of Congress during a lapse in appropriations. The House budget resolution for FY2016 included a policy statement that suggested holding congressional salaries in escrow if a concurrent budget resolution was not agreed upon by April 15. The Senate's resolution on the FY2016 budget did not include this language, but a conference report later included a \"Policy Statement on 'No Budget, No Pay'\".

H.R. 325 was enacted on February 4, 2013 (P.L. 113-3) after being agreed to in the House and Senate. H.R. 807, the Full Faith and Credit Act, was introduced in the House on February 25, 2013, and included an amendment excluding compensation for Members of Congress. The bill passed the House on May 13, 2013, but no further action was taken in the 113th Congress. The provision (Section 138) would prohibit borrowing to pay Members of Congress if the debt limit is reached before December 15, 2014. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to repeal automatic pay adjustments for Congress members, change pay adjustment procedures, and reduce their pay. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to alter pay for Members of Congress under certain conditions, freeze Member pay, and address pay in the event of a government shutdown.

Subsequent bills, H.R. 3835 and H.R. 6726, also aimed to extend the pay freeze for federal employees, including Members of Congress. H.R. 6726, introduced on January 1, 2013, extended the pay freeze for federal employees, including Members of Congress, until December 31, 2013. The bill passed the House on January 2, 2013. Tables provide a history of Members of Congress' salaries since 1789 and information on pay adjustments since 1992. Differences in projected and actual pay adjustments were due to legislation preventing increases in certain years. In some years, Member pay adjustments were limited to match GS base pay increases. Legislation has delayed or prohibited Member pay adjustments in various years. If adjustments had been received since 1992, the 2019 salary would be $210,900. Figure 3 lists laws that have delayed or prohibited Member pay adjustments, with enactment dates and provisions. Member salaries, adjusted for inflation, decreased by 15% from 2009 to 2019."
