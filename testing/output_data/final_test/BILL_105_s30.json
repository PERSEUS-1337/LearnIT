    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Farmer and Entrepreneur Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997\". Congress acknowledges the importance of savings for economic growth, noting a decline in savings levels over the past 25 years. This trend has led to lower productivity, stagnating wages, and reduced standards of living. To address this issue, Congress aims to reform the Federal tax code to eliminate bias against savings. The Federal tax code aims to end bias against savings by replacing income and capital gains taxes with a broad-based consumption tax. Repealing the estate and gift tax would further promote savings, investment, and economic growth, especially benefiting the small business sector. Eliminating the inheritance tax would benefit small businesses, particularly family-owned farms, by reducing compliance costs and preserving family assets. Nearly 95 percent of farms are owned by sole proprietors or family partnerships, making them vulnerable to estate taxes that can lead to the forced sale of land due to liquidity issues. The inheritance tax poses a significant burden on farmers and entrepreneurs, leading to the forced sale of productive assets to cover tax liabilities. Abolishing this tax would promote fairness in the Federal tax system and allow families to pass on their hard-earned assets without facing taxation. Despite its impact on the economy, estate and gift taxes only contribute about 1 percent of Federal tax revenues. Repealing estate and gift taxes is supported by various organizations and commissions, as more income tax is lost from individuals avoiding estate taxes than is collected at death. The text discusses an increase in the unified estate and gift tax credit by amending the Internal Revenue Code to adjust the applicable credit amount for estate tax purposes. The applicable exclusion amount for estate tax purposes is $5,000,000 for decedents dying in 1998 and thereafter. Various sections of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to reflect changes in tax rates and credit amounts. The unified gift tax credit amount is amended to reflect the applicable credit amount for the calendar year. The amendments apply to estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 1997."
