    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges the increasing number of Americans with criminal history records and the high incarceration rates in the U.S. California aims to help formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society for long-term economic growth. Section 1234 of the Penal Code is being amended. Section 1234 of the Penal Code is being amended to define terms related to the California Workforce Development Board and the Supervised Population Workforce Training Grant Program. This program aims to assist individuals on probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision with workforce training. The California Workforce Development Board will administer a grant program for workforce training for individuals on probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision. The program will be developed in consultation with stakeholders, funded by the Legislature, and outcomes reported accordingly. The California Workforce Development Board will administer a grant program for workforce training, with criteria for selection of recipients, outreach to small and rural counties, competitive grant awards, and emphasis on evidence-based practices for serving the supervised population's education and training needs. The grant program administered by the California Workforce Development Board addresses the education and training needs of individuals with postsecondary education for certifications and career advancement, as well as those requiring basic education for entry-level jobs. The program will be competitively awarded through two rounds of funding, with the first phase awarded by May 1, 2015. Each county can apply for the grant program, with the option for multiple counties to apply together. The application must include a partnership agreement with local workforce development boards. Projects must include an education and training assessment for each participant, which can be conducted by the applicant or another entity. Prior assessments may be used if deemed accurate by the California Workforce Development Board. Eligible uses of grant funds include vocational training, stipends for trainees, and earn and learn opportunities for the supervised population. Preference is given to applications with matching funds, involvement of county workforce training programs, and participation of nonprofit community-based organizations serving the supervised population. An application for grant funds must specify the purpose, criteria, and metrics for evaluating success. It should also identify the subset of the supervised population to be served, the industry sectors for training, and the workforce needs within those sectors. Employers interested in hiring individuals from the supervised population should be involved in the application. The grant recipient must define the methodology and training methods, monitor progress of the supervised population, and provide detailed reports to the California Workforce Development Board. The Board will use these reports to submit an annual report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018. The report will evaluate the success and effectiveness of the grant program, provide recommendations on the long-term viability of workforce development boards and county collaborations, and discuss the education and workforce readiness of participants entering the program. It will also assess whether the programs align with the workforce needs of high-demand sectors. The evaluation will assess if the program increased marketable certifications, job readiness, employment opportunities, and training related to skills learned while incarcerated. It will also consider the availability of job markets and support networks for finding employment post-release. The metrics used to evaluate grants should align with program objectives. The requirement for submitting a report will be inoperative on January 1, 2021. Reports must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code."
