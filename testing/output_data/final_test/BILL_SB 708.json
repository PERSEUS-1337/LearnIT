    "title": "SB 708",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to enhance access to child nutrition programs for children from refugee and immigrant households. Amendments to the Education Code require school districts to provide paper and online applications for free or reduced-price meals to students at all times during the school day. The applications must include clear instructions for homeless or migrant families. Applications for free and reduced-price meals can be submitted at any time during a schoolday without overtly identifying children in the National School Lunch Program. School districts must prioritize paper applications before using online applications, which must meet specific requirements. The legislation requires translated applications to be posted on the USDA website with submission instructions, completion of necessary questions for eligibility, clear instructions for homeless or migrant families, compliance with privacy rights laws, and links to CalFresh and health care applications. The legislation mandates translated applications on the USDA website with clear instructions for eligibility, homeless or migrant families, and links to CalFresh, health care, WIC, and summer lunch programs. No online application for free or reduced-price meals can be used by a private entity for non-related purposes or require applicants to waive rights or create user accounts. School districts must ensure equal treatment for eligible children and submit plans to the State Department of Education for approval. Children's names must not be disclosed or used for any purpose other than the National School Lunch Program. No special identification or work is required for meals. Children should have the same meal choices as those paying full price. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
