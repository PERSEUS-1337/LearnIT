    "content": "Products liability involves the civil liability of a manufacturer, seller, or other party in the product's chain for damages caused to a consumer or third-party user. In a lawsuit, a plaintiff seeks damages for injuries sustained while using the product, including medical expenses, disability, pain and suffering, lost earnings, property damage, emotional harm, and punitive damages. The plaintiff must prove reasonable product use and that the product had hazards or was improperly marketed. Products liability involves the civil liability of a manufacturer, seller, or other party in the product's chain for damages caused to a consumer or third-party user. A manufacturing defect is a mistake in the manufacturing process that causes the product to fail to meet design specifications, resulting in injury to a consumer. Manufacturing defects can include physically flawed, damaged, or incorrectly assembled products. Various causes of action, such as strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, and tortious misrepresentation, can be relied upon by a plaintiff seeking to recover damages. A manufacturing defect claim is less costly to litigate than design or warning defect claims as it focuses on a single unit. Jurisdictions often apply a \"strict liability\" standard, making it easier for a plaintiff to prevail. Manufacturers may settle cases if persuaded that a physical flaw in their product caused injury to a claimant. Manufacturers may be more inclined to litigate if they believe the product was not defective, the harm was caused by something else, or the plaintiff's damage claim is unreasonable. An example is seen in Colon ex rel. Molina v. BIC USA, Inc., where a plaintiff pursued a manufacturing defect claim after her child was injured by a disposable lighter missing a safety latch. The court did not dismiss the plaintiff's manufacturing defect claim in Colon ex rel. Molina v. BIC USA, Inc., as there was evidence that the lighter was defective and caused the injury. Design defect claims involve mistakes in a product's design that pose risks to consumers and are commonly brought against manufacturers. Design defect claims challenge the safety of an entire product line, unlike manufacturing defect claims which focus on individual products. Courts use \"consumer expectations\" and \"risk-utility\" tests to determine if a design defect exists. Design defect claims challenge product safety by assessing if the benefits of eliminating foreseeable danger outweigh the costs. Most jurisdictions now use a risk-utility or cost-benefit standard instead of the consumer expectations test. The Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability follows this trend, emphasizing a cost-benefit liability standard for design defects. In the case of Young v. Pollock Engineering Group Inc., the plaintiff suffered severe hand injuries due to a design defect in a die changer. The court highlighted the importance of assessing design defectiveness based on cost-benefit analysis. The court reversed the lower court's dismissal of the plaintiff's design defect claim, finding sufficient evidence of a defective design of the product at issue. A warning defect occurs when a manufacturer fails to provide adequate information about a product's known hazards, leading to preventable risks for consumers. The manufacturer's duty to warn includes informing buyers of hidden dangers and providing instructions on how to use the product safely. Warning defect claims are seen as cost-effective for both manufacturers and plaintiffs, but courts focus on the adequacy of the warnings provided. Warning defect claims focus on the adequacy of warnings provided by manufacturers to inform consumers about product dangers. Factors such as the severity of the danger, likelihood of the warning catching attention, intensity of the warning, and cost of improvement are considered in determining adequacy. In Carruth v. Pittway Corporation, plaintiffs brought a warning defect claim against a smoke detector manufacturer after a fire resulted in deaths, alleging inadequate warning literature. The plaintiffs alleged that the smoke detector's literature did not properly warn about installing it in \"dead air space,\" leading to improper functioning during a fire. The court ruled that warnings should not be conveyed in a way that prevents consumers from being adequately informed. The manufacturer's pamphlet mentioned the danger but in a lengthy document with small print, lacking emphasis on specific risks. The court found that the warning on the smoke detector was not adequately designed to attract the user's attention, allowing the plaintiffs to pursue a products liability lawsuit for a defective warning claim. Products liability law includes various causes of action that a plaintiff can assert, each with unique factors and defenses to consider when determining the likelihood of success. Many states have laws that codify these causes of action. In products liability law, states have laws that codify causes of action based on different theories of liability. Strict liability is a common theory where sellers or manufacturers can be held liable for damages caused by unreasonably dangerous products, regardless of negligence. The strict liability standard in products liability actions makes it easier for a plaintiff to recover damages from a manufacturer or seller for injuries caused by a defective product. This standard ensures compensation for consumers, deters the production of dangerous products, and promotes judicial efficiency. Most courts adopted this standard in the 1960s and 1970s, but there have been shifts in standards since then. Many courts now apply a strict liability standard to manufacturing defect claims, while evaluating design and warning defect claims under a negligence standard. The Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability reflects this approach, but courts still cite Section 402A jurisprudence. Despite the disjunction between what courts say and do, they continue to apply negligence principles to design and warning defect claims while claiming to apply strict liability. Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. was a landmark case in 1963 that established strict products liability. In Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc., a new doctrine of strict products liability was established by the Supreme Court of California. The court held that a manufacturer is strictly liable when a product, known to be used without inspection for defects, causes injury to a human being. This case exemplifies how courts may assess product defects under a strict liability standard. The court in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. established strict products liability, holding manufacturers liable for injuries caused by defects in their products, regardless of fault. Negligence, defined as a failure to exercise standard care, remained an alternative cause of action in products liability litigation. Negligence in products liability litigation has become important since the 1980s. To prove negligence, a plaintiff must show that the defendant had a duty to act, breached that duty, caused the plaintiff's injuries, and led to recoverable damages. In a products liability lawsuit, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the manufacturer produced a dangerous product, which caused injury and resulted in recoverable damages. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to show that the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care in designing or manufacturing the product. Negligence in products liability cases involves proving that the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care in designing or manufacturing the product. Courts assess negligence by weighing the cost of safety precautions against the benefits. Manufacturers are expected to mitigate high risks more carefully than minor risks. Negligence claims do not require a product to be perfect, only reasonably safe for its intended use. An example is Ford Motor Co. v. Bartholomew, where a negligence suit was filed after a car accident due to a design flaw. The plaintiff won a products liability lawsuit against the car manufacturer for a design defect in the transmission system that caused her car to roll backwards. An expert witness testified about the defect, and evidence showed the manufacturer was aware of it. The jury found the transmission system unsafe, leading to a \"false sense of security\" in the \"Park\" position. A products manufacturer can be held liable for breach of warranty if a consumer relies on false assertions about a product. Breach of warranty lawsuits are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, which recognizes express and implied warranties. An express warranty is a direct assertion about a product's performance, quality, or characteristics, while an implied warranty is a promise about a product's minimal standard of quality. A plaintiff can hold a manufacturer or seller liable for breach of warranty without proving negligence. In Forbes v. General Motors Corp., the plaintiff claimed breach of an express warranty when her car's airbag failed during an accident. The plaintiff argued that the product did not meet the warranty or factual representations she relied on. In Forbes v. General Motors Corp., the plaintiff claimed breach of an express warranty when her car's airbag failed during an accident. She argued that the airbag's failure made the car unreasonably dangerous and caused her injuries. The plaintiff presented evidence that the car's manual promised the airbag would deploy in an accident, and she paid extra for this feature based on the salesman's recommendation. The court found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the manufacturer breached the express warranty. In Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the plaintiff sued for breach of an implied warranty after suffering a serious injury from a pair of high heels that collapsed. Evidence showed the heels were made of plastic without support, leading to the conclusion that the goods were defective. In Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the plaintiff sued for breach of an implied warranty due to a serious injury caused by collapsible high heels made of defective plastic without support. The court found that evidence of the defect could lead to a reasonable jury conclusion of breach of warranty. Additionally, tortious misrepresentation can also be a cause of action if a manufacturer's false representation about a product harms a plaintiff who relied on it. This can be intentional or negligent misrepresentation, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff for fraudulent or negligent claims. Misrepresentation claims do not always require proof of product defect at the time of sale. However, proving manufacturer's awareness of false statements and reasonable reliance by the plaintiff can be challenging. Plaintiffs face a high pleading standard and must meet a \"clear and convincing evidence\" threshold for fraudulent misrepresentation claims. Due to these difficulties, plaintiffs may opt for other causes of action in products liability cases instead of pursuing tortious misrepresentation claims. In First National Bank v. Brooks Farms, dairy farmers sued the manufacturer of a faulty silo that led to economic losses due to decreased milk production. The court found that the manufacturer intentionally misrepresented the product's capabilities, leading to damages for the plaintiffs. Federal involvement in products liability can be traced back to the Interagency Task Force on Product Liability initiated by the Ford Administration in 1976. The Task Force's final report in 1977 highlighted the rising costs of products liability, leading to discussions on tort reform in the 1970s and 1980s. While products liability is traditionally governed by state law, federal reform efforts have raised questions about the constitutionality of federal legislation in this area. Current jurisprudence suggests that products liability legislation would be permissible if it falls within Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Federal tort reform bills have generally been limited in scope, aimed at protecting sellers and addressing negligence. Consumer representatives and plaintiffs' attorneys oppose measures that restrict injured parties' ability to recover in products liability suits. The tort system is seen as necessary for providing incentives for safe products and adequate compensation for injured workers and consumers. Insurance companies and manufacturers support federal products liability reform to reduce payouts and establish national uniformity in products liability law. A federal statute could address issues like statute of limitations or statute of repose, but national uniformity may still be limited. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, establishes that federal statutes take precedence over state laws. This means that a state law conflicting with a federal law is invalid. Federal products liability reform aims to create national uniformity in products liability law, but interpretations may vary among jurisdictions. The Court has concluded that federal statutes can preempt state common law, including product liability law. Examples of federal laws that preempt state law include the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA). The FCLAA preempts state \"failure to warn\" and \"fraudulent misrepresentation\" claims related to cigarette advertising when federal regulations are followed. The Supreme Court ruled that federal regulations under the FFDCA preempted a state law claim regarding catheters violating New York common law. Congress enacted products liability laws in the 1980s and 1990s, with little recent legislation. The following section gives an overview of federal products liability statutes from the 97th Congress onwards. During President Reagan's Administration, the 97th Congress enacted the Product Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 to lower insurance costs for businesses. The 98th Congress then clarified this act to allow product manufacturers, sellers, and distributors to purchase insurance on a group basis or self-insure through risk retention groups. Federal legislation was necessary due to state laws making it impractical to form such groups on an interstate basis. The 99th Congress later enacted the Risk Retention Amendments. The 99th Congress expanded the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 to allow risk retention groups to provide all types of liability insurance. They also enacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which requires vaccine-related injury claims to be filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Compensation for pain and suffering is limited to $250,000 under the program. During President Clinton's Administration, the 103rd Congress in 1994 enacted the General Aviation Revitalization Act, which established an 18-year statute of repose for planes with fewer than 20 seats not used in scheduled service at the time of the incident. This law prevents civil actions against manufacturers of such aircraft or components if they are 18 years or older at the time of the accident. The 104th Congress also enacted the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, limiting civil liability for gleaners, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act limits liability for those who donate food to non-profit organizations for distribution to the needy, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998 limits product liability for biomaterials suppliers. The Y2K Act of 1999 limits contractual and tort liability under state law. The Y2K Act of 1999, enacted by the 106th Congress, limits liability in suits related to Y2K failures. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, passed by the 107th Congress during President George W. Bush's Administration, includes provisions limiting liability for smallpox vaccine manufacturers, sellers of antiterrorism technology, and vaccine components. Sections 1714-1717 of the Homeland Security Act were repealed by the 108th Congress in 2003. The 109th Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. The 109th Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) in 2005, which limits liability for manufacturers and sellers of firearms and ammunition. It also includes the Child Safety Lock Act of 2005, requiring secure gun storage devices on handguns. Additionally, the Public Readiness Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) limits liability for pandemic flu and other public health emergencies. Division C of the PREP Act limits liability for public health countermeasures during a declared emergency. Victims can opt for payment from the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund\" instead of suing.
