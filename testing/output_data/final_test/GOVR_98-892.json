    "content": "The Vacancies Act, passed in 1868, aims to prevent the President from delaying nominations for Senate confirmation positions. It allows for temporary filling of vacancies with a first assistant or a Senate-confirmed designee for a limited period, which was increased to 120 days in 1988. Previous legal opinions stated that only one limited period of occupancy per vacancy is allowed. The Vacancies Act, passed in 1868, allows temporary filling of vacancies with a first assistant or Senate-confirmed designee for a limited period. Legal opinions state that once the time period is exhausted, the office must remain vacant. The Department of Justice interprets the Act rigidly, but since 1973, some departments have authority to assign duties temporarily outside the Act. DOJ asserts authority under Sections 509 and 510 of title 28 to temporarily fill vacancies outside the Vacancies Act time limitations. This special authority dates back to the Department's establishment in 1870 and has been used in the past to deny the applicability of the Vacancies Act to vacancies in FBI offices. The Vacancies Act, based on Sections 509 and 510, applies to vacancies in various government offices. The Department of Justice (DOJ) argues that its authority predates the Vacancies Act and allows for temporary appointments. The Comptroller General disagrees, stating that the Vacancies Act is the exclusive authority for filling vacant positions requiring presidential appointment and Senate approval. The Vacancies Act was amended to cover all executive departments and agencies, allowing 120 days for a temporary designee to fill a vacancy, giving the President more time. The Vacancies Act was amended to allow 120 days for a temporary designee to fill a vacancy, giving the President more time to find a nominee. The Senate Committee aimed to clarify the process by tying the time limitation on \"actings\" to the prompt forwarding of nominations. The Vacancies Act was amended to allow 120 days for a temporary designee to fill a vacancy, giving the President more time to find a nominee. A 1989 DOJ opinion acknowledged the Senate Committee's disagreement with its view on the Act, signaling that certain provisions in agency enabling statutes may trump the Vacancies Act. This has led to significant implications on the Senate's confirmation power, with 45 individuals at the Justice Department designated as \"actings\" for periods exceeding the Act's limitation. The Vacancies Act allows 120 days for temporary designees to fill positions, but many acting officials in the Department of Justice have served well beyond this limit without nominations being submitted. Similar situations exist in other executive departments, with vacant positions being filled by temporary designees for extended periods. As of February 28, 1998, 43 acting officials in the 14 executive departments were serving beyond the 120-day limit of the Vacancies Act. The Department of Justice's claim that its enabling legislation supersedes the Act and allows indefinite filling of vacant positions lacks clear legislative support from its establishment in 1870. The 1870 legislation establishing the Department aimed to bring order to fragmented legal authority in the federal government. It sought unity of jurisprudence under one head, not to address vacant advice and consent positions. Section 14 was administrative, establishing a chain of command and providing flexibility to the Attorney General. The 1870 legislation aimed to centralize legal authority in the federal government by establishing a chain of command and giving flexibility to the Attorney General. The provision making the new Solicitor General the Attorney General's chief assistant shows congressional intent to unify governmental law functions in one agency. The 1870 legislation aimed to centralize legal authority in the federal government by establishing a chain of command and giving flexibility to the Attorney General. It directed the Solicitor General to act as the temporary head of the department in case of a vacancy to prevent presidential intrusions. The legislative and administrative history does not support displacing the Vacancies Act for DOJ vacant positions. The Constitution dictates the selection of officials with substantial authority under the laws. The President has the authority to appoint officers of the United States, subject to Senate confirmation. Congress can also vest the appointment of inferior officers elsewhere. The Vacancies Act protects the Senate's role in the confirmation process by limiting temporary assignees to six months. The Vacancies Act limits temporary assignees to six months and requires prompt submission of presidential nominations for vacancies filled by recess appointments. Congress and the Supreme Court emphasize the importance of the appointments process in our constitutional system. The Appointments Clause is a significant structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme, serving as a guard against one branch aggrandizing its power. The DOJ's misunderstanding of the constitutionally mandated appointment process was highlighted during a Senate oversight hearing on the failure of executive agencies to adhere to the Vacancies Act. Witnesses agreed that non-compliance with the Act was unlawful. Several remedial bills were introduced to address the non-compliance with the Vacancies Act, including S. 1761 introduced by Senator Byrd. This bill aimed to withhold payment for duties performed in vacant positions exceeding the 120-day limit and required monthly reporting on vacancies to the Comptroller General. The Vacancies Act directed the Comptroller General to report when the 120-day period had been exceeded to Congress, the President, and other relevant parties. It superseded any other law unless expressly stated otherwise. S. 1764 proposed extensive revisions, making it the exclusive method for temporarily filling vacant positions in executive agencies. The President could only fill vacancies with the first assistant or an officer who had received Senate consent. The Vacancies Act required vacant offices to be filled within 120 days by an officer with Senate confirmation. If not filled, the office would remain vacant until a nominee was confirmed. Acting officials could serve for 120 days, but if no nomination was submitted, the position must stay vacant. No pay could be given to those performing duties after the 120-day period. Executive departments had to report vacancies to the Comptroller General. The Vacancies Act required vacant offices to be filled within 120 days by an officer with Senate confirmation. If not filled, the office would remain vacant until a nominee was confirmed. H.R. 3420 aimed to make the Vacancies Act applicable to the Department, allowing the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to appoint an acting official if the 120-day period lapsed without a nominee. The Vacancies Act required vacant offices to be filled within 120 days by an officer with Senate confirmation. H.R. 3420 aimed to make the Vacancies Act applicable to the Department, allowing the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to appoint an acting official if the 120-day period lapsed without a nominee. S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, introduced in the Senate, clarified that the Vacancies Act applied to all positions in executive agencies requiring Senate confirmation, except for certain positions. The bill aimed to extend the time period for an acting officer to serve from 120 to 150 days, with a possibility of another 150 days if a nomination was submitted. If no nomination was made within 150 days, the office would remain vacant, and duties could only be performed by the agency head. The bill aimed to extend the time period for an acting officer to serve from 120 to 150 days, with a possibility of another 150 days if a nomination was submitted. Any action taken by an acting officer in violation of these provisions would be invalid. Each executive agency would be required to report vacancies and acting officers to the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General would notify Congress, the President, and the Office of Personnel Management when the 150-day limit was reached. In Doolin Security Savings Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, the court ruled that the Vacancies Act applied to the situation where the incumbent Director assigned his duties to the Deputy Director before resigning. The court also held that the 120-day time limit for appointing a nominee for Director does not start immediately. The court ruled in Doolin Security Savings Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision that the 120-day time limit of Section 3348 for appointing a nominee for Director does not start until the President acts. The court did not address the effect of Section 3349 on the Deputy Director's assignment. The Court's ruling in Doolin Security Savings Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision clarified that the 120-day time limit for appointing a nominee for Director under Section 3348 of the Vacancies Act does not start until the President takes action. This decision raised concerns about the potential misuse of the \"vesting and delegation\" theory and the appointment of acting officials without following the requirements of the Act. The Senate Committee expressed worries about the President's ability to do nothing under the Vacancies Act, allowing agencies to designate acting heads indefinitely, and the retroactive ratification of actions by unlawful acting officials. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 replaced existing law and was included in the FY 1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. It was a result of negotiations between Senate sponsors and Administration officials after a filibuster threat prevented a Senate vote on S. 2176. The new legislation aimed to address past issues with imprecise drafting and prevent the Executive from evading Senate Committee goals. The legislative drafting allowed the Executive to evade Senate Committee goals, leading to the realization that piecemeal remediation of the 130-year-old statute would not address contemporary policing problems. The re-write of the legislation aimed to balance congressional goals of timely presidential nominations with executive concerns about the complexity of the vetting process for potential officeholders and the need for flexibility in maintaining administration quality during interim service. The re-write of the legislation provides the President with three options when a position in an executive agency becomes vacant. The President can allow the first assistant, a current officer subject to Senate confirmation, or a qualified officer or employee from the agency to assume the duties. However, certain criteria must be met for temporary service. The President has three options when a position in an executive agency becomes vacant: allow the first assistant, a current officer subject to Senate confirmation, or a qualified officer or employee from the agency to assume the duties. Section 3345 (a) provides flexibility for covered vacancies, allowing the President to select a person within the agency if no law or regulation designates a first assistant. The limitation in Section 3345 (b) (1) prevents placing an employee in an agency solely for the purpose of having them in place while their nomination is pending. Continuity in office allows for reappointment after term expiration under Section 3345. An acting officer can serve for 210 days, with the period suspended during Senate nomination process. If the first nomination is rejected, the acting officer can serve for no more than 210 days after. A second nomination allows the acting officer to serve until confirmed or for 210 days. The acting officer can serve until the second nomination is confirmed or for a maximum of 210 days after the nomination is rejected, withdrawn, or returned. The 210-day limit does not start during a congressional adjournment. Section 3347 states that Sections 3345 and 3346 are the exclusive ways to temporarily fill advice and consent positions unless Congress provides otherwise by law. The DOJ position is that agency heads can delegate duties to other officers or employees, but if no nomination is made within 210 days of a vacancy, the options under the Act are no longer available. Only the nomination process or a recess appointment are then possible for the President. The President can only use the nomination process or a recess appointment for filling vacancies. Actions taken by unqualified individuals are deemed invalid and cannot be ratified, except by Congress. The Comptroller General monitors executive administration of the Act, requiring agencies to report vacancies and acting officers. The Comptroller General monitors executive administration of the Act, requiring agencies to report vacancies and acting officers. If a person serves longer than the 210-day limitation, the Comptroller General must report to specified committees, the President, and the Office of Personnel Management. Special provisions apply to vacancies during the transition to a new administration after a presidential election. The new Act does not apply to \"holdover\" provisions or advice. The Act does not apply to certain officers on boards or commissions, such as the commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or Article I judges. Written notification by the President to the Senate for a nomination after a recess is deemed a nomination, but if not submitted within two days, it is treated as withdrawn. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 discourages the President from using his recess appointment power. It is effective from November 20, 1998, and applies to vacancies occurring after that date. Nominations after the effective date are considered the first nomination for that office. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, effective from November 20, 1998, amends Chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code, regarding acting officers in Executive agencies. It outlines procedures for temporary appointments in case of officer vacancies. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows the President to appoint an acting officer with Senate consent, subject to time limitations and specific criteria, in case of officer vacancies in Executive agencies. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 outlines criteria for serving as an acting officer, including time limitations and Senate approval for certain positions. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows the President to direct a nominated officer to continue serving in the same office without a break in service until the Senate confirms or rejects the nomination. The expiration of a term of office is defined as an inability to perform the functions and duties of the office. Time limitations for acting officers are outlined in section 3346, with a maximum of 210 days unless extended under certain circumstances. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows a nominated officer to continue serving until the Senate confirms or rejects the nomination. If the first nomination is rejected, the acting officer can serve for up to 210 days. If a second nomination is submitted, the acting officer can serve until confirmed or for 210 days after rejection. If a vacancy occurs during a congressional adjournment, the 210-day limit still applies. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows a nominated officer to continue serving until the Senate confirms or rejects the nomination. If a vacancy occurs during a congressional adjournment, the 210-day limit still applies for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive agency. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows a nominated officer to continue serving until the Senate confirms or rejects the nomination. If a vacancy occurs during a congressional adjournment, the 210-day limit still applies for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive agency. Section 3348 defines terms related to vacant offices and outlines exceptions for delegating duties among officers or employees within an Executive agency. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows a nominated officer to continue serving until the Senate confirms or rejects the nomination. If a vacancy occurs during a congressional adjournment, the 210-day limit still applies for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an Executive agency. Section 3348 defines terms related to vacant offices and outlines exceptions for delegating duties among officers or employees within an Executive agency. Unless an officer or employee is performing the functions and duties in accordance with sections 3345, 3346, and 3347, if an officer of an Executive agency whose appointment is required to be made by the President dies, resigns, or is unable to perform the functions and duties of the office, the office shall remain vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an office other than the head of an Executive agency, only the head of the agency can perform the duties. If the Senate is not in session on the last day of a 210-day period, the next session day is considered the end of the period. Actions taken by individuals not authorized to act in a vacant office have no effect and cannot be ratified. The section outlines that actions without authority in a vacant office cannot be ratified. Certain positions are exempt from this rule, and vacancies must be reported to the Comptroller General and each House of Congress. The section requires notification of vacancies in specified offices to the Comptroller General and Congress, including details of acting officials, nominees, and nomination status. If an officer serves beyond 210 days, the Comptroller General must be informed. The Comptroller General must report any exceptions to the specified period to various committees and offices, including the President and the Office of Personnel Management. Section 3349a defines transitional inauguration day and addresses vacancies during this period. During the 60-day period after a transitional inauguration day, the 210-day period under sections 3346 or 3348 begins 90 days after the transitional inauguration day or 90 days after the vacancy occurs. Holdover provisions allow individuals to continue serving after their term until a successor is appointed. Certain officers are excluded from sections 3345 through 3349b. The President can notify the Senate of intent to nominate certain officials during recesses or adjournments lasting over 15 days. This notification is considered a nomination if it includes the nominee's name and office. If no nomination is submitted within 2 days after the recess ends, the process is void. The President must submit a nomination within 2 days after a recess or adjournment lasting over 15 days. Failure to do so will result in the nomination being considered withdrawn. Additionally, there are technical and conforming amendments to the table of sections for chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code. The amendments made to chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code include holdover provisions for certain independent establishments, exclusion of certain officers, and notification requirements for nominations during recesses or adjournments. The effective date for these changes is 30 days after enactment, and they apply to vacancies occurring after that date. The time limitations under section 3346 of title 5, United States Code shall apply to vacant offices as if they became vacant on the effective date of this section. If a person is renominated for an office after the effective date, it will be considered a first nomination for that office."
