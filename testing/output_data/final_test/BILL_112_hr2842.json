    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bureau of Reclamation Small Conduit Hydropower Development and Rural Jobs Act of 2012\" and authorizes certain actions. Section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 is amended to authorize contracts for water supply, specify terms for electric power sales and power leases, including small conduit hydropower development. The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 is amended to authorize contracts for water supply and specify terms for electric power sales and leases, including small conduit hydropower development. The Secretary will offer the lease of power privilege to irrigation districts or water users associations first, with a set time frame for acceptance. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to small conduit hydropower development under this subsection, and the Power Resources Office of the Bureau of Reclamation will lead small conduit hydropower policy and procedures. The Western Area Power Administration, Bonneville Power Administration, and Southwestern Power Administration are not obligated to purchase or market power from facilities covered under this subsection. Water used for conduit hydropower generation is considered incidental to the original project purposes, and power privilege leases will only be granted if they align with project goals. The Secretary must ensure that leasing power privileges for conduit hydropower projects will not interfere with project goals or create negative impacts. Prior consultation with relevant water user associations is required, and terms will be set to protect US interests. Existing agreements and revenue arrangements remain unaffected. The term 'conduit' refers to various water conveyance structures. A reclamation tunnel, canal, pipeline, aqueduct, flume, or ditch is a manmade water conveyance used for distributing water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial purposes, not for generating electricity. An irrigation district includes various water conservation districts or public entities jointly exercising powers. Reserved work refers to conduits in project works with care reserved by the Secretary. The term 'transferred work' refers to conduits in project works whose care has been transferred to a water users association or irrigation district. The term 'small conduit hydropower' denotes a facility capable of producing 1.5 megawatts or less of electric capacity. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of the Interior. Passed the House of Representatives on March 7, 2012. Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
