    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges the essential role of air medical critical care transport in the healthcare system, especially in providing timely access to critical care for millions of rural Americans. Air medical providers operate 24/7 as emergency responders and transport all patients regardless of insurance status. The Medicare air ambulance fee schedule, implemented in 2002, has never reflected true costs. The air ambulance fee schedule under Medicare has not accurately reflected true costs, with reimbursements only adjusted by inflationary updates averaging 2.2 percent annually. This imbalance has led to operational readiness and safety enhancement costs growing at a faster rate, jeopardizing timely care access for millions of Americans. Restoring balance to the fee schedule is crucial to ensure continued access to care. SEC. 2. AIR AMBULANCE DATA REPORTING PROGRAM. Section 1834(l) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new paragraph (16) regarding an air ambulance data reporting program. Failure to report data may result in a reduction in payment updates for air ambulance services provided. The Secretary will reduce the percentage increase for payments under the fee schedule by 2.0 percentage points, which may result in payment rates being less than the preceding year. For 2017 and onwards, air ambulance service providers must submit specified data to the Secretary for each year. The reduction in payment rates for a year will not affect future payment amounts under the fee schedule. Air ambulance service providers must report cost data for services including maintenance, medical supplies, fuel, employee expenses, training, rent, utilities, communications, travel, and insurance as specified by the Secretary. The Secretary requires air ambulance service providers to report cost data for various services, including maintenance, medical supplies, fuel, employee expenses, training, rent, utilities, communications, travel, insurance, and professional malpractice insurance. Additionally, providers may voluntarily submit quality measures data to the Secretary by January 1, 2018. The Secretary mandates air ambulance providers to report cost data for services like maintenance, medical supplies, fuel, and employee expenses. Providers can also voluntarily submit quality measures data, including ventilator use, blood glucose checks, waveform capnography, tracheal tube success, medication errors, and protocol compliance. The Secretary requires air ambulance providers to report cost data for services like maintenance, medical supplies, fuel, and employee expenses. Additionally, providers can voluntarily submit quality measures data, including ventilator use, blood glucose checks, waveform capnography, tracheal tube success, medication errors, and protocol compliance. The Secretary is also mandated to submit a report to Congress on serious reportable events, medical equipment failure, and data submitted by providers. The Comptroller General of the United States is also required to submit a report on the data submitted under this paragraph. The Comptroller General is required to submit a report with recommendations on reimbursement for air ambulance services, reflecting operational costs and preserving access to critical services. The report should not include proprietary information as determined by the Secretary or Comptroller General. The Secretary will increase payment for air ambulance services from 2017 to 2020, with a 20% increase in 2017 and 5% increase from 2018 to 2020 to ensure budget neutrality. The Secretary will adjust percentages to balance increased and reduced expenditures for air ambulance services under this part."
