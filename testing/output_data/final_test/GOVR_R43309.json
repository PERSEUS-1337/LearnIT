    "content": "Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons on record, hit the central Visayas region in the Philippines on November 8, 2013. The super typhoon affected over 10% of the nation's population, with estimated wind speeds of 195 mph at its peak. Many people evacuated in advance, and the speed of the storm and advance warning helped prevent greater flooding. Typhoon Haiyan caused widespread devastation in coastal communities in eastern and western Leyte province and the southern tip of Eastern Samar. Between two-thirds and 90% of structures were heavily damaged or destroyed, including medical facilities. Decentralized government authority, a shortage of workers, looting, and heavy rains delayed relief efforts. The typhoon was the deadliest natural disaster in the Philippines, affecting 11.5 million people and displacing over 540,000. The city of Tacloban, capital of Leyte province, was one of the hardest hit places during Typhoon Haiyan. Thousands of residents drowned in a storm surge, with many seeking shelter in a sports stadium. The estimated number of dead and missing is subject to change, with 14.1 million people affected two and a half months after the disaster. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 14.1 million people were affected by Typhoon Haiyan, with over 4.1 million displaced. The death toll had risen to 6,201, with 1,785 missing. Nearly 5.6 million people needed food assistance, and 1.1 million houses were damaged or destroyed. The Philippines' vulnerability to disasters is exacerbated by its population growth in disaster-prone areas and poor infrastructure. The country faces an average of 20 major storms annually. The response of the United States to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which displaced 350,000 people, has strengthened bilateral relations with the Philippines. U.S. support, including disaster assistance and diplomatic efforts, has been seen as boosting soft power in the region. Some Philippine leaders argue that the U.S. military response has reinforced the case for an increased military presence in the country. The United States significantly increased its soft power in the Philippines and the region compared to China by providing humanitarian and military assistance after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Congress members offered support, with Kerry announcing $40 million in military aid and $25 million in humanitarian aid. Representative Chris Smith led a congressional delegation to the Philippines. Government officials, including Representative Chris Smith, led delegations and held hearings to assess and offer support for the response to Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. U.S. legislators circulated letters calling for assistance to affected areas, sponsored resolutions for charitable donations, and urged the government to grant Temporary Protected Status to eligible Philippine nationals. The humanitarian relief operation, led by the Philippine government, aims to support eligible Philippine nationals affected by Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan by granting them Protected Status in the United States. Relief efforts are divided into phases such as search and rescue, treatment, relocation, and reconstruction, but delays and challenges like transportation issues and bureaucratic hurdles can hinder the process. Coordination with the government, local communities, and international partners is crucial for an efficient response. The humanitarian relief operation, led by the Philippine government, faced challenges like transportation and communication issues, but aid reached most affected areas within two weeks. In-depth assessments were conducted to understand the situation, and aid delivery to affected areas has been ongoing and sustained. In mid-December, efforts shifted towards early recovery programming and long-term reconstruction after Typhoon Haiyan. However, Tropical Depression Agaton in January 2014 exposed ongoing vulnerabilities in affected areas. The Philippine government manages disaster relief through NDRRMC, DSWD, and other agencies. The Philippine government, through various agencies like LDRRMCs, DSWD, and NDRRMC, coordinates relief efforts on the ground. A high-level national taskforce led by President Aquino and Senator Ping Lacson ensures a quick transition from relief to rehabilitation. The government also launched the Foreign Aid Transparency Hub (FAITH) to track international disaster funds and address corruption concerns. The Philippine government launched the four-year Reconstruction Assistance in Yolanda (RAY) plan on December 18, 2013, requesting nearly $8.2 billion for rebuilding areas affected by the typhoon and developing resilience to natural disasters. The plan includes $780 million for critical actions like shelter, education, agriculture, and livelihoods, $2 billion for short-term interventions through 2014, and $5.3 billion for longer-term needs through 2017. Temporary housing in the form of 469 bunkhouses has been provided for those living in tent cities, especially for those near the sea at risk of future storm surges. Each bunkhouse has 24 rooms for families but lacks electricity and running water. The government announced plans to build 60,000 permanent housing units after criticism for inadequate temporary shelters lacking electricity and running water. The US provided over $87 million in humanitarian assistance, with additional funds authorized for emergency response efforts. The US government provided $59 million in humanitarian assistance for the typhoon in the Philippines. An interagency task force was set up to coordinate the response, including deploying Disaster Assistance Response Teams. The response transitioned to early recovery, with ongoing coordination by OFDA. The State Department established a Crisis Response Task Force to monitor and coordinate humanitarian activities in response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The U.S. Embassy in Manila served as a center for communication among U.S. agencies, Philippine authorities, and NGOs. The initial relief operations were conducted by the USS George Washington naval task force and elements of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. Operation Damayan involved nearly 1,000 U.S. military personnel deployed to the disaster area, providing reconnaissance, transporting relief supplies, and evacuating those affected by the typhoon. Marines assisted with road clearance and distribution of aid. Relief efforts were transitioned to the Philippine government on November 24, 2013. The U.S. military's relief efforts in the Philippines were transitioned to the Philippine government, with JTF 505 standing down on December 1, 2013. Over 13,400 military personnel, 66 aircraft, and 12 naval vessels were involved in delivering 2,495 tons of relief supplies and evacuating over 21,000 people. International military assistance from countries like Australia, Japan, and the UK also played a significant role in providing disaster relief and distributing medical supplies. International military personnel provided disaster relief in the Philippines, including distributing medical supplies, drinking water, and food. China sent a naval hospital ship, the Peace Ark, to assist. The Immigration and Nationality Act offers temporary protected status (TPS) under specific conditions, such as ongoing armed conflict or environmental disasters. TPS recipients receive a registration document and employment authorization. The government of the Philippines requested TPS for Filipinos in the US after Typhoon Haiyan. Legislation (H.R. 3602) has been introduced in Congress for Filipino Temporary Protected Status. The international community provides humanitarian assistance in response to disasters like Typhoon Haiyan. The United Nations, along with the Philippine government, established Disaster Assessment and Coordination teams to coordinate humanitarian relief efforts in response to disasters like Typhoon Haiyan. Relief sectors were organized into 12 clusters led by various agencies to prioritize resources and facilitate planning. The United Nations, along with other partners, is actively involved in providing humanitarian assistance and early recovery efforts in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. International recovery efforts involve coordination among various actors and entities, including U.N. agencies, international organizations, NGOs, and donors. Humanitarian assistance is still needed in some areas, focusing on food, clean water, shelter, and basic health care. A Strategic Response Plan has been developed by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in collaboration with multiple organizations to support the government's activities. The Strategic Response Plan (SRP) supports the government in meeting humanitarian needs after Typhoon Haiyan, covering 171 municipalities in 14 provinces. It aims to assist over 14 million affected people by providing food, shelter, and agricultural support. Shelter needs are urgent for families displaced or with damaged homes. Activities include providing shelter material, tools, cash for work, and technical training. Focus is on regaining self-sufficiency through restoring livelihoods in urban and rural areas. Access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and health care is sustained with a focus on disease prevention. The SRP aims to address critical humanitarian needs by providing access to water, sanitation, and health care, restoring livelihoods, and enhancing resilience for future disasters. The plan covers 12 months and targets up to 3 million people, focusing on three consecutive phases of response. The SRP covers the response through the first two phases (January 2015-December 2017). The United Nations, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and European Union will support the government's plans. The U.N. Population Fund launched a plan to assist 3 million women and girls. UNICEF focuses on unaccompanied and separated children. Trafficking concerns have been raised. The Philippine Red Cross has helped 35,000 people trace family members. The Philippine Red Cross is assisting in tracing missing family members after the typhoon. International organizations are providing relief and financial support. The Haiyan Action Plan initially requested $301 million, later increased to $348 million. The Strategic Response Plan launched on December 27, 2013, replaces these earlier appeals. The Strategic Response Plan, launched on December 27, 2013, replaces earlier appeals and requests $788 million. Various countries, including the U.S., have provided assistance through direct contributions and relief flights. As of January 31, 2014, $662.9 million has been contributed to the Typhoon Haiyan response, with $356.1 million to the SRP. The U.N.'s Central Emergency Response Fund has made available $25.3 million to the Plan. The U.S. and the Philippines have close ties due to historical, security, military, and economic interests. The U.S. and the Philippines have close ties due to historical, security, military, and economic interests. Filipino Americans number approximately 4 million, making them the second-largest Asian American population. U.S. military forces are involved in regular joint exercises and ongoing military missions in the Philippines, including Balikatan exercises and counterterrorism assistance. Annual joint exercises include CARAT naval event and PHIBLEX. The U.S. military has a small presence in the Philippines, with no injuries or damage reported during Typhoon Haiyan. Currently, around 500 U.S. military personnel are conducting counterterrorism training for selected Philippine military units. U.S. forces also supported relief efforts after the typhoon, highlighting the growing security cooperation between the two countries. This relationship has become a key aspect of the U.S. foreign policy pivot towards Asia, with discussions ongoing to increase U.S. military access to Philippine facilities. Philippine officials are discussing increasing U.S. military access to facilities, including Subic Bay, and enhancing U.S. military presence on a rotational basis. The Philippines is a key partner for the U.S. in regional security, receiving significant foreign assistance focused on poverty reduction and security concerns. U.S. aid in the past decade has targeted development programs in conflict-affected areas to counter radical ideologies. The Philippines, a lower middle income country with a population of 105 million, has seen significant economic growth in recent years. The Obama Administration requested a 75% increase in Foreign Military Financing to the Philippines in FY2014. The country had been struggling economically due to corruption and poor governance but has emerged as one of Asia's strongest economies with a 7.6% GDP growth rate in 2010. The Philippines experienced its fastest annual growth rate in 30 years in 2010, marking a strong resurgence for the country. Despite being a recipient of IMF loans in the past, the Philippines became an IMF creditor in 2012. The country has benefited from substantial investment inflows in recent years, but there are concerns about potential risks such as private capital outflows due to factors like the typhoon or U.S. monetary policy tightening. Areas damaged by Haiyan are predominantly agricultural and fishing industries in some of the poorest parts of the Philippines. The Philippines' economy is forecast to expand by 6.7% in 2014, slightly less than the estimated 6.9% growth of 2013. The region affected by Typhoon Haiyan, mainly agricultural and fishing industries, is seeking temporary trade arrangements for duty-free access to export markets. Despite the estimated $13 billion costs of the storm, GDP growth is expected to remain strong. Reconstruction efforts are expected to boost the economy once they begin. The Philippines' economy is forecast to grow by 6.7% in 2014, slightly lower than the previous year. Reconstruction efforts after Typhoon Haiyan are expected to spur growth, with construction spending playing a key role. Despite the storm's impact on rice crops, the economy has fared well. Decentralized governance and corruption may hinder stimulus efforts in the future. The lack of control over decisions by regional governments has hindered Philippine economic development for decades. The impact of Typhoon Haiyan will test the central government's ability to implement economic stimulus effectively without corruption or poor local governance. The disaster's aftermath is of interest to the United States, with Congress likely focusing on humanitarian relief and ongoing oversight. The ongoing oversight by Congress includes monitoring the provision of U.S. humanitarian assistance in response to the Haiyan disaster. Congress may also consider long-term assistance strategies for the Philippines, including boosting exports from storm-affected areas and learning lessons for future global disaster assistance. Strategic questions involve the impact of U.S. disaster response on the U.S.-Philippines relationship and regional geopolitical dynamics. The U.S. Congress is overseeing the provision of humanitarian assistance in response to the Haiyan disaster in the Philippines. Strategic questions include the impact on the U.S.-Philippines relationship and regional geopolitical dynamics. The U.S. Department of Defense's role in disaster relief may affect existing and ongoing military activities in the Philippines. Relevant links for further information are provided by the U.S. Embassy in Manila, USAID, and the U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. Department of Defense, USAID, and various UN entities are providing humanitarian aid in response to the Haiyan disaster in the Philippines. Links to official updates and reports can be found on their respective websites. The U.N. Country Team in the Philippines, along with various U.N. entities and InterAction, are providing humanitarian assistance in response to the Haiyan disaster. Links to their official websites for updates and reports can be found. The curr_chunk provides links to websites for contributing to relief efforts in response to the Philippines disaster. It includes resources from USAID, U.S. Embassy in Manila, Charity Navigator, and Guide Star for evaluating charity finances and helping Typhoon Haiyan survivors. The United States is a leader in providing relief efforts for international disasters, with the President having broad authority to offer emergency assistance. Various U.S. agencies deliver disaster aid, adapting their definition of assistance based on the situation. The U.S. government, through agencies like USAID and OFDA, provides disaster assistance by coordinating with international organizations and governments to deliver services and grants for immediate relief materials and personnel. OFDA can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions and has the authority to borrow funds and equipment. USAID, through its offices OFDA, FFP, and OTI, administers U.S. humanitarian aid, including emergency food aid and post-disaster transition assistance. The Department of Defense also funds humanitarian programs for disaster relief and response. The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides humanitarian support in emergency situations by offering food, shelter, medical evacuations, and supplies. The President can utilize defense equipment and military personnel for disaster response. Additionally, the Denton program allows for transportation of humanitarian goods on military aircraft and ships. OFDA and Department of Defense assistance typically lasts 30 to 90 days post-disaster, with ongoing support from USAID's country development programs. State Department also administers humanitarian relief programs. The State Department administers humanitarian relief programs, including the Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) for refugee emergencies. Assistance for long-term emergencies comes from the Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration, and Refugees (PRM) bureau, which assists refugees, conflict victims, and internally displaced people. Humanitarian assistance covers basic needs and community services, with a focus on mass fatality management during catastrophes. Human remains do not cause epidemics in disaster-stricken communities as they do not carry additional pathogens. Epidemics after disasters are usually due to sewage contaminating water sources. The aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami led to the publication of a first responder manual on mass fatality management by PAHO, WHO, and ICRC, highlighting the consequences of mismanagement of the dead. The manual on mass fatality management recommends measures such as rapid retrieval of remains, victim identification best practices, and temporary burial for immediate storage. Mismanagement of the dead can lead to mental distress and legal issues for relatives of the victims."
