    "content": "The roles and duties of a Member of Congress are not explicitly defined by the U.S. Constitution. House and Senate rules only require Members to be present and vote. Beyond voting, there are no formal expectations, allowing Members to focus on persuading, building coalitions, and shepherding legislation. These responsibilities have evolved over time based on Members' and constituents' expectations. The roles and duties of a Member of Congress include representation, legislation, constituent service, political activities, and electoral duties. Members oversee constituent services, travel between their state and Washington, DC, participate in committee activities, meet with lobbyists, supervise staff, speak on the floor, conduct investigations, interact with the media, and attend to electoral duties. Each new Member must develop an approach to their job that serves a wide range of roles and responsibilities. The key to effectiveness in Congress is organizing well within carefully selected priorities. Members delegate tasks to staff in various offices, committees, and political operations. Members of Congress delegate tasks to staff in various offices, committees, and political operations to fulfill their duties and achieve their goals of gaining reelection, securing influence within Congress, and making good public policy. The distribution of responsibility varies based on the Member's preferences and priorities. The roles and duties of Members of Congress can impact their legislative work, constituent relations, media relations, party issues, and electoral activities. These priorities may change with seniority or in response to committee assignments, policy focus, district priorities, leadership changes, or electoral pressures. In the mid-1970s, the House Commission on Administrative Review surveyed Members to identify their expected duties. The House Commission on Administrative Review surveyed Members of Congress in the mid-1970s to identify their expected duties. The research firm Louis Harris and Associates conducted a public survey to gauge expectations of Congress and its Members. The most common expectations of Members were to draft legislation, help constituents, represent district interests, take positions, and provide constituent education. The public survey and Member survey highlighted common interests in local representation, constituency services, legislative activity, and regular contact between the Member and the district. Differences in expectations may stem from varying perspectives on the work of a Member of Congress. Members focus on representational, legislative, and institutional duties, while the public emphasizes representational, legislative, and service responsibilities. This discrepancy may be due to the public's limited awareness of the broader institutional, procedural, and operational framework in which Members operate. Some observers suggest that the narrow public focus on individual Members of Congress may be due to the public's limited awareness of the broader institutional, procedural, and operational framework in which Members operate. The roles and duties of a Member of Congress are influenced by congressional and public expectations, with a focus on representational, legislative, and service responsibilities.

They engage in floor debates on important issues related to their districts or committees, preparing statements, conducting research, offering amendments, and persuading undecided members. They also engage in informal negotiations to advance legislative goals, closely tied to their constituency service role. The constituency service role of Members of Congress involves acting as representatives, ombudsmen, and facilitators for constituents needing assistance from the federal government. This role includes outreach, gathering information on federal programs, casework to solve constituents' problems, providing nominations to service academies, and arranging visits to Washington, DC.

Members of Congress running for reelection may have separate campaign staff and fundraising activities. They can also influence state and local government candidacies and hold leadership roles in their political parties.
