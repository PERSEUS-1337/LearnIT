    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009\" and includes a value index under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The \"Medicare Payment Improvement Act of 2009\" includes a value index for each fee schedule area, which is the ratio of quality to cost components. The quality component is based on health outcome measures for the Medicare population and patient safety. The Secretary will consider hospital readmission rates, emergency department utilization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, and hospital admissions when establishing the quality component for Medicare population and patient safety. The quality component for Medicare population and patient safety includes hospital readmission rates, emergency department utilization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, hospital admissions for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, mortality amenable to health care, and other items determined appropriate by the Secretary. The quality score for each fee schedule area is compared to the national average quality score to establish the quality component. If quality data is insufficient at the sub-State level, the quality component for a sub-State is determined differently. The cost component for a sub-State fee schedule area in Medicare is based on total annual per beneficiary Medicare expenditures under part A and part B. The Secretary may consider total per beneficiary expenditures in the last two years of life as an alternative measure to account for severity differences among fee schedule areas. The cost component for a fee schedule area in Medicare is determined by the ratio of the cost per beneficiary in that area to the national average cost per beneficiary. Amendments to the Social Security Act include adding \"value\" to geographic considerations and defining a value index in subsection (e). The text discusses amendments to the Social Security Act regarding the computation of geographic and value adjustment factors for physicians' services under Medicare. This includes defining a value index and incorporating it into the fee schedule area calculations. The text discusses amendments to the Social Security Act for computing geographic and value adjustment factors for physicians' services under Medicare. It includes establishing adjustment factors for geographic cost-of-practice, malpractice, and value, as well as defining a physician work value adjustment factor based on relative value units for the work component. The amendments made to the Social Security Act include establishing adjustment factors for geographic cost-of-practice, malpractice, and value, as well as defining a physician work value adjustment factor based on relative value units. The quality component described in section 1848(c)(6)(B) will be made available to the public by January 1, 2011, and the amendments will apply to the Medicare physician fee schedule starting in 2012."
