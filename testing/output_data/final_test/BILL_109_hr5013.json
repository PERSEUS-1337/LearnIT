After Hurricane Katrina, law enforcement was overwhelmed, leading to threats to citizens' safety and property. Many citizens lawfully kept firearms for self-defense. During Hurricane Katrina, agencies confiscated firearms from citizens, violating their Second Amendment rights and leaving them vulnerable to criminal activity. Confiscations were done forcefully, including gunpoint entries into homes and stoppages of vehicles and boats. Citizens were either in their homes or trying to escape the flooding. During Hurricane Katrina, agencies confiscated firearms from citizens, violating their Second Amendment rights. The confiscations were carried out forcefully, including intrusion into homes and seizures of property, depriving citizens of liberty and property without due process of law. Additionally, citizens seeking refuge in emergency housing were prohibited from storing firearms, treating them as second-class citizens who had forfeited their constitutional right to bear arms. During Hurricane Katrina, citizens in Louisiana were prevented from joining relief efforts due to armed individuals on the team, who were deputized as Federal law enforcement officers. This action violated citizens' rights to keep and bear arms, personal security, personal liberty, and private property, going against the Constitution and laws of the United States. SEC. 706 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act prohibits the confiscation of firearms during certain national emergencies. SEC. 706 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act prohibits the seizure or registration of firearms during relief efforts for a major disaster or emergency. SEC. 706 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act prohibits the seizure or registration of firearms during relief efforts for a major disaster or emergency. This section also prohibits the possession or carrying of firearms in places or by persons where such possession is not otherwise prohibited by law, except for temporary surrender for entry into transportation during rescue or evacuation. Private Rights of Action allow individuals to seek relief for violations of the prohibition on seizure or confiscation of firearms during a major disaster or emergency. This includes the right to bring an action for the return of the firearm in the United States district court. Attorney fees may also be awarded in such actions. \"In actions to enforce this section, the court will award attorney fees to the prevailing party, excluding the United States.\" The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 25, 2006. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
