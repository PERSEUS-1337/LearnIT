    "content": "The \"Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act of 2003\" allows federal reimbursement for emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens. The \"Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act of 2003\" appropriates $1,450,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to make allotments to States based on the percentage of undocumented aliens. $957,000,000 is used for allotments each year according to a specific formula. The formula for allotments to each State is based on the total amount available and the percentage of undocumented aliens in the State compared to all States. The Secretary appropriates funds for each fiscal year based on the number of undocumented alien apprehensions. The Secretary shall use $493,000,000 to make allotments for the 6 States with the highest number of undocumented alien apprehensions based on the ratio of apprehensions in each State to the total for all States. The Secretary will use $493,000,000 to allot funds to the 6 States with the highest number of undocumented alien apprehensions. The highest number of apprehensions will be based on the 4 most recent quarterly rates reported by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. States described in both paragraphs can receive allotments under both for a fiscal year. Funds will be directly paid to local governments, hospitals, or other providers in the State. The Secretary will allot funds to States with high undocumented alien apprehensions for emergency health services. States can use funds to reimburse local governments, hospitals, and providers for costs incurred in providing services to undocumented aliens. The Secretary will establish a process for States to apply for funds to reimburse costs incurred in providing emergency health services to undocumented aliens, including those allowed into the US solely for emergency care. The deadline for the application process is July 31, 2003. The Secretary will establish a process for States, local governments, hospitals, or other providers to apply for payments from allotments for uncompensated emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens. Measures to combat fraud will be included in the process. Advance payment and retrospective adjustment will be allowed. The process established allows for quarterly payments based on advance estimates of expenditures submitted by applicants. Adjustments will be made for overpayments or underpayments in prior quarters. Unused funds may be reallotted in the following fiscal years. Unused funds may be reallotted in the following fiscal years to States that qualify for reallotments as determined by the Secretary. Reallotments will be made in a similar manner as initial allotments, with the reallotted amount considered part of the State's allocation. In this section, definitions for terms like hospital, Indian tribe, tribal organization, provider, and Secretary are provided. The term 'State' refers to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. This section constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts and represents the obligation of the Federal Government to provide for the payment of amounts provided under this section."
