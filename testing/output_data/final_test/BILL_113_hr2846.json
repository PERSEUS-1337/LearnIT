Congress finds that Jerusalem has been the eternal and undivided capital of Israel for 3,000 years, established as a homeland for the Jewish people in 1948. There has been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for centuries, with the city serving as the capital of Israel since 1950. Jerusalem was divided until 1967 when it was reunified. In 1967, Jerusalem was reunited during the Six Day War and has been administered by Israel since then. In 1990, Congress declared that Jerusalem must remain undivided with rights protected for all ethnic and religious groups. In 1995, Congress approved the relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem by May 31, 1999. The US maintains its embassy in the capital of every country except Israel. Israel has exceeded the 1907 Hague Regulation by ensuring public order and safety in Jerusalem, making it safer and more protected under their administration. Civil life thrives in the city. The United States Government owns properties in Jerusalem, including the ideal location for the US Embassy at 14 David Flusser Street, which was completed in 2010 and leased for 75 years. The United States Government owns properties in Jerusalem, including the ideal location for the US Embassy at 14 David Flusser Street, which was completed in 2010 and leased for 75 years. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The United States Government owns properties in Jerusalem, including the ideal location for the US Embassy at 14 David Flusser Street. Congress believes the US should recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital and transfer the Embassy from Tel Aviv to show commitment. The Secretary of State should transfer the Embassy to Jerusalem and take necessary actions for repurposing or selling the Tel Aviv Embassy. The Department of State should account for the proceeds from the sale of properties in Jerusalem, including the ideal location for the US Embassy at 14 David Flusser Street. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is amended by repealing section 7, with the repeal taking effect on January 1, 2014."
