    "content": "The Act titled \"High-Quality Education Act of 2009\" is established for the purpose of providing high-quality education. The Congress finds that Tennessee's STAR project, initiated in the mid-1980s, demonstrated the benefits of reducing class size for early grade students. Research indicates that these benefits continue over time, with students in small classes showing improved achievements in subsequent years. Follow-up studies also reveal that high-school students who were in small classes in first grade experienced long-term benefits. The benefits of reducing class size for early grade students were demonstrated in Tennessee's STAR project in the mid-1980s. High-school students who were in small classes in first through third grades showed improved achievements, with better grades, more advanced courses, and higher test scores. Wisconsin's SAGE program also saw increased test scores in smaller first grade classes. Research shows that students in small classes were about half a school year ahead by the end of fifth grade. In smaller classes, students were ahead by about half a school year in core subjects like reading, language arts, math, and science. Studies consistently show that reduced class size leads to improved student performance. Teachers in smaller classes can focus more on instruction and less on discipline, providing more individualized instruction. The purpose of this Act is to assist States in lowering class sizes to improve student performance, behavior, and school climate. Smaller classes lead to better identification of students needing help, increased participation, improved behavior, and a sense of community. The Class Size Reduction Matching Grant Program is established under SEC. 3 of the Act to help States lower class sizes for improved student performance and school climate. The Secretary of Education may grant funds to eligible entities to reduce class sizes in public schools. An eligible entity is defined as a State or local educational agency with a class size reduction program in place and specific funding allocated for the program in its annual budget. The Secretary may grant funds to eligible entities for reducing class sizes in public schools. The average class sizes in schools served must exceed certain thresholds. Grantees must use funds for constructing new classroom space, hiring teachers, or purchasing portable structures. The Secretary may grant funds to eligible entities for reducing class sizes in public schools. Grantees must agree to restrictions on fund usage, prioritize schools with high poverty rates or larger class sizes, and may be required to provide matching funds. The Secretary may only grant funds if the grantee agrees to provide non-Federal contributions of at least $2 for every $1 provided by the Secretary. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, excluding Federal Government assistance. To apply for a grant, submission is required. To apply for a grant under this section, an eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary with specific information required. The application should include certification of average core curriculum class sizes at schools served by the entity and the entity's expenditures for the class size reduction program. The eligible entity must submit an application with details on their class size reduction program goals, intended use of grant funds, and progress in achieving program goals. The Secretary will set a deadline for grant applications. Definitions include \"average core curriculum class size\" as the total number of students. The average core curriculum class size is determined by the number of students in each core curriculum class divided by the total number of classes, based on the ratio of physical classrooms to students. Core curriculum classes include Mathematics, Science, Reading, Language Arts, Social Studies, and Foreign Language. The terms \"local educational agency\" and \"poverty line\" are defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. The term \"State\" includes various regions under the jurisdiction of the United States. The Secretary is responsible for making biannual payments. The Secretary will make biannual payments to grantees under this section, with a limitation that payments cannot exceed 20% of the total amount appropriated for the fiscal year or $200,000,000."
