    "content": "The \"Omnibus Foster Care Improvement Act of 1995\" requires states to administer qualifying examinations to all state employees with new authority over child welfare services. The Social Security Act amendment mandates that states must have procedures in place for prospective child welfare decision-makers to pass an examination on various subjects before granting them authority over child welfare services. SEC. 3. PROCEDURES TO EXPEDITE THE PERMANENT PLACEMENT OF FOSTER CHILDREN. Amendment to the Social Security Act requires states to locate parents of children in foster care and evaluate their ability to provide a suitable home. This amendment does not apply to children already in foster care at the time of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. PLACEMENT OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN PERMANENT KINSHIP CARE ARRANGEMENTS. The amendment allows states to consider kinship placement as adoption for children in foster care, if legal custody is transferred to a blood relative or half-sibling through a written agreement. This deems the placement as adoption, the relative as the adoptive parent, and the agreement as an adoption assistance agreement. The amendment allows states to consider kinship placement as adoption for children in foster care. Legal custody can be transferred to a blood relative or half-sibling through a written agreement, deeming the placement as adoption. This agreement is then considered an adoption assistance agreement. Additionally, court costs, attorneys fees, and other related expenses are deemed nonrecurring adoption expenses. At the dispositional hearing, consideration should be given to placing the child with a relative as provided in the Act before considering adoption. Federal funds for foster care and adoption assistance are only available to states that require preference to be given to applications of a foster parent or caretaker relative of the child when considering applications to adopt certain foster children. Section 474 of the Social Security Act requires states to prioritize applications from foster parents or caretaker relatives for adopting foster children before processing other adoption applications, after a 5-year period from enactment. The Social Security Act prioritizes foster parents or caretaker relatives for adopting foster children if the child has emotional ties to them and removal would harm the child's well-being. The amendments made by this Act will apply to Social Security Act payments for quarters after the enactment date."
