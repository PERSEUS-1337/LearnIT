    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cooperative Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries Resources Act of 1993\". Congress finds that several rivers flow between multiple state boundaries, often lacking a single entity with complete jurisdiction over fisheries resources. A strong partnership between federal and state authorities is crucial for coordinating research and resolving issues in large river ecosystems impacted by federally regulated activities and projects. Loss of diverse habitats and fish fauna has been observed in some rivers. The construction of waterway developments is degrading large river ecosystems nationwide, leading to the loss of diverse habitats and native fish populations. Without positive management actions, native species will continue to decline, impacting water users and reducing recreational, commercial, and aesthetic uses of river systems in the United States. Several programs are proposed to address these issues. Several programs are proposed to resolve conflicts in management strategies for river ecosystems. One program, the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement, involves Federal, State, and local fisheries managers sharing resources and funding to develop long-range strategic plans for interjurisdictional fisheries in the Mississippi River drainage basin. This agreement serves as a model for managing interjurisdictional rivers fisheries resources. Coordination of these programs is essential to conserve fisheries resources. To improve coordination and cooperation in managing interjurisdictional rivers and conserve fisheries resources, strategies for information sharing and research are needed. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries is established to improve coordination and cooperation in managing rivers and conserving fisheries resources. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries is established to develop recommendations for cooperative action strategies on the management of interjurisdictional rivers fisheries, including identifying the 10 highest priority rivers in need of cooperative fisheries management and creating comprehensive fishery strategic plans for the top 5 rivers. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries develops recommendations for cooperative action strategies on interjurisdictional rivers fisheries, including identifying priority rivers and creating comprehensive fishery strategic plans. Considerations include problems, management programs, status of fisheries resources, and biological aspects. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries considers the biological, physical, geologic, and hydrographic characteristics of interjurisdictional rivers, along with economic demands. Strategic plans must be reviewed and approved by states before cooperative action strategies are finalized. Membership details are also outlined. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries consists of 13 members, including the Secretary (or designee) as chairperson, 7 individuals appointed by the Secretary representing major drainage systems, and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries consists of 13 members appointed by various government officials or their designees, serving 3-year terms. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries consists of 13 members appointed for 3-year terms. Vacancies are filled for the remainder of the term. Members serve without pay and receive travel expenses. Consensus is sought in resolving matters before the Council. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries consists of 13 members appointed for 3-year terms. Decisions are made by majority vote if consensus cannot be reached. Meetings are called by the Chairperson or majority request. The Secretary provides administrative support, and the Council determines its organization and procedures. No money authorized under this Act can be used for agency reimbursement. The Council on Interjurisdictional Rivers Fisheries, consisting of 13 members, operates independently with decisions made by majority vote. The Council is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and must report strategies to Congress within 36 months. It terminates 30 days after submitting the report. No funds can be used for agency reimbursement under this Act. The Act shall not diminish State authority over interjurisdictional resources in interjurisdictional rivers, exceed the Secretary's current authority, or override existing commissions or compacts. SEC. 4. MISSISSIPPI INTERSTATE COOPERATIVE RESOURCE AGREEMENT. The Secretary, with the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement Steering Committee, will conduct a pilot test of the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement. The pilot test will identify and describe river ecosystems, fishery resources, and impacts of projects on fishery resources in the Mississippi River drainage basin. The curr_chunk discusses the analysis of resource data, identification of information gaps, and recommendations for cooperative management of interjurisdictional fisheries resources in the Mississippi River drainage system. The curr_chunk focuses on the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement, including the development of plans for fish stock restoration, evaluation of program feasibility, and cost estimates for implementation. The Secretary will report to Congress on the evaluation of the pilot test conducted under the Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Agreement within 36 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this Act, definitions include interjurisdictional fisheries resources, interjurisdictional rivers, Secretary (Secretary of the Interior), and State fish and wildlife agency. A State fish and wildlife agency is an entity empowered by state laws to perform functions typically carried out by such agencies. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996: $1,000,000 per year for section 3 and $2,000,000 per year for section 4. Funds remain available until expended."
