    "title": "AB 623",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that prescription and over-the-counter drugs are commonly abused, with opioid pain relievers causing more deaths than heroin and cocaine combined. Abuse of these drugs may lead to heroin abuse, especially when taken in ways other than prescribed. In response to the abuse of opioid analgesic drug products, new regulations require pharmacists to educate patients on proper storage and disposal. Health care service plans must provide access to abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products when available. Health care service plans can apply prior authorization requirements to abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drugs, as long as the same requirements are applied to non-abuse-deterrent versions. Providers can prescribe and plans must cover less than a 30-day supply of opioid analgesic drugs. Abuse-deterrent opioids are those approved by the FDA with labeling claims for reducing abuse. An insurer must not require the use of opioid analgesic drugs without abuse-deterrent properties if abuse-deterrent options are available. Prior authorization can still be applied to abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drugs, as long as the same requirements are applied to non-abuse-deterrent versions. An insurer must provide coverage for a less than 30-day supply of an opioid analgesic drug product. Definitions for \"abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug product\" and \"opioid analgesic drug product\" are provided. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as outlined in the California Constitution."
