    "content": "This report provides an overview of the process for appointing the Director of the FBI, including nominations history and congressional hearing records. The President selects a candidate, conducts vetting, and submits the nomination to the Senate for approval by the Committee on the Judiciary. The Committee on the Judiciary holds hearings on FBI Director nominations and votes to report them back to the Senate. If confirmed, the nominee is appointed by the President. The current nomination process began in 1968, replacing J. Edgar Hoover's nearly 48-year tenure as Director. The Senate debated the need for a new FBI Director due to Hoover's advanced age and the agency's expansion. A 10-year term limit was added in 1976 to prevent reappointment. Since 1972, seven nominations have been confirmed, including two for Robert S. Mueller III. The Senate confirmed seven nominations for FBI Director, including Robert S. Mueller III. L. Patrick Gray was appointed acting Director after J. Edgar Hoover's death, but his nomination was withdrawn due to concerns about partisanship. Clarence M. Kelley was the first Director confirmed through the nomination process. Clarence Kelley, a 21-year FBI veteran, became FBI Director through nomination and confirmation. He was sworn in by President Nixon on July 9, 1973, and served until his retirement on February 23, 1978. President Jimmy Carter nominated U.S. District Court Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr. as Kelley's successor on September 30, 1977, but withdrew the nomination in December due to Johnson's health issues. President Carter nominated William H. Webster to be Director of the FBI on January 20, 1978, after the withdrawal of the previous nomination. Webster, a former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge, was confirmed by the Senate on February 9, 1978, and sworn in on February 23, 1978. He later served as Director of the CIA. William S. Sessions replaced William H. Webster as FBI Director in 1987. Sessions had previous experience in the Department of Justice and as a U.S. Attorney. He was unanimously recommended for confirmation by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and confirmed without opposition. However, he was removed from office by President Clinton in 1993 due to concerns about his conduct and leadership. Louis J. Freeh succeeded William S. Sessions as FBI Director in 1993, following Sessions's dismissal by President Clinton. Freeh was nominated on July 20, 1993, confirmed on August 6, 1993, and served until his resignation on June 25, 2001. Robert S. Mueller III was nominated by President George W. Bush on July 18, 2001, confirmed on August 2, 2001, and served as FBI Director thereafter. Robert S. Mueller III served as FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, appointed for a second term under President Barack Obama. He had previously held various positions including U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts and Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General. Mueller oversaw high-profile cases such as the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing investigation and the prosecution of Manuel Noriega. The legislative circumstances surrounding Mueller's reappointment in 2013 raised legal questions about extending the tenure of the FBI Director. President Obama nominated James B. Comey Jr. to succeed Mueller as his unique two-year term came to a close. Comey had previously served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. James B. Comey Jr. was nominated by President Obama to succeed Mueller as FBI Director in 2013. Comey had previously served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and Deputy Attorney General. The Senate confirmed Comey's nomination by a vote of 93-1 on July 29, 2013, and he began his 10-year term on September 4, 2013. The curr_chunk provides information on various nominations for the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including Clarence M. Kelley, William H. Webster, William S. Sessions, Louis J. Freeh, and Robert S. Mueller III. The curr_chunk discusses nominations for the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including Robert S. Mueller III, William H. Webster, and William S. Sessions. The curr_chunk discusses the reappointment of Robert S. Mueller III as Director of the FBI for an additional two years, citing the need for continuity in national security. Senator Patrick J. Leahy introduced a bill to extend Mueller's term, which was set to expire in August or September 2011. The bill to extend Robert S. Mueller III's term as Director of the FBI for an additional two years was cosponsored by Senator Chuck Grassley, Chairman Dianne Feinstein, and Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss. Mueller testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary about the extension and FBI operations. The committee later discussed constitutional considerations related to the bill. On June 16, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered a bill to extend the term of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III. Chairman Leahy added a section on findings to the original text. An amendment by Senator Coburn for an additional two-year term was tabled. The committee voted to report favorably on the bill, with minority views printed in the Congressional Record. News reports indicated agreement to the Coburn approach to renominate the Director for an extra two-year period. Chairman Leahy expressed willingness to proceed with an alternative approach proposed by Senator Coburn on July 18, 2011. Chairman Leahy was willing to proceed with Senator Coburn's alternative approach to extend FBI Director Mueller's term. Despite initial concerns, Leahy agreed to the plan to pass the bill with Coburn's language, which was eventually amended and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate on July 21, 2011. The bill would need to be passed by the House and signed into law for a subsequent nomination to take place. If the bill is passed and signed into law, a nomination for Robert S. Mueller, III as Director of the FBI would receive expedited consideration. The nomination would be placed directly on the Executive Calendar, with 2 hours of debate and a vote without further motions. The President would be notified of the Senate's action, and legislative activities would resume. The Senate approved the bill under suspension of the rules, and President Obama signed it into law (P.L. 112-24). Mueller was nominated for a second term and confirmed by a vote of 100-0. Legal Overview discusses extending a term of office and the constitutionality of the directorship of the FBI. Congress has previously extended the terms of office for incumbents, such as the members serving on the Displaced Persons Commission. The original act established a commission with terms ending on June 30, 1951, but Congress amended it to extend the terms through August 31, 1952. The Attorney General issued an opinion on the validity of the commissioners' appointments until the extended date. The Attorney General concluded that the two commissioners would continue to hold office validly after June 30, 1951, citing prior incidents of Congress extending terms of office for certain commissions. Congress established the United States Parole Commission in 1976 as an independent agency within the Department of Justice, with commissioners appointed for a term of six years. Congress enacted a law in 1984 to extend the life of the Parole Commission and the terms of offices for an additional five years. Subsequent extensions were made in 1987, 1992, and 1996, with the 1996 extension repealing the provision for extending commissioners' terms. In 1984, Congress extended the Parole Commission's life and commissioners' terms by five years. The 1996 extension reinstated the 12-year time limit, affecting long-standing incumbent officers. Some commissioners served beyond their sixth year without reappointment. Proposed term limits for the FBI Director included a single 10-year term with a possible 5-year extension, or a 4-year term with reappointment options. The original bill proposed limiting the FBI Director to two 10-year terms, citing concerns over long tenures like J. Edgar Hoover's. The constitutionality of extending the Director's term depends on the appointment framework and the President's authority to remove the officer. The constitutionality of extending the FBI Director's term depends on the President's authority to remove the officer, as outlined in the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The power of removal is considered incident to the power of appointment. In Myers v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the President has the authority to remove presidentially appointed executive officers without Senate approval, as long as Congress does not expressly provide otherwise. Congress can regulate the appointment power but cannot directly involve itself in the removal process. The Supreme Court upheld a law restricting the President's ability to remove an agency official in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, distinguishing it from Myers v. United States where the President's removal power was upheld for purely executive officers. In Myers v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could control the terms of removal for officers not in the executive department. This approach shifted in Morrison v. Olson, where the focus was on whether a removal restriction interferes with the President's ability to exercise executive power. The statute at issue allowed an independent counsel to only be removed for \"good cause\" by the Attorney General. The Court in Morrison v. Olson found that an independent counsel could only be removed for \"good cause\" by the Attorney General, despite lacking significant policymaking or administrative authority. This decision weakened the standard set in Myers v. United States by establishing that there are no formal categories of executive officials who may or may not be removed at will. The focus in removal cases now centers on whether restrictions on the President's removal power impermissibly interfere with his constitutional duties. The President's ability to remove the FBI Director at will was established by President Bill Clinton's firing of Director William S. Sessions in 1993. There are no limitations on the President's power to remove the FBI Director within the 10-year term. Senators Byrd and Hruska emphasized this during Senate consideration of the 1976 measure. The President has the power to remove the FBI Director from office within their 10-year term. While the Administration requested Congress to extend the Director's tenure, this could raise constitutional concerns regarding congressional intrusion on the appointments process and impeding the President's duties. However, a court may find that such an extension does not violate the Appointments Clause as the President retains the authority to remove the Director. The President has the power to remove the FBI Director within their 10-year term. Extending the Director's tenure could raise constitutional concerns about congressional intrusion on appointments, but a court may find it does not violate the Appointments Clause as the President can still remove the Director. However, if the Director has existing statutory removal protection, extending their term could be seen as a violation of separation of powers principles. Opinions from the Department of Justice have traditionally supported this view. The Department of Justice has consistently concluded that lengthening an officer's tenure does not pose constitutional difficulties as long as the incumbent can be removed at will. Legislation extending a term of office where the incumbent can only be removed for cause requires a functional analysis but falls within Congress's authority as long as it does not usurp the President's appointing authority. The Department of Justice believes extending an officer's tenure is constitutional if the incumbent can be removed at will. Legislation extending a term of office for cause falls within Congress's authority as long as it doesn't impede the President's appointing authority. Courts have upheld laws extending the tenure of officers who can only be removed for cause, without distinguishing between at-will and for-cause positions. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Congress can imply power to extend terms of office prospectively. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Congress can imply power to extend terms of office prospectively, with a dissenting opinion stating that the Appointments Clause precludes such extensions. The Supreme Court rejected the idea that appointments must be 'long' rather than 'short'. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) found the reasoning in a previous case unpersuasive and stated that Congress could extend the term of the FBI Director without violating the Constitution. The OLC reaffirmed that as long as the President can remove the officer at will, extending their term does not infringe on the President's appointment authority. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion stated that legislation extending a term of office, such as that of the FBI Director, does not require a formal appointment by Congress and does not violate the Appointments Clause as long as the President can remove the officer at will. It is unlikely that an incumbent Director would need to be reappointed or go through a second confirmation hearing, although the Senate could choose to invite them to answer questions."
