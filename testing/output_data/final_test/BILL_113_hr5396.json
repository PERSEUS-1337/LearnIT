    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keeping Families Home Act of 2014\" and includes a Deed-for-Lease Program. Each servicer must establish a deed-for-lease program allowing eligible mortgagors to enter a deed in lieu of foreclosure agreement, lease the property for a year, and have the option to purchase it later. Small servicers are exempt from this requirement. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development defines the term. Servicers must inform eligible mortgagors about the Program and how to apply. The lease under the Program must have a monthly rent equal to fair market rent and typical lease provisions. Eligible mortgagors can apply at any time, even if there is a pending foreclosure sale. Eligible mortgagors must apply for the Program before 7 days prior to the foreclosure sale date. Once applied, the foreclosure sale will be halted until the application is evaluated. Proof of financial hardship is required for the application. Eligible mortgagors can pay the monthly rent amount, which should not exceed 31 percent of their monthly income. They must currently live in the property and intend to continue doing so during the 1-year lease term. If they believe they can afford a higher rent percentage, they can still apply for the Program. Eligible mortgagors can request a review by the Department of Housing and Urban Development if they believe they can afford a monthly rent amount higher than 31 percent of their income. If approved, a higher percentage will be used for the rent calculation. If an eligible mortgagor applies for the Program with a junior lien on their property, the servicer of the Program must also be the servicer of the junior lien. If the servicer of the Program is also the holder of the junior lien, they must release the lien for the eligible mortgagor to participate. If the servicer is not the holder, they must request the lien holder to release it. If the lien holder releases the lien, the mortgagor can participate; if not, they cannot. The servicer must evaluate the mortgagor's application within 30 days and notify them in writing of the decision. If not accepted, the servicer must provide a written explanation. Subsequent owners must also follow program requirements. Subsequent owners of the property leased under the Program must maintain and abide by its terms, certifying compliance to the Department of Housing and Urban Development before purchasing the property. The Department will issue regulations, evaluate compliance, and enforce the requirements of the Program. An \"eligible mortgagor\" is defined as a mortgagor under an \"eligible mortgage,\" which is a first or subordinate mortgage on a single-family property currently used as the mortgagor's principal residence. A \"single-family property\" can consist of 1 to 4 dwelling units, a unit in a multi-unit condominium with common areas, or a unit in a multi-unit project with stock or membership interest.
