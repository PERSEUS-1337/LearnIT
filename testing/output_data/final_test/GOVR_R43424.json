The Constitution, statutes, and recorded precedent guide the House's legislative actions. This overview explains common ways legislation is considered on the House floor and the types of propositions and opportunities for legislative debate available to Members. For a more comprehensive understanding, refer to CRS Report 95-563, The Legislative Process on the House Floor: An Introduction. The House of Representatives primarily uses the \"suspension\" method to approve bills and resolutions quickly. This process starts in the committee with bipartisan agreement, and the Speaker decides which measures will be considered under this procedure. Members are informed of measures to be considered through daily and weekly leadership notifications. The floor process for suspending the rules and passing a bill begins with a motion made by a Member, typically a committee or subcommittee chair. The motion is debatable for 40 minutes, with the majority party Member controlling 20 minutes and the minority party committee leader controlling the other 20 minutes. Members cannot offer amendments from the floor, and if the bill includes changes, the motion will be to \"suspend the rules and pass [the bill] as amended.\" Amendments are not debated or voted on separately. During the floor process for suspending the rules and passing a bill, debate time is allocated in advance or arranged among Members. A single vote is held with two-thirds of Members needed to agree. Many bills are passed by voice vote, with the Speaker determining the prevailing side. There is no record of individual votes, but a record vote can be requested by a Member. During the floor process for suspending the rules and passing a bill, debate time is allocated in advance or arranged among Members. A single vote is held with two-thirds of Members needed to agree. Most bills are passed by voice vote, with the Speaker determining the prevailing side. However, a record vote can be requested by a Member, alerting Members to vote by inserting their voting cards into machines. The Speaker may postpone record votes on suspension motions for later in the day. If a motion to suspend the rules fails, the bill remains eligible for consideration through another procedure. Special rules are used in the House when bills are unlikely to pass under suspension of the rules. These rules are proposed by the Committee on Rules and set the terms for debating and amending a measure. The House first approves a special rule and then considers a bill under the terms of that rule. Special rules allow for customization of procedures for each bill, making them a versatile method for considering legislation. Special rules in the House allow for customization of procedures for each bill. They generally fall into three categories based on amendment opportunities: open rules allow any floor amendments, closed rules do not allow any amendments, and structured rules have specific amendment procedures. The base text for consideration can vary depending on negotiations among committee and party leaders. Special rules in the House customize procedures for each bill, with open, closed, and structured rules dictating amendment opportunities. The process involves Rules Committee action, House action on the rule, and House action on the bill, typically starting with the committee of jurisdiction requesting a rule for consideration on the House floor. Measures under special rules are usually considered in public committee meetings with opportunities for amendments and voting on legislation reporting. The Rules Committee in the House customizes procedures for each bill, with open, closed, and structured rules dictating amendment opportunities. If a measure will be considered under a special rule, the committee makes an announcement on its website. Members can propose amendments to the modified text presented as a committee print, and testify before the Rules Committee during a hearing. Members of the House testify before the Rules Committee to request permission to offer amendments to a bill. If an amendment violates House rules, a waiver can be requested. The Rules Committee then votes on allowing specific amendments or waivers. A special rule is reported to the full House for consideration, including any specific amendments made in order. The chair of the Rules Committee or another member calls up the special rule on the floor. The Rules Committee member, serving as majority floor manager, calls up a special rule on the floor at a pre-arranged time. The chair yields time for debate, with members speaking for a minute or two. The majority floor manager then moves the previous question for a House vote on the main question. The House is ready to vote immediately on the main question, usually decided in the affirmative by majority party Members. Minority Members may urge a \"no vote\" on the previous question to allow the opposition leader to propose changes to the special rule. The vote on the previous question is often a record vote using voting machines. Once agreed to, the House votes on approving the special rule. The House votes immediately on approving the special rule, often by record vote. Once approved, the Speaker schedules consideration of the bill. The House then enters the Committee of the Whole for efficient debate on the bill. During general debate on a bill, Members are given time to speak, typically by floor managers. Amendments may be offered depending on the special rule, with closed rules not allowing floor amendments. Under an open rule, any amendment not violating House rules can be offered, and the bill is read section by section. Under an open rule, a bill is read section by section, and amendments can only be offered to the section being read. Members have five minutes to debate each amendment, with opportunities for additional debate time through motions. In the contemporary House, amendments are typically offered under a structured rule, where specific amendments and their proponents are identified in the accompanying report. The Committee of the Whole allows Members to offer amendments in a specified order, with each amendment debated for a set time. After amendments are approved, the bill is reported to the full House for approval. Record votes may occur before final passage, typically including a motion to recommit. In the House of Representatives, the motion to recommit allows the minority party to propose an amendment to a bill before it is sent back to committee. The motion is debatable for 10 minutes, with the minority party member and majority floor manager each given five minutes to speak. The content of the proposed amendment is not usually known in advance, leading to most motions to recommit failing. After the motion to recommit in the House of Representatives, the House votes on passing the bill, which is a crucial stage in the legislative process. Both the House and Senate must pass the bill in the same form before it can be sent to the President. If there are amendments, a compromise version must be negotiated through a conference committee or an exchange of amendments between the houses. The conference report, a recommended legislation resulting from negotiations between the House and Senate, must be approved by both chambers. No amendments are allowed to the conference report, as it represents the final compromise. Alternatively, the House and Senate may resolve differences through \"ping pong,\" shuttling a measure back and forth with amendments until an agreement is reached. The House may consider Senate amendments under a motion to suspend the rules or a special rule if two-thirds support is unlikely. The House may consider Senate amendments under a special rule to get two-thirds support, limiting opportunities for amendments or motions to recommit."
