    "content": "The \"Municipal Bond Insurance Enhancement Act of 2009\" establishes the Office of Public Finance and Federal Reinsurance for insurers of tax-exempt municipal bonds under section 314 of title 31, United States Code. The Office of Public Finance is established in the Department of the Treasury, with the Director appointed by the Secretary. The Office will provide reinsurance for insured losses of qualified municipal bond insurers. Reinsurance coverage under this subsection is available for insurers licensed to provide insurance for municipal bonds or debt obligations issued for public projects. Insurers must have a governing charter that prohibits certain activities at the time of purchasing reinsurance coverage. A qualified municipal bond insurer must have a charter that limits coverage to specified risks and may require approval from relevant authorities. The insurer can also enter into an agreement with the Director to only cover certain risks. The insurer is not restricted from retaining or fulfilling any obligations. The Director establishes risk-based premiums for reinsurance coverage, ensuring costs are covered without exceeding necessary amounts. The Director establishes terms for additional insurance coverage for State and local bonds to increase market capacity efficiently. The program limits reinsurance for bonds and debt obligations to $50 billion from 2010 to 2014, with appropriations authorized for administrative costs in the first year of operation. The Secretary of the Treasury must divest reinsurance assets acquired under the program within 5 years, ensuring no reduction in credit ratings. Definitions for this subsection are provided. The curr_chunk defines terms related to insured losses, municipal bonds, and qualified municipal bond insurers. The curr_chunk adds a new requirement for reinsurance coverage under a specific subsection. The Office of Public Finance will provide reinsurance coverage not considered a federal guarantee under tax-exempt bond requirements. This amendment will take effect upon the enactment of the Act."
