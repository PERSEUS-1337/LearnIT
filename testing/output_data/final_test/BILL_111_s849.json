FINDINGS.\" Step 4 - Summarized text chunk: \nCongress finds that black carbon is a component of ambient particulate matter, harmful to public health and contributing to climate change. Old diesel engines in the US are a major source of black carbon emissions. The US has made progress in reducing black carbon emissions through regulations. Congress acknowledges the need to reduce black carbon emissions by regulating new vehicles and engines, implementing a voluntary national diesel retrofit program. However, there are still over 11 million diesel engines in the US lacking the latest emission control technology. Gathering information and conducting research on black carbon is essential to identify cost-effective methods for reducing emissions and benefiting public health and the climate. The Act defines the term \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA and \"black carbon\" as light-absorbing particles from incomplete combustion. It also mandates a study on black carbon emissions. The Administrator, in consultation with various federal departments and agencies, will conduct a 4-phase study on black carbon emissions. Phase I involves establishing standard definitions for black carbon and organic carbon. Phase II of the study will summarize scientific and technical information on black carbon emissions, including sources, quantity, climate effects, and public health impacts. The curr_chunk discusses control strategies for reducing black carbon emissions, including diesel particulate filters for engines and emission reduction measures for marine vessels. It also mentions the use of carbon dioxide equivalency factors and modeling to compare climate effects. The curr_chunk discusses the global warming and health benefits of reducing black carbon emissions, as well as international funding for assistance in reducing these emissions and their impacts. The curr_chunk focuses on identifying opportunities for significant black carbon emission reductions in foreign countries through technical assistance and research recommendations for cost-effective technologies to reduce emissions and protect public health. The curr_chunk discusses actions the Federal Government could take to encourage black carbon emission reductions, including submitting reports to Congress on study results and recommendations. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. The Federal Government has authorized appropriations necessary to carry out actions to encourage black carbon emission reductions."
