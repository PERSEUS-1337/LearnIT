    "content": "The \"Agricultural Water Quality Policy Oversight Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, findings and definitions, interagency working group, advisory committee, leadership role of Department of Agriculture, privacy of personal data, and agricultural water quality programs. The \"Agricultural Water Quality Policy Oversight Act of 1999\" emphasizes the importance of using sound science in developing federal policies for private agricultural and rural lands. It highlights concerns about agriculture being a source of water pollution due to nutrient and non-point source pollution. Despite some studies being flawed, federal agencies are increasing regulatory burdens on farmers based on these studies. The Federal policy recommendations for addressing water pollution on agricultural lands should be based on sound science, peer-reviewed, and consider economic feasibility. Most farmers voluntarily implement conservation measures to reduce non-point source water pollution. Technical assistance is provided to help farmers implement these measures. Farmers seeking assistance from the Department of Agriculture provide detailed data. The Department of Agriculture shares detailed data and information about their operations, trusting that it will be kept confidential. Definitions in the Act include terms like \"Interagency Working Group,\" \"advisory committee,\" and \"sound science,\" which refers to scientifically reviewed information. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of an unbiased process for independent scholarly critique of research results, ensuring accuracy of data collection and analysis. It emphasizes the need for repeatable results in similar trials for information or techniques to be considered valid. The curr_chunk introduces the establishment of an Interagency Agricultural Water Quality Policy Working Group. The Interagency Agricultural Water Quality Policy Working Group is established in the executive branch, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture. Its purpose is to ensure the use of sound science in developing agricultural water quality policy and to provide advice on coordinating Federal water quality policy for private agricultural and rural lands. The Interagency Agricultural Water Quality Policy Working Group, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, includes representatives from the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Commerce, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal agencies. The group must hold its first meeting within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, will meet at least annually and require a majority quorum for business. All new Federal water quality policies for agricultural and rural lands must be approved by the group. They will also analyze current national water quality policies affecting these lands. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, will review existing Federal, State, local, and tribal laws and programs related to agricultural water quality policy. They will also assess recent agricultural water quality policy activities by Federal agencies and make recommendations to ensure sound science is the foundation of future policies. Additionally, they will consult with State Governors on integrating Federal agricultural water quality policies with ongoing programs. The Interagency Working Group, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, will submit a report to the President and Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The report will contain findings, conclusions, and recommendations for legislation and administrative actions based on their study. Approval of the report requires a majority vote from the Interagency Working Group members. The Interagency Working Group may hold hearings, gather information from federal agencies, and have the power to request necessary information to carry out its duties. SEC. 4. ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS AGRICULTURE-RELATED WATER QUALITY ISSUES. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish an advisory committee to address agriculture-related water quality issues, with representatives from the agriculture industry, producers, Department of Agriculture employees, research scientists, and other experts. The committee will advise on major water quality issues and report on the Department of Agriculture's role in providing assistance. The Department of Agriculture oversees agricultural water quality and policy, ensuring sound science is used. It considers the financial impact on farmers and ranchers and provides assistance to priority watersheds. The advisory committee meets as needed to advise the Secretary on water quality issues. The Department of Agriculture plays a key role in overseeing agricultural water quality and policy, considering financial impacts on farmers, providing assistance to priority watersheds, and convening an advisory committee to advise the Secretary on water quality issues. The Secretary of Agriculture ensures research cooperation with other federal agencies on agriculture-related water quality and oversees research results to ensure sound science is used. Additionally, efforts are made to reduce paperwork burden on federal agencies. The Secretary of Agriculture reviews efforts by other Federal agencies on agriculture-related water quality rules and makes recommendations to minimize paperwork and not impede normal agricultural activities. SEC. 6. MAINTAINING PRIVACY OF PERSONAL DATA RECEIVED BY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND DATA GATHERING LOCATIONS. Personal data provided to the Department of Agriculture for technical advice or assistance shall remain confidential. Conservation plans developed under the Secretary of Agriculture shall not be released to any other person or agency, except cooperating agencies. This information is considered privileged or confidential. Data collected by the Department of Agriculture, including inventory and monitoring site specific data, are considered privileged and confidential to protect personal privacy and cooperation of land-owners. Third party data collection on private lands must also adhere to confidentiality agreements. Data collected by the Department of Agriculture, including inventory and monitoring site specific data, are considered privileged and confidential to protect personal privacy and cooperation of land-owners. Using Department funds to collect information, produce a plan, or monitor sites is considered private and covered under subsection (a) and (b). SEC. 7. AGRICULTURAL WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS. Amendment to Section 208(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act authorizes appropriations for the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the program for fiscal years 2000 through 2010."
