    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Construction Safety Team Act of 2002\" and establishes National Construction Safety Teams. The National Construction Safety Team Act of 2002 authorizes the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish National Construction Safety Teams for rapid deployment after building failures causing significant loss of life. Procedures for team development and deployment must be developed within 3 months of the Act's enactment. The Director is responsible for updating procedures for Construction Safety Teams, including addressing conflicts of interest, establishing National Construction Safety Teams, determining team size, guiding information disclosure and investigations, and providing additional resources as needed. The Construction Safety Team may need to coordinate investigations with search and rescue efforts, provide public briefings on investigative proceedings, guide teams in evidence preservation, and coordinate with other entities conducting research on building failures. The Director will publish final procedures developed under the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act in the Federal Register promptly. SEC. 3. COMPOSITION OF TEAMS. Each National Construction Safety Team is led by a Director-appointed Team Leader and includes experts from various sectors, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other external professionals.\n\nSEC. 4. FUNCTIONS OF TEAMS. National Construction Safety Teams investigate building failures, evaluate evacuation procedures, recommend improvements to building standards, and suggest research to enhance structural safety and emergency response. In investigating a building failure under this Act, authorized individuals may enter property, inspect records and facilities, and test building components related to the failure. When investigating a building failure, authorized individuals may enter property, inspect records, and test building components. The National Construction Safety Team must avoid unnecessary interference with services and preserve evidence related to the failure. Coordination with search and rescue efforts is also required. The National Construction Safety Team must coordinate its investigation with search and rescue efforts at the building failure site and with other researchers conducting related studies. Memoranda of understanding will be established with federal agencies for investigation coordination. The National Construction Safety Team investigation takes priority over other federal agency investigations. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation takes precedence over the Construction Safety Team's investigation if related. If criminal acts are suspected, the Attorney General can prioritize investigations. The National Construction Safety Team shall relinquish investigative priority to the appropriate Federal law enforcement agency if a building failure may have been caused by a criminal act. This does not affect the Team's authority to continue the investigation. If a Federal law enforcement agency suspects a criminal act, they can notify the Director for further consultation with the National Construction Safety Team. The Construction Safety Team, in consultation with the head of the Federal law enforcement agency, must preserve evidence of the criminal act. SEC. 6. BRIEFINGS, HEARINGS, WITNESSES, AND SUBPOENAS. The Director of a National Construction Safety Team has the authority to conduct hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena necessary witnesses and evidence. The team is required to hold regular public briefings and may hold public hearings to gather testimony and inform the public on the progress of investigations. Witnesses can be summoned and evidence can be produced during investigations under this Act. The Director of a National Construction Safety Team has the authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses and evidence, with witnesses entitled to fees and mileage allowances. Subpoenas can be served by any person designated by the Director, and failure to obey a subpoena may result in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States. The court may punish a failure to obey an order to comply with a subpoena, order, or notice as contempt of court. SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL POWERS. The Director may support a National Construction Safety Team by procuring services, requesting resources from government agencies, conferring with employees, accepting voluntary services, making contracts with nonprofit entities, and involving nongovernmental members. The Director may involve nongovernmental members of the National Construction Safety Team and provide them reasonable compensation for their time spent on activities under this Act. SEC. 8. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. (a) A copy of a record, information, or investigation submitted or received by a National Construction Safety Team must be made available to the public upon request and at a reasonable cost. (b) Exceptions include information exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, or protected by other laws. (c) Safety-related information voluntarily provided shall not be disclosed by the National Construction Safety Team, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or any receiving agency. The National Construction Safety Team and the National Institute of Standards and Technology will not publicly release safety-related information received during an investigation if it could jeopardize public safety. Additionally, they may withhold voluntarily provided safety-related information if its disclosure would hinder future voluntary disclosures. SEC. 9. NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION SAFETY TEAM REPORT.\n\nWithin 90 days of completing an investigation, a National Construction Safety Team must issue a public report containing an analysis of building failure causes, recommendations for evacuation procedures, improvements to building standards, and actions to prevent future failures. The Director, in collaboration with relevant agencies, reviews and promotes the recommendations of the National Construction Safety Team regarding evacuation procedures, building standards, and codes after issuing a public report. The Director collaborates with relevant agencies to review and promote recommendations for building safety, including evacuation procedures, standards, codes, and practices to prevent future building failures. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology must submit an annual report to specific committees, detailing investigations and recommendations by National Construction Safety Teams, as well as actions taken in response to those reports. Additionally, there is a provision for the establishment of an Advisory Committee. The Director, in consultation with relevant federal agencies, establishes an advisory committee to advise on implementing the Act and reviewing procedures and reports. The advisory committee must submit an annual report to specific congressional committees, evaluating National Construction Safety Teams' activities and recommending improvements. The advisory committee established under the Act will not be subject to the duration restrictions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will be subject to the authorities and restrictions of the Act in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. An amendment to the National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986 allows for investigations under the National Construction Safety Team Act of 2002. $25,000,000 is authorized for the National Institute of Standards and Technology for fiscal years 2003 through 2005."
