The \"Equal Education Funding Act\" makes amendments to the amount of grants for territories and local educational agencies under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The changes include increasing the percentage from 1 to 4.5 percent and specifying allocations for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The \"Equal Education Funding Act\" increases grants for territories and local educational agencies under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It involves calculating the sum based on the number of children, educational cost factor, and per pupil effort factor of the State. Amendments are made to subparagraph (C) for clarification. Amendments are made to subparagraph (C) to adjust the amount of the average educational cost factor based on whether it is below 80% or above 120% of the national average. The average educational cost factor in the United States shall be 120 percent of the national average, with adjustments made if it falls below 80 percent or above 120 percent. The pupil effort factor in the State is set at 120 percent of the national average. Puerto Rico is included in the determination of the number of children for local educational agencies. The determination of annual poverty statistics for local educational agencies is based on criteria developed by the Department of Commerce or annual percentage adjustments to the most recent poverty statistics available. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Part A of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by inserting after section 1005, the following: \"SEC. 1005a. TERMS DEFINED FOR BASIC GRANTS.\" The term 'average per pupil expenditure' refers to the total current expenditures of all local educational agencies in a State or the United States divided by the number of enrolled children. The term 'average educational cost factor' is calculated as 50% of the ratio of a State's average per pupil expenditure to all States. The term 'average instructional staff salaries factor' is the average salary of classroom teachers in a State divided by the average for all States. 'Per pupil income' is the total gross personal income of a State divided by the number of children aged 5 to 17. 'Average per pupil effort factor' is the average per pupil expenditure divided by the average per pupil income factor of the State. The average per pupil effort factor is calculated by dividing the average per pupil expenditure of the United States by the average per pupil income factor of the United States."
