    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ALS Registry Act\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The \"ALS Registry Act\" includes key findings about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. The average life expectancy for ALS patients is 2 to 5 years, and only one FDA-approved drug offers modest effects. Over 5,000 new ALS cases are diagnosed annually in the US, with up to 30,000 individuals living with the disease. The establishment of a national registry for ALS will help identify the incidence and prevalence of the disease in the United States. Several ALS disease registries and databases exist globally, but a single national system in the US does not currently collect and store information on ALS cases. The national ALS registry in the United States aims to collect important data, promote understanding, research genetic and environmental factors, facilitate patient-scientist communication, and enhance efforts to find treatments and a cure for ALS. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 399O, which establishes an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry. The Secretary will establish a national registry for collecting data on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) within 6 months of receiving a report. The registry will include information on the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States. The national registry for ALS aims to gather data on the disease's incidence, prevalence, environmental factors, demographics of patients, and other relevant information recommended by the Advisory Committee. It also aims to securely connect patients with resources. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry will establish a secure method for patients to connect with scientists studying the causes and therapies for motor neuron disease. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry includes representatives from national health associations focused on ALS, the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and patients with ALS or their family members. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry includes representatives from various fields such as clinicians, epidemiologists, geneticists, statisticians, ethicists, attorneys, and other interested individuals. Their duties involve studying and making recommendations to the Secretary on the development and maintenance of the National ALS Registry. The Advisory Committee on the National ALS Registry is responsible for studying and making recommendations on the development and maintenance of the Registry, including the type of information collected, data collection methods, data use guidelines, and information on diseases affecting motor neurons essential for ALS research. Within 6 months of establishment, the Committee must submit a report with recommendations on study results. The Advisory Committee advises on the ALS Registry study results. The Secretary can award grants for data collection on ALS. Coordination with existing registries is required for the National ALS Registry. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion of various registries and infrastructure in the Federal public health and environmental sector, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs ALS Registry, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Human Genetics Resource Center, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry studies in multiple states, State-based ALS registries, and the National Vital Statistics System. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a national database for motor neuron diseases, including coordination with existing databases and ensuring public access while protecting personal privacy. The Secretary will ensure that information collected is shared with the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs. A national voluntary health association is defined as a non-profit organization with chapters nationwide. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding for 2007-2010."
