    "content": "The Act of 1997 is titled the \"Acid Deposition and Ozone Control Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that reducing atmospheric nitrogen oxide will decrease acidic deposition and its adverse effects on public health, natural resources, and ecosystems. This reduction will also lower levels of tropospheric ozone, fine particulate matter, and regional haze, which pose threats to public health. Reducing nitrogen deposition can lead to decreased algal blooms and improved water quality, benefiting marine life and economic activities. Further reductions in sulfur dioxide levels will decrease acidic deposition and improve air quality. The Clean Air Act's allowance trading program has been effective in reducing emissions cost-effectively. Technology exists to reduce sulfur emissions inexpensively. The Act aims to support the EPA's goal of controlling ground-level ozone through regional measures, utilizing existing technology to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions beyond current requirements. It also addresses the need to include all necessary states in the ozone transport region for effective reduction. The Act aims to recognize the threat of nitrogen oxide emissions to public health and the environment, require reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions, address regional tropospheric ozone issues, and expand the ozone transport region membership to effectively reduce pollution. The Act aims to expand the ozone transport region membership to include States contributing to ozone levels in noncompliance areas, using the best available science. The Act aims to expand the ozone transport region membership to include States contributing to ozone levels in noncompliance areas, using the best available science. Control of interstate ozone air pollution is addressed in Section 3. The Clean Air Act is amended to add States to the ozone transport region based on their contribution to ozone levels in noncompliant areas. Control measures must apply to newly added States within 18 months. The Clean Air Act is amended to include States in the ozone transport region based on their impact on ozone levels in noncompliant areas, with control measures applying to newly added States within 18 months. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. Section 184 of the Clean Air Act is amended to require reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in newly added states to the ozone transport region to 1/3 of 1990 levels by 2003. The Administrator may establish an allowance trading program for this purpose. The amendment to Section 184 of the Clean Air Act mandates reductions in nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in new states added to the ozone transport region to 1/3 of 1990 levels by 2003. This amendment does not affect laws requiring greater emission reductions."
