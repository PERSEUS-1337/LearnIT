    "content": "As of March 26, 2007, 25,320 military personnel were classified as Wounded in Action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. 54.8% were treated locally and returned to duty within 72 hours, while 45.2% required longer treatment or evacuation to military hospitals in Kuwait, Spain, or Germany. Soldiers needing more than 30 days of care were evacuated to the United States for treatment at specialized medical centers. Immediate life-saving care is provided by trained personnel in combat situations before evacuation to Forward Surgical Teams.

DOD and individual military service support programs assist disabled service members and their families with pay, promotion, medical evaluation, retirement, and transition to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to establish uniform policies and procedures for these programs. The support programs for wounded military personnel lack coordinated guidance, leading to inconsistencies in eligibility criteria and care among different services. There is no DOD-coordinated directive establishing complementary service roles or standardized metrics for program evaluation. The DOD's MSI program assists all service members, while the Army requires specific eligibility criteria. Lack of standardized metrics hinders program evaluation and coordination. The FY2006 NDAA mandates a comprehensive policy for assisting wounded service members. The FY2006 NDAA mandates uniform procedures and standards for assisting wounded service members, to be integrated into service regulations by September 1, 2006. DOD may report to Congress on its implementation efforts."
