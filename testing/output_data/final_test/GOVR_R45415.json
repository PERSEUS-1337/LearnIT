    "content": "Many observers view sanctions as a key part of U.S. policy to address Russian aggression, including the invasion of Ukraine, election interference, cyberattacks, human rights abuses, illicit trade with North Korea, support for Syria, and use of chemical weapons. Most Members of Congress support using sanctions to deter further objectionable activities by Russia. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are based on national emergency authorities granted to the President. The Emergencies Act and International Emergency Economic Powers Act were used by President Obama in 2014 to impose sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. Various executive orders and legislation have been utilized to impose sanctions on Russia for different concerns, including the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act and the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017, as amended, strengthens sanctions authorities from previous legislation and identifies new sanctions targets. It also establishes congressional review of any actions to ease or lift sanctions. Concerns have been raised about the Trump Administration's pace in implementing sanctions, particularly towards Russia. The Trump Administration has implemented sanctions on Russia under the CRIEEA, with 29 designations made as of the start of 2019. Some Members of Congress are urging for more designations to be made based on CRIEEA's mandatory sanctions provisions. The Trump Administration has implemented various Russia-related sanctions under different authorities, including Ukraine-related and cyber-related EOs, as well as designations based on earlier legislation like the Sergei Magnitsky Act and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Sanctions on Russia have been imposed in coordination with the European Union, particularly during the invasion of Ukraine in 2014. The Obama Administration emphasized EU support for sanctions during the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, highlighting U.S.-EU cooperation to counter Russian efforts to divide transatlantic partners. Concerns arose in the EU regarding U.S. commitment to sanctions coordination under the Trump Administration. Sanctions on Russia aim to pressure withdrawal from Crimea and eastern Ukraine, halt cyber attacks, and respond to malicious activities. The text discusses the use of sanctions to deter human rights abuses and corruption, abide by international conventions, and halt Russia's support to certain regimes. It also mentions Russia's actions in Ukraine, including the occupation of Crimea, fostering separatism in eastern Ukraine, and interference with commercial traffic in the Kerch Strait. Russia has signed agreements recognizing eastern Ukraine as part of Ukraine, with separatist military operations limited to the conflict zone perimeter. Sanctions for cyber activities, human rights abuses, and other malign behavior have uncertain impact on Russian behavior. Sanctions on Russia may not change behavior due to various reasons such as policymakers willing to incur costs, unintended support for the government, and limited economic impact. Most sanctions target specific individuals and entities rather than the entire Russian economy. Overall, the majority of the largest firms in Russia are not directly affected by U.S. or EU sanctions, with the economy being more impacted by global oil prices than sanctions. The sanctions were designed to have a limited economic impact, targeting specific individuals and entities responsible for certain actions. The U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia targeted specific individuals and entities associated with key policymakers to induce behavioral change while minimizing collateral damage. Some sanctions aimed to pressure the Russian economy long-term by restricting access to Western technology for oil companies. The economic impact of these restrictions is still unfolding, with evidence showing broad effects on economically significant targets like the April 2018 sanctions on Rusal, which caused instability in global financial markets. The sanctions on Rusal had significant effects on Russian and global financial markets. The Treasury Department announced plans to remove sanctions on Rusal pending congressional review, based on an agreement involving Oleg Deripaska relinquishing control over the firm. This report offers a comprehensive overview of U.S. sanctions in foreign policy towards Russia. The report provides an overview of U.S. sanctions on Russia, including authorities, tools, targets, historical context, countersanctions by Russia, coordination with the EU, and economic impact. Economic sanctions are tools used by Congress and the President to alter objectionable behavior of foreign entities for national security or foreign policy objectives. They include trade restrictions, asset blocking, limits on financial system access, and restrictions on loans and investments. Sanctions, including trade restrictions, asset blocking, and limits on financial system access, can also involve denial of foreign assistance, government contracts, and participation in international financial institutions. Secondary sanctions target third parties facilitating sanctions evasion. US sanctions on Russia focus on specific individuals, entities, and vessels rather than the Russian state directly. Sanctions target specific individuals, entities, and vessels on the SDN list, blocking their U.S.-based assets and prohibiting transactions. The Secretary of State can deny entry or revoke visas for designated foreign nationals. Sectoral sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine focus on specific entities in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors identified on the SSI list. The OFAC has identified entities for inclusion on the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List, prohibiting certain transactions for U.S. individuals and entities. Russia-related sanctions also include a presumption of denial for export licenses to designated end users. The President holds significant authority in using economic sanctions in U.S. foreign policy, with Congress enacting sanctions in legislation for the President to adhere to. The President has the authority to determine individuals and entities subject to sanctions under legislation. This is done by declaring a national emergency and invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to address threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. President Obama and President Trump have used the NEA and IEEPA to declare national emergencies related to cyber-enabled malicious activities, election interference, and Russia's 2014 interference in Ukraine. Congress influences which foreign policy and national security concerns the United States responds to with sanctions by enacting legislation to authorize the President to use sanctions. Congress authorizes the President to use sanctions to deter various threats, but limitations exist due to the Constitution's bill of attainder clause. Congress defines sanctions targets and behaviors, leaving the President to determine guilt and punishment. In the executive branch, agencies like the Department of the Treasury's OFAC and Department of State have varying responsibilities in implementing and administering sanctions. OFAC designates individuals and entities for asset blocking, transaction prohibitions, and trade limitations. The Department of State restricts visas, arms sales, and foreign aid, implements UN arms embargoes, and limits the use of U.S. passports in certain cases. The United States imposes sanctions on Russia through various laws and executive orders, including restrictions on passports, diplomatic relations, commercial exports, arms sales, and military cooperation. The Department of Justice investigates and prosecutes violations of sanctions and export laws. Sanctions were introduced in response to human rights abuses in 2012, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, election interference in 2016, and strengthened by new legislation in 2017. The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia through various laws and executive orders, including restrictions on passports, diplomatic relations, commercial exports, arms sales, and military cooperation. Legislation has been passed to strengthen existing sanctions authorities and establish new sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cyber activities, human rights abuses, and corruption. Sanctions have also been imposed on Russian individuals and entities for various reasons such as the use of chemical weapons, weapons proliferation, trade violations with North Korea, support for the Syrian government, transnational crime, and terrorism. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 was passed in response to the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who uncovered tax fraud implicating government officials. The Sergei Magnitsky Act, passed in response to tax fraud implicating government officials, requires the President to impose sanctions on those involved in criminal activities and human rights abuses in Russia. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, passed in 2016, allows for global application of sanctions against individuals committing human rights abuses. The Global Magnitsky Act, passed in 2016, authorizes the President to impose sanctions globally on government officials and associates responsible for significant corruption and human rights violations. 38 out of 49 individuals designated under the Sergei Magnitsky Act are directly linked to the crimes uncovered by Magnitsky. Additional designations include individuals from Russia's Chechnya region for human rights violations and killings, as well as suspects in the murder of Paul Klebnikov and former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. President Trump issued EO 13818 in December 2017 to implement the Global Magnitsky Act. In December 2017, President Trump expanded sanctions under EO 13818 to target those committing \"serious human rights abuse\" globally. The first 13 designations included two Russian citizens for alleged high-level corruption. Most OFAC designations of Russians were in response to the 2014 Crimea annexation and conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United States has imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on over 650 individuals, entities, and vessels, with the basis being four executive orders issued by President Obama in 2014. These sanctions target those who have undermined democratic processes or institutions in Ukraine, peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity. The United States has imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on over 650 individuals, entities, and vessels based on four executive orders issued by President Obama in 2014. These sanctions target those who have undermined democratic processes or institutions in Ukraine, peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity. Sanctions include measures against those conducting business in occupied Crimea, Russian government officials, supporters, arms sector operators, and entities in key sectors of the Russian economy. OFAC has established four SDN lists based on these executive orders. OFAC has placed over 365 individuals, entities, and vessels on Ukraine-related SDN lists, targeting former Ukrainian officials, separatist officials, Russian-based fighters, and companies. Sanctions also include Russian government officials, members of parliament, and prominent businesspeople designated under different executive orders. The Treasury Department has designated prominent Russian government officials, heads of state-owned companies, politically connected billionaires, and individuals considered part of Vladimir Putin's \"inner circle\" under various executive orders. This includes ministers, directors, CEOs, and oligarchs, with 11 billionaires among Russia's wealthiest individuals targeted for sanctions. The Treasury Department has designated 11 Russian billionaires as part of sanctions, including entities like Bank Rossiya, Rusal, and defense firms like Almaz-Antey and Kalashnikov Group. The Treasury Department has designated 11 Russian billionaires and entities like Bank Rossiya, Rusal, and defense firms like Almaz-Antey and Kalashnikov Group. OFAC uses EO 13662 to identify entities for inclusion on the SSI List, imposing restrictions on transactions with entities in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors, as well as those involved in Russian oil projects. The SSI List includes major state-owned companies in the financial, energy, and defense sectors, with 13 Russian companies and their subsidiaries listed. This includes entities like Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Rosneft, Gazpromneft, Transneft, Novatek, Rostec, and others. These entities have restrictions on transactions due to requirements enacted in CRIEEA in 2017. The SSI List includes major state-owned companies in the financial, energy, and defense sectors, with 13 Russian companies and their subsidiaries listed. This includes entities like Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Rosneft, Gazpromneft, Transneft, Novatek, Rostec, and others. Restrictions on transactions related to deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil projects apply to companies like Rosneft, Gazpromneft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegaz, and Gazprom. President Obama signed the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act (SSIDES) and the Ukraine Freedom Support Act (UFSA) in 2014. President Trump signed the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act (CRIEEA) in 2017. President Trump cited SSIDES, as amended by CRIEEA, to designate individuals and entities for human rights abuses in territories occupied by Russia. UFSA has not been used for sanctions designations. Sanctions authorities in SSIDES and UFSA overlap with executive orders issued under emergency authorities. Many individuals and entities have been designated by OFAC for destabilizing Ukraine. Many individuals and entities have been designated by OFAC for destabilizing Ukraine, potentially under SSIDES for corruption and UFSA for arms transfers and energy export cutoffs. SSIDES and UFSA provide additional sanctions provisions against Russian individuals and entities. The executive branch imposes secondary sanctions on foreign individuals and entities aiding Russia-related designees to evade sanctions or invest in certain oil projects in Russia. President Obama invoked national emergency authorities to address cyberattacks attributed to the Russian government. President Obama declared a national emergency in response to malicious cyber-enabled activities in April 2015, with the first designations announced in December 2016. He issued EO 13757 on December 28, 2016, amending EO 13694 to impose sanctions on individuals and entities involved in election-related cyber activities, including Russia's FSB, GRU, and four GRU officers. OFAC also designated two individuals for financial-related malicious cyber activities. In March 2018, the Trump Administration designated 13 individuals and 3 entities for election-related malicious cyber activities, including the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and its employees. In June and August 2018, OFAC designated five individuals and seven entities referred to as FSB enablers, one of which was Divetechnoservices procuring equipment for Russian government agencies. The Treasury Department noted Russia's activity in tracking undersea communications cables and designated individuals and entities for cyber-enabled election interference related to Project Lakhta. This effort includes the IRA and has the same financial backers. Designees were charged for conspiracy to defraud the US political system, including the 2018 midterm election. Designees also included entities representing themselves as media outlets. In August 2017, CRIEEA codified EO 13694, expanding cyber-related sanctions to activities undermining cybersecurity for democratic institutions. The Trump Administration designated FSB, GRU, and others for the \"NotPetya\" ransomware attack in 2017. In December 2018, OFAC designated 13 GRU officers for cybersecurity undermining. OFAC designated 13 GRU officers for cyber-related election interference, cyber-enabled operations against WADA and/or OPCW, and the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in the UK using a nerve agent. These officers were also indicted by the Department of Justice for related crimes. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (CRIEEA) under CAATSA strengthens sanctions authorities related to Ukraine and cyber issues. The Trump Administration has made 29 designations under CRIEEA, focusing on cyberattacks, human rights abuses, and arms sales. Other new CRIEEA authorities have not been utilized yet. The Trump Administration has made 29 designations under CRIEEA, focusing on cyberattacks, human rights abuses, and arms sales. Some Members of Congress have called for more designations based on CRIEEA's mandatory sanctions provisions. OFAC made its first designations under new CRIEEA authorities in response to actions taken to undermine cybersecurity, including designating entities and individuals responsible for a global ransomware attack. OFAC imposed sanctions on politically connected Russian billionaires, companies, and government officials under Ukraine-related EOs codified by CRIEEA. Several rounds of designations were made in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, OFAC designated individuals and entities as FSB enablers for cyber-enabled activities. On September 20, 2018, the Administration imposed secondary sanctions against entities engaged in \"significant transactions\" with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors. OFAC designated the Equipment Development Department of China's Central Military Commission and its director for receiving combat aircraft and missile system-related equipment. On November 8, 2018, OFAC designated individuals and entities for human rights abuses in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. On December 19, 2018, OFAC designated individuals and entities for cyber-enabled election interference. The Administration imposed sanctions under EO 13694 and CRIEEA for cyber-related election interference, cyberattacks, and attempted assassination in the UK. Other CRIEEA authorities could target foreign investment in Russian oil projects, financial institutions facilitating transactions for Russia's defense or energy sectors, those involved in corruption, and sanctions evaders. The Trump Administration's implementation of sanctions, including those related to Russia and Syria, has raised questions in Congress about its commitment. Officials claim they are enforcing a robust set of sanctions, including new requirements under CRIEEA. President Trump signed CAATSA into law in August 2017, calling it \"significantly flawed\" and expressing concerns about unconstitutional provisions. In early 2018, Members of Congress urged the President to implement mandatory sanctions under CRIEEA in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and Crimea. OFAC made its first designations on March 15, 2018. On March 15, 2018, OFAC made its first designations under CRIEEA's new authorities, including through cyber attacks. The Administration may choose not to invoke various CRIEEA authorities for reasons such as citing only relevant executive orders, different evidentiary requirements for sanctions provisions, ongoing investigations, and using a specific authority to deter objectionable activity. The State Department issued guidance on Section 231 sanctions under CRIEEA, which targets individuals and entities engaging in significant transactions with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors. Factors considered include impact on U.S. national security, transaction magnitude, and relation to Russian government sectors. The State Department issued guidance on Section 231 sanctions under CRIEEA, targeting individuals and entities involved in significant transactions with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors. The Administration fulfilled a requirement to specify entities related to these sectors, emphasizing that while they were not subject to sanctions, secondary sanctions could be imposed on those engaging in significant transactions with them. In January 2018, the Administration noted the impact of Section 231 sanctions on foreign governments, leading to billions of dollars in abandoned Russian defense acquisitions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson advised countries to reconsider purchases from Russia, resulting in foreclosed arms deals worth $8 to $10 billion by August 2018. The Administration sought greater flexibility with Section 231 sanctions, allowing for waivers based on national security reasons. Secretary of Defense James Mattis requested a more flexible waiver authority to prevent hindering actions in the best interest of the US and allies. In July 2018, Secretary Mattis requested a national security waiver to support allies in moving closer to the U.S. and reduce reliance on Russian weapons. Congress amended Section 231 to provide this waiver without congressional review, aiming to undermine Russian influence globally. The President must certify that a transaction would not endanger the United States' alliances, compromise defense systems, or impact defense cooperation with the country. The country must also reduce reliance on Russian arms or cooperate with the U.S. on national security matters. OFAC made designations under Section 231 against China's Equipment Development Department for acquiring Russian military equipment. In December 2017, Russia delivered 10 Su-35 combat aircraft and S-400 surface-to-air missile system equipment to the US. The State Department expanded the List of Specified Persons related to Russia's defense and intelligence sectors, imposing mandatory sanctions on those engaging in significant transactions with listed individuals. Additionally, in December 2018, the State Department further expanded the list as required by CRIEEA Section 241, which identifies corruption among senior Russian political figures and oligarchs. The Treasury Department submitted a report in January 2018 on wealthy Russians with links to corruption and international business affiliations. The report included a classified annex with detailed analysis, leading to speculation about potential new sanctions based on the information provided. In a testimony to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin mentioned plans to implement additional sanctions based on a report and intelligence gathered. On April 6, 2018, OFAC designated Russian billionaires, companies, and government officials under Ukraine-related authorities. The Treasury Department emphasized that these designations were in response to global malign activity, not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian oligarchs profiting from corruption. The designation of Rusal, a major global producer, was part of these actions. The US government designated Rusal, a top global aluminum producer, under sanctions, causing concern for possible secondary sanctions on foreign entities. The Trump Administration allowed a wind-down period for transactions with Rusal, indicating a willingness to remove sanctions if Kremlin-connected billionaire Oleg Deripaska divested. The Treasury Department announced an agreement to eliminate Deripaska's control of Rusal's parent company, leading to the intention to lift sanctions on Rusal and two related companies. Congress has the authority to review and potentially block this action within 30 days. The US imposes sanctions on Russian entities for various objectionable activities. On August 6, 2018, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo determined that the Russian government violated U.N. Security Council requirements by using a chemical weapon in the United Kingdom. This triggered the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, leading to the termination of arms sales and other forms of assistance from the U.S. The Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 allows the President to impose sanctions, including denying financial assistance and export licenses, upon determining the use of chemical weapons. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Ford announced these sanctions on August 27, 2018, with waivers for certain national security-related activities. The Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 allows the President to impose sanctions on Russia for using chemical or biological weapons. If Russia is found to be using these weapons, the President must take further punitive steps within three months unless Russia meets certain conditions. These conditions include providing assurances that they will not engage in such activities in the future and allowing on-site inspections by international observers. Failure to meet these conditions may result in additional sanctions imposed in consultation with Congress. If the President does not certify on all terms, he must oppose support to Russia in international financial institutions, prohibit U.S. banks from making loans to the Russian government, restrict exports and imports, downgrade diplomatic relations, and suspend foreign air carriers owned by Russia. As of the start of 2019, new sanctions had not been imposed, and Russia had not met the conditions to avoid sanctions. The State Department informed Congress that Russia did not meet the required conditions to avoid sanctions under the CBW Act, intending to proceed with implementing additional sanctions. The President has the authority to waive sanctions if deemed essential to U.S. national security interests or if there is a fundamental change in Russia's government leadership and policies. CBW-related sanctions on Russia remain in place for at least a year and can only be lifted if the President certifies to Congress that specific conditions have been met. Sanctions may include restrictions on procurement contracts, import/export licensing, denial of foreign aid, and sales of defense articles/services. Sales of defense articles and services subject to U.S. export control are restricted for Russian state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport and six other Russian defense entities due to sanctions. These restrictions have been in place since 2013 and are in addition to sectoral sanctions imposed in 2015 and its designation as an SDN in 2018 for supporting the Syrian government. The prohibitions against transactions with Rosoboronexport do not apply to contracts related to the maintenance or repair of Mi-17 helicopters purchased by the United States for Afghanistan's security forces and global counterterrorism efforts. Additionally, procurement related to optical sensors for monitoring Russia's Open Skies Treaty compliance is exempt. In 2012, the Department of Commerce imposed restrictions on Russian and other entities for suspected violations of export regulations. In December 2017, BIS imposed export-licensing restrictions on two entities for producing a ground-launched cruise missile system in violation of a treaty. The U.N. Security Council has required member states to curtail relations with North Korea due to its nuclear weapons testing and missile development efforts. The United States has imposed sanctions on North Korea for various violations, including abuse of diplomatic privileges, money laundering, and disruption of regional stability. These sanctions target designated North Korean individuals and entities, as well as foreign individuals and entities supporting them. In addition, in 2017, OFAC designated a Russian oil company and its subsidiaries, along with individuals and companies from Singapore, for trading in petroleum. OFAC imposed sanctions on companies and individuals for trading in petroleum with North Korea under EO 13722. Two Russian entities and individuals were also sanctioned for providing supplies to a North Korean company involved in weapons programs. In August and September 2018, four entities and six vessels were designated for facilitating trade with North Korea. A Russian bank was sanctioned for facilitating transactions with a designated individual involved in weapons activities. Additionally, two Russian shipping companies and six vessels were designated for involvement in ship-to-ship transfer of petroleum products under EO 13810. OFAC imposed sanctions on companies and individuals for trading in petroleum with North Korea under EO 13722. In September 2018, a Russia-based front company was designated for facilitating the exportation of information technology workers from North Korea. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on Syria for various reasons including support of international terrorism and escalating violence against its own people. In April 2018, OFAC designated Russia's state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport and an associated bank for providing support to the government of Syria. Russian individuals and entities are also sanctioned for involvement in transnational crime, with at least 15 individuals and 6 entities currently designated. In December 2017, OFAC designated the \"Thieves-in-Law\" as a transnational criminal organization. OFAC designated Russian individuals and entities as TCOs for their ties to the Thieves-in-Law, including those previously designated under the Brothers' Circle. Russian entities and individuals are also subject to sanctions for global terrorism, with at least 2 entities and 12 individuals designated as SDGTs. The Caucasus Emirate, a terrorist group in Russia, was established in 2007, with its founder Doku Umarov listed as an SDGT in 2010. In 2015, the Islamic State recognized the Caucasus Province as its local affiliate, previously affiliated with the Caucasus Emirate. The Caucasus Province was designated as an SDGT in September 2015. FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations restrict assistance to the Russian government, with specific prohibitions on defense funding and funds to Russia from its Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Account. The Programs Appropriations Act, 2018 prohibits funds to Russia's central government and invokes country notification procedures for foreign aid. Russia is identified as a Tier 3 nation for human trafficking in the State Department's 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report. Secretary of State Pompeo included Russia on the Special Watch List for severe violations of religious freedom in December 2018. The United States established a Special Watch List in 2016 to publicly name foreign governments with deteriorating religious freedoms. Being on this list warns of potential designation as a Country of Particular Concern, leading to sanctions. Russia has responded with countersanctions to U.S. sanctions, affecting imports like beef, pork, and poultry. The Russian government responded to U.S. sanctions by imposing bans on U.S. adoptions of Russian children, visa restrictions on U.S. citizens, and travel prohibitions. They also issued a list of U.S. citizens prohibited from entering Russia and imposed countersanctions on agricultural imports in response to Ukraine-related sanctions. Additionally, Russia imposed countersanctions related to the CRIEEA in anticipation of the act being signed into law. In response to U.S. sanctions, the Russian government imposed bans on U.S. adoptions, visa restrictions, and travel prohibitions. They also implemented countersanctions on agricultural imports. Congress passed legislation in July 2017, leading to a reduction of U.S. mission personnel in Russia. The Trump Administration closed Russia's Consulate General in San Francisco and other diplomatic facilities in the U.S. in retaliation. In response to U.S. sanctions, Russia expelled diplomats and closed diplomatic facilities. The EU has also imposed sanctions on Russia since 2014 for its actions in Ukraine. President Putin signed a law authorizing restrictions on trade with the U.S. and other unfriendly states. The EU imposed Ukraine-related sanctions in cooperation with the United States, aligning with U.S. sanctions. Congress introduced new sanctions in CRIEEA, raising concerns in Europe. The EU has not sanctioned Russia for various violations, but the nerve agent attack in the UK led to a new EU sanctions regime targeting individuals and entities involved. The EU and the United States have imposed sanctions on individuals and entities involved in chemical weapons development. Momentum is growing within the EU for new restrictive measures against cyberattacks and human rights violations. Sanctions are imposed for a defined period to incentivize change and require unanimous agreement among all EU member states. U.S.-EU cooperation on sanctions aims to support Ukraine's political transition and territorial integrity. In 2014, U.S.-EU cooperation on sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict was seen as a high point in transatlantic relations. Sanctions initially focused on visa denials and asset freezes for Russian and Ukrainian officials. The U.S. imposed sectoral sanctions in July 2014, while some EU countries were hesitant due to concerns about trade relations with Russia and energy supplies. In July 2014, after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 by Russian-supplied missiles, Europe changed its stance on sanctions against Russia. The EU expanded its sanctions list, targeting individuals, entities, and companies in Russia's financial, defense, and energy sectors, aligning with the United States. In September 2014, the United States and the EU tightened sectoral sanctions to send a unified message to Russia. EU member states faced challenges in agreeing on sectoral sanctions due to varying economic interests and historical relations with Russia. Germany and other states dependent on Russian gas supplies sought to protect national economic interests. The EU applied lending and investment restrictions only in the oil sector, not to Gazprom or other companies in the Russian gas sector. Sectoral sanctions were designed to share economic burdens across member states and are tied to the full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements for Ukraine. Questions persist about the effectiveness of the sanctions, especially regarding their impact on EU relations with Russia. EU sanctions on Russia, including countersanctions, have financial costs for certain industries in some EU member states. Some European officials consider restructuring the sanctions, while others reject relaxing them. The sanctions consist of measures on individuals and entities involved in Crimea's annexation and eastern Ukraine destabilization. As of 2019, the EU has designated 164 individuals and 44 entities. The EU has imposed economic sanctions on Russia, targeting its finance, defense, and energy sectors. These sanctions include lending and investment restrictions on major state-controlled Russian banks, defense firms, and energy companies. Additionally, there are bans on arms import/export, sale of dual-use goods to Russian military, and sales of equipment for oil-development projects. Restrictions also apply to economic relations with Ukraine's occupied Crimea region. EU individuals and companies are prohibited from certain imports, exports, and technology transfers. The EU has imposed economic sanctions on Russia, targeting its finance, defense, and energy sectors, including restrictions on major state-controlled Russian banks, defense firms, and energy companies. In addition, the EU has imposed restrictive measures on individuals responsible for misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds and abuse of office, freezing assets and imposing visa bans on 13 former Ukrainian officials, including ex-president Viktor Yanukovych. The United States and the EU have imposed sanctions on individuals and entities related to the conflict in Ukraine. The US has designated 209 individuals, 158 entities, and 2 vessels, while the EU has designated 177 individuals and 44 entities. Both have targeted high-ranking Russian officials and individuals close to President Putin, with some differences in their lists due to legal and political reasons. The EU has focused more on military officials, insurgents, and battalions, while the US has targeted companies operating in Crimea. The US and EU have imposed sanctions on individuals and entities related to the conflict in Ukraine. The EU has blanket restrictions on Crimea-related activities and against affiliated individuals and entities, while the US targets companies operating in Crimea. Both have restrictions on lending and investments in specific sectors, focusing on key companies in the financial, defense, and energy sectors. EU removes individuals from its sanctions list due to death, unlike the US which requires survivors to petition for removal. Some designees have successfully petitioned for their removal. The US and EU have imposed sectoral sanctions on Russian companies in the financial, defense, and energy sectors. The US identifies 13 Russian companies and 276 subsidiaries, while the EU identifies 11 entities subject to sanctions. The US prohibits sales to specific companies like Gazprom for certain oil projects, while the EU does not name specific companies. EU does not impose sanctions on oil projects globally like the US. The EU and U.S. have comparable policies in restricting arms trade and dual-use exports to Russia. The EU allowed existing arms sales and service contracts with Russia to continue, but France and some Central European countries pushed for this. However, the ongoing concern about Russian actions in Ukraine prompted EU members to reevaluate some existing weapons system sales and licenses. France canceled a sales contract for Mistral helicopter carriers, and Germany canceled a contract for combat simulation. Germany canceled a $155 million combat simulation center contract with Russia. Central and Eastern European countries are phasing out Russian military equipment for modern U.S. and European alternatives. The EU and U.S. differ in handling existing energy development contracts with Russia. The EU allows continuation with national authorization, while the U.S. generally prohibits unless authorized by OFAC. This led to Eni continuing exploration in the Black Sea with Rosneft, while ExxonMobil withdrew from joint ventures in 2018. Rosneft and ExxonMobil had differing outcomes in their joint ventures with Rosneft. The US and EU have not imposed broad sanctions on Russia's gas sector or Gazprom. Concerns about Russian gas supply led to measures that would not harm gas flow or relations with Russia. Financial restrictions apply to two Gazprom subsidiaries. The US and EU have not imposed broad sanctions on Russia's gas sector or Gazprom. Financial restrictions apply to Gazprom subsidiaries, including Gazpromneft and Gazprombank. Concerns about Russian gas supply led to measures to avoid harming gas flow or relations with Russia. EU leaders were concerned about certain provisions in CRIEEA affecting EU economic interests. The US and EU have not imposed broad sanctions on Russia's gas sector or Gazprom. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact of CRIEEA on EU economic, business, and energy interests, particularly regarding sanctions on entities involved in enhancing Russia's energy export pipelines. This could affect German and Austrian energy companies financing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Some in Europe objected to what they saw as unilateral sanctions that could complicate the EU's own sanctions consensus. The new U.S. sanctions under CRIEEA could impact EU's consensus on sanctions and weaken U.S.-EU cooperation on Ukraine. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on European business partners of Russian companies. The European Commission expressed satisfaction with the inclusion of language in CRIEEA to uphold unity with European partners on sanctions. The European Commission is satisfied with the inclusion of language in CRIEEA to uphold unity with European partners on sanctions. However, there are concerns in Europe that new U.S. sanctions could affect energy projects. The EU is prepared to take \"appropriate steps\" if U.S. sanctions disadvantage EU companies trading with Russia in the energy sector. The Trump Administration has clarified that pipeline-related sanctions would not apply to existing projects initiated before August 2, 2017. Some European officials and experts doubt the Trump Administration's commitment to consult with the EU before imposing new sanctions. Concerns arose after the Administration designated Russian billionaires and companies without prior consultations, potentially impacting Europe's aluminum and manufacturing sectors. There are worries that the Administration may enforce secondary sanctions against European firms. The Trump Administration's announcement of sanctions on Rusal led to a rise in alumina prices and concerns in Europe about plant closures and job losses in key industries. European officials and international partners, including Brazil, raised issues with the sanctions, prompting the U.S. to extend the wind-down period for transactions with Rusal. In December 2018, the Treasury Department announced its intention to terminate sanctions against Rusal and two related companies. The United States and the EU continue to coordinate other Ukraine-related sanctions. The Trump Administration designated individuals and entities under Ukraine-related authorities for supplying occupied Crimea with gas turbines. The EU determined that the transfer of turbines to Crimea breached contractual provisions and EU prohibitions. The EU approved a new legal framework in October 2018 to impose restrictive measures on individuals and entities involved in chemical weapons development. Sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes, not specifically aimed at Russia but likely in response to the Skripal attack. Analysts expect Russian intelligence officers accused in the attack to be targeted. EU-wide sanctions for cyber activities are also anticipated. Analysts anticipate EU-wide sanctions for cyber activities, not specifically targeting Russia but aimed at individuals and entities engaged in malicious cyber activities. Some European leaders and EU officials have called for an \"EU Magnitsky Act\" to impose sanctions on Russians complicit in human rights abuses and money-laundering. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have passed their own versions of the Magnitsky Act. The UK Parliament approved a Magnitsky amendment to sanction human rights violators. Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands are considering similar legislation. The Netherlands proposed an EU sanctions regime for human rights abuses without naming it after Magnitsky to ensure EU consensus. The EU is considering implementing a human rights sanctions regime, prompted by events such as the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and the Skripal attack. UK parliamentarians have called for financial sanctions on Russia, but experts believe EU-wide sanctions would be more effective. However, there are doubts about the EU's ability to achieve unanimity for such sanctions. The EU may struggle to achieve unanimity for additional sanctions on Russian financial activity. The impact of sanctions on Russia, especially related to the Ukraine invasion, is intertwined with global oil price fluctuations. Russia faced economic challenges in 2014-2015, leading to a two-year recession, capital flight, ruble devaluation, and inflation. The government and many Russian firms were excluded from capital markets, widening the budget deficit. Between 2014 and 2015, Russia faced economic challenges due to sanctions, leading to a recession, capital flight, ruble devaluation, and inflation. The government tapped reserves to finance spending and stabilize the ruble. By 2016, oil prices began to rise, helping to stabilize the economy. Access to international capital markets improved, capital outflows slowed, and foreign direct investment rebounded. However, the government had to rely on sovereign wealth funds and partially privatize Rosneft to raise funds. In 2017, Russia's economy showed improvement after facing challenges from sanctions and a recession in 2014-2015. The International Monetary Fund praised Russian authorities for their effective policy response and higher oil prices that helped the economy recover. Sanctions still impact some Russian firms, particularly in the banking sector, limiting their access to financing. The fear of economic destabilization has decreased since the 2014 Crimea invasion. Some studies suggest that sanctions had a modest negative impact on the Russian economy compared to oil prices. Russian officials estimated the cost of sanctions at $40 billion annually, lower than the impact of lower oil prices. Sanctions were predicted to decrease Russia's GDP by 2.4% by 2017, but this effect was significantly lower than the impact of the oil price shock. Oil prices, not sanctions, were found to be the main driver of changes in the ruble's value. Russian officials and businesspeople affected by sanctions have acknowledged the negative impact on Russia's economy. Putin stated in 2016 that sanctions were harming Russia, but not as severely as the decline in energy prices. Economic adviser Alexei Kudrin in 2017 blamed U.S. sanctions for hindering Russia's economic growth. Billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg mentioned in 2018 that Ukraine-related sanctions posed challenges but were overcome. Russia's economic recovery in 2016-2017 occurred despite sanctions, designed to have limited economic impact by targeting specific individuals and entities responsible for offending policies. The sanctions did not broadly prohibit economic activity with Russia. The Ukraine-related sanctions target specific Russian individuals and firms, with more than four-fifths of the largest 100 firms in Russia not directly subject to any U.S. sanctions. SDN sanctions mainly target individuals, not firms, and are unlikely to have broader effects on Russia's economy. SDN sanctions on entities in Russia target businesses controlled by designated individuals, companies in Crimea, and defense firms. 7 of the 100 largest Russian firms are subject to full blocking sanctions, while sectoral sanctions affect 7 of the top 10 companies, limiting certain transactions related to debt, equity, and oil projects. The sanctions aim to restrict access to international markets for major Russian financial, energy, and defense firms, disrupting their ability to refinance existing debts. The sectoral sanctions on Russian oil projects aim to restrict access to Western technology, putting long-term pressure on the Russian government. The IMF estimated that these sanctions could reduce Russia's output by up to 9% in the longer term. The sanctions were designed to exert economic pressure on Russia over time, rather than pushing them \"over the economic cliff\" in the short run. The impact of sanctions on Russia's economy as a whole may have been modest, but specific firms and sectors have felt more significant effects. Examples include Russian banks avoiding financial services in Crimea, Rostec experiencing profit drops due to loss of foreign investment, Western oil service companies limiting operations in Russia, Exxon canceling a joint venture with Rosneft, and Rosneft suspending an oil project in the Black Sea. The Russian government has urged wealthy Russians to repatriate offshore funds for financing. Wealthy Russians are urged to repatriate offshore funds for financing in the face of sanctions. A study shows that sanctioned Russian firms lost a significant portion of their operating revenues, asset values, and employees compared to non-sanctioned peers, with minimal collateral damage to other firms. The study estimates the effects of sanctions on Russian firms, showing that some did worse than average while others did well. For example, Sberbank, Rostec, and Novatek have higher profits today than in 2014 when sanctions were imposed. The discrepancy in performance may be due to varying levels of economic transactions interrupted by sanctions. Despite sanctions, Russian energy firms have been able to continue business as usual, with record-high oil production. The Russian government has supported sanctioned firms by purchasing their debt and granting them contracts. The Russian government strategically granted contracts to sanctioned firms, including Bank Rossiya, Stroygazmontazh, and VTB. In response to sanctions, the government launched a bank recapitalization program and increased orders from defense industry firms to offset lost sales. Promsvyazbank was repurposed to finance Russia's defense industry. The Russian government repurposed Promsvyazbank to finance the defense industry in response to sanctions. Additional support may be provided to sanctioned businesses, with a new department being created within the Finance Ministry for this purpose. The extent of government resources used to shield firms from sanctions is difficult to quantify. The Russian government has used resources to shield firms from sanctions, shifting the cost from the firms to the government. Russian firms have found alternative economic partnerships to minimize the impact of sanctions, such as securing financing from China for projects in the Arctic and forming corporate agreements with Chinese and Saudi companies. The extent of Russia's success in pivoting to China and other non-Western sources of financing remains uncertain. Russia's pivot to China and other non-Western financing sources may not fully substitute Western capital. Chinese banks are more willing to engage, but geopolitical factors complicate business transactions. Russian firms offer better deals to Chinese investors to bypass sanctions. CRIEEA's policy to impose secondary sanctions adds another layer of complexity. After more than four years of escalating sanctions, Russia has not reversed its occupation and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, nor has it stopped fostering separatism in eastern Ukraine. The United States and its allies have documented multiple instances of Russian cyber-enabled malicious activities and determined that Russian agents used a lethal nerve agent in the United Kingdom. Russia remains an influential supporter of the Syrian government. Many observers argue that sanctions help to restrain Russia. Since the introduction of sanctions, reports suggest Russian officials closely monitor developments and adjust policies. Some argue for more sanctions on Russia, while others emphasize fully implementing existing sanctions and coordinating with allies. Observers emphasize the need to coordinate new sanctions with allies, but some doubt their effectiveness in changing Russian behavior without additional foreign policy tools. Concerns are raised about the impact of unilateral sanctions on U.S. businesses. In the 115th Congress, several bills were introduced to increase sanctions on Russia, with debates expected to continue in the 116th Congress. Potential new sanctions could target a wider range of individuals, entities, and sectors. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to expand sanctions on Russia, including prohibiting transactions with Russian sovereign debt, imposing mandatory secondary sanctions on Russian pipeline investment, and expanding sanctions for cyber-enabled activities. There are also proposals to determine if Russia supports international terrorism and to enhance congressional review procedures under the Sergei Magnitsky Act. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to expand sanctions on Russia, including prohibiting transactions with Russian sovereign debt, imposing mandatory secondary sanctions on Russian pipeline investment, and expanding sanctions for cyber-enabled activities. Additionally, various acts such as CRIEEA, Global Magnitsky Act, IEEPA, INKSNA, NEA, Sergei Magnitsky Act, SSIDES, UFSA, and U.S. Sanctions on Russia are relevant in the context of U.S. sanctions on Russia. The text chunk provides information on U.S. sanctions on Russia, including details on various acts and sanctions imposed on Russian firms."
