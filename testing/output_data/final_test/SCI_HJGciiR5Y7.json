    "content": "The new latent model of natural images can be learned on large-scale datasets, providing a latent embedding for each image and a convolutional network mapping the latent space to the image space. This model serves as a strong image prior for tasks like inpainting, superresolution, and colorization. It utilizes high-dimensional latent spaces with a special manifold structure to model high-resolution images. The experiments compare this model with autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and a baseline system. Our model, based on advanced generative adversarial networks, outperforms other approaches in various image restoration tasks. Learning a deep latent model with a simple-structured set or probabilistic distribution helps tackle the complexity of natural images. This approach, utilizing a deep ConvNet to map from the latent space to the image space, can solve image restoration tasks by finding the best latent representation corresponding to the image evidence. The approach of using a deep latent model for image restoration tasks is universal and does not require prior knowledge of the image degradation process. This method, based on latent models trained with GANs, is currently limited to low-resolution images, such as inpainting 64x64 face images. Latent models trained with GANs are limited to low-resolution images like 64x64 face inpainting. To address this limitation, latent models with tens of thousands of dimensions can be used for high-resolution images, allowing for direct optimization and leading to effective image priors for various reconstruction tasks. Previous models had simpler latent space structures, but expanding to higher dimensions shows promise for spanning the space of high-resolution natural images. The text discusses the use of latent models in image restoration, specifically focusing on parameterizing latent spaces for effective restoration results. The approach involves building a latent model of non-degraded images during training and finding a latent representation that maximizes the likelihood of corrupted images during testing. The text also mentions alternative parameterizations of latent spaces to address the challenge of using vectors with tens of thousands of dimensions as inputs to a generator. The text discusses the use of convolutional manifold parameterization for deep latent image models, showing benefits for restoration tasks. It highlights the training of models with high-dimensional latent spaces and the universal image priors they provide. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this parameterization approach. The experiments on CelebA and SUN Bedrooms datasets show the benefits of latent models for image restoration tasks, outperforming other models. This approach directly models natural images without extra components, demonstrating superior performance in large hole inpainting, superresolution, and colorization tasks. Our approach, while not as specialized as other models like BID6 or BID18, is universal and can handle unforeseen degradations. It builds on pre-deep learning methods and uses multiple layers to capture longer correlations, making it effective for tasks like large-hole inpainting. The Latent Convolutional Model introduces a space Z and distribution Z to re-parameterize images in space X. It consists of two ConvNets, with one used to parameterize the latent manifold and the other as a generator. The approach focuses on learning the generator network with learnable parameters. The generator network in the Latent Convolutional Model is trained to map from Z to X, aiming to approximate X. Different approaches like GANs and autoencoders are used to train the generator network, with GANs being known for synthesizing high-resolution images. The GLO model optimizes the generator network parameters along with explicit embeddings of training examples to approximate the input data. This approach expands on previous models by using a higher dimensionality latent space and demonstrating applicability to image restoration tasks. In experiments, GAN models struggled to reconstruct samples from high-dimensional distribution X, indicating they are not suitable for restoring corrupted samples. Autoencoders and GLO latent model BID1 performed better but had blurry reconstructions, suggesting underfitting due to limited latent space dimensionality. The aim is to significantly scale up the latent dimensionality to improve model performance. To address limitations in GAN models and improve reconstruction quality, scaling up latent dimensionality is crucial. One approach is to use a three-dimensional tensor structure for latent elements, allowing for fully-convolutional generators. However, this can lead to limited coordination between distant parts of generated images. To overcome this, latent convolutional manifolds can be used to impose a more appropriate structure on the latent space. To improve reconstruction quality and address limitations in GAN models, scaling up latent dimensionality is crucial. Latent convolutional manifolds can be used to impose a more appropriate structure on the latent space by defining convolutional manifolds as sets of convolutional networks transforming maps of different sizes. The convolutional manifold is defined by the ConvNet architecture and the choice of input, with parameters restricted to lie within a specified range. The idea of convolutional manifolds is inspired by recent work on deep image priors, where they are used to model the latent space of generator networks. This approach results in a learnable latent image model that benefits from the regularization imposed by the structure of high-dimensional convolutional manifolds. The intuition that this regularization would be beneficial in learning high-dimensional latent spaces is supported by experiments. Learning the deep latent model in the framework involves optimizing the ConvNet parameter vectors and generator network parameters to minimize a specific objective function. The optimization process includes using Laplacian-L1 norm and adding an extra MSE loss term to speed up convergence without affecting results significantly. The optimization process involves using stochastic gradient descent to optimize ConvNet parameter vectors and generator network parameters. Each training example receives a representation on the convolutional manifold, which defines a set of images in the image space. Results for various tasks and datasets are shown, with the colorization task highlighting the limitations of perceptual metrics. The resulting manifolds can cover the distribution support with a few thousand dimensions. The learned latent model can be used for image restoration tasks such as inpainting, superresolution, colorization, denoising, and feature inversion. The degradation process is described by the objective E(x|y), allowing for the restoration of unknown images from the distribution X using evidence y. The degradation process is described by the objective E(x|y), which can be set to minus log-likelihood E(x|y) = \u2212 log p(y|x) of observing y as a result of the degradation of x. Different restoration objectives are defined for tasks like inpainting, superresolution, and colorization. The learned latent model is used as a prior for estimation combining the learned prior and the provided image evidence. The optimization process involves estimating the element of the image manifold with the highest likelihood using stochastic gradient descent. Experiments compare the performance of the full model and baseline models on restoration tasks using different formulations. Three datasets were used, including the CelebA dataset with images resized from 178\u00d7218 to 128 \u00d7 128 without additional cropping. The dataset includes images from LSUN BID17 and CelebA-HQ, all resized to 256 \u00d7 256. Tasks such as inpainting, superresolution, and colorization were compared using different methods. For inpainting, images were masked, for superresolution, images were downsampled, and for colorization, color channels were averaged to create grayscale images. Extensive comparisons were performed. The comparison of latent models on datasets like CelebA and Bedrooms involved Latent Convolutional Networks (LCM) with different layer configurations and input noise, and GLO as a baseline model inspired by BID1. The latent dimensionality varied between the models, with LCM having higher dimensions than GLO. The comparison of latent models on datasets CelebA and Bedrooms involved different architectures like LCM and GLO, with varying latent dimensionality. DIP and GAN were also used for restoration tasks, with DIP fitting 1M parameters for inpainting and colorization, and GAN using WGAN-GP and PGAN models with different latent space dimensions. The comparison of latent models on CelebA and Bedrooms datasets included standard autoencoders with different reconstruction metrics and latent dimensionalities. Overfitting was observed with convolutional higher-dimensional latent space, while the variational variant led to underfitting. Experiments on CelebA showed strong underfitting, so autoencoders were not included in the comparison on the higher-resolution Bedrooms dataset. Training on Bedrooms dataset was restricted to the first 200K samples, except for DIP and GAN models. All comparisons were done on hold-out sets using plain SGD. Following experiments on CelebA and Bedrooms datasets with different latent models, including standard autoencoders, overfitting was observed with higher-dimensional latent space. Variational autoencoders led to underfitting. Training on the Bedrooms dataset was limited to the first 200K samples, except for DIP and GAN models. Evaluation was done on hold-out sets using plain SGD. For evaluation, quantitative measures like mean squared error and VGG feature distances were used, showing similar performance across different metrics. Loss for inpainting task only considered specific positions. When evaluating tasks with big multimodal conditional distributions, quantitative metrics may have limited relevance. Human judgement of quality is crucial in such cases. A user study was conducted with 10 random images for each dataset and task, where participants were asked to choose the best restoration variant based on realism and fidelity to the input. The results were compared among different methods and presented to the participants. The user study compared different restoration methods based on realism and fidelity to the input. Traditional latent models performed poorly, while the DIP model excelled in inpainting and superresolution tasks on unstructured datasets. The user study compared restoration methods based on realism and fidelity to the input. The DIP model excelled in inpainting and superresolution tasks on unstructured datasets, outperforming traditional latent models. However, it struggled on CelebA and colorization tasks due to its inability to learn face structure and natural image colors. Models with large latent space were favored by users, with LCM performing better than GLO in all comparisons. LCM also outperformed GLO in perceptual metrics for inpainting and superresolution tasks, but not for colorization. The perceptual metric was deemed inadequate for colorization, as grayscale images scored better than all evaluated methods. The CelebA-HQ dataset comparison between optimization methods over convolutional manifold, z-space, and Progressive GAN latent space showed that the LCM model with 135k parameters outperformed the pretrained Progressive GAN model. The use of convolutional manifold structure distinguishes the LCM approach from the GLO baseline. Additional results on CelebA and Bedrooms dataset are provided in Appendices A, F, G. The LCM approach distinguishes itself from the GLO baseline through convolutional manifold parameterization. Experiments show that using this constraint at test time has a minor effect on CelebA and Bedrooms datasets but significantly improves results on the CelebA-HQ dataset. In a comparison with the Progressive GAN model, the full LCM model with the convolutional manifold constraint performed notably better for inpainting tasks. The full LCM model with convolutional manifold outperformed other approaches in inpainting tasks, showing a better balance between fitting known pixels and inpainting unknown ones. High-dimensional latent spaces and ConvNets are crucial for good image reconstructions on hold-out sets, allowing for quality restorations from various degradations at high resolutions. The proposed approach of using the LCM model for image parametrization has limitations such as long training times on large datasets and the need to store latent representations in memory. Despite these limitations, the universality of the models allows them to be trained once for a certain image type and applied to any degradations. The LCM model for image parametrization has limitations like long training times and storing latent representations. The model can be used for any degradations after being trained once for a specific image type. The model requires lengthy optimization in latent space at test time, but degradation-specific or universal feed-forward encoders can reduce the number of iterations needed. The study shows comparisons for tasks like half-image inpainting and inpainting. The LCM model achieves the best balance for half-image inpainting, outperforming the GLO model with vectorial-structured latent space. The study compares different dimensionality of the latent space and shows that the vector-based GLO model gives worse results compared to the LCM model. The GLO model underfits despite being trained on high-dimensional latent vectors. Image inpainting with GLO models shows best fit to known pixels. WGAN-GP with increasing penalties on latent representation leads to worse underfitting without improving reconstruction quality. Most GAN implementations use Gaussian prior in latent space sampling. In the restoration process, imposing a penalty on the squared norm of z can worsen the underfitting problem of GANs. The fitting error increases with penalty weight, as shown in TAB7 and Figure 10. The LCM model's Generator Network g \u03b8 has varying map sizes and parameters in different datasets. The generator network in the LCM model has varying map sizes and parameters in different datasets. The latent network used in CelebA128, Bedrooms, and CelebA-HQ consists of different numbers of convolutional layers with no padding. The full LCM model has higher loss for both train and test sets compared to other methods due to additional constraints. The LCM model, with additional constraints, performs better at image reconstruction tasks compared to other methods. Linear interpolations in the LCM latent space are smoother and more faithful to the training data distribution than in convolutional GLO latent space. Interpolations in the latent space of the LCM model show smoother and more plausible results compared to the convolutional GLO model. Image restoration using a squared error negative log-likelihood function as a loss is also discussed. In image restoration, a simple quadratic likelihood potential is used instead of modeling JPEG degradation. Sampling from the latent space involves mapping trained ConvNet parameter vectors to a lower-dimensional space using PCA and fitting a GMM for sampling. Unconditional image generation results are shown in FIG0."
