A new local-to-global alignment framework (L2GA) is proposed to address the issue of loosely related data-text pairs. The framework includes a local alignment model based on multi-instance learning and a global alignment model using a memory-guided CRF layer to exploit dependencies among alignments in the training corpus. The proposed method improves alignment accuracy and can generate semantically equivalent training data-text pairs for neural generation models. It addresses the issue of loosely related data-text pairs in data-to-text generation by using a local-to-global alignment framework. The text discusses the challenges of aligning loosely related data-text pairs in training data for neural generation models. Previous methods focused on local interactions, but this work aims to establish explicit semantic correspondences in such pairs. The text discusses a Local-to-Global Alignment (L2GA) framework for establishing semantic correspondences in loosely related data-text pairs. The framework includes a local alignment model for discovering correspondences within a single pair and a global alignment model for inducing missing attributes in the entire dataset. The text introduces a global alignment model, a memory-guided CRF-based framework for sequence labeling to infer missing alignments in data-text pairs. Pseudo labels are generated using string matching heuristics, addressing unmatched text spans by adjusting prediction probabilities in the CRF layer. The proposed method improves alignment accuracy by changing prediction probability calculation in the CRF layer and incorporating alignment results from a local alignment model. Experimental results on a restaurant dataset show enhanced alignment accuracy compared to previous methods and the ability to detect unaligned errors in training data. Our proposed method enhances alignment accuracy for neural generation models by improving content consistency. It involves learning alignments in loosely corresponded data-text pairs, matching words in text descriptions with possible slots in meaning representations. The task is to align words in text with slots, even if not all slot-value pairs are mentioned. Some unaligned words can be matched to slots in the corpus. The proposed method aims to improve alignment accuracy for neural generation models by matching words in text descriptions with slots in meaning representations. It introduces a local-to-global alignment model consisting of two modules to handle semantic alignments and dependencies among alignments. A model with a CRF layer is proposed to exploit dependencies among alignments in the entire corpus, producing semantic labels for text spans not supported in the paired MR. A specific memory is integrated into the CRF layer to incorporate alignment guidance from the local model, inducing semantic labels for words in text X with respect to its paired input MR. The task is formulated as a multi-instance learning problem, aiming to discover fine-grained annotations from coarse level supervisions. The text discusses the MR Encoder, which represents slot-value pairs as word sequences and utilizes a bidirectional LSTM layer to generate contextualized representations. Self-attention is used to obtain a summary context vector for the slot-value pair. Slot embeddings are also incorporated using a trainable slot embedding matrix. The text discusses embedding slot-value pairs and descriptions into vectors using LSTM and CNNs, aiming to maximize similarity between MR-text pairs. Slot embeddings and contextual vectors are generated to achieve this alignment objective. The sentence encoder defined in Eq.3 calculates similarity between MR-text pairs based on vector representations of slot-value pairs in R and words in description X. A function in Eq.4 aligns each word with the best scoring slot-value pair, with alignment based on inner product similarity. The loss function in Eq.5 encourages higher similarity between related MR R and description X pairs. A global alignment model using a CRF-based sequence labeling framework is proposed to handle text spans not supported by noisy input, leveraging dependencies among alignments. The CRF based sequence labeling framework leverages dependencies among alignments and addresses the issue of lacking training labels by generating pseudo labels through exact string matching. Words are categorized into entity mentions, unknown entities, or non-entities to induce semantic labels for words with unknown types. To induce semantic labels for words with unknown types, the sequence paths in the CRF layer are modified. The alignments serve as a soft memory to integrate semantic annotations learned by a local model. The LSTM-CRF model decodes context vectors for words in the description to compute label scores and captures label dependencies using a CRF layer. The CRF layer in the model maximizes the total probability of all possible label sequences, including entities with unknown types, by enumerating all possible tags. The optimization goal is to maximize the probability of all possible label sequences for entities with unknown types. Integrating local alignment clues into the sequence labeling framework involves selecting the most probable slot for each word in the description and computing the slot representation based on similarity provided by the alignment model. This approach enhances the conventional CRF by incorporating semantic labels and alignment supervisions. Utilizing alignment information to improve prediction scores in sequence labeling. Training involves optimizing global model by minimizing negative log-likelihood of score for given text description. Viterbi decoding used for inference to obtain alignments. Experiments conducted on E2E challenge. Our proposed model utilizes alignment information to produce alignments based on unique slots in the E2E challenge dataset. Evaluating alignment accuracy is challenging due to ambiguity in alignment boundaries, but alignments can be used to refine the input MR. Our proposed model utilizes alignment information to produce refined MRs by recovering slot-value pairs using detected spans and labels. The alignments are evaluated by comparing the produced MRs with annotated ones, and compared with neural baselines for precision and recall. The proposed model utilizes alignment information to refine MRs by recovering slot-value pairs. It compares alignments with annotated MRs and neural baselines for precision and recall. The model includes a dictionary-based sequence labeling model for distant supervised NER and a modified LSTM-CRF global model. Results show improvement over baselines in exploiting global alignment dependencies. The proposed method L2GA improves alignment performance globally, outperforming distant supervised sequence labeling approaches. The Distant LSTM-CRF performs worse than Modified LSTM-CRF, highlighting the importance of exploring all possible sequences. Both models utilize information in paired MRs for pseudo labels, but string matching can lead to mislabeled entities. The proposed method L2GA outperforms the Modified LSTM-CRF in learning alignments for loosely related data-text pairs, showing the necessity of using a global model. The performance of local model MIL decreases dramatically on noisy data-text pairs, while global models like Modified LSTM-CRF and L2GA are less sensitive. The proposed method L2GA outperforms the Modified LSTM-CRF in learning alignments for loosely related data-text pairs. Detailed alignment F1 scores are reported in Table 2, with L2GA achieving the best result in 4 out of 8 slots. Integration of alignment guidance from the local model is shown to be essential, especially in the slot familyFriendly. Different ways of incorporating the local model with the sequence labeling framework are also explored. In this section, a new method called L2GA is proposed for sequence labeling. L2GA integrates results from local models without introducing label noise, leading to better performance compared to separate models. Alignments are shown to improve neural generation models by refining data-text pairs, reducing hallucination. The proposed method L2GA is used to refine the training corpus for a sequence-to-sequence generation model. A rule-based aligner is employed to evaluate generation correctness, showing a significant reduction in errors after training with L2GA. This highlights the importance of studying alignments in loosely related data-text pairs to reduce data noise in large datasets. The alignment results from different models show that global models can induce semantic labels accurately, while the Modified LSTM-CRF struggles with labeling lexically different but semantically equivalent words.

Previous work focused on aligning data units with text spans for verbalization. Our work extends previous approaches by inducing alignments for text spans not supported by the input data, aiming to extract information from user queries. Various methods have been used, such as training language models on data records and applying CRF-based extractors to detect related text spans. Bellare & McCallum (2009) utilized a generalized expectation criteria to learn alignments between databases and texts for semantic annotation induction. Our approach is a unified neural-based alignment model that improves alignment accuracy in loosely related data-text pairs. It induces semantic correspondences for related words and infers labels for unsupported text spans. The method helps reduce noise in training data and shows promise for challenging datasets with complex schemas. The dimensions of trainable hidden units in LSTMs are all set to 400. During training, hidden units in LSTMs are set to 400, with a dropout rate of 0.1. The model is pre-trained for 5 epochs and then trained jointly with 10 epochs using SGD optimization. The goal is to refine MR-text pairs by using induced alignments. String values are directly recovered from text spans, while categorical values are retrieved using a simple method. The text describes a method for refining MR-text pairs by collecting text spans with detect labels in the training corpus and corresponding slot-value pairs. The frequency of candidate slot-value pairs is calculated, and the most frequent one is used. This helps in accurately recovering slot values even when the MR is inaccurate."
