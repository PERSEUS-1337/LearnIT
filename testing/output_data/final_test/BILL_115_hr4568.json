    "content": "The \"Enhancing Geothermal Production on Federal Lands Act\" allows for geothermal exploration test projects on federal lands under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. The term 'geothermal exploration test project' refers to drilling a well to test for geothermal resources on leased lands, causing minimal soil disruption and developed in a small diameter without requiring off-road motorized access. Geothermal exploration test projects involve drilling wells on leased lands with minimal soil disruption, using rubber-tired equipment, and without high-pressure well stimulation. The project must be completed in less than 90 days and restore the site within 3 years. The Secretary may categorically exclude geothermal exploration test projects from environmental assessment requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act, unless extraordinary circumstances exist. Extraordinary circumstances are defined as per the Department of the Interior Departmental Manual. A leaseholder is required to provide notice for the process. The leaseholder must notify the Secretary 30 days before starting a geothermal exploration test project. The Secretary will review the project within 10 days to determine if it qualifies for a categorical exclusion. If not, the leaseholder will have an opportunity to remedy the situation. The Secretary must provide clear findings on deficiencies in a project that does not qualify for categorical exclusion and allow the leaseholder to address and resubmit the notice of intent. SEC. 31 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 introduces Geothermal Leasing Priority Areas. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 introduces Geothermal Leasing Priority Areas on covered federal land, not excluded from geothermal energy development under specific laws. The Secretary must designate these priority areas within 5 years, considering certain criteria. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, must consider the preference for geothermal leasing, economic viability of geothermal energy production, and compliance with relevant laws when designating geothermal leasing priority areas on covered land. The Secretary must review and potentially modify these designations at least once every 10 years. The Secretary must prepare a supplement to the final programmatic environmental impact statement for geothermal leasing within one year of designating a geothermal leasing priority area. Subsequent designations of priority areas must also be included in the environmental impact statement. Consultations are required in developing any programmatic statement. In developing a programmatic environmental impact statement for geothermal leasing, the Secretary must consult with State, Tribal, and local governments, transmission infrastructure owners, developers, and other entities. The Secretary cannot delay issuing permits or holding lease sales due to a pending supplement. Compliance with NEPA is required if a geothermal leasing priority area has been sufficiently analyzed. The Secretary is not required to prepare additional analysis under NEPA for geothermal lease sales in the priority area. SEC. 4. FACILITATION OF COPRODUCTION OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY ON OIL AND GAS LEASES. Amendment to the Geothermal Steam Act allows for noncompetitive leasing of land under oil and gas leases for coproduction of geothermal energy. SEC. 5. Noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for geothermal resource development. Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to include definitions related to fair market value per acre for adjoining land. The Secretary must determine the fair market value for a lease within 180 days of receiving an application, and it must be at least 4 times the median amount paid per acre for all land leased under the Act in the previous year or $50, whichever is greater. The term 'industry standards' refers to the criteria used by qualified geothermal professionals to evaluate temperature measurements and permeability for energy production. 'Qualified Federal land' is land eligible for leasing under the Act. 'Qualified geothermal professional' is an expert in geothermal resource assessment. A qualified geothermal professional is defined as an engineer or geoscientist with at least 5 years of experience in geothermal exploration. A qualified lessee is someone eligible to hold a geothermal lease, and a valid discovery is the identification of a geothermal resource through temperature measurements in a well. The curr_chunk discusses the noncompetitive lease of qualified Federal land for geothermal resource development to qualified lessees meeting specific criteria. The land must meet industry standards for permeability and temperature measurements, be between 1 and 640 acres, and not already leased or nominated for leasing. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for a qualified lessee to receive a noncompetitive lease for geothermal resource development on Federal land, including the submission of geological and technical data to support a valid discovery of geothermal resources. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development in accordance with established procedures. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development according to regulations. The Secretary must provide a qualified lessee with a proposed fair market value determination for public comment and allow for an appeal process for the final determination. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development according to regulations. After publication of a notice of request to lease land, the Secretary may not accept any nomination of the land for leasing unless the request has been denied or withdrawn. A lease awarded under this paragraph is considered a lease awarded for annual rental purposes. The Secretary will issue regulations within 270 days of enactment to carry out the competitive lease sale process for geothermal resource development."
