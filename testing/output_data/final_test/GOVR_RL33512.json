    "content": "The transportation sector is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, raising questions about resource allocation for protection. Deterrence measures can be taken to reduce the risk without hindering travel and commerce. Four key policy objectives are identified to support a system of deterrence and protection. Protection measures in the transportation sector focus on ensuring trustworthiness of passengers, cargo, workers, and companies to prevent attacks from within the system. Additionally, security perimeters are established around transportation facilities and vehicles to prevent external attacks. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to federalize airline passenger and baggage screening and deploy more armed air marshals on flights. The federalization of airport screening remains controversial. The federalization of airport screening post-9/11 is still a contentious issue. Representative Bill Shuster criticized the decision to create TSA, suggesting private security companies should handle screening. Only 21 out of 450 airports have opted for private screening under TSA contracts. Congress has discussed maintaining private screening options, but extensive reforms have not been thoroughly debated in aviation security legislation. Aviation security legislation has focused on screening for explosives and background checks. Challenges remain in effectively screening passengers, baggage, and cargo for threats, utilizing intelligence to identify potential threats, responding to security threats, addressing aircraft vulnerabilities, and managing unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandated 100% screening of checked baggage on domestic and international passenger flights post-9/11. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 required physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights, which is carried out through the Certified Cargo Screening Program. TSA does not routinely perform physical inspections of air cargo. The TSA collaborates with various entities to conduct screening inspections using approved technologies and procedures for cargo on passenger aircraft, both at airports and off-airport facilities. They work internationally to ensure compliance with security measures and standards. TSA also partners with Customs and Border Protection for risk-based targeting of cargo shipments, utilizing the ATS-C system to identify high-risk shipments. The TSA focuses on assessing cargo shipments for explosives threats, especially after the 2010 cargo aircraft bomb plot from Yemen. Congress found in 2014 that TSA had not met key performance requirements for explosives detection. The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (P.L. 113-245) addressed these concerns by requiring a five-year technology investment plan and increased accountability for acquisitions. The TSA's acquisition and technology deployment strategy focuses on improving the capability to detect concealed explosives carried by airline passengers. Concerns have been raised following incidents like the 2015 Russian passenger airliner bombing and the 2009 Northwest Airlines incident, leading to the accelerated deployment of Advanced Imaging Technology screening devices at passenger screening checkpoints. The TSA deployed Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) at passenger screening checkpoints in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to improve explosives detection on passengers. Next-generation screening technologies include X-ray systems for carry-on baggage, bottled liquids scanners, cast and prosthesis imagers, shoe scanning devices, and portable explosives trace detection equipment. Privacy concerns about AIT led to the elimination of human analysis of AIT images and the use of automated threat detection capabilities. Medical risks posed by backscatter X-ray systems have also been a concern. The DHS Office of Inspector General conducted covert testing on passenger screening technologies, revealing failures in AIT and ATR effectiveness. Legislative proposals have sought to prohibit the use of AIT for primary screening. TSA's deployment of AIT technology for primary screening at airports has been limited, with many smaller airports lacking this capability. Despite plans to expand AIT usage, there are concerns about uniformity in explosives screening. TSA aims to address this by implementing risk-based passenger screening measures, such as the PreCheck trusted traveler program, but this program is not yet available at many smaller airports. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 directed TSA to develop recommendations for more efficient passenger screening and initiate pilot programs at large airports to increase efficiencies. TSA has also started risk-based screening initiatives to focus resources effectively. TSA has implemented risk-based screening initiatives, including PreCheck for expedited screening of trusted travelers. Participants undergo background checks and can keep shoes on and liquids and laptops in carry-on bags. PreCheck lanes are available at over 180 airports as of December 2016. The TSA's PreCheck program aims to process 50% of passengers through expedited screening lanes at over 180 airports. The cost is $85 for a five-year membership, with a goal to increase enrollment from 10 million to 25 million. Concerns include the lack of biometric authentication, following the failure of a previous biometric program in 2009. In 2016, biometric identity authentication was reintroduced at 13 airports under a private trusted traveler program known as Clear, separate from PreCheck and not funded by TSA. Participants use an express lane for identity verification with a fingerprint or iris scan. TSA phased out the managed inclusion program in 2015 after objections were raised about routing selected travelers through PreCheck lanes. Since September 2015, TSA behavior detection officers and explosives trace detection personnel no longer direct non-PreCheck passengers to expedited screening lanes. Canine explosives detection teams still evaluate passengers at some airports, but TSA is moving towards offering expedited screening only to PreCheck enrollees. PreCheck has improved screening efficiency, resulting in cost savings of $110 million annually for TSA. Additionally, a known crewmember program has been developed to expedite security screening for airline flight crews. TSA has expanded the known crewmember program to include flight attendants and developed a passenger behavior detection program called SPOT. Questions remain about the effectiveness of the behavioral detection program, with concerns about potential racial or ethnic profiling. Despite some Members of Congress seeking to eliminate funding for the program, no specific action has been taken. The TSA PreCheck program, funded by P.L. 114-190, aims to enhance security by involving private-sector entities in marketing and enrolling applicants. Following security failures in 2009 and 2010, TSA modified directives for airlines to check passenger names against the no-fly list within 2 hours of urgent updates. The TSA implemented the Secure Flight program to vet all passengers flying to or from U.S. airports against the Terrorist Screening Database. International flights also use watchlists by CBP's National Targeting Center-Passenger. TSA conducts risk-based analysis through the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). In 2015, TSA announced it would incorporate CAPPS assessments. The TSA's Secure Flight program incorporates CAPPS assessments, passenger data, and watchlists to determine airport screening procedures. Congress may address issues like watchlist updates, utilizing all available information for threat assessment, and protocols for redress. The TSA is assessing the effectiveness of terrorist watchlist checks and protocols for redress. There is a focus on preventing terrorist travel, especially by radicalized individuals joining foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS. Congress directed TSA to explore fingerprint-based criminal background checks for PreCheck participants and expand checks for airport workers. Airport operators are responsible for perimeter security, access controls, and worker credentialing. Airport operators issue security credentials to workers, known as SIDA badges, to control access. TSA mandates security measures like guards and locks at access points. Airports train employees to verify identification and may use surveillance and patrols for property protection. These security measures are funded by the airport and approved by TSA. TSA requires security background checks for airport workers with unescorted access to secure areas at commercial passenger airports and air cargo facilities. Background checks include criminal history records and security threat assessments, checking names against terrorist databases. Certain criminal offenses within the past 10 years are disqualifying. Airports collect biographical information and fingerprints for TSA background checks. The law proposes expanding the criminal history look-back period to 15 years and disqualifying individuals released from prison within 5 years of their application. TSA must establish a waiver process for denied credentials and implement recurrent vetting for airport workers with SIDA access credentials. The law mandates recurrent vetting of airport workers with SIDA access credentials using FBI's Rap Back services to identify criminal offenses. TSA is directed to conduct enhanced physical inspections at access points and in SIDA areas, with random and data-driven approaches. Covert testing of access controls is also increased. Explosives screening technologies at passenger checkpoints include AIT, X-ray imagers, and ETD systems for detecting explosives residue. TSA's FY2017 budget request includes procurement plans for AIT. In its FY2017 budget request, TSA plans to procure AIT and ETD systems for explosives screening. They also aim to acquire over 300 advanced technology X-ray imagers with enhanced capabilities. For checked baggage screening, TSA uses EDS and ETD technology, deploying different speed EDS systems based on airport needs. Acquisition of explosives detection technology is focused on replacing outdated systems mandated by the ATSA law. TSA funds the development of new algorithms to detect homemade explosives in checked baggage and deploys canine teams at transportation facilities to enhance security. There is a growing interest in increasing deployments of canine teams in non-sterile areas of airport terminals following airport bombings in 2016. The TSA is authorized to provide training in airport security measures, including the use of canine teams, to foreign governments. Canine teams are utilized along with other resources to improve security and reduce passenger wait times at airport checkpoints. Incident response at airports is primarily the responsibility of airport operators and local law enforcement, with federal law enforcement potentially taking a lead investigative role in terrorism-related incidents. The Brussels and Istanbul airport bombings raised concerns about security in non-sterile airport areas. P.L. 114-190 requires DHS to enhance training for law enforcement and first responders for active shooter events at airports and public locations. A lone gunman targeted TSA employees at LAX in 2013, resulting in casualties. TSA proposed improvements include better training for screeners and improved incident coordination. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-50) requires airports to adopt plans for responding to security incidents, including evacuation procedures, unified incident command, communication testing, law enforcement response time frames, and joint exercises. TSA does not support arming employees or providing bulletproof vests to screeners, and does not recommend mandatory law enforcement presence at checkpoints. The act also mandates TSA to facilitate information sharing among airports for best practices in security incident planning, management, and training. The Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015 mandates airports to have security incident plans, including law enforcement response timeframes. TSA funds law enforcement support at screening checkpoints through agreements. Foreign air carriers operating flights to the US must adhere to passenger and baggage screening requirements. The TSA enforces requirements for passenger, baggage, and cargo screening on commercial flights to the US. TSA officials inspect foreign airports for compliance with international aviation security standards. Fifteen foreign airports have CBP preclearance facilities for passengers traveling to the US. The TSA enforces screening requirements for passengers, baggage, and cargo on commercial flights to the US. Passengers arriving from preclearance airports can deplane directly into the sterile area at US airports, bypassing customs and immigration processing. TSA is prioritizing screening measures at preclearance airports and working to increase checked baggage preclearance operations to avoid rescreening at the airport of entry. The threat to civilian aircraft from shoulder-fired missiles remains a major concern for aviation security. Since the 1970s, over 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by such missiles, causing 25 crashes and over 600 deaths. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 highlighted this terrorist threat. The State Department authorizes the donation of security screening equipment to last point of departure airports to mitigate these security vulnerabilities. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to aviation security was highlighted after the 9/11 attacks, with efforts to reduce worldwide stockpiles by nearly 33,000 missiles. Concerns persist that these weapons may be in the hands of terrorist groups, especially in conflict zones like Libya and Syria. The DHS initiated the Counter-MANPADS program to protect civil aircraft from missile attacks, particularly in conflict zones like Iraq and Syria. Despite successful testing and FAA certification of two protective systems, they have not been deployed on commercial airliners in the US due to high costs. These systems offer effective protection against heat-seeking missiles, a significant threat to aviation security. Airlines have not invested in systems to protect against heat-seeking MANPADS, arguing that costs should be shared with the government. Policy discussions focus on funding limited units for civilian airliners. Other options like ground-based missile countermeasures and escort planes with antimissile tech face operational challenges. MANPADS are a security threat to civil aviation overseas, but an attack in the US could have a significant impact. MANPADS pose a security threat to civil aviation overseas, and an attack in the United States could have a significant impact on the airline industry. Efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to potential MANPADS attacks in flight paths face challenges due to limited resources and large geographic areas. The FAA has taken steps to accommodate the operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in domestic airspace, although the deadline set in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was not met. The operation of civilian UASs in domestic airspace raises security risks, including the potential for terrorist attacks using drones. Terrorists could use drones for small-scale attacks with explosives or as platforms for chemical, biological, or radiological attacks. In 2011, the FBI disrupted a terrorist plot to attack the Pentagon and Capitol using model aircraft packed with explosives, increasing concerns about potential drone-based attacks. The unauthorized flights of drones near political figures and sensitive locations in various countries have raised concerns about security threats posed by small unmanned aircraft. Incidents of drones flying near airports, restricted airspace, and crowded events domestically have also been reported. The potential for drone attacks using chemical, biological, or radiological weapons is a serious concern. The FAA is proposing regulations for commercial drone operators that would require TSA threat assessments. The FAA is proposing regulations for commercial drone operators that would require TSA threat assessments. Recreational users are exempt from this requirement, but law enforcement may not have sufficient training to respond to the security threats posed by drones. Integrating tracking mechanisms and \"geo-fencing\" capabilities into unmanned aircraft systems could help prevent unauthorized flights. TSA has not formally addressed security concerns from unmanned aircraft operations. Unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace raise security concerns, but they are valuable for homeland security, especially for CBP border surveillance. CBP uses 10 modified Predator UASs and plans to acquire 14 more for border-patrol. State and local governments are interested in using UASs for various missions like traffic patrol and event security. Some agencies have obtained drones through federal grants and FAA authorizations. The introduction of drones into domestic surveillance operations raises legal issues related to privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Courts use various tests to determine if government drone surveillance constitutes a search or seizure, considering factors like the location of the search, technology used, and societal views on privacy. The use of drones in domestic surveillance raises legal concerns regarding privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Courts consider factors such as the technology used and societal views on privacy when determining if government drone surveillance constitutes a search or seizure. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to require warrants for drone surveillance, with exceptions for border patrols and terrorist threat investigations. P.L. 114-190 directs the FAA to establish a pilot program for detecting and mitigating unmanned aircraft. The FAA is directed to establish a pilot program to detect and mitigate unmanned aircraft operations near airports and critical infrastructure. Concerns over cybersecurity threats to aircraft and air traffic control systems are growing, with Executive Order 13636 guiding DHS to work with the FAA on cybersecurity risks. TSA is directed to review threats to civil aviation, including potential disruptions. The TSA focuses on cybersecurity threats to civil aviation, collaborating with industry rather than through regulation. They formed a Cybersecurity Working Group in 2012 and launched the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Center in 2014. The FAA has a software assurance policy for information systems but lacks a formal cybersecurity threat model. The FAA lacks a formal cybersecurity threat model for air traffic control systems, facing challenges in mitigating cyberthreats during the NextGen modernization initiative. Security and integrity are required in the airworthiness certification process for onboard aircraft systems. Collaboration with software security companies is increasing to address cybersecurity risks in aviation systems, but vulnerabilities still exist due to system interconnectedness. The FAA has issued warnings about the vulnerability of interconnected aircraft systems to unauthorized access. The GAO has criticized the FAA's current cybersecurity approach for not adequately addressing the interdependencies between aircraft and air traffic systems. Recommendations include developing a comprehensive cybersecurity threat model and improving security controls and oversight. The FAA is mandated to develop a strategic framework to reduce cybersecurity risks in the national airspace system, civilian aviation, and FAA information systems. This includes addressing risks related to airspace modernization, aircraft automation, and in-flight entertainment systems. Additionally, the FAA is directed to assess the cost and schedule for developing a cybersecurity threat model and implement security guidance for FAA data systems. Passenger rail systems in the US are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, as seen in incidents in Europe and Asia. States carry a large number of passengers daily on rail systems, which are potential targets for terrorist attacks. Congress faces the challenge of balancing rail security with efficient transit operations and other federal priorities. Due to the impracticality of screening all rail passengers like airline passengers, security measures focus on managing attack consequences. Steps have been taken to assess vulnerabilities, plan for emergencies, and reduce risks and consequences of attacks. Security measures for rail passengers include vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, training of transit personnel, increasing security personnel, installing video surveillance, and conducting random inspections. Securing bus passengers is more challenging due to the large number of buses and passengers. Unlike the aviation sector, security in surface transportation is primarily provided by transit and rail operators and local law enforcement agencies. TSA's role is limited in this area. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 authorized $3.5 billion for grants for public transportation security, requiring high-risk targets to have approved security plans by DHS. TSA provides oversight, coordination, and training for transit and rail security, with some operational support through VIPR teams. The DHS is required to conduct security background checks on public transportation and railroad employees, regulate security training standards, and assess threats in transit and passenger rail. TSA aims to increase system resilience, expand deterrence activities, and engage the public in the counterterrorism mission. TSA inspectors conduct assessments of transit security. The TSA conducts security assessments of transit systems through the BASE program and has a training program for transit security. The House Committee on Homeland Security discussed issues with the surface transportation security inspector program, including the lack of expertise among inspectors and challenges with management. The number of inspectors increased from 175 in FY2008 to 404 in FY2011. The number of surface inspectors decreased to 260 in FY2016, reflecting a reduction in VIPR inspectors and focusing efforts on risk-based tasks. GAO reported inconsistencies in reporting rail security incidents and poor data on incidents due to lack of guidance and enforcement by TSA. TSA has implemented processes to address these issues. The TSA has processes in place to address security issues in public transit, passenger rail, and surface transportation. Funding for security improvements has declined significantly since 2009, with potential for duplication among DHS grant programs. The Obama Administration has proposed consolidating these programs, but Congress has not supported this in the appropriations process. The proposal to prioritize maritime security activities has not been supported by Congress in the appropriations process. Concerns have been raised about grant programs not focusing on high-risk areas and unawarded funds. Congress directed TSA to ensure high-risk transportation providers have plans for security incidents. One key challenge is prioritizing maritime security activities among numerous potential attack scenarios, including preventing the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction in shipping containers. The 115th Congress may examine port security initiatives such as the 100% container scanning requirement and port worker security card system. Cybersecurity is an emerging concern, with a deadline for scanning imported marine containers by July 1, 2012, unless deemed infeasible by DHS. The DHS has requested a two-year extension for all ports to comply with the 100% container scanning requirement, citing challenges and high costs. DHS officials and major U.S. trading partners oppose the 100% scanning strategy in favor of a risk-based and layered security approach. The European Commission and major U.S. trading partners oppose 100% container scanning, favoring a multilayered risk management approach. DHS officials have identified operational, technical, logistical, financial, and diplomatic obstacles to implementing 100% scanning. They prefer focusing on high-risk containers to allocate inspection resources effectively. The DHS prefers focusing on high-risk containers for inspection to effectively allocate resources. This approach involves risk-based scanning, investment in intelligence, and potentially increasing personnel for targeted enforcement operations at ports. Additionally, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) rule was implemented in January 2007 for workers at U.S. ports to obtain secure access. The TWIC card is required for port workers to access secure areas, authorized under the MTSA. Approximately 2.1 million holders as of October 2015, with renewal every five years. TSA conducts security threat assessments using biometric technology for identification. Workers pay a fee for the card, which includes criminal history checks. Terminal operators are required to deploy card readers at their facilities. The Coast Guard issued a final rule requiring high-risk maritime facilities to install card readers for worker identification. About 525 out of 3,200 facilities regulated under MTSA would need card readers, while others would continue to use TWIC as a \"flash pass\" without biometric data for worker identification. The Coast Guard issued a final rule in August 2018 requiring high-risk maritime facilities to install card readers for worker identification. However, problems with the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) system have been highlighted, including fraudulent cards being produced in Los Angeles. Audits have criticized the implementation of TWIC, with incomplete and unreliable pilot test results for card readers. The 2011 GAO audit found weaknesses in the TWIC enrollment process, background checks, and card usage at ports, undermining its effectiveness. A 2016 Inspector General audit criticized TSA for prioritizing customer service over careful applicant scrutiny, leading to fraudulent TWIC issuance. The Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act (P.L. 114-278) requires TSA to enhance vetting and fraud detection processes. The Coast Guard released a document in June 2015 outlining plans to address cybersecurity in the maritime environment, including developing guidance for vessels and ports to address vulnerabilities. They will also incorporate cybersecurity into enforcement programs and training for mariner licensing and port security officer qualifications. The Coast Guard plans to modify the MSRAM tool to include cyber risks, as part of efforts to address cybersecurity in the maritime environment. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to promote cybersecurity risk sharing among maritime stakeholders and require DHS to report on maritime cyber threats, but the Senate did not act on the bills."
