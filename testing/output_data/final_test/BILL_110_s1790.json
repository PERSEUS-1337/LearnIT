    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to teen pregnancy prevention. Congress finds that a significant number of American teens, particularly African American and Latino teens, face high rates of pregnancy and HIV/AIDS diagnosis. African American youth are disproportionately affected by HIV, with a high percentage of new AIDS cases reported among this demographic. In 2005, Latino and African American teens had high rates of new AIDS cases and sexually transmitted infections. African American teens had significantly higher rates of gonorrhea and syphilis compared to white teens of the same age. In 2005, the rates of gonorrhea and syphilis were significantly higher among black teens aged 15-19 compared to white teens. Syphilis rates were 19 times higher among black teens, and nearly three-fourths of reported gonorrhea cases were among African American teens. SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED AND SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants for community-based projects to prevent teen pregnancies in minority or immigrant communities with high rates of teen pregnancy. Grant recipients must agree to use specific strategies for this purpose. To prevent teen pregnancies in minority or immigrant communities with high rates of teen pregnancy, community-based projects can promote effective communication among families, educate community members about the consequences of teen pregnancy, encourage young people to postpone sexual activity and teach skills to avoid unwanted advances, and provide information about contraceptives and barrier methods to prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. To prevent teen pregnancies in minority or immigrant communities with high rates of teen pregnancy, community-based projects aim to educate young people about the consequences of early parenthood and provide information on contraceptives and barrier methods to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. Grant recipients must agree to use effective strategies in implementing these initiatives. The Secretary may grant funds for school-based projects aimed at preventing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among teens by providing counseling and support services. Effective strategies based on scientific research must be used in these initiatives. The Secretary grants funds for school-based projects to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among teens by providing health and educational services, promoting better outcomes for pregnant teens, and offering training for individuals working in support programs. Priority is given to projects in eligible communities. The grant requires the formation of a coalition of entities, including public secondary schools and service providers, for project implementation. Funds can also be used for training individuals to provide project services. Applicants must agree to submit reports to the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary must provide reports on project outcomes, education, and awareness about unintended pregnancy and STIs among teens. Evaluations of 10% of projects under the grant must be conducted within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

It also looks at the variance in teen pregnancy rates by location. The research explores factors influencing teen pregnancy rates, including location, population subgroup, acculturation level, and socioeconomic status.
