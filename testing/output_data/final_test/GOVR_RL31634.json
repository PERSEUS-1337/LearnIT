    "content": "The basic intent of HIPAA's health insurance provisions is to ensure individuals and small employers can maintain coverage, switch plans easily, and purchase coverage independently. The reforms protect individuals with preexisting conditions, limit waiting times for coverage, guarantee access to plans, and allow for coverage renewal. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) includes provisions for guaranteed renewal of coverage, non-discrimination based on health status, special enrollment periods, tax deductions for self-employed health insurance premiums, availability of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) with high deductible plans, tax incentives for long-term care insurance, administrative simplification, and privacy provisions for electronic health information transmission. Additional federal protections have been added since the passage of HIPAA. Federal protections have been added since the passage of HIPAA, including requirements for minimum hospital stays for newborn delivery, mental health services coverage, and mastectomy reconstructive surgery. These provisions aim to help insured Americans with preexisting conditions and those who have been denied insurance due to their health status. However, they do not address the larger issue of the uninsured population. HIPAA provisions do not address the larger problem of the uninsured, estimated at 45 million in 2003. The Act does not regulate the price of health insurance coverage and evidence suggests that costs may be higher for individuals under HIPAA's group-to-individual portability provisions. The Act does not require employers to offer or pay for health insurance for their employees. The HIPAA Act does not mandate employers to provide health insurance for their employees, family coverage, or cover part-time, seasonal, or temporary employees. However, employers sponsoring a group health plan must comply with certain requirements, including restrictions on preexisting condition limitations, discrimination based on health status, premium equality, and documentation of coverage. The HIPAA Act allows individuals to use evidence of creditable health plan coverage to reduce or eliminate preexisting condition exclusion periods when switching health plans. Portability protection applies when moving between group health plans or between group and individual plans. Creditable coverage gives individuals credit for previous insurance when applying for a new plan. Creditable coverage includes various types of health insurance such as group health plans, individual health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, military health care, and more. Preexisting conditions are defined as medical conditions for which advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was received within the 6-month period before enrollment. Pregnancy is not considered a preexisting medical condition. Preexisting condition limits or exclusions cannot be imposed on newborns or newly adopted children if they are covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of birth or adoption. Final regulations under HIPAA address benefit exclusions that are not designated as preexisting condition exclusions but are considered as such by regulators. Examples include provisions excluding coverage of pregnancy until 12 months after eligibility for benefits. The Act prohibits the use of genetic information as a preexisting condition, except in cases where there is a diagnosis of a related medical condition. Plans must comply with HIPAA portability provisions by July 1, 2005, including exclusions related to accidents prior to enrollment. A group health plan cannot impose more than a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period. HIPAA prohibits imposing a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period (18 months for late enrollees) on eligible participants. Portability protection is also provided in the individual market. Group health plans covered by HIPAA must meet requirements related to portability, including limitations on preexisting conditions. The HIPAA prohibits imposing a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period on eligible participants. The plan cannot apply any preexisting condition waiting period on pregnancy, a covered newborn, or on any covered child under 18 who is adopted. Employers must provide a certificate stating the amount of creditable coverage accumulated and whether the enrollee was subject to a waiting period. This certificate can be used to demonstrate prior creditable coverage when switching to a new health insurance plan. The HIPAA prohibits a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period on eligible participants. Individuals should maintain continuous coverage under a health insurance plan to benefit from portability protection. Preexisting medical condition coverage may be limited for up to 12 months for first-time enrollees, and 18 months for late enrollees. It is important not to allow insurance coverage to lapse for 63 or more days to qualify for portability protection. The HIPAA prohibits a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period on eligible participants. Individuals with prior creditable coverage can reduce their limitation period by one month for every month of previous coverage. Continuous coverage must be maintained to avoid new limitation periods, even with job or health plan changes. A break in coverage lasting longer than 62 days may result in a 12-month preexisting condition limitation period. Individuals without creditable coverage may face a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion period. To waive this limitation, they need to provide certifications of prior coverage, including COBRA continuation. Health plans must issue written certifications of coverage periods and waiting periods. Interim rules have been issued to streamline this process. The Act provides guidance and model certification forms to streamline the process of administering it. Late enrollment in a group health plan occurs when an individual enrolls outside of the initial enrollment period or a special enrollment period. A waiting period is the time an employee must wait before being eligible for health plan enrollment, which can be determined by the employer or health insurance issuer. The Act does not limit the length of waiting periods but requires them to be applied uniformly regardless of health status. The Act requires waiting periods to be applied uniformly regardless of health status. Waiting periods do not count towards coverage breaks of 63 days or more. Any waiting period must run concurrently with preexisting condition limitation periods. The Act requires waiting periods to be applied uniformly regardless of health status, with waiting periods not counting towards coverage breaks of 63 days or more. Preexisting condition limitation periods cannot exceed 7 months from enrollment. New benefit packages may cover additional benefits not included in prior plans, with discretion given to plans and issuers in applying prior creditable coverage. Plans can choose to include all periods of coverage or examine coverage on a benefit-specific basis. The April 8, 1997 interim rule allows for certain categories of benefits to be considered separately, such as mental health, substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, dental care, or vision care. Plans may exclude coverage of benefits not covered under the prior plan for up to 12 months. Employers are not required to offer coverage to an individual's spouse or children, but if they do, the same protections apply. Coverage cannot be denied based on a family member's illness, and preexisting condition restrictions are limited. HIPAA guarantees these protections. HIPAA guarantees availability of a plan and prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions for eligible individuals moving from group health insurance to the individual market. States can enforce HIPAA individual market guarantees or establish an alternative mechanism. In states using the federal fallback approach, health insurance issuers must offer coverage to all eligible individuals without limitations on preexisting conditions. Compliance with the Act's requirements can be achieved in three ways. HIPAA guarantees availability of a plan and prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions for eligible individuals moving from group health insurance to the individual market. States can enforce HIPAA individual market guarantees or establish an alternative mechanism. Issuers must offer coverage to all eligible individuals without limitations on preexisting conditions. Compliance with the Act's requirements can be achieved in three ways, including offering access to popular insurance policies and maintaining risk adjustment mechanisms. Individuals must have creditable health insurance coverage for 18 months or longer, with no breaks in coverage of 63 or more days, and meet specific eligibility criteria to be protected by HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions. Those purchasing insurance on their own who do not meet these criteria may be protected under state laws. The protections apply only to individuals whose most recent coverage was through traditional employer-based group arrangements, governmental plans, or church-sponsored plans. Individuals covered under HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions must have creditable health insurance for 18 months or longer without breaks exceeding 63 days. Eligibility is limited to those with employer-based group plans, governmental plans, or church-sponsored plans. Those with military, college-sponsored, or government-sponsored plans are not eligible for federal protections but may be covered under state laws. Acceptable state mechanisms must offer choice of coverage, no preexisting condition restrictions, and at least one policy option. State mechanisms for individuals covered under HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions must offer choice of coverage without preexisting condition restrictions. Examples include NAIC Model Acts, high-risk pools, risk adjustment approaches, financial subsidies, or other mechanisms providing a choice of individual health insurance coverage. State mechanisms for individuals covered under HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions include health insurance coverage pools, mandatory group conversion policies, and open enrollment by health insurance issuers. Some states utilize high-risk pools or a combination of mechanisms to provide group-to-individual portability. As of December 2003, the District of Columbia and 10 states utilize the federal fallback mechanism for enforcement. The Act provides for special enrollment periods to help individuals losing group health insurance coverage easily obtain other group coverage. This includes allowing eligible employees to enroll in a group health plan if they were previously covered under a different plan. Individuals seeking information on state health insurance regulations can contact the state's department of insurance. The special enrollment period allows employees or dependents who lost coverage under a previous plan (e.g., due to COBRA expiration or termination of employment) to enroll in a new group health plan within 30 days of losing coverage. A written statement may be required if declining coverage for other reasons. The special enrollment period allows employees or dependents who lost coverage under a previous plan to enroll in a new group health plan within 30 days. Dependent beneficiaries can also enroll through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement of adoption within the same timeframe. The special enrollment period allows individuals to enroll in a new group health plan within 30 days of losing coverage or through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. The Act prohibits group health plans from denying enrollment based on health status-related factors, including medical history, genetic information, and disability. Plans cannot charge differential premiums based on these factors or fail to re-enroll participants. The Act prohibits discrimination in group health plans based on health status-related factors, including medical history and disability. Premiums cannot be adjusted or coverage denied based on these factors. The Department of Labor defined the nondiscrimination provisions of HIPAA broadly, including coverage for individuals in high-risk activities. The broad interpretation of HIPAA's nondiscrimination protections extends to individuals engaging in high-risk activities, excluding coverage for injuries associated with such activities. Group health plans are not required to offer coverage to an individual's spouse or children, but if offered, the same non-discrimination protections apply. The Act prohibits health plans from denying coverage due to a family member's illness or charging higher premiums based on health-related factors. It allows for premium discounts for participation in health programs and requires acceptance of small employers regardless of health status. The Act requires health plans to accept small employers with two to 50 employees, known as \"guaranteed issue.\" This includes enrolling every eligible individual in the employer's group. Exceptions exist for network plans with capacity limits or if employees don't reside in the plan's area. Groups with over 50 employees are not covered unless mandated by state law. The Act requires health insurance issuers to report on access to health insurance in the large group market every three years. It mandates all issuers to provide guaranteed renewability for coverage, except in cases of non-payment of premiums or fraud. Insurers can charge any amount for coverage. HIPAA originally did not mandate specific benefits for group health insurance plans, but Congress later added protections for certain services. For example, the FY1997 appropriations bill required plans covering mental health services to offer limited mental health parity and prohibited plans covering newborn delivery from limiting hospital stays to less than two days. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, incorporated in the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act, also requires plans covering mastectomy for breast cancer to include reconstructive surgery. Private health insurers often provide less coverage for mental illnesses compared to other illnesses, limiting hospital days and outpatient visits while increasing cost sharing. Some states have passed full-parity laws for mental health coverage, but self-insured plans are exempt from state regulation under ERISA. About 52% of covered workers are in self-insured plans. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) amended ERISA and the Public Health Service Act to establish federal standards for mental health coverage in employer-sponsored plans. It requires parity only for annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage, allowing plans to impose more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing. The MHPA has limitations, exempting employers with 50 or fewer employees and those experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires parity for annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage in employer-sponsored plans. Employers experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs due to MHPA compliance can apply for an exemption. Legislation to expand MHPA for full-parity coverage has faced opposition from employers and health insurance organizations. The Act prohibits group health plans from restricting hospital stays for childbirth to less than 48 hours for normal deliveries and 96 hours for caesarian deliveries. Title IX of the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act requires coverage for mastectomies to also include prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery. Federal law allows employers to exclude specific illnesses from health benefit plans, but factors limit their ability to do so. The Act prohibits group health plans from restricting hospital stays for childbirth. Federal law allows employers to exclude specific illnesses from health benefit plans, but factors limit their ability to do so. Self-funded plans under ERISA have flexibility in crafting benefits. Association plans must comply with various requirements of the Act relating to group health coverage, such as not dropping a group from coverage due to medical service use. States can impose their own requirements, but HIPAA ensures that state laws do not hinder consumer protections. The Act's provisions override state laws on portability, but state laws regulating rating practices still apply. Exceptions exist for state laws that offer greater portability, such as defining preexisting conditions differently or allowing longer breaks in coverage than the Act specifies. For example, a state may limit preexisting condition periods to 6 months for group health plans. The Act overrides state laws on portability but still allows state laws regulating rating practices. Exceptions exist for state laws offering greater portability, such as defining preexisting conditions differently or allowing longer breaks in coverage. The Act does not place restrictions on premium amounts, but some states may limit insurance premiums in the individual market. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury jointly enforce the provisions of the Act, with specific responsibilities for enforcing requirements on employer plans, group health plans, and health insurance issuers. States have the primary responsibility for enforcing HIPAA's access, portability, and renewability. States are primarily responsible for enforcing HIPAA's access, portability, and renewability standards for insurers. If states fail to enforce these standards, DHHS will step in. Missouri was the only state as of 2001 that had not enacted enabling legislation. Noncompliant group health plans under ERISA may face civil money penalties, and participants can sue plans and issuers for benefits. The Secretary of Labor can investigate compliance, and the IRS can fine noncompliant employers. States enforce requirements on issuers, with Missouri's HHS Secretary handling enforcement. Fines of $100 per day can be imposed for violations. The Act allows for fines of $100 per day for noncompliance by entities. The Secretary of HHS can create regulations for coverage requirements. COBRA continuation coverage is considered creditable coverage when transitioning between group policies. Regulations for HIPAA's insurance provisions are listed in a table. The Act makes changes to laws regarding COBRA continuation coverage, including clarifications for disabled qualified beneficiaries. Eligible individuals in the individual market must exhaust COBRA or other continuation coverage before moving to the individual market, where insurers can charge rates allowed under state law. The Act clarifies that disabled qualified beneficiaries and their family members are eligible for an additional 11 months of COBRA coverage. It also includes provisions for a qualified beneficiary who becomes disabled within the first 60 days of COBRA, a child born or adopted during COBRA coverage, and termination of COBRA if the beneficiary joins a group health plan without exclusions. HIPAA includes provisions for electronic transmission of health care information to streamline administrative operations within the health care system. Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification in 2001 to specify content and format standards for electronic health care claims and transactions. The Administrative Simplification Compliance Act of 2001 allowed for an extension on compliance deadlines for electronic transactions and codes standards. HIPAA also required the development of security standards to protect health information and unique health identifiers for patients, employers, and providers. Compliance with security standards was required by April 21, 2005. In each fiscal year since FY1999, Congress has prevented CMS from developing a standard for the unique patient identifier by inserting language in the agency's annual appropriations bill. Patients are concerned about the privacy of their medical information and fear unauthorized access to their records. Lawmakers addressed these concerns in HIPAA's administrative simplification provisions. HIPAA addressed concerns about the privacy of health information by setting a deadline for Congress to enact legislation. When Congress failed to meet the deadline, the Secretary developed a health information privacy rule, issued in December 2000 with modifications in August 2002. For more information on the privacy rule, see CRS Report RS20500. HIPAA also authorized tax-advantaged medical savings accounts (MSAs) under a demonstration that began in 1997. Medical savings accounts (MSAs), now called Archer MSAs, are personal savings accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses. They can be used to pay for health care not covered by insurance, including deductibles and copayments. MSAs may be established by taxpayers with qualifying high deductible insurance, either self-employed or covered by a high deductible plan from a small employer. Employer contributions to MSAs are tax-exempt, while individual contributions are tax-deductible. MSAs are held in trust by financial institutions, with tax-exempt earnings. Withdrawals for medical expenses are not taxed. MSAs, now called Archer MSAs, are personal savings accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-exempt, while non-qualified distributions are subject to income tax and a 15% penalty. The deadline for establishing new accounts was initially set by HIPAA, with a limit of 750,000 accounts. Amendments extended the deadline to December 31, 2003. Despite low numbers of new accounts, current owners can maintain their accounts with qualifying high-deductible insurance. MSA owners with qualifying high-deductible insurance can continue to make contributions and roll over their balances into HSAs. HIPAA increased the deduction for self-employed taxpayers' health insurance premiums from 30% to 45%. For more information on tax-advantaged accounts, refer to CRS reports RS21573 and RL32467, and legislative activity in CRS Issue Brief IB98037. HIPAA increased the deduction for self-employed taxpayers' health insurance premiums from 30% to 80% in 2006 and thereafter. Legislation accelerated and increased the percentages set by HIPAA, allowing 100% of health insurance costs to be deducted starting in 2003. Payments for personal injury or sickness through an arrangement like accident or health insurance are exempt from taxation under HIPAA. HIPAA established new rules for the tax treatment of long-term care insurance and expenses, effective January 1, 1997. Qualified long-term care insurance is treated as accident and health insurance, with benefits excluded from gross income. Employer contributions to premiums are also excluded. Unreimbursed long-term care expenses can be deducted as itemized deductions. In 2005, unreimbursed long-term care expenses can be deducted as itemized deductions if they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. Long-term care insurance premiums are considered as these expenses, with age-adjusted limits ranging from $270 to $3,400. Self-employed individuals can include long-term care insurance premiums in their above-the-line deduction for health insurance expenses, limited to age-adjusted limits. Qualified long-term care insurance covers only long-term care services, is guaranteed renewable, and does not provide cash surrender value. Long-term care insurance is guaranteed renewable and does not provide cash surrender value. It applies refunds of premiums and policy holder dividends to reduce future premiums or increase benefits. Policies issued before January 1, 1997, meeting state requirements are considered qualified for favorable tax treatment. Qualified long-term care services include necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, and personal care services for chronically ill individuals. Services must be provided according to a prescribed plan of care by a licensed health care practitioner. Amounts paid for services provided by a spouse or relative of a chronically ill person are not considered eligible medical expenses for tax benefits unless the service is provided by a licensed professional. Chronically ill individuals are defined as those who require substantial assistance with daily activities, have a disability similar to specified levels, or need supervision due to severe cognitive impairment. HIPAA requires certification by a licensed health practitioner for individuals with severe cognitive impairment. Accelerated death benefits from life insurance contracts for terminally or chronically ill individuals are excluded from gross income. Amounts from viatical settlements are also excluded, except for business-related insurable interest payments. Terminally ill individuals are certified by a physician as having a qualifying illness. A chronically ill individual, certified by a physician as having an illness expected to result in death within 24 months, is defined similarly to long-term care. Exclusions for accelerated death benefits are limited to long-term care costs not covered by insurance. Benefits paid periodically are limited to $240 a day or long-term care costs. Contracts cannot reimburse expenses covered by Medicare. Consumer protection provisions for long-term care insurance apply, with exceptions for chronically ill individuals. HIPAA added exemptions for certain organizations from federal income tax, including state-sponsored membership organizations providing insurance to high-risk individuals and state-sponsored workmen's compensation reinsurance organizations. Health insurance providers organized under state laws for not-for-profit health insurance can deduct 25% of claims and expenses incurred during the year. HIPAA expanded tax exemptions for certain organizations and introduced changes to individual retirement account (IRA) distributions. It also required the inclusion of organ and tissue donor information in tax refund mailings and authorized tax-advantaged medical savings accounts (MSAs) under a demonstration starting in 1997."
