    "content": "Congress appropriated $2.649 billion for legislative branch operations in FY2001, a 6.6% increase over the FY2000 appropriation. The funding included a regular annual legislative branch appropriations bill, a supplemental appropriation, and a rescission. The first bill was vetoed by President Clinton, but a new bill with the same funding levels was incorporated into the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House Appropriations Committee initially allocated funding for FY2001 at 5.5% less than FY2000 levels, but the Senate approved a 3.7% increase. The House later restored most of the funds cut, resulting in a compromise bill with a 2.1% increase over FY2000. Additionally, a second bill included $118 million in appropriations and a 0.22% cut in FY2001 funds. In FY2001, the legislative branch was funded at its FY2000 level in continuing resolutions. The legislative branch appropriations bill is divided into two titles: Title I for Congressional Operations and Title II for Related Agencies. Title I includes budgets for activities directly serving Congress, while Title II includes budgets for activities not directly supporting Congress. The legislative branch appropriations bill includes funding for Congressional Operations and Related Agencies. Title I budget authority accounted for 69.7% of the total appropriation in FY2000, while Title II budget authority accounted for 30.3%. Additionally, there is legislative budget authority not included in the annual appropriations act, consisting of permanent federal funds and other budget authority. Permanent federal funds do not require annual action and are available as a result of previously enacted legislation. Trust funds are monies held in accounts for specific purposes and do not require annual legislative approval. Non-legislative entities within the legislative branch budget are funded in other appropriation bills but are included in the legislative section for bookkeeping purposes. The status of Legislative Branch Appropriations for FY2001 shows a subcommittee vote of 6-3 and a full House Appropriations Committee markup on May 9, 2000 with a vote of 31-23 to report the measure. The House Appropriations Committee voted 31-23 to report the measure to the House on May 9, 2000. The Senate version, S. 2603, was marked up by the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 18, 2000, and passed by unanimous consent. The Senate agreed to advance S. 2603 to the third reading on May 25, 2000. The bill was engrossed and returned to the Senate calendar. The Senate passed H.R. 4516, incorporating the text of S. 2603. The conference report for H.R. 4516 appeared in the Congressional Record on July 27. The House agreed to waive points of order against the conference report on July 27. The Senate failed to approve the conference report on Sept. 20, 2000. H.R. 4516 was vetoed on Oct. 30, 2000. The FY2001 legislative funding bill, H.R. 4516, was vetoed on Oct. 30, 2000. A revised budget estimate of $2.716 billion was an increase of $258.3 million from the FY2000 appropriation. The House passed its version of the bill on June 22, with a funding level of $1.914 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2001 legislative funding bill, H.R. 4516, saw a decrease of $9.8 million, or 0.5%, from the FY2000 appropriation. The House adopted a managers' amendment adding $95.7 million to the bill, resulting in a reduction to $1.818 billion in FY2001 from $1.924 billion in FY2000. This reduction was based on maintaining the FY2000 budget authority, less $94 million, and included reductions for various departments. The FY2001 legislative funding bill, H.R. 4516, included significant budget cuts for various agencies in the legislative branch. The House Appropriations Committee estimated that 1,720 full-time equivalent positions would be eliminated, with reductions in agencies such as the Capitol Police, GAO, CRS, CBO, AOC, GPO, and the House of Representatives. The bill aimed to reduce funding allocations across different departments. On May 4, the House Appropriations Committee chairman released funding allocations of $2.355 billion for the legislative branch in FY2001, $45 million less than the Senate's allocation. On May 8, the House committee voted on its version of the FY2001 legislative budget without changes. On June 20, an additional $95.7 million was added through a manager's amendment, with $113 million reallocated from the Subcommittee on Transportation to the Subcommittee on Legislative. Hearings were held by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative in January and February 2000. The Senate passed H.R. 4516 on July 17 incorporating text changes. The Senate passed H.R. 4516 on July 17, containing $1.721 billion, a 3.7% increase from the previous year. The Senate's appropriation base did not include a previous supplemental. The Senate minority leader intended to delay passage until after the House considered its version. Earlier, on May 24, the Senate began considering its version of the FY2001 legislative branch appropriations bill, S. 2603. On May 25, the Senate advanced S. 2603 to the third reading by a vote of 98-2. The Senate passed H.R. 4516 with various percentage increases for different departments.

The report included a 2.1% increase over the FY2000 appropriation, as well as $51.1 million in emergency FY2000 supplemental appropriations for the legislative branch and other departments. Division A of the bill contained provisions for the legislative branch, including $11.1 million in emergency supplemental appropriations for security enhancements and repairs. President vetoed H.R. 4516, criticizing it for funding Congress and the White House before other appropriations measures. The Government Appropriations Act, 2001 provided funds for the legislative branch and the White House. The President vetoed the bill due to Congress' focus on priorities other than funding classrooms, schools, and workers. FY2001 legislative branch funds were included in the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act after the President's veto of H.R. 4516. The FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-554) included legislative branch appropriations of $2.649 billion, with additional funding for specific programs such as the Russian leadership program and fire safety measures. Supplemental appropriations for FY2000 were also approved for various purposes. In FY2000, Congress approved a 0.38% rescission in the legislative branch appropriations through H.R. 3194 (P.L. 106-113). This bill also included a $10 million supplemental for the Library of Congress and $136,700 for a gratuity payment. Additionally, a second bill (H.R. 3908) passed in March allocated $17 million for the legislative branch, including funds for security enhancements to the Library of Congress buildings. In FY2000, a $17 million supplemental was allocated for security enhancements to the Library of Congress buildings and grounds, with additional funds for fire safety to various Capitol buildings and grounds. The Senate delayed further action on the supplemental due to concerns over rising costs, eventually adding it to S. 2536. The FY2000 legislative supplemental appropriation contained in H.R. 3908 was subsequently incorporated in S. 2536, the FY2001 agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration, and related agencies appropriations bill. S. 2536 included $11.9 million in emergency appropriations for the Capitol Police Board for security enhancements, and $2.7 million for other security measures. The FY2000 legislative supplemental appropriation included $2.7 million for Capitol Police salaries and $17.5 million for fire safety upgrades. The funding for fire safety was later removed. The $17.5 million appropriation for fire safety was removed from S. 2536 and added to H.R. 4425 during conference. Language related to the Trade Deficit Review Commission was also deleted. Additionally, three other legislative branch provisions were included in H.R. 4461, but later dropped during consideration. Conferees on H.R. 4425 agreed to add a $17.5 million supplemental for fire safety upgrades. H.R. 4425 was signed into law by the President on July 13 (P.L. 106-246), with a $17.5 million supplemental for fire safety upgrades. The appropriations for fire safety included funds for Capitol buildings, Senate and House office buildings, Capitol power plant, Botanic Garden, and Architect of the Capitol. Conferees on H.R. 4475 added language related to the operations of the legislative branch, providing additional funds for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. A Washington, D.C. area law enforcement training center is being established for various federal agencies, including the United States Capitol Police and the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, focusing on firearms and vehicle operations requalifications. A new provision in the legislative branch appropriations bill places the chief administrative officer position for the U.S. Capitol Police under direct control of the Capitol Police, with oversight from the Comptroller General of the United States. The Comptroller General will monitor the performance of the CAO and report to relevant authorities on progress in resolving administrative issues. Action was taken on Supplementals in H.R. 5666, a Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill, which included funding for the Capitol Police Board and the Architect of the Capitol for security measures. Major funding issues were addressed, such as increasing funds for additional officers, transferring administration of the Capitol Police, and merging other law enforcement entities. The House and Senate Subcommittees on Legislative Branch consider funding requests for legislative agencies each spring, with options to maintain a flat budget, provide a modest increase, or approve a budget decrease. Funding priorities include electronic document printing, digital programs for the Library of Congress, staff succession programs, and comptroller general authority for flexibility in reduction-in-force and retirement options. The House and Senate Subcommittees on Legislative Branch consider funding requests each spring, with options to maintain a flat budget, provide a modest increase, or approve a budget decrease. The FY2001 bill initially proposed a 5.5% reduction, but was later increased by $95.7 million. The final budget for FY2001 saw a 2.1% increase to $2.527 billion. The legislative branch budget is 0.15% of the total federal budget. A \"flat\" budget can be challenging due to ongoing maintenance needs and technology updates.

The House expressed concern for the security of electronically formatted legislative information in the FY2001 bill, directing the clerk of the House to establish information security standards and procedures. The clerk was required to submit proposed standards and procedures to the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for approval. The Library of Congress and the Government Printing Office are directed to work with the clerk and secretary of the Senate to implement systems for confirming the authenticity of legislative information by January 3, 2001.
