    "content": "Recent advancements in deep learning techniques like CNN and GAN have made significant progress in semantic image inpainting, reconstructing missing pixels in images. Deep learning models require large datasets and computational resources for training, with inpainting quality varying based on dataset size and diversity. To address these issues, a new inpainting strategy called Comparative Sample Augmentation is proposed in this paper. This method filters out irrelevant images and generates additional images using surrounding region information, improving training set quality. Experiments show that this approach extends the applicability of deep inpainting models to datasets of varying sizes while maintaining quality. Semantic image inpainting is a challenging task in computer vision, with difficulties in synthesizing visually and semantically coherent missing pixels. Current solutions fall into traditional patch-based learning methods and deep learning models. Deep learning models require large datasets for training, and inpainting quality varies based on dataset size and diversity. A new inpainting strategy called Comparative Sample Augmentation is proposed to extend the applicability of deep inpainting models to datasets of varying sizes while maintaining quality. Traditional patch-based learning methods and deep learning methods are used for the inpainting problem. Traditional methods struggle with reconstructing complex non-repeating structures and capturing high-level semantics. Deep learning methods use deep models to extract representations of existing pixels and transform inpainting into a conditional pixel generation problem. However, deep learning methods require a large amount of diverse training data, limiting their applicability when training data is limited. The paper proposes a black-box strategy to address issues with neural networks in tasks involving adversarial noise. The strategy adapts to existing generative frameworks and extends deep neural network strategies to cases with varying amounts of training data. The contribution includes selecting relevant samples based on color attributes, improving local image qualities by adding new images through white-noise addition. Our method improves image inpainting results using generative structures, especially with limited training data. Previous approaches either incorporate features directly into the image or utilize learning methods from other training images. Traditional methods handle background information to fill missing pixels but struggle with complex images like human faces. Deep learning methods using Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks are effective for inpainting images, but require large amounts of labeled data for training. Traditional methods struggle with complex images like human faces. The proposed data augmentation method of Comparative Sample Augmentation aims to address the high computational resources and training time required for training generative inpainting models. It consists of a comparative augmenting filter and a self enricher to select relevant samples and add noise masks to original images for training. This approach combines global information and local features to form a dataset for inpainting neural network training. The algorithm is easy to implement and adaptable to various generative adversarial networks. The algorithm introduced addresses the under-representation of contextual information in traditional inpainting methods by using a comparative augmenting filter on the training dataset. It defines a similarity distance between two distributions of RGB pixels to improve inpainting accuracy. The algorithm improves inpainting accuracy by comparing RGB pixel distributions in images, selecting K-closest images based on color similarity. Random masks are added to enhance deep inpainting model robustness against over-dependency on training data. The algorithm enhances inpainting accuracy by adding random masks to improve deep neural network robustness against overfitting. Additional images with normal random noise are included in the training set to address concerns about insufficient latent space representation in generative adversarial networks. The algorithm improves inpainting accuracy by adding random masks to enhance neural network robustness. It includes additional images with normal random noise in the training set to address concerns about latent space representation. The method is evaluated on datasets CIFAR-10, CelebA, and Places, with experiments on \"many\" and \"few\" data cases. Images are randomly sampled and masked for testing, resulting in Reduced-CIFAR, Reduced-CelebA datasets. The algorithm enhances inpainting accuracy by incorporating random masks to improve neural network robustness. It utilizes the state-of-the-art WGAN-GP for the generative model framework, producing better images with sample augmentation. The method lacks effective quantitative evaluation metrics for image inpainting, reporting mean l1 and l2 errors for reconstruction. In this paper, the authors introduce a strategy of comparative sample augmentation for deep inpainting. They demonstrate through experiments that their method extends deep-learning-based inpainting to cases with varying data sizes without requiring model adjustments. Future work includes incorporating gradient matching and feature encoders to better approximate the distance between inpainting and training images, as well as improving control of augmentation using advancements like BID1."
