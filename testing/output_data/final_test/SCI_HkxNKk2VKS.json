    "content": "The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a signal processing algorithm that efficiently approximates Bayesian inference in non-conjugate models by linearizing the local measurement function. It outperforms methods relying on cubature in time-critical real-world problems. However, it is limited in its local nature compared to global approximation methods like variational inference or expectation propagation (EP). Power EP is formulated as a nonlinear Kalman filter that iteratively improves linearization, matching EKF on the first pass and enhancing stability as EP power tends to zero. The EP-like algorithm stabilizes by calculating the limit as EP power approaches zero. It solves non-conjugate temporal Gaussian process models in linear time, O(n), using sigma-point integration. The drawback is the exponential scaling of cubature points with dimensionality. The number of cubature points scales exponentially with dimensionality. Linearisation offers an alternative to cubature methods, with the statistically linearised filter showing promising results in various modeling scenarios. Linearisation ensures closed-form solutions for posterior integrals, leading to significant benefits. Power EP (PEP, Minka, 2004) is formulated as a Gaussian filter parametrised by local likelihood approximations, with refined linearisations during multiple data passes. It is shown to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter (EKF, Jazwinski, 1970) in a single iteration, and can efficiently handle temporal GPs with large data and high-dimensional latent states. The Power EP method is a Gaussian filter that outperforms the EKF in handling temporal GPs with large data and high-dimensional latent states. It aims to calculate the posterior over latent states in non-conjugate Gaussian process models with one-dimensional inputs. The Power EP method uses Gaussian filtering and smoothing with Gaussian approximations for filtering distributions. It incorporates a moment matching procedure for non-Gaussian likelihoods in the update step. The Power EP method utilizes Gaussian filtering and smoothing with Gaussian approximations for filtering distributions. It involves a moment matching procedure for non-Gaussian likelihoods in the update step, where the required moments are calculated via derivatives of the log-normaliser of the tilted distribution. This leads to a modified set of linear Kalman filter updates, incorporating a cavity distribution calculation and closed-form updates for the approximate likelihood. The EKF-PEP method, derived from Eq. (7) with \u03b1 = 1, results in closed-form filter updates, simplifying implementation without costly matrix operations. Comparison with EP and EKF on nonconjugate GP tasks shows suitability for large datasets. The approach is demonstrated on a log-Gaussian Cox process modeling coal mining accidents in small time series. The EKF-PEP method, derived from Eq. (7) with \u03b1 = 1, simplifies filter updates for large datasets. It is demonstrated on a log-Gaussian Cox process modeling coal mining accidents. EKF-PEP shows a tight match to the EP posterior, with improvements in mean and marginal variances. Linearisation in a simulated motorcycle crash model improves posterior in some regions. This new perspective unifies PEP and EKF paradigms for temporal data. Further exploration includes adjusting \u03b1 and using statistical linearisation for local approximations. The proposed globally iterated EKF-PEP algorithm Algorithm 1 combines extended Kalman filter with power EP-style updates and linearisation for obtaining local approximations. It involves iterated EP-style loop and analytical linearisation in EP, resulting in improved posterior estimates. The proposed EP-style algorithm with linearisation is equivalent to the EKF. The algorithm updates the Kalman filter with new Kalman updates based on scaling observation noise with the Jacobian of the state. This results in improved posterior estimates. The algorithm (Garc\u00eda-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015) refines local posterior approximations using statistical linear regression (SLR), seen as a globally iterated extension of the SLR filter. Linearising the measurement function with respect to the posterior is beneficial when measurement noise is small. The algorithm is equivalent to the EKF on the first filtering pass, but iteratively refines likelihood parameters in the smoothing pass. Posterior linearisation is a variational free energy method that minimizes local KL divergences. PLF is a version of the algorithm with \u03b1 = 0 and SLR replacing analytical linearisation. Both PLF and the algorithm are more stable than EP, as no covariance subtractions and inversions are needed. The coal mining dataset contains dates of 191 coal mine explosions in Britain between 1851-1962, modeled using a log-Gaussian Cox process with locally constant intensity. Gaussian approximation is used for the Poisson likelihood due to its discreteness. The motorcycle crash experiment involves 131 simulated accelerometer readings with heteroscedastic noise modeling. The motorcycle crash experiment consists of 131 simulated accelerometer readings with heteroscedastic noise modeling. A GP is used for the mean and another for the time-varying observation noise. The model is reformulated for improved identifiability, with EKF-PEP and PEP equivalent methods compared. The EKF-PEP method and PEP equivalent are compared in the motorcycle crash experiment. Plots show posterior for mean process, observation noise process, and full model."
