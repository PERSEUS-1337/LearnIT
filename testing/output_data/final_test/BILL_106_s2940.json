    "content": "The International Malaria Control Act of 2000 may be cited as the ``International Malaria Control Act of 2000''. Congress finds that malaria is a significant global health issue, with 300-500 million cases and over 1 million deaths annually. Approximately 40% of the world's population is at risk, with children under 9 years old being the most vulnerable. Malaria predominantly affects sub-Saharan Africa, where over 90% of cases occur. Malaria is a significant global health issue, with high-risk areas including America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The disease is particularly dangerous during pregnancy, causing severe anemia and contributing to maternal deaths. Pregnant mothers who are HIV-positive and have malaria are more likely to pass on HIV to their children. \"Airport malaria\" is becoming more common, with cases imported by international travelers. In the United States, there were 1,400 cases of malaria reported. In the United States, most of the 1,400 malaria cases reported in 1998 were imported. The infection rate increased by 40% between 1970 and 1997. Malaria is caused by a parasite spread by mosquitoes, with no vaccine available. Treatment is challenging due to drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. Assistance for malaria prevention, treatment, control, and elimination is addressed in Section 3. Congress recognizes the international problem of malaria, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and its negative interaction with HIV and tuberculosis. The Administrator of USAID is directed to coordinate with federal officials and organizations to develop comprehensive malaria prevention programs in recipient countries, aligning efforts with HIV and tuberculosis control activities. Authorization of $50,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 to prevent and control HIV and tuberculosis internationally. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should coordinate with federal officials to ensure financial assistance promotes public health in recipient countries. Information on vaccine and therapeutic development for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis should be provided to recipient countries. The Agency for International Development should provide recipient countries with information on clinical trials for vaccines and therapeutic agents for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Administrator should also consider the interaction among the epidemics of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis when providing financial and technical assistance."
