    "content": "The \"Hiring Incentives to Reinvest and Incentivize New Growth Act of 2010\" or the \"HIRING Act of 2010\" includes a refundable credit for increasing employment under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"HIRING Act of 2010\" offers a credit against taxes for increased wages paid in 2010 and 2011. Quarterly advance payments of the credit are also provided to employers. The \"HIRING Act of 2010\" provides a tax credit for increased wages paid in 2010 and 2011. Quarterly advance payments of the credit are available to employers based on a percentage of wages paid compared to the previous year. If payments are received, the tax for the year will be increased by the total amount of the credits. The \"HIRING Act of 2010\" offers a tax credit for increased wages in 2010 and 2011, with quarterly advance payments available to employers. Any increase in tax due to the credit is not considered tax imposed by the chapter for credit calculation purposes. Claims must be filed within the specified time limits, and interest may apply if the Secretary has not paid out a filed claim. If the Secretary does not pay a claim within 45 days (20 days for electronic claims), it will be paid with interest. The total wages for the tax credit cannot exceed a certain limit, and inflation-adjusted wages are considered for this purpose. The term 'inflation-adjusted wages' refers to aggregate wages increased by an inflation percentage. The inflation percentage is 3 percent for 2009 and 5 percent for 2010. The term 'wages' is defined as the amount of compensation that does not exceed the median household income in the United States for the previous calendar year, with special rules for railway labor. Adjustments may be made for certain acquisitions after December 31, 2008. After December 31, 2008, if an employer acquires a major portion of a trade or business from another person, the wages deemed paid by the employer before the acquisition will be increased by the wages paid by the predecessor for the acquired portion. This rule also applies to dispositions after December 31, 2008. After December 31, 2008, if an employer disposes of a major portion of a trade or business, the amount of wages deemed paid by the employer before the disposition will be decreased by the wages attributable to the disposed trade or business. The text discusses how a change in status from self-employed to an employee can impact the determination of the credit allowable for a taxable year. If an individual has net earnings from self-employment in one year and becomes an employee in the following year, the employer's aggregate wages for the initial year will be increased by a certain amount of the individual's net earnings. The text outlines rules for determining the credit allowable for a taxable year, including conditions related to median household income, remuneration for trade or business employment, treatment of successor employers, and special rules for short taxable years. The text outlines rules for determining the credit allowable for a taxable year, including conditions related to median household income, remuneration for trade or business employment, treatment of successor employers, and special rules for short taxable years. Tax-exempt employers under section 501(a) are treated as taxpayers for this section and section 6402. Amendments are made to section 280C and other related sections for consistency. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009. The Secretary of the Treasury will work with State Employment Security Agencies to inform businesses about the availability of the credit."
