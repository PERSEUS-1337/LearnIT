    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing Over-Classification Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the over-classification of homeland security information, as highlighted by the 9/11 Commission, hinders accurate sharing of information, increases security costs, and limits public access. This problem has worsened since the 9/11 attacks, causing confusion internally at the Department of Homeland Security and with external partners, impacting the dissemination of homeland security information. Excessive government secrecy hinders the dissemination of homeland security information to various partners and the public. The Department should make all unclassified information available to the public to improve transparency and security. The Department should develop policies to promote compliance with classification markings and National Archives policies. SEC. 210F. OVER-CLASSIFICATION PREVENTION PROGRAM is added to Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to prevent over-classification within the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with developing policies to prevent over-classification of sensitive information related to homeland security, terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction. Coordination with various government and private sector entities is required for this purpose. The Secretary of Homeland Security must create standard formats for intelligence products, ensure they are prepared in both classified and unclassified formats, and make unclassified products available to relevant government and emergency response entities. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish policies, procedures, and programs to protect national security and privacy rights of US persons. An ongoing auditing mechanism must be implemented to ensure compliance. The senior Department official periodically selects classified information to assess compliance with classification policies, identify issues, recommend training improvements, and report annually to the House Committee on Homeland Security. The Department must report findings of audits to relevant committees, allow employees to challenge classification decisions, warn of penalties for non-compliance, and establish penalties for violations. The Department will establish penalties for employees and contractors who repeatedly fail to comply with policies, procedures, and programs after receiving notice and training. The term 'finished intelligence product' is defined as a document where an analyst evaluates raw intelligence. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF OVER-CLASSIFICATION PREVENTION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by adding a new section: \"SEC. 210G. ENFORCEMENT OF OVER-CLASSIFICATION PREVENTION PROGRAMS.\" The Secretary is required to assess technologies for assigning electronic personal identification numbers to Department employees and contractors with classification authority to track classified documents, determine sharing circumstances, address over-classification issues, and assess the impact of any problems or misuse on information sharing. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan for a Department standard for electronic personal identification numbers for employees and contractors, provide the plan to relevant committees within 180 days of enactment, and coordinate training with the Archivist. The Secretary, in coordination with the Archivist, shall require annual training for Department employees and contractors with classification authority. Training includes educating them on creating classified intelligence products in a standard format simultaneously with unclassified versions. The Secretary mandates annual training for Department employees and contractors with classification authority, focusing on the proper use of classification markings and consequences of over-classification. The Department requires annual training for employees and contractors with classification authority to ensure proper use of markings and avoid non-compliance with policies, with consequences for personnel evaluation and mission success. Successful completion serves as a prerequisite for obtaining and renewing classification authority. The Department implements a detailee program for personnel to be detailed to the National Archives and Records Administration for training and educational purposes. The Department implements a program to educate personnel on classification authorities, oversight, and consistency with Archivist policies. The program includes individuals with classification authority in each office and coordinates with the Archivist. The Department, in coordination with the Archivist, will report to Congress on expanding a detailee program to other departments, along with the costs involved. The program will cease on December 31, 2012, unless specified otherwise by law. SEC. 5. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT. The table of contents in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include new items related to over-classification prevention programs. Passed the House of Representatives on July 30, 2008."
