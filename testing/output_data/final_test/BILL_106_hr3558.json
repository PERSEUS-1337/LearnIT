    "content": "The \"Safe Pipelines Act of 2000\" requires all individuals responsible for operating and maintaining pipeline facilities to be tested and certified by the Secretary. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for corrosion testing. SEC. 3. CORROSION TESTING.\n\nThe Secretary must require pipeline operators with internal inspection devices to test for corrosion and anomalies every 5 years and share the results with the public.\n\nSEC. 4. NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS. SEC. 4. NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS. Amends Section 60102(h)(1) of title 49, United States Code to include notification requirements for spills of more than 40 gallons and pipeline ruptures. Section 60108 of title 49, United States Code is amended to include requirements for hydrostatic testing of covered pipeline facilities. The operator must conduct initial testing within 30 days of becoming a covered facility and repeat the testing at least once every 5 years. The operator of a covered pipeline facility must conduct hydrostatic testing once every 5 years. The Secretary may approve alternative testing methods upon request, excluding high-risk pipelines. A list of high-risk pipelines must be provided within 90 days. The Secretary must establish a list of high-risk pipelines within 90 days of enactment. Pipelines with multiple reportable leaks due to corrosion or external forces in the past 3 years will be included. The Secretary will maintain a list of high-risk pipelines that have experienced reportable leaks due to corrosion or defects in the past 3 to 5 years, excluding leaks during hydrostatic tests. The Secretary will maintain a list of high-risk pipelines with reportable leaks due to corrosion or defects in the past 3 to 5 years. A pipeline facility on the list remains for 5 years from the last leak. The length of a pipeline with more than 2 termini is the longest distance between any 2 termini. A covered pipeline facility is one not under certification or agreement. A covered pipeline facility must have been in operation for 10 years or more or be on the Secretary's list of high-risk pipelines. The Secretary is required to make pipeline maps available online by October 1, 2000. Additionally, authority can be delegated to states. Chapter 601 of title 49, United States Code, allows states to administer their own pipeline safety standards for interstate pipelines by submitting a program proposal to the Secretary of Transportation for approval. The program must demonstrate adequate legal authority to carry out the proposed standards. No State program can have standards less stringent than Federal regulations. The Secretary must approve each program within 90 days of submission, unless the State lacks resources or expertise, or the program compromises safety. If a State fails to administer an approved program correctly, the Secretary can withdraw approval after a public hearing. If corrective action is not taken within 90 days, the Secretary can withdraw program approval after notifying the State in writing. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on the effectiveness of external leak detection systems for pipelines and report the results to Congress by October 1, 2000. Additionally, cost-benefit analyses of National Transportation Safety Board recommendations classified as \"open\" must be completed within 2 years. SEC. 10. The Secretary of Transportation will study the effectiveness of double-walled pipelines in preventing ruptures and leaks and report the findings to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study to determine the optimal minimum burial depth of underground pipelines to prevent hazardous material release. Within 1 year of the Act's enactment, a report on the study results will be submitted to Congress, along with proposed rulemaking to modify pipeline burial depth regulations."
