    "content": "The federal government's real property portfolio includes over 2.8 billion square feet of building space, 496,000 structures, and 42 million acres of land, acquired over decades to support agencies' missions. As agencies' needs change, some assets become less useful or unneeded, such as the shift in VA healthcare from hospital-based care to outpatient clinics and DOD's reduction in force leading to base closures. In FY2016, federal agencies owned 3,120 vacant buildings and 7,859 partially empty buildings. Agencies struggle to dispose of unneeded space due to legal and budgetary constraints, leading to real property management being on the high-risk list since 2003. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has listed real property management as high-risk since 2003 due to thousands of unutilized or underutilized properties in the government's inventory. Efforts to dispose of these properties are hindered by statutory requirements, costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Agencies must continuously survey and report excess property they no longer need. Agencies must report excess property to GSA for disposal, following regulations and statutory requirements. Excess properties are offered to federal agencies first, then to state and local governments or nonprofits for public use. Agencies may convey surplus properties to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for public benefit at less than fair market value. Surplus properties not used for public benefit are sold at fair market value or demolished. Statutory requirements, such as the McKinney-Vento Act, can slow down the disposition process, leading to increased operating costs for agencies. Public benefit conveyance requirements are set in law, agencies cannot skip screening even for surplus properties that may need to be demolished. This adds up to six months to the disposal process and forces agencies to pay maintenance costs. Environmental and historic preservation statutes also contribute to delays, requiring agencies to assess environmental consequences and develop abatement plans. The National Historic Preservation Act mandates disposal actions that minimize harm to historic properties. Federal agencies must take actions to minimize harm to historic properties, including consulting with preservation groups. Unneeded buildings in their portfolio may require costly repairs and renovations to meet standards and preservation requirements. The poor condition of these properties can deter buyers or lessees, leading agencies to consider retaining rather than disposing of them. Demolishing vacant buildings can also incur high deconstruction and cleanup costs, sometimes exceeding maintenance costs in the short term. Federal agencies often struggle to dispose of unneeded real property due to various obstacles, such as conflicting stakeholder agendas and opposition from communities and veterans groups. These conflicts can lead to delays or cancellations of disposal plans, preventing agencies from reducing their inventories of unneeded properties. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data on agency real property portfolios, which may be inaccurate. Agencies sometimes lease space instead of seeking funding for new construction, even if it is more costly in the long run. The FRPP is the primary source of information on real property controlled by executive branch agencies, with data collected from 24 major landholding agencies annually. Other agencies are encouraged, but not required, to report data to GSA. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data on agency real property portfolios, including excess and surplus properties. GSA historically has not allowed direct access to FRPP data by Congress, citing proprietary concerns. Limited FRPP data is made public through annual summary reports on GSA's website, but these reports may not be sufficient for congressional oversight. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data is limited and not provided agency-by-agency, hindering congressional oversight. GAO audits have found unreliable data on real property, including inaccurate reporting by agencies and missing key data elements like maintenance needs and utilization rates. The GAO report found that problems with FRPP data collection lead to agencies making real property decisions using unreliable data. Data quality issues stem from changing definitions, with inconsistencies in reporting underutilized and not utilized buildings. The number of such buildings reported decreased significantly from FY2010 to FY2014, prompting GAO concerns. The GAO found that the FRPC's data on underutilized and not utilized federal real property is unreliable, leading to concerns about agencies making decisions based on inaccurate information. The annual summary reports lack important data on excess and surplus properties, including their operating costs, which Congress has expressed interest in. The government's reliance on costly leased space contributes to federal real property being designated as a \"high risk\" issue by GAO. The GAO designates federal real property as a \"high risk\" issue due to the government's reliance on costly leased space. Leasing is often more expensive than owning, as seen in a case where a long-term lease cost $40.3 million more than purchasing the same building. Agencies may choose to lease due to operational needs or budget scoring rules, even if it's not the most cost-effective option. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 requires agencies to have upfront budget authority for total legal commitments before acquiring space. Leasing is favored over construction or purchase due to lower initial funding requirements. Some agencies have independent leasing authority, like USPS and VA, with varying levels of real property expertise. The SEC's $557 million lease was criticized for being a costly misstep. The SEC's inspector general criticized the agency for poor leasing decisions, acquiring three times more space than needed and bypassing closer and cheaper locations. Real property disposition is typically decentralized among federal agencies, with varying levels of authority and methods for disposal. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA, P.L. 114-287) centralizes the disposal process for federal assets, with a newly created board making recommendations for disposal. The act applies to all federal executive branch agencies and government corporations, excluding properties on military installations, Coast Guard properties, and those outside the United States maintained by certain departments. Indian and Native Alaskan tribe properties, USPS properties, and Tennessee Valley Authority properties are also excluded. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA, P.L. 114-287) centralizes the disposal process for federal assets, excluding properties on military installations, Coast Guard properties, and those outside the United States. The Tennessee Valley Authority properties are also excluded. Agencies must develop recommendations for reducing unused space and operating costs, categorizing properties for sale, transfer, exchange, consolidation, relocation, redevelopment, reconfiguration, or outleasing. Data on each property's age, condition, operating costs, sustainability metrics, square footage, and federal employees working there must be submitted to GSA and OMB within 120 days of each fiscal year. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) requires agencies to recommend realignment options for federal properties, such as sale, redevelopment, or outleasing. Criteria for realignment must consider factors like value, cost reduction, mission alignment, and space utilization. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) mandates agencies to recommend realignment options for federal properties based on factors like value, cost reduction, mission alignment, and space utilization. Criteria for realignment include maximizing utilization rate, potential costs and savings, reducing long-term space leasing, consolidating similar operations, economic impact on communities, and reducing energy consumption. The OMB Director must submit revised recommendations and criteria to a Public Buildings Reform Board for review. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) establishes a Public Buildings Reform Board composed of a chairperson and six members appointed by the President. The board must include members with expertise in commercial real estate, space optimization, and community development. Each member serves a six-year term, and the board itself terminates six years from the date FASTA was enacted. The board reviews recommendations from the OMB but can perform an independent review of agency inventories and make its own decisions. The Public Buildings Reform Board, established by the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016, is required to independently review agency inventories, develop an accounting system, and consider proposals from state and local officials and the private sector. The board must hold public hearings, identify high-value federal properties to sell, with a total estimated fair market value between $500 million and $750 million. The Public Buildings Reform Board, established by the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016, must identify high-value federal properties with a total estimated fair market value of $500 million to $750 million for sale. The board's recommendations must be submitted to the OMB Director for review and approval, with a report to be published by GAO on the methodology used for property realignment. The OMB Director has 30 days to review and report to Congress on the decision to approve or disapprove the recommendations. The OMB Director must review and approve the Public Buildings Reform Board's recommendations for high-value federal properties worth $500 million to $750 million. If approved, federal agencies must implement the recommendations within six years in consultation with GSA. If disapproved, the board can submit revised recommendations for approval. FASTA amends McKinney-Vento by shortening the screening and application process for properties suitable for providing services to the homeless. The Comptroller is required to oversee the implementation of the recommendations for high-value federal properties. The FASTA act requires the Comptroller General to monitor federal agencies' implementation activities and report findings to Congress. Recommendations for property disposal with hazardous materials must comply with environmental laws and be certified by the disposing agency's head. The FASTA act requires federal agencies to certify property disposal with hazardous materials to ensure compliance with environmental laws. The disposing agency must provide information on environmental activities to the property recipient. Additionally, FASTA established funds for administrative costs and recommended actions implementation. The FASTA act established the proceeds and space management fund (APSMF) for implementing recommended actions. The APSMF receives funds from appropriations and proceeds from real property sales as per board recommendations. Funds in the APSMF account are solely for implementing board recommendations. Federal agencies can retain net proceeds from property disposal for further disposal activities or deficit reduction. The FASTA act requires the establishment of a comprehensive database of federal real property, including details like size, location, utilization level, operating costs, and replacement value. The database must be accessible to federal agencies and the public for free. FASTA aims to improve real property disposal processes and oversight, although there are potential drawbacks. The FASTA process enhances oversight of real property disposal by incorporating various perspectives from agencies and government-wide review by GSA and OMB. This allows for identifying opportunities for consolidation, cost reduction, and applying new ideas across multiple agencies. The Public Buildings Reform Board provides a diverse perspective on warehouse maintenance costs, potentially identifying opportunities for the government to sell properties that agencies may not have considered marketable. This diversity of expertise may lead to disagreements between OMB and the board on recommendations. The Public Buildings Reform Board may face disagreements with the OMB Director over disposal methods, potentially leading to the termination of the FASTA disposal process. Congress indirectly influences FASTA recommendations through board appointees, which may reduce local stakeholder pressure. However, keeping Congress at a distance could disadvantage it relative to the executive branch in the recommendation process. The OMB Director collaborates with GSA to develop recommendations for the board, with the authority to approve or disapprove them. Congress has only an indirect role in the process, as they cannot vote on recommendations under FASTA. FASTA streamlines the disposal process by exempting properties from lengthy screening requirements, reducing unnecessary costs for agencies. FASTA allows agencies to dispose of unneeded properties more efficiently. The board can recommend conveyances, which can be reviewed by HUD for potential use in assisting the homeless. The OMB Director can exclude properties for use by state or local governments. Centralizing conveyance decisions may reduce properties available to governments and nonprofits. FASTA does not prioritize any disposal method. FASTA allows agencies to dispose of unneeded properties more efficiently by recommending sales instead of conveyances to state or local governments and nonprofits. Funding for disposals is provided through appropriations and property sales. The board must recommend the sale of at least five properties with a fair market value of $500 million to $750 million, even if agencies have not declared them as unneeded. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act (FASTA) allows agencies to efficiently dispose of excess properties through sales rather than conveyances to state or local governments. The act requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to establish a real property database for oversight and policymaking. However, the database lacks detailed sales proceeds data and information on repair needs, hindering the disposal process. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act (FASTA) aims to dispose of excess properties efficiently through sales rather than conveyances to state or local governments. Congress may benefit from agency repair estimates reported for each building to inform funding decisions. Comparing leasing costs to building or buying costs could enhance oversight of long-term operating leases. GAO has identified federal real property management as a high-risk area due to the government's increasing reliance on leases over constructing or purchasing buildings. The prospectus approval process allows Congress to oversee GSA's lease decisions before seeking appropriations. The General Services Administration (GSA) must obtain congressional authorization for real property projects exceeding a certain cost threshold. GSA submits detailed prospectuses to the Senate and House committees for approval before receiving appropriations. Congressional oversight of GSA's lease proposals is crucial due to its extensive portfolio. However, the effectiveness of the prospectus approval process as an oversight tool may be limited. The approval process for GSA leases may lack oversight as comparative cost data is not required to be presented to Congress. Mandating the inclusion of such data in prospectuses could improve oversight. GSA used to include cost comparisons in the past but discontinued it in the mid-1990s due to limited funding for construction alternatives."
