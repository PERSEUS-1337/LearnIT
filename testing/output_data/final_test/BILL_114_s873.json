He studied petroleum engineering at Penn State University and served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot during World War II. After the war, he worked as a Bush pilot, trapper, guide, and laborer in Alaska. Hammond later earned a degree in biological sciences from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and worked as a biologist and field agent. Hammond worked as a biologist, field agent, and hunter for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In Southwest Alaska, he conducted predator and prey studies on caribou, counted brown bears at McNeil River, and recorded Black Brant geese at Izembek Bay. He later cruised Lake Clark counting wildlife and found a future homestead site. In 1959, Hammond won election to the Alaska State House of Representatives as an independent, later switching to the Republican party. He then served as a State senator and mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough before being drafted to run for Governor of Alaska in 1974. In 1974, Hammond won the Alaska Governor election by defeating Walter J. Hickel in the primary and William A. Egan in the general election. The campaign focused on oil leasing, salmon fisheries, and state overspending. Hammond won the Republican primary by 7,874 votes and the general election by a slim margin of 221 votes after 2 recounts. In 1978, Hammond narrowly defeated Walter J. Hickel in the Republican primary by 98 votes, the closest margin in Alaska's history. He then went on to win the general election against Hickel and Democrat Chancy Croft by 16,000 votes. As Governor, Hammond oversaw the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, championed the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, and authored the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend program. He also secured approval for a constitutional budget reserve. As Governor, Hammond championed agricultural development in Interior Alaska, oversaw the purchase of the Alaska Railroad by the State, opposed the construction of a proposed Ramparts hydroelectric dam on the Yukon River, supported the creation of a 200-mile fisheries zone off the coast of the State, and oversaw the creation of the largest State park in the United States, the Wood Tikchik State Park. In 1980, as Governor, oversaw the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which dissolved 120,000,000 acres of Alaska into protected status and designated 104,000,000 acres of land for various conservation purposes. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 designated 5,500,000 acres in 14 new units of the National Wilderness Preservation System, added over 40,000,000 acres in 10 new units of the National Park System, and increased the number of units in the National Wildlife Refuge System to 19, covering 76,800,000 acres in the state. Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 designated 5,500,000 acres in new wilderness units, added 40,000,000 acres to National Park System, and expanded National Wildlife Refuge System to cover 76,800,000 acres in the state. Hammond, a writer and poet, donated collection to University of Alaska Library Archives, wrote books on Alaska, and died in 2005 at age 83 after surviving 5 plane crashes. Hammond survived 5 plane crashes and numerous close calls with death, including a fire at Lake Clark. He was survived by his wife, Bella, and daughters Heidi, Dana, and Wendy. Hammond was known for bipartisan alliances and close friendships with colleagues and staff members. The designation of 2,600,000 acres of wilderness in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve would honor the legacy of Jay Hammond, a respected public servant known for his bipartisan alliances and close relationships with his staff. The approximately 2,600,000 acres of National Wilderness Preservation System land within Lake Clark National Park and Preserve will be designated as the \"Jay S. Hammond Wilderness Area\". Any reference to this wilderness area in US laws or records will now be known as the \"Jay S. Hammond Wilderness Area\"."
