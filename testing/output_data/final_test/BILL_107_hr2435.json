Congress finds that information technology systems are crucial for various sectors and need protection against attacks. Private sector solutions driven by the market are the best way to safeguard these systems. The government should collaborate with industry on a voluntary basis to enhance cyber security without mandating specific technologies or imposing unnecessary costs. Prompt and secure information exchange would improve cyber security for both private and public entities, reducing financial risks and protecting critical elements of the economy. The government should collaborate with industry on a voluntary basis to enhance cyber security without mandating specific technologies or imposing unnecessary costs. Concern about legal liability associated with cyber security information exchange has impeded secure practices. This is crucial for minimizing cyber security-related disruptions to critical infrastructure and protecting the economy and national security. The secure disclosure and protected exchange of cyber security information is crucial for private and public entities to address cyber security needs in a timely manner. Uniform legal standards are needed to promote appropriate disclosures and exchanges of information. The National Plan for Information Systems Protection aims to enhance cyber security without imposing unnecessary costs. The National Plan for Information Systems Protection, Version 1.0, released by the President on January 7, 2000, aims to promote secure disclosure and exchange of cyber security information, assist in responding to cyber security problems, and establish legal principles to lessen burdens on interstate commerce. The National Plan for Information Systems Protection, Version 1.0, aims to establish legal principles for secure disclosure and exchange of cyber security information to protect legitimate users and privacy.

The term \"cyber security information\" refers to data related to the ability of protected systems or critical infrastructure to withstand intentional interference or unauthorized access that violates laws and threatens public safety or interstate commerce. The term \"cyber security information\" includes assessments, projections, testing, risk assessments, audits, operational issues, solutions, and immediate threats related to the cyber security of protected systems or critical infrastructure. The term \"cyber security information\" excludes information filed with securities regulators or accompanying securities solicitations. A \"protected system\" includes systems affecting critical infrastructure facilities. An Information Sharing Organization (ISO) is an entity created by private sector organizations to share cyber security information among themselves and with government agencies. SEC. 4. PROTECTION FOR CYBER SECURITY INFORMATION SHARED WITH THE GOVERNMENT. Cyber security information voluntarily provided to any Federal entity, agency, or authority shall be protected against disclosure. This includes information provided directly to the government about its own cyber security, a third party's cyber security, or to an ISO that is then shared with the government. Such information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act without the provider's consent. Cyber security information disclosed to Federal entities is protected from third-party disclosure and cannot be used in civil actions. Exemptions apply to private entities sharing information with government agencies, exempting them from certain disclosure requirements. Exceptions to the restrictions on cyber security information disclosure include obtaining information through independent legal authorities, public disclosure, and sharing third-party information with private entities. The entity, agency, or authority must notify the third party of received information, except if there is probable cause of economic espionage or support from a nation under a trade embargo. SEC. 5. ANTITRUST EXEMPTION. The antitrust laws do not apply to conduct related to cybersecurity problem-solving or information sharing. Exception for agreements involving boycotts, market allocation, or price fixing. SEC. 6. CYBER SECURITY WORKING GROUPS. The President may establish working groups of Federal employees to address cyber security, share information, and serve the purposes of this Act. A list of these groups will be maintained and made public, with a point of contact for each. Participation among the working groups will be balanced, and meetings will be announced in advance. The working groups established under this section will have procedures announced in advance by the President. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to these groups, and there is no private right of action to enforce any provision of this section."
