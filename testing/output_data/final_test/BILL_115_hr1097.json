The \"Unsubscribe Act of 2017\" prohibits entering into negative option agreements online without providing consumers with a cancellation mechanism. It also makes it illegal to charge a consumer's financial account for goods or services in a free-to-pay conversion contract without their express consent. The \"Unsubscribe Act of 2017\" requires that consumers be notified of contract terms, including receiving goods or services for free initially and being charged later. Consumers must also take an affirmative action to consent to the charges before they are applied. The \"Unsubscribe Act of 2017\" mandates notifications for free-to-pay conversion contracts and automatic renewal contracts entered into online. Consumers must receive notifications of contract terms on a quarterly basis and before the end of the initial fixed period, respectively. The Federal Trade Commission may create regulations to enforce the \"Unsubscribe Act of 2017,\" requiring notifications of contract terms for free-to-pay conversion and automatic renewal contracts entered online. Consumers must receive notifications quarterly and before the end of the initial fixed period.
