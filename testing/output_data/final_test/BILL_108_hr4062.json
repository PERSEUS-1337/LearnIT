    "content": "The authorization for programs under the Small Business Act and Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is extended through June 4, 2004. Fee authorizations under the Small Business Investment Act are extended to October 1, 2004. Purchase and guarantee authority for fiscal year 2004 under Title III of the Small Business Investment Act is also addressed. Section 20 of the Small Business Act is amended to authorize $4 billion in purchases of participating securities and $3 billion in guarantees of debentures for fiscal year 2004 under Title III of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. During the specified period, a new paragraph on combination financing is added to the Small Business Act, defining it as a mix of a guaranteed loan and a commercial loan. This applies to small businesses obtaining loan guarantees. The Small Business Act now includes provisions for combination financing, which involves a mix of a guaranteed loan and a commercial loan for small businesses. The commercial loan obtained can be made by the participating lender or a different lender, secured by a senior lien, and may incur a one-time fee of 0.7 percent of the loan amount. The Administration may receive a fee of 0.7 percent of the commercial loan amount if the loan has a senior credit position. A guaranteed loan can be secured by a subordinated lien. The Administrator will process combination financing applications based on the program as of October 1, 2003. Small business eligibility standards for combination financing will remain in effect. The Administrator will apply existing standards to combination financings made under this paragraph. Any changes to these standards after the enactment date should not overly limit the availability of combination financing compared to before the modifications. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEE FEES. During a specified period, a temporary percentage fee of 0.5 percent is to be collected on guaranteed loans under the Small Business Act. During a specified period, a temporary fee of 0.36 percent will be collected on approved loans under the Small Business Act until September 30, 2004. Subparagraph (B) of section 7 of the Act will not be effective during this time. SEC. 6. EXPRESS LOAN PROVISIONS. Definitions for the Express Loan provisions include terms like \"express lender,\" \"Express Loan,\" \"Express Loan Pilot Program,\" \"Administrator,\" and \"small business concern.\" The term \"small business concern\" is defined under the Small Business Act. Only qualified lenders designated by the Administrator can make Express Loans. Existing lenders will keep their designation unless they violate laws or regulations. There is a temporary expansion of the Express Loan Pilot Program. The Express Loan Pilot Program's maximum loan amount is temporarily increased to $2,000,000 until September 30, 2004. The Administrator retains the authority to operate the program after October 1, 2004. No regulatory changes will be made without proper notification. The notification under section 7(a)(24) of the Small Business Act imposes requirements on lenders for Express Loans, limits terms for deferred participation loans, restricts staff reallocation affecting loan processing times, and provides incentives or disincentives. The Administrator must collect data on loans over $250,000 made under the Express Loan Pilot Program and report monthly to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. Subsections (b), (c), (e), and (f) will expire after September 30, 2004. SEC. 7. Fiscal year 2004 deferred participation standards state that loans made under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act until September 30, 2004, shall have the same terms as those on October 1, 2003. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration can take necessary actions to maintain the loan program. SEC. 8. Temporary increase in loan limit under the Business Loan and Investment Fund is also mentioned. During the period from enactment to September 30, 2004, the Small Business Act allows for a temporary increase in the loan amount to $1,500,000. Additionally, a 0.25 percent guarantee fee is collected on deferred participation shares exceeding $1,000,000 for loans made during this period. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \n\"Speaker of the House of Representatives. Vice President of the United States and President of the Senate.\""
