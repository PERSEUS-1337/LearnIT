    "content": "The Act titled \"Guardsmen and Reservist Employer Tax Act of 2003\" introduces a new section called \"RESERVE COMPONENT EMPLOYMENT CREDIT\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, offering a credit for the employment of reserve component personnel. The \"RESERVE COMPONENT EMPLOYMENT CREDIT\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a credit for employing qualified reserve component personnel, including a self-employment credit for qualified self-employed individuals. The employment credit is based on the difference between a qualified employee's average daily compensation and military pay while on reserve duty. The \"RESERVE COMPONENT EMPLOYMENT CREDIT\" provides a credit for employing qualified reserve component personnel, based on the difference between average daily compensation and military pay while on reserve duty. The \"average daily military pay and allowances\" is the amount paid to a qualified employee for participating in qualified reserve component duty, divided by the total number of days spent on duty, including travel time. The term \"qualified compensation\" refers to compensation paid to a qualified employee for participating in reserve component duty, excluding vacation, holiday, sick leave, or other forms of pay. The term \"qualified compensation\" refers to pay for reserve component duty, excluding vacation, sick leave, or other forms of pay. A \"qualified employee\" is someone who has been employed for 21 days before participating in reserve duty. The self-employment credit for a qualified self-employed taxpayer is based on their average daily self-employment income minus the average daily military pay and allowances received while participating in qualified reserve component duty. The self-employment credit is calculated based on the taxpayer's average daily self-employment income and military pay received during qualified reserve component duty. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in qualified reserve component duty, divided by the total number of days spent on duty, including travel time. A 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' is someone who meets specific criteria related to self-employment and military duty. A qualified self-employed taxpayer is defined as someone with net earnings from self-employment and is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The employment credit provided is in addition to any deduction for compensation paid to a qualified employee during qualified reserve component duty, with a maximum credit of $25,000 per qualified employee. The limitation on the employment credit applies to all members of a controlled group, with allocations determined by the Secretary. Disallowance may occur for failure to comply with employment rights of reserve component members. The reemployment rights of reserve component members of the armed forces are restricted for taxpayers under certain conditions, including being under a final order from a district court for a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code. Additionally, no credit is allowed for taxpayers when the individual eligible for the credit is called to active duty for training. The term 'allowable' refers to being called to active duty for training under specific provisions of title 10 and title 32 of the United States Code, or full-time National Guard duty. 'Military pay' and 'allowances' are defined as per title 37 of the United States Code. The term 'qualified reserve component duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency operation. Participants must not engage in normal employment or self-employment duties during this duty, except when on authorized leave. During qualified reserve component duty, individuals must not engage in normal employment or self-employment activities, except during authorized leave. Rules similar to other sections apply. Amendments are made to the general business credit section. Amendments are made to the general business credit section by adding a new paragraph for the reserve component employment credit under section 45G(a). A clerical amendment is also made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. Effective Date: The amendments for reserve component employment credit apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
