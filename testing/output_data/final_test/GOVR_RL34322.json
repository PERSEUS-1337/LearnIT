This has been achieved through arms sales, military training, and interventions in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The United States has prioritized stability in the Persian Gulf region by supporting allied governments and ensuring the free flow of oil and gas. This includes arms sales, military training, and interventions in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The GCC members aim to resolve internal issues, coordinate security cooperation, and minimize external intervention. U.S. military posture in the Gulf region in the 1990s focused on containing threats from Iraq and Iran, while later efforts addressed weapons of mass destruction. The strategic environment has become more complex with the rise of terrorist networks, the removal of Saddam Hussein, and the strengthening of Iran. The Gulf Security Dialogue was established in 2006 to enhance U.S.-GCC defense cooperation. The Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) was established in May 2006 to enhance U.S.-GCC defense cooperation and address emerging terrorism and proliferation threats. It serves as the principal security coordination mechanism between the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council, focusing on improving defense capabilities, regional security issues, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, critical infrastructure protection, and Iraq. The Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) was established in May 2006 to enhance U.S.-GCC defense cooperation and address emerging terrorism and proliferation threats. It serves as a forum for U.S. officials and their counterparts in participating GCC countries to discuss bilateral and multilateral initiatives in defense capabilities, regional security, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, critical infrastructure protection, and Iraq. The GSD discussions are led by Assistant Secretaries in the Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, with ongoing bilateral consultations at the working level. The Dialogue does not replace bilateral arrangements but complements them. The Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) aims to enhance U.S.-GCC defense cooperation and address terrorism and proliferation threats. It promotes multilateral cooperation and complements bilateral arrangements. U.S. policymakers seek to balance the benefits of a military presence in the Persian Gulf with the costs, supporting intra-GCC and GCC-U.S. cooperation to reduce regional dependence on U.S. forces. The United States has backed initiatives like the Peninsula Shield force and the GCC \"Belt of Cooperation\" air space monitoring network. The Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) aims to enhance U.S.-GCC defense cooperation and address terrorism and proliferation threats. The establishment of the GCC \"Belt of Cooperation\" air space monitoring network and the promotion of bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the GCC countries have been ongoing trends in U.S. foreign policy. Changes in the regional security environment have led to an evolution in the focus of U.S. engagement with the GCC countries, with an emphasis on counterterrorism and counter-proliferation efforts alongside conventional military cooperation. Increased emphasis is now being placed on counter-proliferation efforts and conventional military cooperation in U.S.-GCC dialogue. U.S. policy makers may be concerned that existing initiatives are not sufficient to address transnational threats effectively. Discussions on securing key energy infrastructure sites in the Gulf region have been prompted by terrorist threats and attempted attacks, despite historic sensitivities. Efforts to promote security cooperation between GCC countries and the U.S. have faced significant challenges. The GCC countries face challenges in security cooperation and policy responses to transnational threats. Some leaders are hesitant to fully embrace integrated responses, while maintaining outreach to Iran. They support initiatives for Iraq but Sunni Arab governments may limit engagement based on perceptions. The GCC countries may limit engagement with the Iraqi government due to sectarian interests. Intra-governmental politics hinder joint military and interagency consultations. U.S. national security priorities include stability in the Persian Gulf, terrorism threats, Iranian investments in ballistic missile technology, and growing interest in Gulf security from China, Russia, and India. Congress may influence U.S. foreign policy towards GCC countries through funding programs under the Gulf Security Dialogue and evaluating arms sale proposals. The Administration has proposed arms sales to enhance defense capabilities of GCC countries under the Gulf Security Dialogue. Congressional concerns about Israel's military advantage may persist, with evaluations of arms sale proposals in relation to new U.S. objectives in the changing security environment. Details of arms sale proposals to GCC countries notified to Congress are included in the Appendix. Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar-days before the Administration can conclude a government-to-government Foreign Military Sale of certain equipment or services. The sale of Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) technology to Saudi Arabia raised Congressional concerns in 2007. JDAM is a GPS satellite-aided guidance kit that enhances bombing accuracy for conventional bombs. The sale of JDAM kits to foreign countries has raised concerns due to their potential use as offensive weapons. The kits require accurate target coordinates, GPS capability, and an operational test and evaluation plan for successful use. The United States has sold JDAM kits to Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman in the Middle East region. Congress must be formally notified before concluding a government-to-government Foreign Military Sale under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act. Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Congress must be notified 30 days before finalizing a foreign military sale of major defense equipment to a non-NATO government valued at $14 million or more. This requirement applies to arms sales to GCC countries meeting specific value thresholds. Bahrain and Kuwait are major non-NATO allies, but this designation does not impact the notification process. The executive branch can proceed with arms sales unless Congress blocks it through a joint resolution under AECA procedures. Congress can block or modify a Presidential sale of military equipment by enacting specific legislation or a joint resolution disapproving it under AECA procedures. However, Congress must be able to pass legislation expressing its will on the sale and override a potential Presidential veto. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kohler predicted an increase in arms sales proposals related to the Gulf Security Dialogue in October 2006. Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD) is expected to lead to an increase in arms sales proposals involving the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in 2007. Lt. Gen. Kohler highlighted the importance of enhancing GCC countries' missile defense capabilities and discussed potential weapons sales such as border and maritime security equipment. The Administration has notified Congress of proposed arms sales, including Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) technology to Saudi Arabia, which has raised concerns among some Members of Congress. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the potential sale of JDAM technology to Saudi Arabia, citing worries about the protection of U.S. and allied forces in the Gulf region and Israel's military edge. The Administration notified Congress of a proposal to sell 900 JDAM kits to Saudi Arabia in January 2008, leading to objections from lawmakers who called for specific assurances before the sale proceeds. In August 2007, 114 Members of Congress expressed opposition to the proposed sale of high technology armaments to Saudi Arabia. In November 2007, Representative Mark Kirk and 186 other Members of Congress stated they would oppose the sale of JDAM kits unless assurances were provided to protect U.S. forces and Israel's military advantage. They also called for tight Congressional oversight and consultations with Israel. In November 2007, Representative Anthony Weiner and 116 other Members of Congress signed a letter to President Bush requesting a postponement of formal notification regarding proposals to sell high technology armaments to Saudi Arabia until January 15, 2008. The Administration assured the security and proper employment of precision guided munitions proposed for sale to Saudi Arabia in a response letter to Representative Mark Kirk. The response letter assured Congress that the sale of precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia would not affect Israel's military advantage. Representative Anthony Weiner introduced a resolution to prohibit the sale, but it was not considered by the House Foreign Affairs Committee within the review period. On January 15, Representatives Weiner and Wexler requested a vote on a resolution regarding the potential sale of JDAM technology to Saudi Arabia. The 30-day review period ended on February 14, 2008, allowing negotiations to proceed. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency presented a Letter of Offer and Acceptance to Saudi Arabia in May 2008, with deliveries of JDAM systems scheduled for 2011. Congress can block or modify arms sales up to the point of delivery. Senator Schumer introduced a resolution on May 13, 2008, to prohibit certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The issuance of a letter of offer for proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia is contingent on Saudi Arabia increasing its oil production by 1 million barrels per day. Representative Weiner introduced similar legislation in the House. Debate in Congress over weapons sales to GCC states, including Saudi Arabia, reflects past concerns about the security commitment to the region. Members express concerns about the fate of U.S. weaponry and threats to U.S. forces in the event of hostile regime changes. The debate over arms sales to Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, raises concerns about potential threats to U.S. forces in the event of hostile regime changes. Congress has sought assurances from the President regarding the security and use of weapons systems sold to Saudi Arabia, as outlined in the Arms Export Control Act. The Gulf states are considered too dependent on U.S. support to use sophisticated U.S.-made arms against the United States or its allies. The Arms Export Control Act allows the transfer of defense articles and services for specific purposes, including self-defense, participation in regional or collective arrangements, and economic development in less developed countries. The U.S. Government can prevent transfers by finding violations of defense sale agreements, suspending deliveries, or refusing new arms orders. In July 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert acknowledged receiving arms under this act. In July 2007, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that the United States had committed to ensuring Israel's military edge over Arab states. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak also expressed confidence in maintaining Israel's military superiority during a visit to Washington, DC in October 2007. Israel did not oppose proposed U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries, as they had arrangements with the U.S. administration to address their concerns. The United States has indicated its intention to provide Israel with advanced JDAM kits with enhanced laser guidance and anti-jamming capabilities. While Israeli leaders trust in U.S. commitments to maintain Israel's military superiority, there has been no confirmation of plans to sell more capable JDAM systems to Israel. Various arms sales proposals to GCC countries have been formally notified to Congress since August 1, 2007 under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency has provided details on the proposed sales, including notification transmittal numbers, estimated sale value, and notification dates to Congress.
