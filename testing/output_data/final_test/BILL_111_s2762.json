Congress finds that the designated wilderness and Special Management Areas are located at the headwaters of streams and rivers, with limited water resource facilities upstream. These lands are not suitable for new water development projects, ensuring the preservation of their wilderness values. The purpose of this section is to protect the wilderness values of designated lands by means other than Federal reserved water rights. Water resource facilities include irrigation, pumping facilities, reservoirs, and hydropower projects. The Act prohibits any claims to water rights in Colorado based on the Act's construction or land designations. It also states that the Act does not affect existing water rights. The Act clarifies that it does not impact any water rights of the United States in Colorado before the Act's enactment. It also specifies that the Act does not serve as an interpretation of any other Act or designation, nor does it set a precedent for future wilderness designations. The Act prohibits the funding, development, or enlargement of water resource facilities in specified areas. The Secretary must allow reasonable access to existing facilities, including motorized access on established routes. The Act allows existing water resource facilities in specified areas to be used, maintained, repaired, and replaced to preserve their function and operation without increasing adverse impacts on resources and values. Existing water resource facilities in specified areas must have vested water rights adjudicated before the enactment of the Act. The impact on water resources cannot be increased due to changes in the use of the facility. Maintenance and repair of existing facilities and access routes are necessary to prevent adverse impacts on the area's resources and values. Existing water resource facilities in specified areas must have vested water rights adjudicated before the enactment of the Act. Maintenance, repair, and monitoring of these facilities within designated wilderness areas are required to prevent adverse impacts on the area's resources and values.
