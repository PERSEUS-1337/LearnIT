    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of restoring healthy salmon and steelhead runs in the lower Columbia River, as they are crucial to the region's culture and economy. The Columbia River treaty tribes have significant rights related to these species, and efforts have been made by governments to assist in their recovery. One of the challenges facing salmonid populations is increased predation by marine mammals, such as California sea lions. The population of California sea lions has increased significantly over the last 3 decades, with over 1,000 sea lions entering the lower Columbia River during the peak spring salmonid run. The percentage of salmonid run eaten or killed by sea lions at Bonneville dam has also increased. Sea lions have been congregating near the dam and entering fish ladders, with some being unresponsive to hazing methods. The 1994 amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act established a process to address aggressive sea lion behavior near Bonneville dam. However, a more urgent and expedited procedure is needed to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in the Columbia River. The Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force recommended lethally removing more California sea lions in 2011 to safeguard the passage of salmonids. SEC. 3. Taking of California sea lions on the Columbia River or its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened species of salmon. Amendment to Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to allow temporary removal of California sea lions in the Columbia River or its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened salmon species. The Secretary has 90 days to determine the permit for lethal taking of California sea lions in the Columbia River to protect salmon species. Public comments are allowed within this period, and the decision will be published in the Federal Register. If the Secretary determines that alternative measures to reduce sea lion predation on salmonid stocks do not adequately protect the threatened or endangered species, an eligible entity may apply for a permit authorizing the lethal taking of California sea lions. The Secretary must approve or deny the application within 30 days. Multiple permits may be issued. The Secretary may issue multiple permits to an eligible entity for lethal taking of California sea lions. Each permit is valid for up to one year and can only be used once every 14 days. Consultation with other eligible entities and relevant entities like the Corps of Engineers is required before issuing a permit. The Secretary may issue multiple permits to eligible entities for lethal taking of California sea lions, with each permit valid for up to one year and allowing the lethal taking of up to 10 sea lions. A report on the implementation of the permits and their impact on Columbia River salmonid stocks and the California sea lion population must be published annually. The Secretary may issue permits for lethal taking of California sea lions, limited to 10 sea lions per permit annually. The total number of sea lions taken each year cannot exceed one percent of the annual potential biological removal level. Sea lions can only be taken if they have preyed upon salmonid stocks in the Columbia River. The Secretary may issue permits for lethal taking of California sea lions, limited to 10 sea lions per permit annually. Nonlethal alternative measures to prevent preying on salmonid stocks have generally not been effective. Permit holders must consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service and may consult with other Federal agencies. Washington and Oregon can delegate permit authority to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. The Secretary may designate the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission to administer permit authority for lethal taking of California sea lions. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to permits issued under this subsection for 3 years. The Secretary's permitting authority will terminate after 5 years or when lethal removal is no longer needed to protect salmonid stocks from sea lion predation. The Secretary of Commerce will submit a report to Congress within two years of the enactment of the Act on the need for potential legislation to address marine mammal predation on threatened or endangered fish species. Eligible entities include the State of Washington, the State of Oregon, and various Native American tribes. Sense of Congress: Nonlethal methods are preferred to prevent predation of salmonid stocks by sea lions in the Columbia River. Permit holders should be trained in wildlife management for lethal removal. The Federal Government should support nonlethal alternative measures for preventing predation."
