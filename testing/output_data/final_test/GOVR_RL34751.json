The retirement annuity is based on time served and basic pay, with annual adjustments for inflation. Military retirees also receive nonmonetary benefits such as TRICARE medical care and exchange privileges. The military retirement system provides a defined benefit pension based on time served and basic pay, with eligibility for commissary privileges, TRICARE medical care, and access to Morale, Welfare and Recreation facilities. The system aims to maintain a young and vigorous military force, ensure competitiveness with private-sector employers, provide a reserve pool of experienced manpower for emergencies, and offer economic security for retired members. Active duty personnel qualify for a monthly pension after 20 years of service, while reservists receive retired pay based on points and typically start at age 60. The military retirement system provides a defined benefit pension based on time served and basic pay. Active duty personnel qualify for a monthly pension after 20 years of service, while reservists receive retired pay based on points and typically start at age 60. Disability retirement offers options based on years of service or severity of disability. In FY2017, $53.5 billion was paid to 2 million military retirees and $3.9 billion to survivors. Congress faces challenges balancing constituent concerns and budget constraints regarding military retirement issues. Some argue military retirement is too generous, citing early eligibility and cost-saving modifications. Others defend it, citing the unique demands of military service and negative effects on recruiting and retention from past changes. The military retirement system has different systems for active duty members, reservists, and medically disabled individuals. Retirement pay calculations are based on entry date and pay base at retirement. Changes to the system are closely monitored by various groups. The defined benefit portion of the military retirement system cliff-vests after 20 years of service, with different methods for calculating retired pay based on longevity. Eligibility for disabled veterans is vested on their disability retirement date regardless of years of service. Active duty military personnel have four methods for calculating retired pay, including the Final Basic Pay System, \"High Three,\" Redux, and the Blended Retirement System (BRS). Eligibility for retirement is based on entry date, pay base at retirement, years of service, and choice of retirement system. Eligibility for military retirement calculations is determined based on entry date, pay base at retirement, years of service, and choice of retirement system. The Final Basic Pay cohort entered before September 8, 1980, with 30 years of service in 2010. Those entering service after September 8, 1980, and before January 1, 2018, can elect the High Three system for retired pay calculations. The Redux military retirement system, initiated in 1986, reduced retired pay for servicemembers entering after August 1, 1986. By 1997, concerns arose about recruiting and retention issues. In 1998, the Clinton Administration supported Redux repeal. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 repealed compulsory Redux, allowing post-August 1, 1986, entrants to choose the High Three system or Redux with an immediate $30,000. The FY2016 NDAA terminated the Redux option for military retirement. Servicemembers entering during the Redux period must choose between the High Three system or Redux with a $30,000 cash bonus. Those selecting the Career Status Bonus must serve 20 years or forfeit a portion of the bonus. Congress adopted a new retirement system based on recommendations from the MCRMC, transitioning to a blended defined benefit plus defined contribution system. The BRS is mandatory for servicemembers who entered the service on or after January 1, 2018, with a reduced multiplier of 2.0 for the defined benefit calculation. Retirees under this system would receive 40% of their pay base at 20 years of service and 60% at 30 years. Under the Blended Retirement System, a 30-year retiree would receive 60% of their pay base. Retirees can elect to receive a lump sum payment of their discounted retired pay, with the option to receive 100% of their monthly annuity after reaching the eligibility age for social security. The lump sum payment can be taken as a single payment or in up to four annual installments. Members under the BRS can choose to receive a discounted lump sum payment as a single payment or in up to four annual installments. This lump sum is considered earned income and is taxed accordingly. Reserve component members have the option to elect the lump sum from age 60 until the normal retirement age. Studies suggest that a small percentage of officers and a larger percentage of enlisted members will choose the lump sum option. The BRS includes a defined contribution element to address the issue of many military personnel not completing 20 years of service for retirement benefits. Starting January 1, 2018, servicemembers are automatically enrolled in the Thrift Savings Plan with a 3% individual contribution level, increasing to 4% with DOD matching. DOD matches servicemembers' contributions up to 4% of basic pay after two years of service. Servicemembers must contribute 5% to receive the 4% government match. They become fully vested after two years and can take ownership of contributions. New servicemembers are automatically enrolled in the TSP program unless they opt out. Congress authorized continuation pay for members between 8 to 12 years of service under the BRS, requiring a three-year service obligation. The pay can be given as a lump sum or in up to four payments. Active duty and reserve component members may receive a minimum continuation pay based on their monthly basic pay. The law authorizes continuation pay for military members between 8 to 12 years of service under the Blended Retirement System. Active duty members can receive continuation pay based on their monthly basic pay, with the option for an additional amount at the discretion of the Secretary concerned. Reserve component members within the eligibility window would also receive minimum continuation pay, plus an additional amount determined by the Service Secretary. This flexibility in continuation pay aims to aid force-shaping by offering higher payments to those in undermanned occupational specialties. The reserve retirement system requires 20 qualifying years of service for eligibility, accruing at a rate of 2.5% per equivalent year of service. The primary difference from the active system is the points system used for calculating qualifying years and the age of retirement annuity. Redux is not an option for reservists, with a qualifying year defined as earning at least 50 retirement points in the reserve component. Points are awarded for various reserve activities, such as active service, annual training, membership in the Ready Reserve, inactive duty training, funeral honors duty, and completion of military correspondence courses. A participating member of the selected reserve can accrue 50 points per year for retirement eligibility, with a maximum cap of 130 points per year. The total points, including active duty, cannot exceed 365 points annually. The number of points earned is crucial for determining qualifying service years and retired pay calculation. A reservist can retire after 20 years of qualifying service, with no minimum age requirement. However, retired pay usually starts at age 60, along with eligibility for military medical care. Upon retirement, reservists are transferred to the Retired Reserve and receive benefits like commissary privileges and access to military facilities. Time in the Retired Reserve counts towards higher retired pay. A reservist transitioning to the Retired Reserve at age 45 will have their retired pay at age 60 calculated based on a lieutenant colonel's basic pay with 15 years of longevity. The calculation method for retired pay depends on the date the reservist joined the armed forces, with options including Final Basic Pay, High Three, or the Blended Retirement System. Reservists with less than 12 equivalent years of service can elect the Blended Retirement System. The calculation process mirrors the active duty system but is adjusted for the part-time nature of reserve service. The calculation process for retired pay in the Retired Reserve mirrors the active duty system but is adjusted for the part-time nature of reserve service. For example, a reserve component lieutenant colonel with 5,000 points who joined the military in January 1980 and transferred to the Retired Reserve in 2000 would have their retired pay calculated based on equivalent years of service and a pay base of $8,762.40 per month. The retired pay for servicemembers is calculated based on the pay base and retired pay multiplier, resulting in a monthly retirement annuity. Disability retirement, known as Chapter 61 retirement, is available for those with a permanent disability rated at 30% or more. Disability retirees cannot receive a lump sum payment and their retired pay is subject to federal income tax. The retired pay for servicemembers is subject to federal income tax unless certain conditions apply, such as disability due to combat-related injury or eligibility for disability retirement before September 25, 1975. Retired enlisted members with less than 30 years of service may receive a 10% increase in pay for extraordinary heroism, capped at 75% of their retired or retainer pay. Military retirees receive full Social Security benefits in addition to their military retired pay. Current military personnel do not contribute a portion of their salary to military retirement pay accrual but are entitled to full Social Security benefits based on their service. Military retired pay and Social Security are not offset against each other, and military retired pay is not subject to withholding for Social Security tax. Military retired pay is adjusted for inflation by statute. The COLA formula has not been modified since 1995, but discussions about modifications are ongoing. COLAs for 2007 to 2017 are detailed in Table 5. For military personnel who entered service before August 1, 1986, a COLA equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index is applied each December. The COLA for military retired pay is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1% and applied to the monthly benefit amount, with the final payment rounded down to the nearest $1.00. For personnel who entered service on or after August 1, 1986, COLAs are calculated using different methods based on their retirement pay formula choice. Annual COLAs are typically one percentage point below the actual inflation rate, with a one-time recomputation of annuity at age 62 to account for lost purchasing power. After a one-time recomputation at age 62 to adjust for lost purchasing power, the retired pay multiplier is increased to match that of a member who did not choose the Redux option. Concerns have been raised about the Blended Retirement System's impact on recruitment, retention, and financial well-being of military personnel. The impacts of the BRS on recruitment and retention, as well as on the financial well-being of military personnel, are uncertain. A recent study for the Marine Corps found small effects on force profiles, with officer retention being more sensitive than enlisted retention. Retention may vary by occupational specialty, suggesting flexibility may be needed in offering retention incentives. Those who retire after a 20-year career and contribute to the TSP may have lower take-home pay from retirement to age 60 compared to the legacy system. The BRS may result in lower take-home pay for military personnel retiring before age 60 compared to the legacy system, but offers higher benefits after age 60 when drawing from the TSP without penalty. Estimates show slightly higher lifetime benefits under the legacy system. Congress addressed concerns by requiring financial literacy training for servicemembers under the new retirement system. Military retirement costs have been rising modestly each year. Since FY1985, military retirement costs have been budgeted using accrual accounting, with contributions to a Military Retirement Fund to finance future payouts to current personnel. This change resulted in an unfunded liability discussed in the next section. The Military Retirement Fund (MRF) accumulates annual accrual contributions from personnel for future retirement payouts. Changes in military end-strength, pay tables, or retirement formulas affect DOD budget obligations. An independent board determines DOD's yearly contribution to the MRF based on future retirement cost estimates. Payments to retirees come from the MRF, not the annual budget. The Military Retirement Fund receives contributions from active duty military personnel for future retirement payouts. The fund also receives transfers from the Treasury to cover the initial unfunded liability. The normal cost percentage is approximately 30 cents on every dollar of basic pay for full-time members. Discussions on federal civilian and military retirement include debates on retirement costs and funding sources. The unfunded liability for federal civilian and military retirement, totaling $742.6 billion as of FY2016, is being paid off annually from the General Fund of the Treasury and is expected to be fully amortized by FY2025. Congressional actions, such as changes to basic pay or benefits, can impact this liability. For instance, the implementation of the Blended Retirement System reduced the unfunded liability by $800 million. The FY2017 NDAA extended the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) as a permanent benefit with annual COLA increases, raising the unfunded liability by $200 million. The DOD Actuary estimates this change will increase NCPs by 0.1 percentage point, resulting in an actuarial loss of $8 billion to the Military Retirement Fund. The Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) is required by law every four years, with the 10th QRMC making recommendations. The 10th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) recommended major revisions to the active and reserve retirement systems, including a defined benefit plan vesting personnel at 10 years of service with options to begin benefits at age 60 or 57, and a defined contribution plan requiring services to contribute up to 5% of annual base pay into a retirement account. The 11th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) recommended changes to the retirement system, including a contribution plan for servicemembers starting at 2% and increasing to 5% based on years of service. Gate pays would be established at career points, separation pay used to encourage personnel in over-manned skills to separate early, and alignment of active and reserve retirement systems. The report recommended modifications to the reserve retirement system, including allowing members with 20 qualifying years to start receiving retired pay after 30 years of service or at age 60. The points needed for a qualifying year would be reduced from 50 to 35. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was established to provide recommendations for modernizing pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was tasked with providing recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services, including retirement systems. The commission was required to ensure that existing servicemembers and retirees would not receive less in retired pay than under the current system. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) delivered its final report to Congress on January 29, 2015, with recommendations adopted in the FY2016 NDAA. Changes included reducing the retired pay multiplier, government matching contributions, and the lump sum option. The MCRMC did not recommend changing the 20-year retirement eligibility but suggested giving the Secretary of Defense authority to adjust years-of-service requirements. DOD opposed this proposal, and Congress did not adopt it. The MCRMC recommended giving the Secretary of Defense authority to adjust years-of-service requirements, but Congress did not adopt this provision. The 20-year eligibility remains unchanged in current law."
