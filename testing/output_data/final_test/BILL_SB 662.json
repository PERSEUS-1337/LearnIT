    "title": "SB 662",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Subaccount is created for providing loans and making payments for the Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Program. Funds in the subaccount are continuously appropriated to the department for these purposes, and interest earnings can be used for administrative expenses. The Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Subaccount receives money from loan repayments, fees, and interest payments. The department can use the funds to make loans to local governing bodies, private businesses, and nonprofit entities within recycling market development zones. The department can use funds from the Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Subaccount to make payments to local governing bodies within a recycling market zone for services related to promotion. Funding for a loan is contingent on obtaining all significant federal, state, and local permits. The department will establish and collect fees for loan applications to cover processing costs. Fees or points will also be set for loans to fund the administration of the revolving loan program. The department may use funds from the subaccount for the Recycling Market Development Revolving Loan Program administration, as specified in the annual Budget Act. If there are insufficient funds in the subaccount, the department can use funds from the account to administer the program. The department can allocate funds for protecting the state's position as a lender-creditor, covering various costs like foreclosure expenses, attorney fees, and repair costs. This section will be inoperative on July 1, 2021, and repealed on January 1, 2022, unless extended by a later statute. Section 48705 of the Public Resources Code requires manufacturers of architectural paint in California to submit annual reports on their paint recovery efforts, including sales volume and postconsumer paint recovery methods. The repeal of this section does not affect loan obligations or the state's ability to collect loans. The architectural paint stewardship program includes the total cost of implementation, evaluation of funding mechanism, independent financial audit, and examples of educational materials provided to consumers. The department must review the annual report and adopt a finding of compliance or noncompliance within 90 days."
