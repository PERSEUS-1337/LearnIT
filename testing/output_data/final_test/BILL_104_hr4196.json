    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging Establishment Act\" and establishes the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging under the Public Health Service Act. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research, training, and information dissemination on imaging modalities with biomedical applications. The Director establishes a National Biomedical Imaging Program for research and development in new techniques and devices, as well as related disciplines. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research on imaging modalities for biomedical applications, including technology assessments, outcomes studies, screening for diseases, advancing existing modalities, developing image-enhancing agents, and new techniques for imaging-guided surgery. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research on imaging modalities for biomedical applications, including technology assessments, outcomes studies, screening for diseases, advancing existing modalities, developing image-enhancing agents, and new techniques for imaging-guided surgery. The institute also focuses on research into technologies to enhance and expand the potential applications of picture archiving, communication systems, and telemedicine. The Director or the Institute prepares and transmits a plan to the Secretary and the Director of NIH to initiate, expand, intensify, and coordinate activities of the Institute regarding biomedical imaging, with periodic reviews and revisions of the plan. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research on imaging modalities for biomedical applications, including technology assessments, outcomes studies, screening for diseases, advancing existing modalities, developing image-enhancing agents, and new techniques for imaging-guided surgery. The institute also focuses on research into technologies to enhance and expand the potential applications of picture archiving, communication systems, and telemedicine. The establishment of a center within the Institute to coordinate imaging research activities conducted or supported by Federal agencies and to facilitate the transfer of biomedical imaging technologies is subject to the establishment of an advisory council with 12 members appointed by the Secretary, including 6 members representing disciplines in biomedical imaging who are not officers or employees of the United States. The advisory council for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging consists of 12 members appointed by the Secretary, including scientists, physicians, and health professionals knowledgeable about biomedical imaging. Ex officio members include directors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Science Foundation, and National Institute of Standards and Technology. Funding is authorized for fiscal year 1997 to carry out the institute's activities. For fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999, funding is authorized for biomedical imaging activities by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging. The amount appropriated is adjusted for inflation each year. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging is established with the use of existing resources from the National Institutes of Health. This includes transferring personnel, utilizing facilities, and obtaining administrative support from other NIH agencies. No provisions authorize the construction of facilities under this Act. The Act authorizes the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging without provisions for constructing facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must establish an advisory council within 90 days. A conforming amendment is made to the Public Health Service Act. The Act establishing the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging takes effect on October 1, 1996, or upon enactment, whichever is later."
