    "content": "Three important principles guide public health and medical preparedness and response. Preparedness and response are distinct functions with different leadership roles, legal authorities, and funding mechanisms at each level of government. States and localities hold authority and responsibility for health care and emergency management oversight, with governors authorized to enforce evacuations in emergencies. The federal government typically does not dictate health care or emergency management activities to state or local officials. The nation's health care system is primarily private and for-profit, operating in a competitive marketplace where emergency planning is not always prioritized. The 2001 terrorist attacks and other events increased congressional interest in tracking and responding to health threats, leading to the establishment of relevant programs in the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security. The 110th Congress focused on oversight of these activities. The 110th Congress focused on oversight of HHS and DHS readiness for health emergencies, federal agency coordination, and major initiatives like pandemic flu preparedness. The 111th Congress is expected to continue oversight but faces a changing landscape with potential shifts in preparedness priorities under the Obama Administration and ongoing health care reform debates. The nation's unsettled economy also poses challenges for policy makers. The nation's unsettled economy poses challenges for policy makers, affecting future spending for public programs. Federal programs addressing health emergencies may face constraints unless they are viewed as a means for job creation or economic stimulus. The 109th Congress enacted laws for public health and medical preparedness, establishing programs and authorities for emergency response activities. The Obama Administration may reconsider homeland security objectives, with priorities likely differing from the Bush Administration. This includes oversight of medical countermeasures by BARDA and the reorganization of DHS under the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The Obama Administration redirected federal funds to major cities for mass dispensing of antibiotics in response to an attack, which received mixed critiques. Transition also marked the transfer of presidential authority for homeland security positions and programs established since 2001. The Obama Administration redirected federal funds to major cities for mass dispensing of antibiotics in response to an attack, which received mixed critiques. Shifts in doctrine or priority in the new Administration may manifest when key positions are filled or when the budget proposal for FY2010 is unveiled. Congress may consider relocating certain programs, and President Obama may consider reorganizing certain homeland security functions, such as those of the Homeland Security Council (HSC). President George W. Bush established the HSC in the Executive Office of the President shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Council (HSC) was established by President George W. Bush after the 2001 terrorist attacks. There have been calls to merge the HSC with the National Security Council (NSC) due to shared responsibilities. President Obama has called for a review of NSC functions. Roles and responsibilities in public health and medical preparedness have shifted, with clarity provided by the 109th Congress. Activities in DHS are led by the DHS CMO, and in HHS by the HHS ASPR, as outlined in the PAHPA and PKA. Refinement of these roles is ongoing. The DHS CMO and HHS ASPR have primary responsibilities for medical issues in disasters and emergencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security leads federal response activities, while the Secretary of HHS leads public health and medical response under the overall leadership of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The roles involve shared responsibilities, with ongoing refinement. The GAO recommended that DHS and HHS conduct training and exercises to define federal leadership roles clearly. Federal incident response activities are coordinated according to the National Response Framework (NRF) and ESF-8. Some recommended activities have been undertaken, but it is unclear if they rigorously tested federal leadership roles in a pandemic. Some leadership gaps and conflicts remain in ESF-8 despite efforts to learn from Hurricane Katrina. Concerns include clarity in leadership for responder health and safety, emergency sheltering, mass fatality management, and mental health services. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a directive in 2009 to review response plans for large-scale medical incidents, requiring DHS offices to assess current plans and report back by February 24, 2009. The PAHPA mandates the HHS Secretary to publish a comprehensive, all-hazards plan. The PAHPA requires the HHS Secretary to publish a national public health and medical response strategy, known as the NHSS, starting in 2009 and every four years. The Bush Administration directive established a national strategy for public health and medical preparedness, to be incorporated into the NHSS. RAND Corporation was awarded a contract to support the development of the NHSS in FY2009. The 111th Congress may monitor these developments. The 111th Congress may monitor the NHSS development process, focusing on the leadership's progress under the Obama Administration and the alignment of goals with new priorities. Congress may also review the HHS Secretary's authorities for public health emergencies and funding for disaster response activities. The status of the Public Health Emergency Fund, which has not received appropriations for years, remains unclear. The Public Health Emergency Fund has not received appropriations for years, and it is uncertain if a flu pandemic would qualify as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. If major disaster assistance were applicable, FEMA funds could support HHS response activities. Congress has provided over $9 billion in grants since 2002 to strengthen public health and hospital preparedness for health threats. The PAHPA extended programs with added requirements for states to receive funds. The Cooperative Agreement for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and the Hospital Preparedness Program, administered by CDC and HHS ASPR respectively, have posed challenges for federal managers and state awardees. Issues include difficulty in setting performance goals and staffing preparedness programs due to workforce shortages and funding challenges. Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to address these issues. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $50 million for cyber-security improvements at HHS, but funding for medical countermeasures and pandemic flu preparedness was removed in conference. Policymakers are concerned about medical surge capacity in health systems. The successful response to mass casualty incidents requires coordination of elements like patients, treatment facilities, healthcare workforce, medical supplies, records, and financing mechanisms. The private healthcare sector has faced cost constraints and has tried to avoid unused capacity needed in emergencies. The federal government has tried to establish this capacity in the private sector since 2001, with mixed success. The federal government has sought to establish surge capacity in the private sector since 2001, with mixed success. The HHS Hospital Preparedness Program provides grants to state governments to work with private health care facilities. The federal government has historically assisted states with disaster response through guidance, funding, and procurement of medical response assets. This expanded federal role provides a stronger backstop for state, local, and private-sector response efforts. The federal government has expanded its role in disaster response by providing medical assets like Field Medical Stations (FMS) and Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) supplies. Costs for acquiring these assets are tracked through annual appropriations, while deployment costs are often reimbursed by FEMA. However, specific costs for HHS responses to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike have not been published, prompting potential interest from Congress. The 111th Congress may examine the federal Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) in response to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Concerns include the lack of evidence for effective services, timeliness, scope, duration, organization, cost, and accountability. The roles and responsibilities of HHS, FEMA, and states in state CCP programs are unclear. HRSA manages health professions programs to address shortages but not for disaster surge capacity. Efforts to increase health professionals for disaster response include liability protection and a national verification system for licenses. Uniform protection for volunteer health professionals is being worked on at state and federal levels. A uniform system for protecting volunteer health professionals is still lacking at both state and federal levels. Surge capacity in the public health workforce has only recently gained federal attention. The National Disaster Medical System and the Medical Reserve Corps provide surge capacity for disaster response. The responsibility for the health and safety of disaster response workers is a significant concern. The National Response Framework (NRF) is concerned about the health and safety of disaster response workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) faced challenges during Hurricane Katrina due to confusion about its role. Efforts to elevate worker health and safety to an Emergency Support Function in the NRF were made, but instead, a revised Worker Safety and Health Support Annex was included. There is no federal assistance program specifically for covering uninsured health care costs post-disaster. Following recent disasters, special assistance was provided by Congress or the Bush Administration to address the issue of uninsured health care costs. This included funding for hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities near affected sites, as well as a program for medical screening, monitoring, and treatment services. There is debate over whether these costs should be a federal responsibility. Congress funded a program to provide medical services to responders exposed to hazards at the World Trade Center site post-9/11. Legislative proposals in the 110th Congress aimed to address health care needs of those affected by the WTC exposures. Efforts to address health issues of responders exposed to hazards at the World Trade Center site post-9/11 were hindered by the lack of a central registry and monitoring program. Legislative proposals in various Congress sessions aimed to provide medical services and compensation for WTC-related illnesses, with the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2009 being introduced in the 111th Congress. The SAFE Port Act authorized the establishment of medical monitoring programs post-Hurricane Katrina, but as of May 2008, HHS had not implemented a plan for it. This lack of clarity in responsibilities and funding within HHS agencies like ASPR, ATSDR, and NIOSH could hinder effective response to disasters. The 2008 GAO recommended that HHS develop plans to register all responders during disasters to ensure their health and safety. The plan should also include medical monitoring programs for at-risk individuals and those not directly involved in response efforts. This is in line with the requirements of the SAFE Port Act and PAHPA to consider the needs of vulnerable populations in emergency planning. The 110th Congress authorized funds for a National Commission on Children and Disasters, focusing on the needs of at-risk individuals like children, pregnant women, and senior citizens. The 111th Congress is interested in how federal efforts address diverse special needs and coordinate disaster response. The FEMA Disability Coordinator's office has not effectively coordinated its work with other federal agencies. The FEMA Disability Coordinator's office has not effectively coordinated its work with the National Council on Disability as required. The 109th Congress allocated $6.1 billion for a human flu pandemic threat, mainly supporting an HHS initiative for vaccine production. The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed the financial risks of this investment, noting uncertainties in vaccine technology research and sustainability of expanded production capacity. GAO has provided recommendations for pandemic response. The GAO has made recommendations for pandemic response planning, coordination, and capacity. The 111th Congress is likely to be interested in the status of national preparedness efforts, including federal investment and leadership for planning efforts. The status of state preparedness efforts and the potential availability of FEMA funds for HHS response activities are also important considerations. The response to communicable disease threats may involve movement restrictions, business and school closures, compulsory treatments, and other constraints. State and local governments have primary authority over domestic containment measures, but a comprehensive response may involve overlapping governmental authorities and legal and economic issues. Managing employers' and workers' concerns during outbreaks, like a flu pandemic, can be challenging, as fear of losing employment or wages may impact compliance with public health measures. Recent incidents have raised concerns about the coordination among federal agencies responsible for disease control, border security, and transportation infrastructure. If systems are unable to respond to common infectious disease threats like tuberculosis, they may struggle to address more serious threats. Effective solutions to health emergencies should address scientific, technical, and economic constraints, individual and collective rights, and the roles of federal, state, and local authorities. Health emergencies often involve resource scarcities, requiring careful prioritization based on scientific evidence. Since 2001, various government agencies and academic institutions have expanded laboratory capacity for studying dangerous biological pathogens and toxins, playing a key role in biodefense efforts. Biodefense laboratories are crucial in responding to biological attacks and understanding bioterrorism threats. However, they also pose a risk of being a source for attacks. The 111th Congress may address issues related to oversight, security, transparency, and international collaboration in domestic biodefense laboratories. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress (S. 485/H.R. 1225) would require the HHS Secretary to review and report on these issues. The 111th Congress (S. 485/H.R. 1225) would require the HHS Secretary to review and report on laboratory capacity, information sharing, training standards, and a voluntary reporting system for accidents. It would also reauthorize the Select Agent Program to regulate biological pathogens and toxins for bioterrorism, with requirements for program review and surge capacity planning. The bills in the 111th Congress would reauthorize the Select Agent Program to regulate biological pathogens and toxins for bioterrorism, with requirements for program review, surge capacity planning, and guidance to improve inventory practices. Additionally, they would authorize HHS and USDA to release sensitive information to designated state officials if state laws protect against further disclosure. The FBI believed a DOD scientist was responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks, but the individual took his own life before charges could be filed, raising concerns about security risk assessments for individuals in the Select Agent Program. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended a review of the Select Agent Program, with concerns raised about DHS potentially taking over regulation of biological pathogens due to lack of homeland security expertise. Some in the biomedical research community were also concerned about the potential changes. The biomedical research community successfully argued for the Project BioShield program to remain with CDC and APHIS instead of being moved to DHS during the establishment of the new department in 2002. The program encourages the development of countermeasures for various threats, managed by DHS and HHS with a 10-year advance appropriation for procurement. DHS conducts Material Threat Determinations to assess hazards like anthrax and sarin. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in HHS supports countermeasure development and communication with developers. The PAHPA requires the HHS Secretary to create a strategic plan for countermeasures research. The BioShield program has faced challenges, with unresolved issues including the clarity of shared roles between DHS and HHS. The remaining key issues in the BioShield program are the clarity of shared roles between DHS and HHS, and whether HHS can define contract terms that are attractive to product developers. Congress and the Bush Administration have made improvements, but concerns about successful procurements persist. Intellectual property protections may impact the availability of countermeasures. In December 2005, Congress passed the PREP Act to address emergency preparedness. The \"Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act\" (PREP Act) eliminates liability for manufacturers and others involved in producing, distributing, and using covered countermeasures during emergencies. HHS Secretary Leavitt declared emergencies for smallpox, anthrax, botulism, and acute radiation sickness countermeasures in October 2008. The law also establishes a fund to compensate those harmed by covered countermeasures. The 111th Congress may consider reauthorization of expired preparedness and response programs. Congress may consider reauthorization of expired preparedness and response programs, including HHS health professions programs and the Strategic National Stockpile of countermeasures. The last reauthorization in 1998 did not focus on emergency preparedness, but concerns have heightened since 2001. The Select Agent program to regulate biological pathogens also expired in FY2007."
