The \"Small Non-Coal Producing Company Relief Act\" allows eligible small assigned operators to have their annual premiums reduced based on their average annual taxable income. The Combined Fund's eligibility criteria for plan years before October 1, 2003, require a surplus of $150,000,000 at the close of the previous plan year. The eligibility criteria for plan years before October 1, 2003, require a surplus of $150,000,000 at the close of the previous plan year. Eligible small assigned operators must have an average annual gross income not exceeding $25,000,000 for the 5-taxable year period ending before October 1, 1993. The eligibility criteria for small assigned operators before October 1, 2003, require a surplus of $150,000,000 at the end of the previous plan year. Small operators must have an average annual gross income not exceeding $25,000,000 for the 5-taxable year period ending before October 1, 1993. Production of coal by assigned operators or related persons is defined as employing employees in coal extraction, preparation, processing, or changing for sale. In determining gross income or taxable income, assigned operators and related persons are treated as one person. If the Combined Fund has a surplus of 50% or more of net expenses, no annual premium is imposed on eligible small assigned operators for the next plan year. If the surplus is 100% or more, no premium is imposed on other operators. The annual premium for assigned operators in the Combined Fund may be reduced based on the surplus in excess of 100% of net expenses for the plan year. The total reductions in annual premiums cannot exceed $5,000,000 for any plan year. The reduction in annual premiums for assigned operators in the Combined Fund cannot exceed $5,000,000 for any plan year. Reductions in premiums for operators who have not paid at least 50% of assessed premiums from October 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995, are not included. Any decrease in premium reductions is applied first against other reductions and then ratably among operators. Surplus computation is required for this section. The surplus in the Combined Fund must be calculated on an accrual basis, certified by an independent auditor, and reviewed by a court of law for reasonableness. The determination must adhere to accounting principles and reasonable assumptions. A new item is added to the Internal Revenue Code for this purpose. The amendments in Sec. 9704A reduce annual premiums for certain assigned operators, effective for plan years starting after January 31, 1993. SEC. 3 waives penalties. No penalty under section 9707 of the Internal Revenue Code for eligible small assigned operators who pay premium installments before January 1, 1996. Failure to pay due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect, can be corrected within 90 days of notice. The installment amount is not reviewable or appealable after notice of failure or a final administrative or judicial determination."
