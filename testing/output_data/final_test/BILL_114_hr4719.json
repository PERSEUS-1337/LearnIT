    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Correcting Obstructions to Mediate, Prevent, and Limit Inaccessibility Act\" or the \"COMPLI Act.\" It addresses notice and compliance opportunities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Section 308(a)(1) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include provisions for notice and compliance opportunities in civil actions for discrimination. A written notice specific enough to identify barriers must be provided to the owner or operator of the accommodation before commencing a civil action. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 308(a)(1) amendment requires a written notice identifying barriers to be given to the owner or operator of a public accommodation before initiating a civil action. The notice must include the date and time of denial of access, a 90-day compliance period, and failure to remove the barrier may lead to a civil action. The ADA amendment requires a written notice to be given to the owner or operator of a public accommodation before a civil action can be initiated. The notice must include the date of denial of access, a 90-day compliance period, and refraining from communication with the owner during this period. The ADA amendment mandates that a public accommodation must notify the public of any alleged violations and the steps being taken to address them within 15 days of receiving notice. Failure to do so forfeits the 90-day period to rectify the violation and may result in a civil action. The ADA requires public accommodations to notify the public of alleged violations within 15 days. If a good faith effort is made but the violation cannot be corrected within 90 days, an additional 30 days may be granted for compliance. Factors indicating a good faith effort to remove barriers or correct violations include securing construction permits, hiring contractors, obtaining completion estimates, and beginning necessary construction work. The text chunk discusses limitations on civil actions for discrimination under section 302(b)(2), including restrictions on commencing a civil action during specific periods or while a related civil action is pending. Damages awarded in civil actions for discrimination are limited to plaintiffs who were actually denied access to or reasonable use of the public accommodation in question. SEC. 3. REPORT ON HIGH-FREQUENCY LITIGATORS. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of this Act's enactment, analyzing the impact of the notice and compliance opportunity provided under section 308(a)(1)(B). The report will determine the number of individuals in each State who have filed 10 or more actions alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act within a 12-month period, assess the effect of the notice and compliance opportunity on the number of actions filed, and evaluate its impact on an individual's ability to bring a legitimate accessibility claim. The Attorney General will submit a report to Congress analyzing the impact of the notice and compliance opportunity provided under section 308(a)(1)(B) of the Act. This report will include recommendations on whether a cap on recoverable attorneys fees would reduce the number of actions brought by individual plaintiffs."
