    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 36 of the Code of Civil Procedure in California is amended to grant preference in civil actions to parties over 70 years old or under 14 years old in certain cases. Preference is given based on the party's substantial interest in the case and their health condition. Preference in civil actions can be granted to parties over 70 years old or under 14 years old, or those with a serious medical condition, based on their substantial interest in the case. The court may approve a motion for preference supported by medical documentation or a showing that the interests of justice will be served. Upon granting a motion for preference, the court sets the trial within 120 days with no continuance beyond that period, except for physical disability or good cause. In cases of alleged professional negligence by a health provider, the trial date is set between six to nine months from the motion's approval.
