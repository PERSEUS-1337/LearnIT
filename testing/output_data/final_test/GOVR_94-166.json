    "content": "American criminal law can apply outside the United States under certain circumstances, particularly for multi-jurisdictional crimes. While federal statutes allow for extraterritorial application, prosecutions have been limited due to practical, legal, and sometimes diplomatic complications. The Constitution does not prohibit the enactment of laws that apply internationally or the prosecution of conduct committed abroad. The Constitution allows for the application of American law beyond the United States, including prosecuting crimes committed abroad. Congress has the power to define and punish felonies on the high seas and regulate commerce with foreign nations. The Constitution grants Congress the power to define and punish felonies on the high seas and regulate commerce with foreign nations, allowing for the application of American law beyond the United States. This includes extraterritorial criminal legislation in a maritime context and the overseas application of federal criminal law, even on American vessels within another nation's territory. Congress's commerce powers, including regulating interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes, provide authority for enacting criminal statutes with extraterritorial application. The Foreign Commerce Clause may have even broader implications, as seen in recent court cases. Courts in recent cases have taken a middle ground on Congress's power to regulate illicit overseas commercial sexual activity by Americans. One court found Congress had the authority in a specific case, while another narrowly interpreted the statute to avoid ruling on Congress's power under the foreign commerce clause. Another court held that Congress could regulate the channels of U.S. foreign commerce but left other questions for future consideration. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have differing views on Congress's foreign commerce power. The Eleventh Circuit believes it mirrors interstate commerce powers, while the Fourth Circuit extends it to regulate activities affecting U.S. foreign commerce. Congress has used extraterritorial legislation to further its powers or rely on shared powers. The Constitution grants Congress powers that are not unlimited, with specific limits on the extent of power overseas. Limitations also exist in the due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment and the need to harmonize conflicting grants of authority. The Constitution reserves to states the remaining governmental powers not vested elsewhere. The Constitution limits Congress's power overseas, with specific restrictions in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. This clause defines the extent of extraterritorial legislation and enforcement, marking the outer boundaries of American law abroad. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause limits Congress's authority to enforce American law abroad. The Supreme Court has noted that due process protections do not apply to aliens without significant connections to the United States. Lower court decisions are increasingly addressing due process issues in cases involving extraterritoriality, with some courts requiring a nexus to the United States for due process to be considered. The Due Process Clause limits Congress's authority to enforce American law abroad, requiring a nexus to the United States for due process to be considered in cases involving extraterritoriality. This includes a requirement that a defendant's conduct must have a past, present, or anticipated impact within the United States to be held criminally liable in an American court. Due process challenges based on notice and knowledge are also raised in these cases. The relevant factors for determining extraterritorial application of American criminal statute include indicia of knowledge, reason to know, obligation to know, and reasonable ignorance of the law's requirements. Citizens are expected to know their own nation's laws, seafarers the law of the sea and the laws of the nation they sail under, and everyone the laws of the land they are in. Courts have held that questions of extraterritoriality are primarily within Congress's discretion, with due process concerns raised when applying American law to conduct lawful in a foreign country. The extraterritorial application of American criminal statutes is within Congress's discretion, with due process concerns raised when applying American law to conduct lawful in a foreign country. Statutes are generally construed to have only territorial application unless there is a clear indication of broader intent for overseas application. The presumption against extraterritoriality limits provisions to their terms when they provide for extraterritorial application. The second rule of construction suggests that the nature and purpose of a statute can indicate if Congress intended it to apply outside the US. The Supreme Court's endorsement of the domestic presumption in civil cases has raised doubts about the vitality of previous rulings. The final rule assumes Congress acts in line with international law unless stated otherwise. International law does not dictate decisions on the overseas application of American law, but Congress considers it for legislation with international consequences. Courts interpret statutes with the presumption that Congress looks to international law for policy considerations. The courts interpret legislation with the presumption that Congress or the state legislature intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law, unless indicated otherwise. The question of extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is a matter of national interests, considering what national interest is served and what interests of other nations suffer. The classification of these interests dates back to a 1935 Harvard Law School study, dividing them into five principles based on the circumstances under which nations apply their criminal laws. The American Law Institute's Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States provides a comprehensive statement on international law regarding extraterritorial jurisdiction. It emphasizes the importance of reasonableness in allowing a country to enforce its laws outside its borders, aligning with the principles outlined in a Harvard study. While the Restatement's views are influential, the courts ultimately determine the extent to which international law recognizes extraterritorial jurisdiction. The courts determine the extraterritorial application of laws by referencing the Harvard study principles, which are interpreted broadly. The territorial principle covers conduct within a nation's borders, on its territorial waters, vessels on the high seas, and conduct with an impact within its territory. Congress may specify when a law applies to territorial waters and vessels. Courts also consider the \"impact\" basis for extraterritorial claims, especially when other principles are present. The protective principle in international law applies to crimes committed outside a nation's territory against its security, territorial integrity, or political independence. It allows for the extraterritorial application of statutes protecting the federal government and its functions, such as murder of federal officers, acts of terrorism affecting American foreign policy, threats to U.S. national security, immigration law violations, stowaway entry into the U.S., and overseas bribery. The nationality principle in extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is based on the citizenship of the accused, as seen in cases like Blackmer v. United States. This principle often intersects with other principles like protective and passive personality principles. The universal principle allows any nation to punish offenses against all nations committed by offenders. Extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction allows nations to punish offenses committed by offenders found within their borders, especially in cases of piracy and crimes on stateless vessels. Congress has established the extraterritorial application of federal criminal law, often targeting misconduct within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, which includes navigable waters and federal enclaves. This concept dates back to the First Congress and extends beyond the territorial confines of the United States. Extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction under U.S. law has expanded to cover various federal criminal laws related to air travel, customs matters, spacecraft, submersible vessels, overseas federal facilities, human trafficking, and sex offenses committed abroad by federal employees or military personnel. This extension allows for the application of U.S. laws beyond its territorial borders. Some federal criminal statutes have extraterritorial application based on international treaties or agreements, with jurisdictional circumstances varying. These laws may apply when the offender is American, commits universally condemned misconduct, or is found in the United States after the offense. Other statutes explicitly apply overseas or outline specific jurisdictional circumstances. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) allows for extraterritorial coverage of federal criminal law with the consent of the nation with primary criminal jurisdiction. It prohibits drug-related activities on vessels within U.S. jurisdiction, including vessels from other countries that have consented to U.S. law enforcement aboard the vessel. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) allows for the application of U.S. law aboard vessels, including \"stateless\" vessels. It provides the basis for Coast Guard drug interdiction efforts in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Courts have upheld MDLEA as a valid exercise of Congress's authority to punish felonies on the high seas. There is debate over the need for a nexus to the U.S. and jurisdictional determinations. The extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction includes a wide range of statutes designed to protect federal officers, employees, and property, prevent smuggling, and deter obstruction or corruption of overseas activities of federal departments and agencies. This jurisdiction applies to cases involving the assassination of Members of Congress, murder or kidnapping of federal law enforcement officials, even if the offenders are not Americans. The extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction covers various offenses such as fraud, false statements, theft of federal property, counterfeiting, and murder of foreign nationals to facilitate criminal activities in the United States. The validity of these assessments has been questioned by RJR Nabisco, as there is no clear indication that Congress intended these statutes to apply abroad. This raises doubts about the global application of laws enacted to prevent and punish federal property theft. The RJR Nabisco Court endorsed implied extraterritoriality for \"piggyback\" statutes like conspiracy and aiding and abetting, allowing for criminal liability even if the crime occurred abroad. Earlier cases also upheld conspiracy charges for individuals outside the US involved in violating American law. The RJR Nabisco Court endorsed extraterritoriality for criminal liability based on crimes that apply abroad, particularly under RICO. State criminal laws are less likely to apply overseas compared to federal laws, reflecting the federal government's responsibility for protecting American interests abroad. The Constitution allows limited state law application overseas, subject to federal government's primacy in foreign affairs. Congress can override state laws in areas under its authority, and treaties bind states. States can legislate extraterritorially if intended, but typically do so in limited circumstances. State statutory provisions claim extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction in limited circumstances, such as when elements of the offense occur within the state or when crimes are attempted across state borders. Other instances include homicides where the victim dies within the state, bringing stolen property into the state, or failing to comply with state law outside its borders. Federal law also plays a role in regulating state extraterritorial jurisdiction. Failure to comply with a legal duty imposed by state law can lead to extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction. Prosecutions for such offenses are rare due to legal, practical, and diplomatic obstacles faced by investigators and prosecutors. The Restatement highlights the limitation of state officials exercising their functions in another state without consent. Congress has endorsed diplomatic efforts to increase multinational cooperative law enforcement activities through over 70 mutual legal assistance treaties in force, allowing state and federal law enforcement investigators access to benefits facilitated by the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs. Investigations of extraterritorial federal crimes in another country without consent are rare due to potential diplomatic protests, liability for reparations, and criminal prosecution of offending foreign investigators. Mutual legal assistance treaties facilitate cooperation in law enforcement activities by providing various provisions for locating persons, executing search warrants, taking witness depositions, and seizing assets related to forfeitures. Letters rogatory may be used to take witness statements in foreign countries, but the process is time-consuming and subject to the discretion of foreign courts. American law enforcement officials have increasingly utilized cooperative methods overseas to investigate and prosecute extraterritorial offenses. The United States has expanded its presence with federal civilian law enforcement agencies assigning personnel overseas, including the Justice Department's Criminal Division, FBI, DEA, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Secret Service. Regulatory agencies with law enforcement responsibilities also have international offices. The Securities and Exchange Commission, along with 105 foreign regulatory entities, is part of the International Organization of Securities Commissions' enforcement cooperation agreement. Congress has enacted measures to support foreign law enforcement efforts in the US, such as the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act of 2009. This allows Justice Department attorneys to request search warrants and access to electronic communications for foreign investigations. The Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches of foreign nationals' property outside the US, unless there are significant voluntary connections with the US. It is unclear how the Fourth Amendment applies to US citizens and foreign nationals with connections to the US. Prior to a Supreme Court decision, the Fourth Amendment and its exclusionary rule were not considered applicable to overseas searches by foreign law enforcement, except under certain circumstances. Since the Supreme Court decision in Verdugo-Urquidez, the Fourth Amendment is generally not applicable to searches or seizures of U.S. citizens by foreign officials in other countries. However, exceptions exist for cases involving \"joint ventures\" or conduct that \"shocks the conscience of the court.\" These exceptions were rarely encountered before MLATs were established, and it remains unclear if they apply to searches involving U.S. nationals. Since the Supreme Court decision in Verdugo-Urquidez, the Fourth Amendment generally does not apply to searches or seizures of U.S. citizens by foreign officials in other countries. Exceptions exist for cases involving \"joint ventures\" or conduct that \"shocks the conscience of the court.\" The warrant requirement may not apply to searches by U.S. officials in other countries, as the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard still applies to United States officials. \"The Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard applies to U.S. officials conducting searches affecting U.S. citizens in foreign countries. Foreign searches must comply with foreign law and can be upheld under the good faith exception. The Fifth Amendment and Miranda requirements do not apply to statements made abroad to foreign officials, except in custodial interrogations by American officials.\" The admissibility of confessions and incriminating statements in trial in the US is subject to certain rules. Prosecution of federal crimes generally must begin within five years, but exceptions exist for certain offenses. The statute of limitations can be suspended if the accused is a fugitive, and federal courts can suspend it to await evidence from a foreign government. The district court can suspend the statute of limitations for an offense if evidence is in a foreign country and an official request has been made. The suspension period can last up to six months if the evidence is provided before the original expiration date, or up to three years in other cases. The government must prove that the purpose of the request is to obtain evidence located overseas. The government can request the suspension of the statute of limitations for an offense if evidence is in a foreign country. The time limits for suspension vary, and the purpose of the request must be to obtain overseas evidence. The use of this section to extend or revive a statute of limitations is a topic of debate among different circuits. Extradition is the oldest form of international law enforcement assistance, governed by treaties where one country surrenders a fugitive to another for prosecution or serving a sentence. The United States has bilateral extradition treaties with about two-thirds of the world's nations. Treaties negotiated before 1960 reflected the view that criminal jurisdiction was territorial, but newer agreements allow for extradition regardless of where the offense occurs. Recent treaties address complications like the nationality exception and political offense exception. Extradition treaties often include provisions regarding the nationality exception and political offense exception. These clauses ensure that extradition may not be denied based on nationality and that cases involving such denials must be referred to local authorities for prosecution. The political offense exception, originally meant to protect unsuccessful insurgents, now encompasses offenses like treason and sedition in most extradition treaties worldwide. The political offense exception in extradition treaties includes offenses like treason and sedition, often with limitations to prevent acts of terrorism. Recent treaties have generic descriptions instead of specific crimes listed for extradition. Foreign authorities may expel or deport a suspect instead of extraditing them, especially if they are not a citizen of the country of refuge. Abducting a defendant overseas and bringing them to the United States for trial does not affect the federal court's jurisdiction. Federal crimes committed within the US are tried where they occur, while crimes committed outside the US are tried based on Congress-provided venue statutes. Section 3238 allows the trial of extraterritorial crimes in the district where the offender is first brought. Venue for federal crimes can be in the district where the offender is first brought or arrested, or in the district of their last known residence. Section 3238 allows for the trial of extraterritorial crimes in the district where the offender is first brought while in custody. The Controlled Substance section and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) both outlaw possession of controlled substances in different contexts. They have parallel venue provisions for trial in specific judicial districts. Federal courts can subpoena US residents abroad but generally cannot subpoena foreign nationals in foreign countries. Mutual legal assistance treaties facilitate the transfer of custody of foreign witnesses and encourage foreign nationals to testify voluntarily in the US. Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows federal courts to authorize depositions to be taken abroad in exceptional circumstances and in the interests of justice, permitting the admission of such depositions into evidence in a criminal trial. Originally available only to defendants, prosecutors have had access to this rule since the 1970s as an alternative to long-term incarceration of material witnesses. To establish exceptional circumstances, the moving party must show the necessity for the deposition. Some courts require the witness's unavailability and the materiality of their testimony to establish exceptional circumstances for depositions. Depositions in criminal cases should be conducted similarly to civil cases, with the defendant given the opportunity to attend. Depositions taken abroad should ideally have the defendant present, allow cross-examination by counsel, be under oath, have a verbatim transcript, and be captured on videotape. However, courts have allowed depositions to be admitted into evidence in criminal trials even if these conditions are not fully met. In some countries, depositions may be taken under conditions that differ from U.S. law, but a treaty provision can address this issue. Compliance with Rule 15 is necessary but not sufficient for using a deposition at trial, as admissibility depends on meeting Confrontation Clause requirements for face-to-face confrontation, cross-examination, and witness demeanor exposure. Previous cases have referenced Supreme Court decisions in Ohio v. Roberts or Maryland v. Craig. The Supreme Court decisions in Ohio v. Roberts and Maryland v. Craig addressed the Confrontation Clause's requirements for face-to-face confrontation and the admission of hearsay evidence. Crawford v. Washington later established that \"testimonial\" hearsay must be subject to cross-examination to be considered reliable for evidence. The Crawford case established that \"testimonial\" hearsay must be subject to cross-examination for reliability in evidence, rejecting the Roberts rule exception. The status of Craig's video and public interest exception remains unclear, with differing opinions on what qualifies for the exception. The Eleventh Circuit's en banc Craig analysis suggested that overseas depositions may be more acceptable under the confrontation clause than video trial testimony. The Fourth Circuit upheld a Confrontation Clause challenge in a video case that met the dual requirements of face-to-face confrontation denial for policy reasons and reliability through oath, cross-examination, and witness observation. Depositions taken overseas that comply with Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Confrontation Clause are likely admissible in federal criminal trials under Rule 802 of the hearsay rule. The hearsay rule, Rule 802, poses an obstacle but allows exceptions for depositions taken abroad under Rule 15. Conflict may arise between a defendant's rights and government secrecy for national security. Rule 16 entitles a defendant to disclosure of statements, but complications may arise with foreign intelligence gathering. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to obtain witnesses, but providing a witness who is a terrorist suspect in custody may have adverse effects. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant's right to confront witnesses, even those presenting classified information. The Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) allows for prosecution-prepared summaries of classified information to be disclosed as evidence. National security interests cannot override a defendant's right to a fair trial. Additionally, there is a statutory procedure for admitting foreign business records in federal courts. Section 3505 allows for the admission of foreign business records in federal courts, exempting them from the hearsay rule in criminal proceedings. The records can be authenticated through foreign certification, with a procedure for challenging their reliability. Failure to provide timely notice or foreign certification can prevent admission. Appellate decisions have upheld Section 3505 against Confrontation Clause challenges. The Constitution grants Congress broad powers to enact laws of extraterritorial scope, with few limitations. Appellate decisions have upheld Section 3505 against Confrontation Clause challenges, citing the need for actual confrontation in cases of \"testimonial\" hearsay. The Constitution grants Congress broad powers to enact laws with extraterritorial scope, allowing for prosecutions beyond the United States. Various criminal laws have been enacted by both federal and state governments, but prosecutions are limited due to practical, legal, and diplomatic obstacles. Various criminal laws with extraterritorial scope have been enacted by Congress, including statutes related to domestic assault, hate crimes, smuggling, theft, nuclear material offenses, body armor possession, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, and obscene material.
