    "content": "A variety of statutes and regulations govern oil and gas development on federal lands, with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managing most federal mineral development. The Forest Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, authorizes activities on federal lands in the National Forest System. The report addresses leasing and permitting of onshore federal public domain lands, managed by BLM and the Forest Service. It analyzes the legal framework for oil and gas development, the impact of the Energy Policy of 2005, and requirements of federal environmental laws for issuing coalbed methane leases. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 ended private acquisition of federal oil lands, allowing the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for exploration and lease lands containing oil and gas. Public domain lands obtained by treaty or conquest are subject to leasing and permitting for oil and gas development. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 allows the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits on public domain lands, excluding certain categories like national parks and monuments. The federal government retains title to the lands, which include National Forest System lands and reserved subsurface mineral estates. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 allows the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits on public lands, excluding certain areas like national parks. Lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System cannot be leased, but existing rights are preserved. The Secretary can lease public lands known to contain oil or gas, except for National Forest System lands if the Secretary of Agriculture objects. The U.S. Forest Service has separate regulations for oil and gas development on its lands. The Secretary can withdraw BLM-managed lands to restrict certain land uses. The Secretary of the Interior can withdraw Federal land from settlement for specific purposes, but Congress can also make withdrawals. The BLM manages 262 million acres of public lands under the FLPMA, developing Resource Management Plans to determine land use. The BLM manages public lands under the FLPMA, developing Resource Management Plans (RMPs) that determine land use. RMPs must allow oil and gas development in an area for it to take place, following \"multiple use\" and \"sustained yield\" principles. The Secretary must involve the public and government in RMP development through procedures like public hearings. The BLM and U.S. Forest Service manage public lands under multiple use and sustained yield policies, developing land management plans that consider various uses and criteria. The Secretary must involve the public in the planning process through procedures like public hearings. The Forest Service classifies lands into three categories for potential leasing: open to development with standard lease terms, open with constraints requiring lease stipulations, and closed to leasing. Compliance with NEPA is required, and once analysis is complete, BLM is notified of decisions. The Forest Service classifies lands for leasing into three categories: open for development with standard lease terms, open with constraints, and closed to leasing. BLM is notified of decisions on available lands for leasing, followed by competitive leasing procedures. Public lands must undergo a competitive bidding process quarterly, with specific acreage limits and notice requirements. The Secretary authorizes competitive leasing of public lands through an oral auction with a national minimum bid of $2 per acre. Bids below the minimum are rejected, and winning bidders must make required payments on the day of sale. The lease process involves a rental payment, an administrative fee, and a bonus bid payment within ten days. The lease is issued within sixty days, with a royalty payment requirement of at least 12.5%. If no competitive bids are received, noncompetitive leasing is offered within thirty days, available for two years. The first qualified applicant who pays the application fee can receive the lease without bidding competitively. Noncompetitive offers received after a competitive auction are considered simultaneously, with a lottery determining the lease winner. Offers can be withdrawn within sixty days if no lease is signed. A 12.5% royalty is required for oil or gas removed. Minimum and maximum acreage limits apply. BLM will issue the lease within sixty days if criteria are met. If no application is submitted within two years, the land is available for noncompetitive leasing. The leasing process for public lands involves competitive auctions and noncompetitive leasing. NEPA applies to both processes, potentially requiring new environmental assessments. General restrictions limit leasing to U.S. citizens and certain entities. Citizens and corporations are restricted from controlling federal leases, with limitations on acreage ownership. Leases require a minimum royalty payment of 12.5% of oil or gas production, with potential increases for late payments or reinstatements. The Secretary has the authority to adjust royalties on noncompetitive leases if deemed necessary. The Secretary has the authority to adjust royalties on noncompetitive leases if necessary. Royalties for oil and gas leases must be paid in value, with the option for royalty payment-in-kind. The Secretary is required to sell any royalty oil or gas, except when it is deemed desirable for the use of the United States. Leases also require payment of annual rentals, with rates starting at $1.50 per acre per year for the first five years and increasing to $2 per acre for each additional year. The Secretary can adjust royalties on noncompetitive leases as needed. Royalties for oil and gas leases must be paid in value, with the option for payment-in-kind. Annual rentals are required, starting at $1.50 per acre per year for the first five years. A minimum royalty is due once oil or gas is discovered, equal to the annual rental. Rental payments are not due on acreage with royalties or minimum royalties, except on nonproducing leases with compensatory royalty. The Secretary can waive, suspend, or reduce rentals and royalties. Royalties and rentals are initially paid to the U.S. Treasury, with funds distributed to the State and the Reclamation Fund for water projects in arid Western states. The Act of 1902 allocates 90% of funds from federal leases in Alaska to the State of Alaska. Leases can be extended for drilling operations or oil/gas production, with criteria to be met for extensions. The Mineral Leasing Act allows for lease extensions based on production, drilling operations, and cooperative plans. Failure to comply with MLLA provisions can result in lease cancellation. The Mineral Leasing Act allows for lease extensions based on production, drilling operations, and cooperative plans. Lease can be cancelled if lessee fails to comply with MLLA provisions or regulations. Operators must submit an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) for each oil or gas well, which must be approved before drilling operations can begin. Before drilling operations can begin, operators must submit a complete Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) to the BLM at least thirty days prior. The APD must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, evidence of bond coverage, Form 3160-3, and any other required information. BLM must post the APD for public inspection for thirty days before taking action. Additionally, BLM must prepare an environmental review and decide if an EIS is needed. An adequate bond or financial arrangement is required before any surface-disturbing activities can start. Within five days of the public notice period ending, BLM must choose to approve the application as submitted or with modifications. BLM and the Forest Service must approve a surface use plan of operations before granting a permit to drill on managed lands. The operator submits the plan as part of the APD, which is forwarded to the Forest Service for NFS lands. The level of detail required in the plan varies based on the type, size, and intensity of the proposed activities. The Forest Service evaluates proposed surface use plans of operations to ensure consistency with approved forest land management plans and compliance with NEPA and Forest Service regulations. They may require increased bonding if necessary for reclamation and restoration of NFS lands, ultimately deciding to approve the plan with conditions. The Forest Service evaluates proposed surface use plans of operations for consistency with approved forest land management plans and compliance with NEPA and Forest Service regulations. Options for decision include approving the plan subject to specified conditions, disapproving the plan, or delaying the plan for further review. The decision is then forwarded to BLM. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made changes to federal oil and gas lease regulations, with selected provisions highlighted in this report. The 2005 EPACT requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding to streamline oil and gas development processes. The memorandum must ensure lease stipulations are only as restrictive as necessary to protect the resource. The Secretary of the Interior must conduct a review of Federal onshore oil and gas leasing practices and submit a report to Congress detailing steps to improve efficiency. The 2005 EPACT mandates the Secretary of the Interior to streamline oil and gas leasing practices and submit a report to Congress. It also requires the establishment of a Federal Permit Streamlining Pilot Project and deadlines for decision-making on various applications. Additionally, the Secretary of Agriculture must ensure compliance with environmental and cultural resource laws. The 2005 EPACT mandates the Secretary of the Interior to streamline oil and gas leasing practices, subject to a rebuttable presumption for categorical exclusion under NEPA for exploration or development activities under MLLA. The House bill differed from the NEPA provision adopted by the Conference Committee, exempting certain actions by the Secretary of the Interior for exploration or development of a domestic Federal energy source from the EIS requirement. The House bill included provisions for leasing ANWR lands for oil and gas drilling, with bids submitted as sealed competitive bids. One unique provision required the first lease sale to be for at least 200,000 acres. The House bill included provisions for leasing ANWR lands for oil and gas drilling, with bids submitted as sealed competitive bids. The first lease sale must be for at least 200,000 acres, with additional sales to be conducted based on interest in development. The State of Alaska would receive 50 percent of ANWR leasing revenues, with the remainder divided between a Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund and miscellaneous receipts in the U.S. Treasury. Other provisions include reducing royalty rates for oil and gas production on \"marginal properties\" and reinstating terminated leases under certain conditions. The Secretary of the Interior must conduct a study on split estates, while the Secretary of Energy must study petroleum and natural gas storage capacity. Coalbed methane (CBM) is a natural gas trapped in coal seams, extracted by decreasing water pressure. CBM production increased significantly in the 1990s, becoming a new natural gas source. The Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that CBM could be leased separately from coal. Environmental groups, developers, and BLM are in litigation over compliance with FLPMA and NEPA in CBM development. In the context of CBM development, compliance with FLPMA and NEPA has been a subject of litigation in federal courts and the Interior Board of Land Appeals. Environmental groups challenged a BLM decision to issue CBM leases to Pennaco, citing issues with NEPA requirements and environmental impacts of CBM extraction. Environmental groups alleged that BLM did not adequately assess the environmental impacts of issuing Pennaco leases for CBM development. The Interior Board of Land Appeals agreed, stating that the Buffalo RMP/EIS was insufficient as it did not specifically address the unique impacts of CBM extraction, such as increased water production and air quality concerns. The IBLA found that the Wyodak DEIS did not satisfy NEPA due to being a post-leasing analysis, which did not consider reasonable alternatives. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the IBLA's decision in Pennaco Energy, Inc. v. United States Department of the Interior, stating that the IBLA's conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. This case is significant in applying FLPMA and NEPA to CBM development. In Northern Plains Resource Council, Inc. v. United States Bureau of Land Management, BLM approved APDs for CBM wells based on FONSIs without preparing an EIS, despite earlier environmental studies indicating further studies were needed for commercial production. The court rejected the argument that the original RMP and EIS were inadequate for CBM development, stating that the APDs were for test wells within the scope of exploratory drilling. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision due to procedural grounds and statute of limitations. In subsequent litigation, the plaintiff challenged a new statewide EIS and proposed RMP amendments allowing full-field CBM development. The court agreed with one of the plaintiff's arguments, stating that BLM should have considered a phased development alternative. However, the court also ruled that BLM was justified in conducting two separate studies of the area. In another case, plaintiffs argued that BLM had acted arbitrarily by approving CBM wells at twice the density contemplated in existing environmental documents. The plaintiffs challenged BLM's approval of CBM development, arguing that a new EIS or SEIS should have been created to address cumulative environmental impacts. They also claimed BLM violated FLPMA by approving development that did not conform to the RMP. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and IBLA decisions have addressed similar issues in the past. The IBLA ruled that BLM's water quality analysis for CBM development was inadequate and should have considered cumulative environmental impacts of new wells. In a previous case, the IBLA emphasized the importance of considering potential impacts of oil and gas exploration when leasing public lands. The IBLA decision on CBM development stated that surface occupancy stipulations commit to allowing surface-disturbing activity. The appellants failed to prove that CBM development would have different environmental impacts compared to conventional oil and gas development. Evidence showed that the coalbeds in question were deep underground with limited water production potential, suggesting minimal environmental impacts from CBM extraction in that area."
