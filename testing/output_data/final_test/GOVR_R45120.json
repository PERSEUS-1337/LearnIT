    "content": "The Latin American and Caribbean region has seen significant political and economic development over the past three decades. Most countries in the region have transitioned from authoritarian regimes to elected democracies. Free and fair elections are now the norm, although some have been controversial. In 2017, successful elections were held in the Bahamas, Ecuador, and Chile. In 2017, Honduras faced irregularities in elections, leading to calls for new elections. Despite protests, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was declared the winner. In 2018, nine countries in the region held elections, with Venezuela's being flawed due to opposition boycott. Cuba also underwent a political transition in April. Despite improvements in political rights and civil liberties, many countries in the region still struggle with delivering public services, accountability, transparency, and citizen safety. Several elected presidents have faced early ousters due to social turmoil, economic crises, autocratic actions, and corruption scandals. Organized crime has contributed to the erosion of democracy in some countries. Organized crime, especially in Mexico and Central American countries, has increased due to the region's use as a drug transit zone, leading to corruption, crime, and violence. Another factor impacting democracy is the abuse of power by executives, seen in Venezuela with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro suppressing opposition and manipulating state institutions. Media freedom has declined in some countries due to organized crime-related violence and political attempts to control independent media. In 2018, political challenges were seen in various countries. Peru's president resigned amid corruption charges, Nicaragua faced violent suppression of protests, Brazil elected far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro raising concerns for democracy, and Guatemala saw protests against efforts to expel the U.N.-backed commission. In its 2018 report, Freedom House categorized countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as free, partly free, or not free. Cuba and Venezuela were ranked as not free, while 10 countries were ranked as partly free. Positive developments were noted in Ecuador and Colombia, with Ecuador's President Len\u00edn Moreno praised for reforms including easing media pressure and proposing term limit restoration. Colombia also implemented reform measures to limit pretrial. In February 2018, the Freedom House report praised Colombia for reform measures to limit pretrial detention and expand state control in former rebel areas. However, concerning developments were noted in Venezuela, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico. Venezuela was criticized for descending into dictatorship and a humanitarian crisis, Bolivia for overturning presidential term limits, and Honduras for flawed elections. Freedom House criticized Nicaragua for flawed municipal elections in 2017 favoring President Daniel Ortega's party. In Mexico, extensive state surveillance against journalists and activists was revealed. The Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index classifies countries based on electoral process, civil liberties, and government functioning. The Economist Intelligence Unit's democracy index evaluates countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, excluding small English-speaking Caribbean nations. In 2017, Cuba and Venezuela were classified as authoritarian regimes due to government suppression of opposition protests. In 2018, Nicaragua was added to the list for human rights violations and deaths during government repression. Five countries in the region were classified in the 2018 index. The 2018 EIU index classified countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with some as hybrid regimes, full democracies, and flawed democracies. Governments in the region face corruption and organized crime, leading to declining confidence in democracy. Populism has resurfaced in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico and Brazil, disillusioned voters turned to populist candidates to address issues. The 1990s saw a shift towards export promotion, attracting foreign capital, and privatizing state enterprises. Latin America faced economic challenges in 2002 and 2009 due to global economic crises, with countries like Mexico being hit hardest. In the 2010s, Latin America experienced economic growth but began to decline annually after 2011. The region was significantly affected by the global decline in commodity prices, China's economic slowdown, and reduced appetite for imports. Economic growth returned in 2017 with 1.3% growth, and in 2018, growth declined slightly to 1.1%. The IMF projected growth to increase to 2% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020. Latin America made significant progress in combating poverty and inequality from 2002 through 2014. In 2002, almost 45% of the region's population lived in poverty, but by 2014 that figure had dropped to 27.8%, representing 164 million people. Extreme poverty also declined over this period, from 11.2% in 2002 to 7.8% in 2014. Factors contributing to this decline included increasing per capita income levels and targeted public expenditures, such as conditional cash transfer programs. Since 2015, the poverty rate for Latin America increased to 30.2% of the region's population. The poverty rate in Latin America increased to 30.2% in 2017, affecting 184 million people. Extreme poverty also rose to 10.2%, impacting 62 million individuals. Economic setbacks in Brazil and Venezuela were major contributors to this reversal in poverty reduction. However, some countries like Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Paraguay saw a decrease in poverty levels between 2016 and 2017. U.S. interests in the region include economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns due to strong economic linkages. The United States has strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, being a major trading partner and source of foreign investment. Free-trade agreements have enhanced economic relations with 11 countries in the region. Latin American nations, including Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia, supply almost 28% of imported crude oil to the United States. Immigration from the region, both legal and illegal, is influenced by geographic proximity and economic and security conditions. Curbing illicit drug flow from the region has been a key focus of U.S. relations for over three decades, leading to close security cooperation with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Obama Administration focused on promoting economic and social opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite progress in democratic development, authoritarian rule persists in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. The US has strong economic ties with the region, including trade agreements and cooperation on combating drug trafficking. Under President Obama, the Administration continued policies similar to the George W. Bush Administration in Latin America. Emphasis was placed on partnership, shared responsibility, and mutual respect through engagement and dialogue. Significant support was provided to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, including initiatives like Plan Colombia, the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. In response to a surge of migrants from Central America, the U.S. Strategy for was developed in 2015. The Obama Administration developed the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to improve security, governance, and prosperity. They resolved trade concerns with Colombia and Panama, enacted FTAs in 2011, and negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2015. President Obama implemented DACA in 2012 to provide relief for certain immigrant children. The Obama Administration implemented DACA in 2012 to provide relief for certain immigrant children and granted Temporary Protected Status to Haitians after the 2010 earthquake. They also shifted towards engagement with Cuba and pressed for dialogue in Venezuela. The Trump Administration has changed the dynamics of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. The Trump Administration's policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean reflects continuity with long-standing U.S. objectives, but is at odds with some actions on immigration, trade, and foreign aid. President Trump's cancellation of the Summit of the Americas was a missed opportunity, with Vice President Pence attending instead. The Administration proposed significant cuts in assistance to the region, deviating from past practices. President Trump's policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean includes significant cuts in assistance to the region, deviating from past practices. He shifted focus from free trade agreements to renegotiating new agreements, describing past agreements as detrimental to U.S. workers and industries. The Administration's actions on immigration, trade, and foreign aid are at odds with long-standing U.S. objectives. President Trump's policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean includes significant cuts in assistance to the region and a shift from free trade agreements. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criticized NAFTA, leading to the proposed USMCA. The Administration's imposition of duties on steel and aluminum imports in 2018 added challenges to U.S. trade relations with the region. Relations with Mexico have been strained due to anti-immigrant rhetoric and calls for changes in trade agreements. Despite tensions over immigration and trade agreements, overall U.S.-Mexican relations remain cooperative, with a focus on security cooperation and economic ties, including energy cooperation. The Trump Administration's actions on immigration, such as terminating TPS for several Central American and Caribbean countries, have raised concerns in the region about their capacity to receive deportees. The Trump Administration's immigration actions, including terminating TPS for Central American and Caribbean countries, have raised concerns about deportations' effects on economies. Court challenges have temporarily halted TPS terminations for Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador. Other policies, like \"zero tolerance\" for illegal border crossings and restrictions on asylum claims related to gang violence or domestic abuse, may limit Central American migrants' ability to seek asylum. Additionally, President Trump rolled back some Obama-era efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in June 2017. The State Department made significant changes to U.S. policy towards Cuba, including restrictions on financial transactions with the Cuban military and the elimination of individual people-to-people travel. The staff at embassies in both capitals was downsized in response to unexplained injuries of U.S. personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. Additionally, a multiyear strategy was issued for U.S. policy towards the Caribbean region, focusing on security, diplomacy, prosperity, energy, education, and health. The United States provided $23 million in humanitarian relief assistance to Caribbean countries and territories after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Trump Administration has provided relief assistance to Caribbean countries and foreign territories, imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela, and supported regional efforts to resolve the situation. Additional sanctions on trade with Venezuela are being considered, but concerns exist about exacerbating the humanitarian situation. In Nicaragua, the Administration has spoken out against President Ortega's authoritarian rule amidst growing political unrest. The Trump Administration has taken a strong stance against authoritarian rule in Nicaragua and Guatemala, supporting measures such as targeted sanctions and the role of the U.N.'s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. However, there are concerns about the Administration not speaking out strongly enough against efforts to weaken the Commission in Guatemala. The State Department expressed support for combating corruption in Guatemala through a reformed CICIG, despite President Morales' decision to expel the commission. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala raised concerns about the future of anticorruption efforts in the country. The Trump Administration also warned about the influence of China and Russia in the region. The Administration's 2017 National Security Strategy warns of China and Russia's influence in Latin America, citing their support for dictatorships in Venezuela and Cuba. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised concerns about China's foothold in the region and Russia's growing presence, particularly their arms sales to unfriendly regimes. The White House reevaluated U.S. relations with El Salvador after it switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in August 2018. The State Department recalled U.S. chiefs of mission from the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Panama for consultations regarding their decisions to switch recognition. The Trump Administration's policy towards China in the region differs from previous administrations, emphasizing engagement and consultations. U.S. warnings about China's influence have been met with skepticism in Latin America. The Trump Administration's policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean emphasizes that \"America First\" does not mean America alone. Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the interconnectedness of prosperity and security between the region and the United States. He identified transnational crime, particularly drug trafficking, as a significant security threat and pledged continued U.S. support to combat it. In February 2018, then-Secretary of State Tillerson further outlined the administration's framework for U.S. policy in the region. The Trump Administration's policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on economic growth, security, and democratic governance. These pillars align with long-standing U.S. policy objectives in the region and were emphasized by Vice President Pence and USAID Director Mark Green. The administration aims to combat transnational crime, particularly drug trafficking, and promote a \"hemisphere of freedom.\" The State Department's policy framework for U.S. policy towards Latin America contradicts some of President Trump's rhetoric and efforts to reduce foreign assistance. Views of U.S. leadership in the region have dropped due to political rhetoric and actions on immigration and trade, affecting cooperation on regional and global challenges. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned about oppressive forces and socialism in a speech in Miami. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned about oppressive forces and socialism in Latin America, labeling Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela as the \"troika of tyranny.\" The Administration increased economic sanctions on these countries, citing human suffering, regional instability, and communism as reasons. The 115th Congress traditionally plays an active role in policy towards the region, especially in areas like immigration and trade. The 115th Congress rejected proposed cuts in foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by the Trump Administration for FY2018. They provided $1.7 billion in foreign aid, 55% more than requested. For FY2019, bills were reported out to fund key countries and initiatives at levels similar to FY2017. The Congress approved short-term continuing resolutions for FY2019 foreign aid appropriations at FY2018 levels. Full-year FY2019 funding was left for the 116th Congress to address. The 115th Congress did not complete action on appropriations measures tightening economic sanctions on Cuba. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019 extended a prohibition on closing the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay. The 115th Congress enacted the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018, requiring the US to vote against loans to Nicaragua and authorizing sanctions for human rights violations and corruption. The bill also directed the Defense Intelligence Agency to report on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The 115th Congress passed the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018, which mandated the US to vote against loans to Nicaragua and impose sanctions for human rights violations and corruption. Additionally, the bill required a report on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. In a separate action, the House approved H.R. 2658 in December 2017, authorizing humanitarian aid for Venezuela. Various resolutions were passed by both houses on US policy towards the region, including calls for the release of political prisoners, support for dialogue, and urging Venezuela to hold free and fair elections. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs approved H.Res. 1006 condemning the situation in Venezuela and seeking House consideration under suspension of the rules. The Senate passed S.Res. 83 calling for support to stop illicit fentanyl trafficking from Mexico and China. The House passed H.Res. 336 reaffirming a strong partnership with Mexico. Resolutions were also passed regarding Argentina's economic reforms and combating corruption in Central America. The House passed resolutions condemning violence in Nicaragua and reaffirming support for combating corruption in Central America. The United States provides foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean to support development and strategic interests in the region. The Trump Administration has emphasized different priorities over the years, from combating Soviet influence to promoting democracy and open markets. The Trump Administration has proposed significant cuts to U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a requested reduction of $590 million (35%) compared to the FY2018 estimate. This includes cuts to various types of assistance and aid for every nation in the region. The Administration's FY2019 budget proposal also aims to eliminate the Inter-American Foundation. The FY2019 budget proposal includes cuts to U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a reduction of $590 million (35%) compared to FY2018. The proposal also aims to eliminate the Inter-American Foundation. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, providing $1.7 billion for foreign assistance in the region, which is $607 million more than requested for FY2018. The 115th Congress did not complete action on foreign aid appropriations for FY2019. The FY2019 budget proposal includes cuts to U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a reduction of $590 million (35%) compared to FY2018. The bills H.R. 6385 and S. 3108 proposed significant funding for key U.S. initiatives in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America, exceeding the Administration's request. However, both bills did not receive floor consideration, and funding for foreign aid programs in the region expired on December 21, 2018. The Caribbean and Latin America are key in U.S. counternarcotics policy due to being sources of illicit drugs like cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, and opioids. Concerns include rising heroin abuse, opioid-related deaths, and cocaine overdoses in the U.S. Colombia supplies 90% of cocaine to the U.S., with record levels of coca cultivation and production in 2017. Mexico has seen an increase in opium poppy cultivation and heroin and fentanyl production. Transit countries in the region collaborate with the United States to combat drug production and intercept illicit flows, but Venezuela does not. Public corruption in Venezuela facilitates drug trafficking. Drug trafficking and transnational crime syndicates have led to security and economic challenges in some countries, resulting in high levels of violence. Many governments in Latin America, especially in the Central American transit zone, struggle with overwhelmed law enforcement and border control agencies due to the drug trade. Government corruption hampers efforts to combat drug trafficking and recover illicit proceeds. The ongoing crime and violence problems in the Western Hemisphere are largely blamed on the continuing U.S. demand for illicit drugs. Criminal gangs like Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and the \"18th Street\" gang from southern California are undermining citizen security in Central America. Gang-related violence, particularly in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, has led to some of the highest homicide rates globally. These gangs are involved in various criminal activities such as extortion, money laundering, and weapons smuggling, but generally do not partake in transnational drug trafficking. The United States has been supporting efforts to counter drug trafficking in Latin America for over 40 years, with a focus on countries like Colombia. The most significant program was Plan Colombia, which provided over $10 billion to combat drug trafficking and rebel groups. After signing a peace accord, Colombia shifted to a new strategy called Peace Colombia, causing tensions with the U.S. over aerial fumigation. Colombian President Ivan Duque plans to resume aerial fumigation. Colombian President Ivan Duque has vowed to resume aerial fumigation as part of U.S. efforts to combat drug trafficking in Latin America. The U.S. has various partnerships in the region, such as the M\u00e9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI, focusing on security cooperation and combating criminal groups. The Trump Administration's approach emphasizes security objectives, with assistance programs targeting drug trafficking and gangs. The Trump Administration has prioritized combating gangs, particularly MS-13, and reducing funding for U.S. security assistance programs. U.S. law enforcement agencies, with support from Central American units funded through CARSI, have brought charges against thousands of MS-13 members. The 115th Congress held hearings on opioids, Mexican drug production, Colombia's peace process, criminal groups in the Western Hemisphere, and Mexican transnational criminal organizations. In March 2017, the Senate passed S.Res. 83 calling for increased U.S. support for Mexico's anti-drug efforts. The Senate passed S.Res. 83, calling for increased U.S. support for Mexico's efforts to combat fentanyl. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided increased resources for Colombia and Mexico, stable funding for CBSI, and required a plan on addressing illicit opioid flows. The FY2019 foreign aid appropriations bills maintained funding for security partnerships and addressed underlying conditions contributing to crime and violence. Congress will continue to oversee counternarcotics and antigang programs and consider the distribution of drug control funding. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of drug control funding and the roles of civilian, law enforcement, and military in antidrug efforts. It references various reports on security cooperation in Mexico, organized crime, drug trafficking, and U.S. engagement in Central America and Colombia. The Latin American and Caribbean region is a significant trading partner for the United States, with strong economic relations despite challenges like NAFTA renegotiation and diplomatic tensions. The US accounts for a large portion of the region's merchandise imports and exports, with Mexico being the main trading partner. The United States has strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean through FTAs, including NAFTA. These agreements have influenced future trade agreements on various issues like intellectual property rights, services trade, agriculture, and more. The United States has extended trade preferences to some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through programs like the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and the Generalized System of Preferences. GSP was reauthorized in 2018. Some countries in South America resisted forming comprehensive FTAs with the US after NAFTA, leading to other trade agreements in the region. President Trump's shift in U.S. trade policy towards the Western Hemisphere has led to the renegotiation of NAFTA. The United States, Mexico, and Canada reached an agreement in September 2018, resulting in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This comes as other countries in the region, such as the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur, are also pursuing trade arrangements. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed by the leaders of all three countries on November 30, 2018. The agreement must be approved by Congress and ratified by Canada and Mexico before it can take effect. It updates provisions on intellectual property rights, labor and environmental standards, digital trade, corruption, and state-owned enterprises. President Trump's trade actions in 2018 on aluminum and steel imports added challenges to U.S. trade relations with the region. President Trump imposed tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports, with exemptions for Argentina and Brazil. Mexico retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. The USMCA did not address the tariffs, and Trump's withdrawal from the TPP affected U.S. trade policy. In March 2018, Mexico, Peru, and Chile signed the CPTPP, which came into force among the first six countries. Colombia plans to join later. U.S. withdrawal from TPP could impact competitiveness. The 115th Congress faced trade policy issues. The 115th Congress, in its legislative and oversight capacities, dealt with trade policy issues related to NAFTA renegotiation. The proposed USMCA now requires congressional approval, with a focus on U.S. negotiating objectives, impact on industries like autos, U.S. and Mexican economies, supply chains, and trade relations with the LAC region. Congress also faces issues from Section 232 investigations on aluminum and steel imports, including potential tariffs and retaliatory measures from Mexico. Energy reform in Mexico is another factor to consider. Mexico's energy reform and its impact on U.S. trade and investment, along with concerns about U.S. market share in countries like Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, could lead to increased intra-trade and investment among other countries like Argentina, Brazil, and China. This may affect U.S. exports and trade policy perceptions in the region. Latin America's status as a leading source of both legal and unauthorized migration to the United States significantly impacts U.S. immigration policies and relations with the region's governments. Unauthorized migrants from Latin America often benefit from programs like Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The Trump Administration's U.S. immigration policy changes, including ending TPS designations and DACA, have raised concerns in Latin America. Factors driving migration from the region to the U.S. include familial ties, poverty, political instability, and crime. Venezuela has emerged as a top country of origin for U.S. asylum seekers due to its crisis. The Trump Administration's tough immigration policies led to a decline in unauthorized migrants at the U.S. border initially, but numbers began to rise again in 2017. President Trump's focus on border security and the construction of a wall strained relations with Mexico. Venezuela has become a major origin country for U.S. asylum seekers due to its crisis. The Trump Administration's immigration policies strained relations with Mexico and other countries in the region. Central American countries are concerned about potential large-scale removals overwhelming their capacity. Mexico and northern triangle countries are providing services at their U.S. consulates to assist those affected by changes in U.S. immigration policies. The Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to terminate TPS designations for six countries since September 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to end TPS designations for six countries, including four in Latin America. There is debate over extending TPS for Central Americans due to their long U.S. residence and ties. The Trump Administration argues that ending TPS aligns with the program's original intent. A federal court injunction has temporarily halted the termination for Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador. The Trump Administration's decisions to terminate TPS designations for four countries in Latin America are predicted to have negative effects on mixed-status families and foreign relations. Affected governments are hoping for legislative protection for their constituents and are preparing reintegration assistance for former TPS beneficiaries. Additionally, the DHS announced the rescission of the DACA initiative, with its future uncertain due to ongoing lawsuits. The DACA initiative faces legal challenges in federal courts, with concerns about the potential impact on Latin American-born recipients, especially those from Mexico. The Mexican government hopes for legislative protection for DACA beneficiaries but is also prepared to support those who may be deported. Additionally, there is a zero-tolerance policy on illegal border crossings, affecting Central American migrant families seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. In May 2018, DOJ implemented a zero tolerance policy for illegal border crossing, prosecuting all adults without exception. This led to the separation of up to 3,000 children from their parents. After a court order for reunification, DHS reverted to previous immigration policies. Attorney General Sessions' decision in June 2018 could limit Central American migrants' ability to qualify for asylum in the U.S. The availability of asylum in the United States for Central Americans facing femicide and gang-related violence may lead to increased emigration to Mexico and other less equipped countries. Mexico has strengthened its humanitarian protection system while deporting over 520,000 Central American migrants from 2015 to November 2018. Despite not signing a \"safe third country agreement\" with the US, Mexico has provided humanitarian visas, work permits, and asylum to Central American migrants, including those affected by a new DHS policy announced in December 2018. In 2018, DHS announced plans to return non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico while Congress provided foreign assistance to address migration from Central America. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed transferring funds to help process asylum applications in Mexico. The 116th Congress may consider similar provisions for foreign aid funding in FY2019. The 115th Congress did not determine funding for border infrastructure for FY2019. Various proposals related to TPS and DACA were introduced but not enacted. For more information, see CRS reports on immigration control efforts, U.S. strategy in Central America, zero tolerance policy, DACA FAQs, discretionary reprieves, and temporary protected status. Corruption has become a serious issue. Corruption has become a serious political concern in many Latin American countries, with perceptions of increasing corruption fueling civil society efforts for government accountability. The use of social media and increased scrutiny by media, investors, and congressional bodies have led to a greater awareness of corrupt behavior. This heightened awareness was evident in elections across the region in 2018. Corruption in Latin America is a significant concern, with politicians, political parties, and police being viewed as the most corrupt by citizens. Venezuela was perceived as the most corrupt country in the region in 2016 and 2017. Public corruption has had a negative impact on the economy, especially in Venezuela's foreign exchange regime. Brazil is also facing a widespread corruption investigation. In Brazil, a corruption investigation since 2014 implicated the political class, with Odebrecht admitting to paying $735 million in bribes. Corruption in Mexico reportedly costs up to 5% of GDP annually, affecting the Institutional Revolutionary Party in the 2018 elections. In Peru, President Kuczynski resigned over Odebrecht bribes, succeeded by Vizcarra who focused on fighting corruption. In April 2018, Vizcarra hosted the Summit of the Americas with a focus on fighting corruption. Following a judicial corruption scandal, he introduced political and judicial reforms in August 2018. Vizcarra challenged Peru's congress in September 2018 to approve the reforms, which were later put to a public referendum in December 2018. The majority of the measures passed, including reforms to the magistracy council and campaign finance rules. In Central America, international entities have collaborated with Guatemala and Honduras to combat corruption. The U.N.'s International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala helped prosecute former President Otto Perez-Molina and his vice president for corruption. The OAS also assisted Honduras in establishing the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity. Guatemala's President Morales has become hostile towards extending the mandate of CICIG, leading to tensions with the organization. In early January 2019, President Morales of Guatemala ended CICIG's mandate prematurely, defying the nation's top court. The U.S. supports anticorruption efforts in Central America due to concerns about criminals thriving in corrupt governments. Since FY2016, U.S. aid to Central America has been tied to anticorruption measures. Assistance has supported efforts in Guatemala and Honduras, including funding for CICIG and MACCIH. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on corrupt individuals, including Venezuelan officials. Congressional analysts note limited funding for anticorruption programs, with worldwide spending not exceeding $115 million annually. Congress has taken steps to condition U.S. assistance, support anticorruption efforts, and back the Trump Administration's use of targeted sanctions. They could oversee changes to NAFTA related to corruption in the proposed USMCA. In May 2017, the House passed H.Res. 145 reaffirming the importance of combatting corruption in Central America. In July 2017, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reported a bill focused on combating public corruption worldwide. The FY2019 NDAA contains a provision requiring a report on drug trafficking and corruption in Central America's northern triangle countries. Congress has supported funding for CICIG and MACCIH in FY2018 and FY2019. President Mauricio Macri won the 2015 presidential election, ending 12 years of rule by the Kirchners. President Macri succeeded the Kirchners, implementing market-oriented economic policies and resolving the country's default status, leading to economic growth in 2017. Argentina's economic growth in 2017 was followed by a downturn in 2018 due to factors like a severe drought and high inflation. The government sought IMF support, receiving a $50 billion program in June and increasing it to $57 billion by 2021. Despite protests over austerity measures, Argentina received additional funds from the IMF in October 2018. Argentina's economic downturn in 2018 led to IMF support totaling $20.4 billion. President Macri's popularity has waned, potentially impacting his reelection bid in 2019. The Peronist party remains divided, with a moderate faction candidate posing a strong challenge. Macri's government improved relations with neighboring countries and criticized the Maduro government in Venezuela. U.S.-Argentine relations focus on commercial ties and cooperation on various issues. Under the Kirchner governments, there were periodic tensions in relations. The Obama Administration engaged the Macri government on various issues. Strong bilateral relations continue under the Trump Administration, with a focus on expanding trade, combating illicit activities, and establishing a working group for cyber issues. President Trump reaffirmed U.S. support for Argentina amid economic difficulties and held a bilateral meeting with President Macri in November 2018. During a bilateral meeting in Argentina on November 30, 2018, Trump and President Macri reached agreements on educational exchange programs, national park conservation, health cooperation, aviation safety, and energy sector cooperation. Congress has shown support for the bilateral partnership, providing $2.5 million in FY2018 foreign assistance to support Argentina's counterterrorism efforts. The US has expressed concern about Argentina's progress in investigating two terrorist bombings in Buenos Aires\u2014the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA). Resolutions have been proposed to support Argentina's investigation and commend the work of AMIA special prosecutor Alberto Nisman. For more information, refer to CRS reports on Argentina. Brazil, the fifth-largest and fifth-most populous country in the world, has significant natural resources. Brazil, the fifth-largest and fifth-most populous country in the world, has the potential to become a world power due to its size and natural resources. Despite setbacks like military rule and economic challenges, Brazil transitioned to a liberal democracy and implemented reforms in the 1990s for stronger growth. A boom in international demand for Brazilian commodities fueled rapid economic expansion, strengthening Brazil's middle class and international stature. However, in recent years, Brazil has faced struggles in emerging from economic difficulties. Brazil has faced economic challenges in recent years, with a contraction in the economy from 2014 to 2016 due to global commodity price declines and government mismanagement. Despite a return to economic growth in 2017, the national unemployment rate remains high, and millions of Brazilians who fell out of the middle class during the recession are still in poverty. A corruption scandal involving politicians and business executives has fueled discontent with the political class, leading to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and unpopular economic reforms under President Michel Temer. The United States has strong political and economic relations with Brazil, but disagreements have arisen over trade policies. Despite friction over import quotas on Brazilian steel, the countries are increasing cooperation in areas such as security and humanitarian assistance to Venezuelan migrants. Discussions are ongoing regarding potential U.S. access to Brazil's Alc\u00e2ntara space launch. During the 115th Congress, concerns were raised about democracy and human rights in Brazil, including the assassination of Marielle Franco and the imprisonment of former president Lula da Silva. U.S. support for conservation efforts in Brazil was also continued through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. President Bolsonaro has called for closer alignment with the United States, leading to discussions on bolstering commercial and defense ties and working together on global issues. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $10.5 million for environmental programs in the Brazilian Amazon. FY2019 foreign aid appropriations measures in the House and Senate would have continued this assistance, with the House bill providing $10.5 million and the Senate bill providing $11 million. The Caribbean region consists of 16 independent countries and 18 overseas territories, including some of the hemisphere's richest and poorest nations. The State Department submitted a multiyear strategy for the Caribbean in June 2017, focusing on strengthening U.S.-Caribbean relations in six priority areas: security, diplomacy, prosperity, energy, and education. The United States launched the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) in 2009 to reduce illicit drug trafficking, promote public safety, and support social development in the region. Congress has allocated almost $559 million for the CBSI from FY2010 through FY2018. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) received almost $559 million in funding from FY2010 through FY2018. The program benefitted 13 Caribbean countries with targeted assistance in areas such as security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention. Additionally, the United States launched the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) in 2014 to promote a cleaner and more sustainable energy future in the region. In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused widespread damage in the Caribbean, especially in the Eastern Caribbean. Hurricane Irma devastated Barbuda, with 95% of structures damaged. Hurricane Maria killed 27 people in Dominica and caused severe structural and agricultural damage. The United States provided almost $23 million in humanitarian funding to six Caribbean countries and territories affected by the hurricanes. The Trump Administration requested a decrease in funding for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) for FY2018 and FY2019. Congress maintained funding at $57.7 million for FY2018, as outlined in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. Both the House and Senate rejected proposed cuts for FY2019, with the House bill providing $58 million and the Senate bill providing $57.7 million for the CBSI. The Senate bill provided $57.7 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and $2 million for enhanced efforts in Latin American and Caribbean countries. The 115th Congress did not complete action on FY2019 appropriations, leaving final decisions to the 116th Congress. In July 2017, the House Western Hemisphere Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on the State Department's new multiyear strategy on the Caribbean. Central America has become a major transit corridor for illicit drugs and irregular migration to the United States, stemming from deep-rooted challenges like insecurity, weak political and judicial systems, and high poverty levels. The Obama Administration prioritized working with Central American nations to enhance security, governance, and prosperity in the region. The Obama Administration launched a new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, requesting increased foreign assistance for the region. Congress allocated $1.5 billion in aid for Central America, with conditions for the Northern Triangle countries to improve security, combat corruption, and protect human rights. The Trump Administration has maintained this strategy while making some policy changes. The Trump Administration has implemented changes in U.S. policy towards Central America, including cutting foreign aid, emphasizing security concerns, and making immigration policy changes. The Northern Triangle governments are concerned that reducing assistance and increasing deportations could worsen poverty and instability in the region. Despite some progress in stabilizing their economies with U.S. support, challenges remain. The Northern Triangle countries have implemented policy changes to stabilize their economies, but living conditions have not improved due to a lack of effective poverty-reduction programs. While security conditions have improved with declining homicide rates, they still face high levels of violent crime and widespread impunity. Attorneys general, supported by international commissions, have made progress in prosecuting high-level corruption cases, facing backlash in Guatemala and Honduras. The 115th Congress supported the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America but reduced funding for the initiative. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $626.5 million for the Central America strategy, more than requested but less than the previous year. FY2019 foreign aid appropriations measures would have provided $595 and $515.5 million to continue implementing the strategy. The Trump Administration's efforts have faced opposition from the Guatemalan and Honduran governments. The Trump Administration requested $435.5 million for Central America in FY2019. Bills introduced during the 115th Congress aimed to guide U.S. policy and address corruption concerns in the region. Congress approved provisions to support anticorruption efforts and called for the independence of attorneys general in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision requiring the Secretary of State to report the names of Salvadoran and Guatemalan officials. Some Members of Congress called for sanctions on corrupt officials in the Northern Triangle and appropriated funding for anticorruption efforts in the region. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for CICIG and MACCIH. There were efforts to suspend U.S. funding for CICIG due to allegations of persecution of Russian dissidents. The U.S. State Department found no evidence supporting allegations of CICIG persecuting Russian dissidents. Funding for CICIG, MACCIH, and attorneys general recommended in FY2019 foreign aid appropriations measures. Colombia is a key U.S. ally in Latin America. Colombia, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has a strong partnership with the United States focused on counternarcotics and counterterrorism. Plan Colombia, a program initiated over two decades ago, received over $10 billion in assistance from the U.S. Congress between FY2000 and FY2016. Originally a 6-year strategy, it evolved into a 17-year framework to address conflict, drug trafficking, and development in Colombia. Plan Colombia, a 17-year U.S.-Colombian bilateral effort, aimed to address drug trafficking and promote development. Despite being considered a U.S. foreign policy success, critics highlight enduring issues such as illegal drug exports, uneven development, and ongoing violence against human rights activists. Revenue from drug trafficking funded various armed groups in Colombia, leading to a long-standing conflict. In August 2018, Iv\u00e1n Duque, a member of the Democratic Center party, became Colombia's new president, succeeding Juan Manuel Santos. Duque inherited a controversial peace agreement with FARC, which was the central legacy of Santos. The CD party, led by Duque, was critical of the peace accord. In March 2018, the CD party became the dominant party in the legislative elections. In September 2018, President Duque outlined his policy goals at the U.N. General Assembly, denouncing Maduro's authoritarian government and proposing a lead role in containing the damage. Colombia faces challenges with coca cultivation and cocaine production, contributing to regional issues. Colombia's potential cocaine production in 2017 reached nearly 1,370 metric tons, with exports primarily to the U.S. market. Despite economic stability and improved security, concerns remain for U.S. lawmakers due to the demobilization of former FARC members. Key issues in the U.S.-Colombian relationship include implementing the peace accord with the FARC, fighting organized crime, and reducing corruption. Efforts are being made to address the spike in assassinations of social leaders and human rights defenders. In early January 2019, President Duque and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed cooperation on counternarcotics, peace accord implementation, and trade. Pompeo pledged U.S. assistance to Colombia to reduce coca production by 50% by 2023. Congress allocated $391.3 million in FY2017 and FY2018 for programs in Colombia to support peace accord implementation, address inequalities, reintegrate demobilized fighters, and combat cocaine production. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request for Colombia was $265 million, a 32% decrease from FY2018 funds allocated by Congress. Both the House and Senate appropriations bills aim to maintain funding at $391.3 million, focusing on post-conflict recovery, counternarcotics, and security. Colombia has also received U.S. humanitarian funding to assist over 1 million Venezuelan migrants, with approximately $96.5 million allocated for the Venezuela response, including $54.8 million for Colombia. Cuba remains a one-party authoritarian state with a poor record on human rights. First Vice President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018, marking the first time since the 1959 Cuban revolution that a Castro is not in charge of the government. Cuba has implemented gradual market-oriented economic policy changes over the past decade. Cuba under President D\u00edaz-Canel faces challenges in implementing economic reforms and addressing calls for greater freedom. The country is rewriting its constitution, with proposed changes including an appointed prime minister, age and term limits for the president, and some market-oriented reforms. However, the new constitution would still maintain state dominance in the economy and the Communist Party's political control. The U.S. Congress has influenced policy towards Cuba through legislation on economic sanctions. The Obama Administration shifted U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014, moving away from sanctions towards engagement. This included restoring diplomatic relations, lifting Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and increasing travel and commerce. However, President Trump reversed some of these efforts in 2017 by increasing sanctions and restricting transactions with companies controlled by the Cuban military. The State Department reduced staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana due to unexplained injuries to U.S. diplomatic members. Congressional debate on Cuba policy continued in the 115th Congress, with a provision in the 2018 farm bill allowing funding for U.S. agricultural export promotion programs in Cuba. Other bills tightening economic sanctions were introduced but not completed by the end of the Congress. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to ease or lift sanctions on Cuba, but were not acted upon. Congress also provided funding for democracy and human rights assistance in Cuba, as well as U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting. The Trump Administration requested $10 million for democracy assistance and $13.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2019. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for democracy programs and broadcasting. The 115th Congress approved continuing resolutions for FY2019 funding at FY2018 levels. Several measures extended a prohibition on funding to close or relinquish control of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Trump Administration requested funding for democracy assistance and Cuba broadcasting in FY2019. The 115th Congress approved continuing resolutions for FY2019 funding at FY2018 levels. Measures extended a prohibition on funding to close or relinquish control of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Additionally, there are requirements for reports on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Cuban airport security, and efforts to track public air charter flights between the United States and Cuba. The Senate approved a resolution commemorating Cuban democracy activist Oswaldo Pay\u00e1. President Jovenel Mo\u00efse is completing his second year. President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, in his second year in office, faces challenges with a divided congress and ongoing investigations into money laundering allegations. Widespread corruption has hindered good governance in Haiti's history. A report in 2017 implicated 15 officials, including former prime ministers and Mo\u00efse's chief of staff, in embezzlement and fraud related to $2 billion in loans from Venezuela's PetroCaribe oil program. In early 2018, an investigative judge was appointed to address citizens' complaints. In response to citizens' demands for accountability regarding the PetroCaribe corruption case, President Mo\u00efse took action by firing implicated staff members and creating a new investigative commission. The government also started implementing IMF-recommended reforms, including reducing subsidies and reallocating resources to health, education, and social services. However, protests erupted when fuel prices surged by 51% in July 2018, leading to the resignation of Mo\u00efse's prime minister and the reinstatement of subsidies. Mo\u00efse then appointed a new prime minister, Jean-Henry. Haiti's political instability and economic fragility have led to ongoing concerns for the United States. The country, the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, faces challenges exacerbated by natural disasters like the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Almost 60% of Haiti's population lives in poverty, with 25% in extreme poverty. The recent protests against subsidy reductions and corruption highlight the deep-rooted issues facing the nation. Haiti faced natural disasters like the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, worsening food supply issues and causing a cholera epidemic. Despite transitioning to reconstruction and development, the Trump Administration ended TPS for Haitian migrants in 2019, sparking protests for reinstatement. The Trump Administration ended TPS for Haitian migrants in 2019, sparking protests for reinstatement. State Department documents warned of grave consequences for national security. A U.S. district court issued an injunction against TPS termination, allowing Haitians to retain their status. Federal court proceedings began to challenge Trump's decision. The U.N. Mission for Justice Support in Haiti focuses on rule of law, police development, and human rights. The UN Mission in Haiti focused on rule of law, police development, and human rights. MINUSTAH assisted with elections, combatting gangs and drug trafficking, and responding to natural disasters. However, MINUSTAH faced criticism for sexual abuse and introducing cholera. The U.N. pledged support for cholera victims and a $400 million plan, but funding and implementation remain incomplete. Congress rejected the Trump Administration's proposed aid reduction for Haiti in FY2018, providing $184 million instead. The Haiti provisions in the Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) condition assistance on strengthening rule of law, combating corruption, and resolving commercial disputes. It allows Haiti to purchase U.S. defense articles for its Coast Guard and provides funding for cholera-affected communities, reforestation, and prison assistance. The Administration requested $170.5 million for Haiti in FY2019, with proposed reductions. The FY2019 foreign aid appropriations measure, H.R. 6385 and S. 3108, would allow the Haitian government to purchase U.S. defense articles for its Coast Guard. The House version includes conditions for assistance related to strengthening the rule of law, combating corruption, and resolving commercial disputes. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various assistance programs for Haiti. Congress approved funding for Haiti, including $1.2 million for International Military Education and Training (IMET), $1.2 million for Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and $1.75 million for cholera-affected communities. No action was taken on proposals related to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians. Congress also showed interest in Mexico as a top trade partner and energy supplier. Mexico is a key energy supplier and trade partner of the United States, with strong cultural and historical ties. The renegotiation of NAFTA led to the proposed USMCA agreement in 2018. Security issues in Mexico impact U.S. national security, especially along the border. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto completed his term in 2018, overseeing significant reforms but facing challenges with human rights abuses and corruption. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took office in December 2018 after winning the presidential elections. He aims to govern differently from previous administrations, focusing on addressing poverty and corruption. Some concerns exist about potential changes to Mexico's investor-friendly policies and relations with the United States. U.S.-Mexican relations have faced periodic tensions since 2017. Since January 2017, periodic tensions have arisen between the United States and Mexico. Both countries have focused on strengthening economic ties, combating drug trafficking, and addressing illegal migration from Central America. Despite disagreements over the border wall and immigration policies, security and migration efforts continue. Mexico has applied retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs. In response to U.S. tariffs, Mexico applied retaliatory tariffs. The 115th Congress closely followed NAFTA renegotiation and the potential impact of USMCA on the economy and U.S.-Mexican relations. Congressional actions included resolutions supporting Mexico's efforts against fentanyl, promoting bilateral cooperation, and providing funding for economic partnership and cooperation between the two countries. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, $152.6 million was provided for Mexico, with additional funds allocated to combat opioids. The Trump Administration's FY2019 request for Mexico was $78.9 million, lower than previous years. The House recommended $125 million, while the Senate suggested $169.5 million. Congressional actions included resolutions supporting Mexico's efforts against fentanyl and promoting bilateral cooperation. President Daniel Ortega, aged 72, is currently suppressing popular unrest in a manner reminiscent of Anastasio Somoza, the dictator he helped overthrow in 1979 as a \"comandante\" of the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). President Daniel Ortega, who served as president from 1985 to 1990 and was reelected in 2006, 2011, and 2016, has faced growing opposition due to his increasingly authoritarian rule despite implementing social welfare programs. Critics have raised concerns about his antidemocratic policies and self-enrichment. Ortega faced criticism for his antidemocratic policies and self-enrichment, but was able to maintain power due to weak political opposition and FSLN control. Despite his authoritarian tendencies, many supported him for his economic measures. However, attitudes shifted in 2018 when protests erupted over social security cuts proposed by Ortega, leading to unexpected unrest. The announcement of social security reforms in Nicaragua led to protests calling for early elections and Ortega's resignation. The government violently repressed the protests, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights sent experts to investigate human rights abuses. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights investigated human rights abuses in Nicaragua, concluding that security forces' actions could be crimes against humanity. Ortega was called to be investigated, leading to the expulsion of the team by government authorities. Independent news facilities were destroyed, civil society groups lost legal standing, and protesters and journalists were accused of plotting coups. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions on high-level officials, including Vice President Rosario Murillo. Nicaragua's economy is expected to contract by almost 3% in 2018 due to the current political crisis. The political crisis in Nicaragua has led to a significant economic contraction of almost 3% in 2018, with a further 0.7% contraction expected in 2019. The 115th Congress enacted the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018, which restricts US loans to the Nicaraguan government unless certain conditions are met, such as combating corruption and holding free elections. Sanctions can be imposed on individuals responsible for human rights violations or corruption. Congress also allocated $10 million in Development Assistance to Nicaragua for FY2018. The 115th Congress allocated $10 million in Development Assistance to Nicaragua for FY2018. For FY2019, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 million in development assistance for Nicaragua, while the House Appropriations Committee specified funding for programs promoting democracy and the rule of law. The 115th Congress did not complete action on FY2019 foreign aid appropriations. The 115th Congress did not finalize FY2019 foreign aid appropriations, leaving it to the 116th Congress. The House passed a resolution condemning violence in Nicaragua. Mart\u00edn Vizcarra became Peru's president in March 2018 after his predecessor resigned due to bribery allegations. Vizcarra will serve until July 2021. Mart\u00edn Vizcarra became Peru's president in March 2018, succeeding his predecessor who resigned amid bribery allegations. Vizcarra's term will last until July 2021. He has prioritized fighting corruption, securing legislative support for judicial and political reforms, and responding decisively to scandals involving high-level officials. Opposition leaders, including Keiko Fujimori, have been implicated in corruption scandals as well. Peru's economy has been strong since 2001, with consistent growth due to high commodity prices. In 2018, economic growth was 3.7%, and it is predicted to average 3.9% annually from 2019-2023. President Vizcarra continues market-friendly economic policies. Peru signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2018. President Vizcarra of Peru is implementing market-friendly economic policies, including issuing legislative decrees to improve infrastructure and stimulate economic growth. Social unrest and disputes over natural resource exploitation, particularly in the mining industry and indigenous rights, remain major challenges. Recent elections in mining regions saw critics of mining elected as governors. A current dispute involves a highway project through protected areas and indigenous reserves in the Amazon rainforest. Balancing the desire to help the poor and indigenous populations has been a political challenge for successive Peruvian governments. Peru faces challenges in balancing economic growth with indigenous rights and environmental concerns, particularly in the mining industry. The Trump Administration requested reduced funding for Peru in FY2018, but Congress ultimately appropriated more funds. Venezuela's economic crisis continues to worsen. Venezuela is in a deep economic and humanitarian crisis under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's authoritarian rule. Maduro, unpopular and reelected in an unfair contest, has faced international condemnation. Countries have downgraded relations and imposed sanctions on Maduro's government. Maduro's reelection in Venezuela in 2017 solidified his power, leading to protests and violence. The government has cracked down on dissent, arresting and torturing dissidents, including military officers. The country is facing a severe economic crisis with a sharp decline in the economy, hyperinflation, and food shortages. The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to hyperinflation, severe shortages of food and medicine, and a humanitarian crisis. President Maduro blames U.S. sanctions for the country's economic problems and has increased military control over the economy. Venezuela may seek to restructure its debts, but default on bond payments has already occurred. The United States has had strained relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier, especially under the Ch\u00e1vez government. The Trump Administration has increased sanctions on the Maduro government in Venezuela due to concerns about human rights violations and lack of cooperation on antidrug efforts. They deemed the May 2018 elections as \"unfree and unfair\" and Maduro's inauguration as an \"illegitimate usurpation of power\". Targeted sanctions have been imposed on Venezuelan officials responsible for undermining democracy. The Trump Administration has increased sanctions on Venezuelan officials for human rights violations, corruption, and drug trafficking. Recent sanctions targeted individuals and companies accused of stealing $2.4 billion. Broader economic sanctions have restricted government access to U.S. financial markets and banned purchases of Venezuela's digital currency and debt. The Administration is considering further sanctions to limit trade with Venezuela, with differing opinions on the potential impact. Additionally, nearly $97 million in humanitarian assistance is being provided for Venezuelan refugees in countries like Colombia. The 115th Congress took actions to respond to the crisis in Venezuela, including passing bills for humanitarian assistance and democracy support. $15 million was allocated in FY2018 for democracy and human rights in Venezuela. In FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $9 million for democracy and human rights funding in Venezuela, $6 million less than the previous year. The House Appropriation Committee proposed $15 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $20 million. The 116th Congress will focus on Venezuela's economic crisis, U.S. sanctions, foreign aid appropriations, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Congressional interest in Latin America and the Caribbean remains high, with a focus on influencing Venezuela's government to return to democratic rule and address the humanitarian crisis. In the 116th Congress, potential oversight issues include U.S. assistance effectiveness in Central America, immigration legislation related to TPS and DACA, Colombian coca cultivation surge, and U.S. assistance to Mexico. Congress must approve agreements before they can enter into force. The oversight issues in the 116th Congress include U.S. assistance effectiveness in Central America, immigration legislation related to TPS and DACA, Colombian coca cultivation surge, and U.S. assistance to Mexico. Other key concerns are the increase in political repression and violence in Nicaragua, Chinese and Russian engagement in the region, U.S. relations with Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro, and democracy and human rights in Brazil."
