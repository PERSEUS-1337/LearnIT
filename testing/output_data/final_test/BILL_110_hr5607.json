The court will protect sensitive information in proceedings under the State Secret Protection Act of 2008 by taking steps such as reviewing evidence ex parte, issuing protective orders, and conducting in camera proceedings as needed. Participation of counsel will not be limited unless necessary to protect privileged evidence. The court will protect sensitive information under the State Secret Protection Act of 2008 by reviewing evidence ex parte, issuing protective orders, and conducting in camera proceedings. If disclosure presents a risk that cannot be addressed through less restrictive means, the court may require the Government to produce an adequate substitute, such as a redacted version or summary of the information. The court may require the Government to provide a substitute for sensitive information if necessary, which must be approved and allow counsel to challenge the Government's privilege claim. SEC. 4. ASSERTION OF THE PRIVILEGE. The Government can assert the privilege in civil actions and provide an affidavit explaining the basis for the claim. SEC. 5. PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS. The court conducts a preliminary review of privileged information asserted by the Government, considers appointing a special master or expert witness, and may order the Government to provide an index of evidence. The court conducts a preliminary review of privileged information asserted by the Government and may order the Government to provide an index correlating statements with evidence subject to privilege. Prehearing conferences are held to determine steps to protect sensitive information and define issues related to the claim of privilege. The court assesses the Government's claim, resolves disputes over participation in proceedings, sets a discovery schedule, and may order security clearances for counsel or parties. If necessary security clearance is not provided promptly, alternate or additional counsel may be proposed. If alternative or additional counsel proposed by a party cannot be cleared for security clearance promptly, the court will appoint another attorney to represent the party. If a security clearance for counsel is denied, the court may require the Government to explain the denial ex parte. SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND STANDARD FOR ASSESSING THE PRIVILEGE CLAIM. The court conducts a hearing to determine the validity of a privilege claim. The court reviews all evidence and submissions related to the claim before ruling on its validity. In cases where a timely review of all evidence is not feasible, the court may sample the evidence. The court may substitute a sufficient sampling of evidence if a full review is not feasible, as long as it does not affect the privilege claim's determination. The court must independently assess the likelihood of harm if the privilege is not upheld, weighing testimony from Government experts equally with other expert testimony. The burden of proof lies with the Government to demonstrate the nature and likelihood of harm.

If the court determines that a privilege is not validly asserted, the evidence may be disclosed or admitted at trial. If the privilege is valid, the evidence cannot be disclosed. The court may order a nonprivileged substitute if possible to provide an equivalent opportunity for litigation. In a civil action, if the Government fails to provide nonprivileged evidence as ordered by the court, the court will rule against the Government on the relevant issue. The court will also weigh the equities and make appropriate orders if the action is not against the Government. Additionally, the court will not resolve any issue based on the state secrets privilege if the Government's privilege claim is adverse to a party. The court will only uphold the Government's privilege claim after the party has completed discovery of nonprivileged evidence. If privileged evidence is deemed necessary to decide an issue, the court will weigh the equities and make appropriate orders in the interest of justice, such as striking testimony or dismissing a claim.
