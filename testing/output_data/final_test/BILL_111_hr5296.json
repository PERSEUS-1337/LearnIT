These zones can apply for grants to replace or retrofit polluting vehicles or engines to improve the health of the population living in the zones. The San Joaquin Valley faces serious air quality challenges impacting development, health, and economy. It emits high levels of nitrogen oxides and does not meet federally mandated standards for ozone and PM2.5. Children miss school days and residents experience premature deaths due to elevated ozone levels. The San Joaquin Valley faces severe air quality challenges, leading to high asthma rates, significant economic costs, and chronic unemployment. The Federal Government needs to collaborate with the Valley and the State to designate it as an air quality empowerment zone for federal grants and assistance. SEC. 4.
