    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act of 2017\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress acknowledges ongoing barriers to diversity in Federal Reserve bank president positions despite progress made through antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal Reserve Act.
