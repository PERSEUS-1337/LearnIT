    "content": "The term 'joint resolution' for section 822(a)(2) refers to a resolution of Congress concurs with the President's report on North Korea's compliance with international obligations. Congressional review procedures are outlined in the section. The joint resolution described in subsection (a) is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of either House, superseding other rules only if inconsistent. It recognizes the constitutional right of each House to change its rules regarding procedures. The joint resolution must be introduced in the House of Representatives by the majority or minority leader, or a designated member, and in the Senate by the majority or minority leader, or a designated member. The resolution is then referred to the Committee on International Relations in the House and the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate. If a committee to which the resolution is referred does not act, it can be discharged. If a committee does not report a joint resolution within 30 days of its introduction, the committee will be discharged from further consideration, and the resolution will be placed on the House calendar. After committee action, the resolution can be considered on the House floor. The House may proceed to consider a joint resolution if a Member makes a privileged motion, which is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. If agreed to, the House will immediately consider the resolution as unfinished business until disposed of. Debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall be limited to two hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing the resolution. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is permitted. Appeals from decisions are also addressed. Appeals from decisions on joint resolutions described in subsection (a) are decided without debate. Joint resolutions in the Senate follow specific procedures outlined in the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, it bypasses committee referral and amendments are not allowed. Upon receiving a joint resolution from the other House, it will not be referred to a committee and may only be considered for final passage. The procedure in the receiving House remains the same, but the vote on final passage will be on the joint resolution from the other House. Once the joint resolution from the other House is disposed of, the original joint resolution in the receiving House cannot be considered. In the computation of the 30-day period mentioned, days when either House of Congress is not in session due to an adjournment of more than 3 days or adjournment sine die will be excluded. SEC. 3 amends the North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999 to expand restrictions on nuclear cooperation with North Korea. SEC. 4 prohibits the United States government from assuming liability for nuclear accidents in North Korea. The provision prohibits the US government from entering into agreements that impose liability for nuclear accidents at reactors provided to North Korea under the Agreed Framework. The prohibition applies regardless of other laws, except for treaties requiring Senate approval."
