NAVY SHIP SCRAPPING PILOT PROGRAM. During fiscal years 1999 and 2000, the Secretary of the Navy will conduct a pilot program to gather data on the cost-effective scrapping of US vessels within the country. The program aims to demonstrate safe and environmentally friendly techniques for scrapping vessels. The Secretary will determine the number or tonnage of vessels to be scrapped for this purpose. When selecting a contractor for scrapping a vessel under the pilot program, the Secretary will award the contract to the most suitable offeror. The Secretary will award the contract to the offeror providing the best value to the United States, considering factors like technical qualifications, past performance, and compliance with environmental and worker protection laws. Weight will be given to technical and performance-related factors over cost and price-related factors. The curr_chunk discusses the qualifications required for managing workers safely in ship construction, including handling hazardous materials like polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos, and lead. It also mentions the need for expertise in metal cutting, fire prevention, and use of cranes. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for scrapping a vessel, including providing a plan for safe and cost-effective removal, demilitarization, and disposal of materials in compliance with laws.

The Secretary of the Navy must submit an interim report on the pilot program by September 30, 1999. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a final report on the pilot program by September 30, 2000.
