    "content": "Several revenue and spending provisions are set to expire at the end of 2012, including the Bush tax cuts, extended unemployment benefits, Social Security payroll tax reduction, and other tax extenders. If these measures expire and spending cuts take effect, budget deficits are projected to decrease as a percentage of GDP through 2022. The decline in deficits is due to lower spending levels and higher revenue levels compared to previous years. The budget deficit is estimated to decrease by $502 billion between 2012 and 2013 under current law. The estimated deficit reduction is projected to fall by $502 billion between FY2012 and FY2013 due to fiscal policy changes. If Congress alters these policies by increasing spending or decreasing revenue, the deficit could increase. The budgetary impact of reversing these policies may not directly compare to their impact under current law. The economic and budgetary impact of policy changes may not be immediately felt, with effects spread out over time. Individuals receiving emergency unemployment compensation may face the expiration of benefits, while tax changes like the payroll tax rate reduction expiration may impact taxpayers gradually. Spending cuts under the Budget Control Act will result in immediate agency budget reductions. The Budget Control Act will lead to immediate agency budget reductions starting January 2, 2013. The effects of these cuts will be felt over the fiscal year and beyond, potentially causing economic contraction in the first two quarters of 2013. Delaying action to address these policies can increase uncertainty and hinder the return to a sustainable federal budget path. The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, included reductions in tax rates on capital gains and dividends, repealed limitations on personal exemptions and itemized deductions, expanded tax credits like the EITC and child tax credit, and reduced the marriage tax penalty. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 made modifications to these cuts, expanding the child tax credit refundability and further reducing the marriage penalty. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded the child tax credit refundability and reduced the marriage penalty. It also increased the EITC for families with three or more children and introduced the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The Bush tax cuts were extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Starting in January 2013, tax rates and credits will revert to 2001 levels. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 temporarily reinstated the estate and generation-skipping taxes through 2012, with a lower top rate of 35% and a higher exemption amount of $5.0 million. If no legislative action is taken after 2012, the estate tax will revert to pre-EGGTRA rules with a top rate of 55% and a $1 million exemption. After 2012, the estate tax will revert to pre-EGGTRA rules with a top rate of 55% and a $1 million exemption. Extending current estate tax provisions would increase the budget deficit. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amounts were not indexed for inflation, leading to an estimated 27 million additional taxpayers being subject to the AMT in 2012. Congress has regularly increased the AMT exemption amount to adjust for inflation. The AMT exemption amount has been adjusted for inflation through various legislative acts. The AMT was patched in 2005 and extended through 2011, with proposals to permanently index it for inflation. This would cost an estimated $1.9 trillion over a 10-year period. In December 2010, Congress temporarily reduced the Social Security payroll tax by two percentage points to stimulate the economy. The reduction was extended through 2012 to help the middle class. CBO estimates the impact of allowing the payroll tax reduction. The temporary payroll tax reduction, enacted in 2010 and extended through 2012, is set to expire. CBO estimates that letting it expire would reduce the budget deficit by $95 billion between FY2012 and FY2013. Further extensions would increase the deficit unless costs are offset. Various temporary tax provisions expired in 2011, with more set to expire in 2012. The Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012 extended over 50 expired and expiring tax provisions through 2013, including benefits for research and development, investment incentives, tax treatment of foreign-source income, and energy-related tax incentives. Extending these provisions will increase the budget deficit. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will increase access to health insurance coverage and includes revenue provisions to pay for expanded coverage. One-third of the revenues will be derived from penalties imposed on individuals and employers for not purchasing or providing health insurance. The ACA includes revenue provisions to pay for expanded coverage, with taxes and fees on health insurers, plan administrators, and employers. Nearly half of the revenues come from taxes on high-income taxpayers, including a Medicare payroll tax and a tax on unearned income, projected to raise $18 billion in 2013. Additionally, an extra 0.9% payroll tax is imposed on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers effective after December 31, 2012. The ACA includes revenue provisions to pay for expanded coverage, with taxes and fees on health insurers, plan administrators, and employers. Nearly half of the revenues come from taxes on high-income taxpayers, including a Medicare payroll tax and a tax on unearned income. Effective after December 31, 2012, an additional 0.9% payroll tax is imposed on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. For taxable years after December 31, 2012, the law will impose a tax equal to 3.8% on net investment income for households with modified adjusted gross income over specified thresholds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes revenue provisions to fund expanded coverage, with taxes on high-income taxpayers. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over 10 years through spending cuts and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over 10 years through spending cuts. However, the Joint Committee failed to reach an agreement, triggering a $1.2 trillion automatic spending reduction process starting in January 2013. This includes across-the-board spending cuts of $109 billion in FY2013, with $54.7 billion each from defense and non-defense spending. Various measures have been proposed to cancel or modify this process, such as the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act. If the 2013 sequester is fully canceled, the deficit would increase by roughly $65 billion in FY2013. Eliminating the automatic reduction process from FY2014 to FY2021 would cost an additional $1.105 trillion through FY2022. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides income support for unemployed workers through state-funded UC benefits, with additional support from Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) and Extended Benefit (EB) programs. For more information on the Budget Control Act's effects on the budget deficit, refer to CRS Report R42506. The EUC08 and EB programs provide additional unemployment benefits based on worker eligibility, state law, and economic conditions. States fund regular UC benefits and the state share of EB payments, while the federal government funds UC program administration, the federal share of EB payments, and the EUC08 program. The EB program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by states under permanent law, but temporarily 100% federally funded until the end of 2012. The EUC08 program, first authorized by P.L. 110-252, has been amended multiple times, most recently by P.L. 112-96. The EUC08 program, providing additional weeks of unemployment benefits to certain workers, is set to expire at the end of 2012. If not extended, federal spending would decrease by $26 billion in FY2013. For more information on unemployment insurance benefits, refer to CRS Report RL33362. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, established in 1997, aimed to control Medicare physician spending levels. Updates to the physician fee schedule were initially close to the Medicare economic index (MEI), but in 2002, actual expenditures exceeded targets. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system, established in 1997 to control Medicare physician spending levels, has seen actual expenditures exceed allowed targets since 2002. Congress has enacted laws to override reductions, but temporary reprieves have led to steeper future payment rate reductions. Without legislative action, physician fees could be reduced by 27% in 2013, reducing the budget deficit by $11 billion between FY2012 and FY2013. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40907. In late 2012 or early 2013, Congress must agree on appropriations bills to provide funding to departments and agencies for the fiscal year. Failure to reach an agreement may lead to a government shutdown, affecting federal employees and various sectors of the economy. This issue may divert legislative attention from other activities. Congress may need to address an increase to the debt limit in late 2012 or early 2013, with potential negotiations similar to those in 2011 that led to the passage of the BCA. The current debt limit is $16.394 trillion, and the debt subject to limit could reach $16.796 trillion by the end of FY2013. Treasury may still need to sell debt due to seasonal fluctuations, even if the annual level of federal debt subject to limit does not increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt subject to the limit could reach $16.796 trillion by the end of FY2013, $402 billion above the current limit. Changes in fiscal policy would impact the budget deficit and federal debt levels. Budget analysts are concerned about future debt levels and the need for significant changes to spending or revenue policies. The Congressional Budget Office warns that significant changes to spending or revenue policies could harm the economic recovery. Current policies like extended unemployment benefits and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are losing effectiveness. CBO projects that GDP won't fully recover until FY2018 and reversing current policy changes could boost GDP growth to 4.4% in 2013. Timing issues with tax and spending policies could also impact the economy. The timing of tax and spending policies under current law can have significant implications on the economy. Immediate policies like reducing unemployment benefits may have an adverse effect, while others like automatic spending cuts and tax increases spread out over time. Taking action to prevent these changes can dampen the expected economic contraction. Different policy choices can lead to varying levels of growth and employment. Policies that increase aid to the unemployed are more effective at boosting employment than income tax reductions, as lower-income households are more likely to spend additional income. Differences in the growth and employment effects of various fiscal policies can have significant implications on the economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has highlighted the importance of timing tax and spending policies to prevent economic contraction. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urges Congress to address fiscal challenges with a focus on long-term sustainability and economic recovery. He warns that 2013 spending and tax policies could harm the recovery and recommends implementing a credible deficit reduction plan. Table A-1 outlines expiring provisions, automatic spending cuts, and short-term considerations for Congress to address. The table compares various fiscal plans including the Debt Reduction Task Force, the President's FY2013 budget, and the House FY2013 Budget Resolution. Implementing any of these plans would require legislative language and separate legislation to become law. The Domenici-Rivlin and Simpson-Bowles plans include comprehensive tax reform as part of broader debt or deficit reduction packages, but do not provide explicit recommendations on current fiscal policy choices. Tax reform may or may not contribute to deficit reduction, depending on its design. Revenue-neutral tax reform would not directly help with longer-term deficit reduction strategies."
