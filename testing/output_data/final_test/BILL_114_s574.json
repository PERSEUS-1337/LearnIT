    "content": "The \"Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act\" or the \"LEAP Act\" provides a tax credit for employees participating in qualified apprenticeship programs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"LEAP Act\" offers a tax credit for apprenticeship programs under the Internal Revenue Code. The apprenticeship credit is determined based on the applicable credit amounts for each apprentice, with a limit of 2 taxable years per apprentice. The credit amount varies based on the age of the apprentice. The term \"apprentice\" is defined as an employee in an officially recognized apprenticeable occupation under an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship or a recognized State agency. The applicable apprenticeship level is determined based on the average number of apprentices for the employer in the 3 preceding taxable years, rounded down to the nearest whole number. This applies to apprentices in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). The new apprenticeship program credit is zero for employers without apprentices in the 3 previous taxable years. The credit reduces other allowable credits for the same employee. Rules from section 51 also apply. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to apprenticeship credits, including the addition of a new paragraph (37) and adjustments to subsection (a) of section 280C. A clerical amendment is also made to the table of sections. The text chunk discusses employees in qualified apprenticeship programs and the effective date of the amendments. It also mentions limitations on government printing costs. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will work with Federal departments to reduce government printing costs, establish printing guidelines for employees, and require departments to prominently display guidelines. The Federal Government requires agencies to list the issuing agency, total number of copies printed, cost of production, and publishing entity in all public documents."
