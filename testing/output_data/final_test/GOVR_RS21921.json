    "content": "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 mandated the Department of Defense to develop cruise missile defense programs focusing on operational efficiency and affordability, particularly in response to the threat posed by advanced stealthy cruise missiles. The Senate Armed Services Committee in 1999 criticized the lack of integration and coherence in DOD's cruise missile defense programs. The Department of Defense is committed to developing Cruise Missile Defense capabilities as part of its air defense strategy, focusing on operational effectiveness and jointness. The integration of CMD plans for effective interoperability is a key question, with analysts emphasizing the importance of joint warfighting capability in detecting and intercepting advanced cruise missiles. CMD primarily serves as force protection for U.S. troops in conflict zones, with the threat to the U.S. being lower than in theater environments. The United States faces a growing threat from Cruise Missiles (CMs) as technology spreads globally. The failure to detect Iraqi CMs during Operation Iraqi Freedom has highlighted the importance of Cruise Missile Defense (CMD) as a critical mission area. CMD involves a series of military tasks known as the \"kill chain\" to detect and intercept CMs, which present operational challenges. Surveillance radars detect manned and unmanned aircraft, including CMs. Tracking the aircraft along its course is complicated by elusive flight paths. Combat identification is crucial to avoid friendly fire incidents. Engaging the CM involves deciding which defense assets to use for interception. The final step is neutralizing the CM with missiles or gunfire. The U.S. military is exploring new technologies like directed energy weapons to defend against advanced cruise missiles (CMs). Efforts are being made to enhance sensor coverage and link with Service weapons systems for target engagement. Collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration is also being pursued for comprehensive air surveillance. Improved joint surveillance, tracking, and combat capabilities are necessary to effectively counter advanced CM threats. Efforts to enhance effectiveness against advanced cruise missiles require improved joint surveillance, tracking, combat identification capabilities, and increased weapons range. The Pentagon's initiatives to improve CMD capabilities are addressed through various offices and strategies, with JTAMDO playing a key role in coordinating air and missile defense programs. JTAMDO's mission includes developing joint capabilities for an air and missile defense family of systems, force protection, homeland air security, assessing ballistic missile defense architectures, and addressing chemical, biological, radiological threats. The SIAP Joint Program Office (JPO) is leading efforts to develop a System of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (SIAP) to provide a total, shared environmental awareness for all allies within a theater. This system aims to detect and track all airborne objects, enabling timely decision-making for threat responses. The effectiveness of SIAP will rely on newer data linkages and the ability to track every object with a clear signature. The SIAP JPO is developing an integrated architecture for data sharing to accelerate interoperability between systems for airborne threat detection and intercept. JSSEO projects fielding this technology in September 2005 with estimated development costs of $160 million from FY2004 to FY2009. DOD aims for SAIP IOC by 2012. JCIET, deactivated in February 2005, addressed combat identification issues and solutions to reduce fratricide incidents. The Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team (JCIET) conducted joint exercises to test Service platforms' performance in detecting, tracking, and identifying airborne threats, including cruise missiles (CMs). The data collected from these exercises helped in addressing the advanced CM threat and improving combat identification capabilities. The Integrated Fire Control (IFC) initiative aims to create over-the-horizon and joint CMD intercept capabilities by decoupling Service-specific and platform-specific fire control radars from their weapons. This would enable platforms like E-2C Hawkeye and F-15 to intercept CMs using radar guidance. The Integrated Fire Control (IFC) initiative aims to enhance missile defense capabilities by utilizing surveillance platforms like E-2C Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS to relay tracking information for engaging cruise missiles. By decoupling fire control radar from weapons, IFC aims to extend interception range and improve defense against stealthy CMs, creating a wider coverage area. This effort is being pursued within the Army's Integrated Fire Control Product Office. The Army's Integrated Fire Control Product Office and the Navy's IFC counter air program office are now handling defense efforts. The main issue is whether DOD has adequately followed congressional directives on CMD, focusing on coordination with ballistic missile defense, development for near-term and advanced threats, and affordability. Some argue that CMD has been overshadowed by BMD in terms of resource allocation. In FY2005, DOD requested $9.2 billion for the Missile Defense Agency for BMD, while only asking for $239 million for CMD. The Defense Science Board highlights the unpredictability of the cruise missile threat and the need for advanced defense strategies. The Department of Defense is prioritizing effective theater and air missile defense to address near-term and future airborne threats. Upgrades to CMD weapons platforms and the development of integrated air picture and combat identification are key objectives. The Department of Defense is focusing on improving theater and air missile defense capabilities, including creating a joint engagement zone (JEZ) for better combat identification and integrated fire control. However, challenges remain in allocating sufficient resources and manpower towards CMD efforts. The Department of Defense is allocating resources towards improving theater and air missile defense capabilities, including creating a joint engagement zone for better combat identification and integrated fire control. Upwards of 40% of resources are being used for initial defensive operations of BMD, homeland air security coordination, force protection, and WMD defense requirements. Congress emphasizes the need for operational effectiveness in CMD measures, with interoperability of resources being crucial for developing effective CMD. Several CMD objectives will likely enable other mission areas, such as counter-air operations and battlefield interdiction efforts. The increased jointness associated with CMD efforts may create organizational friction and pressure on Congress to provide oversight. Service control over boundaries may become cloudier with enhanced IFC, potentially hindering future joint CMD capabilities. The overlap in CMD operations between Services may lead to a reorganization of control and funding for certain weapons systems and programs. The congressional directive to develop affordable CMD measures is crucial for procurement. Affordable CMD measures are crucial for procurement as current cost-exchange ratios favor attackers over defenders. The Pentagon is focusing on advanced CMD programs to combat sophisticated CM attacks, but more resources may be needed for less costly defenses against simple CM threats. DARPA has a low-cost cruise missile defense program to counter low-tech CMs by reducing interceptor costs. DARPA is developing low-cost interceptors for cruise missile defense to counter low-tech threats. Cheaper intercept technologies may be needed for cost-effective defense, including jamming technology and point defense weapons. Combat identification remains a challenge in CMD, with questions raised about the deactivation of JCIET. The deactivation of JCIET raises concerns about combat identification in CMD. Other organizations like JTAMDO may not be able to fill the gap, potentially leading to scrutiny if friendly aircraft are mistakenly targeted in the future."
