    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing America's Future Uniformed Services Act (SAFE-USA) of 1999\". The Congress acknowledges the decline in defense budget over the past 15 years, leading to a lack of readiness in the Armed Forces to execute the National Military Strategy. This decline is attributed to inadequate equipment modernization, delayed maintenance, reduced combat training, and declining quality of life for service members and their families. The decline in defense budget has led to readiness issues in the Armed Forces, affecting military pay, retirement, health care, housing, and family support programs. Low pay, inequities in retirement, dissatisfaction with health care, and inadequate facilities contribute to retention problems. The aging military barracks and family housing, along with inadequate family support programs, are straining military personnel and their families. The post-Cold War drawdown and increased military operations have exacerbated these challenges. The Armed Forces are experiencing significant strains on personnel and their families, leading to recruiting and retention difficulties. Factors contributing to declining retention rates include inadequate pay, family separations due to increased operations, and lack of resources for missions. The sense of Congress is highlighted in Section 3. The sense of Congress is to provide sufficient resources for the Armed Forces to execute the National Military Strategy with minimal risk and revitalize the all-volunteer force by improving housing, healthcare, and family support programs. The sense of Congress is to provide resources for the Armed Forces to reform the military retirement system and enhance pay and benefits to retain high-quality personnel. In fiscal year 2000, military basic pay will increase by 4.8 percent, effective January 1. The adjustment required by section 1009 of title 37 for the rates of monthly basic pay for uniformed services members will be waived."
