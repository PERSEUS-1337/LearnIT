    "content": "In a study comparing foveating and non-foveating deep networks, different variable-resolution downsampling methods were evaluated for ImageNet recognition using a Densenet-121 network. The best variable-resolution method slightly outperformed uniform downsampling, indicating that foveation does not significantly impact object recognition in deep networks. Various foveated downsampling approaches were compared to uniform downsampling, with similar performance among the foveated methods and a slight advantage for the best method over uniform downsampling. Foveation does not significantly impact object recognition in deep networks, as shown in a study comparing foveating and non-foveating networks using variable-resolution downsampling methods with a DenseNet-121 network. This suggests that foveation could be integrated into vision systems for tasks like object recognition and text reading in robots. To calculate radially symmetric mean values, nasal and temporal fits are summed with weights 0.25 and 0.75. The training procedure includes random horizontal flips and a batch size. Networks are trained for 90 epochs using SGD with a learning rate reduction every 30 epochs. When the resulting crop goes beyond image boundaries, edge pixels are copied. Multiple points are sometimes chosen in a single image, with the highest-saliency points close together containing similar information. Saliency maps are modified after each selection to avoid choosing similar points. This exploration could benefit general vision systems."
