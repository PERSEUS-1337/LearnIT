    "content": "The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to include a new section for online voter registration. The Election Assistance Commission, in consultation with state election officials, will develop an online voter registration platform. It will include an online version of the mail voter registration application form, meeting specific requirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The platform will allow applicants to provide an identification number for signature verification. The online voter registration platform developed by the Election Assistance Commission will require applicants to provide an electronic signature acceptable by the state or jurisdiction. Applicants must indicate if they are registered to vote elsewhere, and if so, the new registration will be considered a request to cancel the previous registration. The Commission will transmit completed applications. The Election Assistance Commission will forward completed online voter registration applications and cancellation requests to state election officials. If a state has a certified platform, the Commission will connect applicants to that platform instead of its own. The state must accept online voter registration applications that meet the same requirements as mail-in registrations. If electronic signatures are not accepted, the individual must provide alternative identification to finalize the registration. The state allows individuals to finalize their online voter registration by signing at the poll before voting for the first time in that jurisdiction. First-time voters may be required to vote in person if they registered online and have not previously voted in that jurisdiction, with exceptions for absentee voters. The Voting Act allows individuals to vote by mail if they meet certain criteria, including being elderly or handicapped, providing sufficient information for signature verification, or being entitled to vote under federal law. States can conduct elections entirely by mail-in ballot. Amendments are made to state procedures under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Amendments to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 include allowing online registration and updating the timing of registration. Amendments to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 include online registration deadlines and informing applicants of eligibility requirements and penalties.

The Postmaster General will incorporate online voter registration into the USPS Online Change of Address process, allowing individuals to register to vote during the process. Completed applications will be forwarded to the Election Assistance Commission for processing. Additionally, there will be a voter registration deadline. SEC. 3. VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINE amended to change deadline from \"30 days\" to \"28 days\"."
