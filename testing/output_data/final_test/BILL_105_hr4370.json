Appropriations of $250,000,000 are allocated for fiscal years 1999 to 2002 for payments to States under allotments. The Secretary shall allot funds to each State based on the proportion of medicare beneficiaries, with 40 percent allocated according to the number of individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under.

The Secretary shall allot funds to each State based on the proportion of medicare beneficiaries, with 60 percent allocated according to the number of individuals receiving home health services under this title in the State. Amounts allotted to a State shall remain available for obligation through the end of the fiscal year. Unused allotments may be redistributed by the Secretary. The Secretary will redistribute unused funds from States that do not fully obligate their allotments to States that have used up their allotments. States will receive payments based on qualifying payments made in the fiscal year. In fiscal year, payments to States for home health agencies and administrative expenses are limited to allotments. Qualifying payment to agencies is based on reasonable costs of providing home health services. The agency providing home health services must ensure that their reasonable costs do not exceed the reimbursement amount under this title. The determination of costs can be based on estimates or reliable information. A qualified home health agency is defined for this purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, a qualified home health agency must have a participation agreement, show a severe adverse impact due to payment limitations, and demonstrate efficient management. Payment for administrative expenses is limited to 5% of the amount paid to the State. The State may use funds under subparagraph (A) for expenditures in a fiscal year, but not to meet non-Federal fund requirements. States are not obligated to pay all qualified home health agencies or the full amount. The Secretary can make advance payments and retrospective adjustments under this subsection. The Secretary can make advance payments to States based on estimates of expenditures and adjust payments as needed for overpayments or underpayments from previous fiscal years. This subsection provides budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts for the Federal Government to pay States. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to provide updates every 90 days on the implementation of the prospective payment system for home health agencies to Congress."
