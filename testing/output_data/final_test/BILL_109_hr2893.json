This credit is added as a new section 25C in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2005\" allows individuals a tax credit for qualified taxable fuel expenditures up to $250 ($500 for joint returns) for nonbusiness use in highway vehicles. Qualified taxable fuel expenditures exclude fuel eligible for other tax credits or refunds. The \"Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2005\" provides a tax credit for qualified fuel expenditures, excluding certain types of fuel.

The \"Working Families Gas Tax Credit Act of 2005\" offers a tax credit for fuel expenses, with the credit amount decreasing based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. To qualify, the price increase of a gallon of gasoline must exceed the inflation rate by at least 200 percent. The percentage change in the price of a gallon of gasoline for a taxable year is determined by comparing the average price at the end of the year to the average price at the beginning. The inflation rate is calculated by comparing the Consumer Price Index at the end of the year to the beginning. Inflation adjustments for dollar amounts in subsections based on Consumer Price Index published by the Department of Labor. The amount is adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year. If the increased amount is not a multiple of $50, it is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Similar rounding rules apply for amounts not multiples of $10 or $100 in different subsections. Guidance on these adjustments is provided annually by January 31. The Secretary shall provide annual guidance by January 31 for adjustments based on cost-of-living, rounding to the nearest multiple of $100. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004."
