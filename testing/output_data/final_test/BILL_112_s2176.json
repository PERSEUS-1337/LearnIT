    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nuclear Waste Fund Relief and Rebate Act.\" It includes a section certifying commitment to the Yucca Mountain site under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of defense waste, including various types of radioactive waste and materials related to nuclear weapons production. It also mentions the certification of the Yucca Mountain site as the selected location for a repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. If the President fails to publish or revokes certification of the Yucca Mountain site as a repository for radioactive waste, entities making payments to the Secretary will not have to make additional payments. Those who have already paid will receive a refund from the Nuclear Waste Fund. Entities making payments to the Secretary will receive a refund from the Nuclear Waste Fund. 75% of the returned payments will be used for rebates to ratepayers, and 25% will be used for upgrades to nuclear power facilities to enhance storage and security. The Secretary will use the required payment to meet penalty obligations for failing to transport defense waste to Yucca Mountain. If transportation is not initiated by January 1, 2017, a penalty of $1,000,000 per day will be paid to each State where the waste is located. The Secretary will pay a maximum of $100,000,000 to each State per year for storing defense waste until transportation begins. States must use the payments to offset community investment losses and address public health concerns. The President and Secretary's responsibilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 are sufficient grounds for the Commission to grant or amend licenses for nuclear power reactors or waste facilities. This aims to ensure safe and timely disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The entity receiving benefits under certain subsections will not be penalized by the Commission for canceling a contract due to non-payment to the Secretary or accepting certain amounts. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to clarify the disposition of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by the Federal Government. The table of contents is updated to reflect these changes.
