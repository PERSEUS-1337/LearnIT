    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19605 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow licensed racing associations to operate satellite wagering facilities for races in specific zones at their racetrack enclosures, subject to certain conditions. No satellite wagering facility, except those at tracks with live racing, can be located within 20 miles of another facility or track. However, in the northern zone, this restriction can be waived with consent from the racing association or existing facility. The Department of Food and Agriculture may approve up to three satellite wagering facilities jointly licensed to specific agricultural associations, located on fairgrounds or within San Francisco. A one-year test must be conducted before licensing to assess impact on state parimutuel revenues and attendance at existing racetracks and fair satellite wagering facilities in certain counties. Satellite wagering facilities may be located on leased fair property. The fairs may contract for the operation of a satellite wagering facility with licensed racing associations or fairs within the northern zone, even if located on leased property. Section 19620.2 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow satellite wagering facilities within 20 miles of existing or proposed facilities. Any unallocated balance from revenue deposited into the Fair and Exposition Fund can be used for California fairs. The Secretary of Food and Agriculture is allocated funds for California fairs for various projects related to public health, safety, maintenance, emergencies, physical changes, and property protection. Some funds may also be used for general operational support for fairs with limited revenue sources. Section 3200 of the Food and Agricultural Code amends the use of funds appropriated for California fairs and expositions for the 1995-96 fiscal year. The funds will now be allocated for the purposes specified in Section 19630 of the Business and Professions Code, and may be distributed to all state designated fairs. The funds will be deposited in the Fair and Exposition Fund as specified in the Business and Professions Code."
