    "content": "The \"Gun Buy Back Partnership Grant Act of 1998\" aims to reduce gun violence by assisting State and local law enforcement in conducting community gun buy back programs. This initiative is driven by findings that highlight the high number of gun-related deaths in the United States, emphasizing the need to address the prevalence of guns in American households. The \"Gun Buy Back Partnership Grant Act of 1998\" authorizes grants for States and local governments to run community gun buy back programs. Funds must be used solely for this purpose, with a minimum allocation of 0.50 percent of the total appropriation per qualifying entity. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is restricted from providing excessive amounts under this Act. Under the \"Gun Buy Back Partnership Grant Act of 1998,\" the Bureau of Justice Assistance is limited to providing a qualifying State or local government with no more than 5 percent of the total appropriation for the fiscal year. Grants cannot cover more than 50 percent of the cost of a community gun buy back program, unless waived by the Director due to fiscal hardship. Preferential consideration is given to applications from jurisdictions that will destroy all guns received in the program. The \"Gun Buy Back Partnership Grant Act of 1998\" limits the Bureau of Justice Assistance to providing a State or local government with up to 5% of the total appropriation for the fiscal year.
