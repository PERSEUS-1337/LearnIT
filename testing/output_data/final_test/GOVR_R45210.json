    "content": "Different parts of a farm bill are authorized for different periods of time, with programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill set to expire at the end of FY2023 or after the 2023 crop year. Enacting farm bills after the expiration date has been common in the past 42 years, with only two bills enacted before the deadline. The 1996, 2008, and 2014 farm bills were enacted after their original expiration dates, with programs like nutrition, conservation, and trade affected by fiscal year authorizations. Farm bills since 1965 have typically been enacted before their expiration, except for the 2008 and 2014 bills which required extensions. The 1990 farm bill was the last one enacted before the 2018 farm bill, with most farm bills typically enacted before their expiration, except for the 2008 and 2014 bills which required extensions. The dairy program is particularly affected by calendar year expiration, as it is tied to crop years. Since 1965, farm bills have been introduced in odd-numbered years, except for 1970, 1990, 2014, and 2018. The 2018 farm bill was the first to be completed before June. The 1970, 1990, and 2018 bills were enacted in November and December of a lame duck Congress. The 2014 bill required reintroduction in a subsequent Congress. The House and Senate have alternated in initiating farm bill actions since 1965. The Senate and House have alternated in marking up farm bills since 1965. Extensions of prior farm bills have been atypical, with only the 2002 and 2008 bills requiring extensions. Presidential vetoes of farm bills are rare, with only the 2008 bill being vetoed as a stand-alone measure. The 2008 farm bill was vetoed twice by President George W. Bush, but Congress overrode the veto to enact a complete bill that included the trade title. This was the only time a farm bill was enacted as a result of a veto override. President Clinton also vetoed a 1995 budget reconciliation package that included the first version of the 1996 farm bill. The complexity and political sensitivity of enacting a new farm bill have increased over time, making the process more difficult. The uncertainty surrounding the legislation affects a diverse group of stakeholders and may lead to questions about future program benefits and market uncertainty for agricultural commodities."
