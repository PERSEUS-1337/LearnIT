    "content": "The \"Emerging Business Encouragement Act of 2014\" may be cited as the act. It pertains to emerging business enterprises. The \"Emerging Business Encouragement Act of 2014\" allows for the designation of small businesses as emerging business enterprises in specific industry categories, with established criteria and an appeal process for decisions. Designations expire if the business no longer meets the criteria. The designation of an emerging business enterprise does not expire if the business existed prior to the designation, but instead expires 5 years after the designation date. If the enterprise exceeds the size limitation after designation, it only expires if the size is 50% or more of the maximum size of a small business in that industry category. The rulemaking for self-certification and audits of emerging business enterprises includes criteria such as the number of employees being less than 10 percent of the larger of a small business in that industry category. The criteria for self-certification and audits of emerging business enterprises include limiting the number of employees to not more than 10 percent of the small business in the industry category or 25 employees, being less than 5 years old, and not paying excessive salaries to owners or management. The Administrator shall publicize procedures for designations under this paragraph and provide training on Federal procurement on an Internet Web site at no charge. Additionally, a contracting preference is added to the Small Business Act for certain salary thresholds. The Small Business Act is amended to establish goals for participation by emerging business enterprises in federal contracts, with a preference given to these enterprises in contract awards.

If the default rate on loans is 10 percent higher than the prior year, there will be a 50 percent increase in the succeeding fiscal year. Reports are required annually after the first guaranteed loan under this program. Each lender must report the total number of loans, loan amount, and default rate annually. Lenders must verify the status of a business before issuing a loan, and sanctions apply for fraudulent misrepresentation.
