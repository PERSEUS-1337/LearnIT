The program aims to explore various aspects of the oceans to benefit and inspire the American people, improve understanding of marine ecosystems, facilitate discovery of marine natural products with potential benefits, and communicate discoveries and knowledge. The program aims to maximize therapeutic benefits by integrating scientific disciplines, communicating discoveries to policymakers and researchers, utilizing ocean science resources, and promoting education and public understanding of the oceans. SEC. 4. AUTHORITIES. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey little known areas of the marine environment, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will conduct exploration activities combining archaeology and oceanographic sciences, develop a transparent process for reviewing proposals, enhance technical capabilities of the marine science community, and conduct public education and outreach activities to improve understanding of ocean science. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will conduct exploration activities to enhance marine science capabilities and promote public education. Additionally, they will accept donations for ocean exploration purposes and establish a forum to facilitate partnerships and communication among experts. SEC. 5. EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other agencies and experts, will convene a task force to develop a strategy for transferring new exploration technology, improving communication infrastructure, implementing a data management system, and fostering cost-sharing partnerships. To encourage cost-sharing partnerships with governmental and non-governmental entities for transferring exploration technology and expertise to the program. Interagency financing is authorized for federal agencies involved in the program to share, transfer, receive, and spend funds appropriated for administrative or programmatic projects. Funds can be transferred among departments and agencies through an appropriate instrument. Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to receive appropriations of $45,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2010 and $55,000,000 for fiscal years 2011 through 2016 to carry out the program.
