    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that 80-90% of chronic disease prevention is through medications, emphasizing the importance of using appropriate medications for patient outcomes. However, 1/2 to 2/3 of individuals with chronic diseases in the US do not adhere to prescribed medications, leading to higher healthcare costs, reduced treatment effectiveness, and thousands of deaths. Improving medication adherence among individuals with chronic diseases can reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, lower healthcare costs, and improve patient health outcomes. Drug therapy problems cost the US healthcare system over $290 billion annually. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a national research and reporting strategy for improved medication adherence. The Secretary will report annual statistics on medication adherence for individuals with chronic diseases to inform decision-makers about primary nonadherence, medication persistence, quality measures, and methods to improve adherence. The research conducted under subsection (a) focuses on improving medication adherence and persistence among individuals with chronic illnesses. It includes strategies used by private stakeholders and pertains to individuals treated under various federal health care programs. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to medication adherence and management, including terms like medication persistence and primary nonadherence. These definitions are crucial for understanding the concepts discussed in the United States Code. The Secretary must report to Congress on the research conducted on medication therapy management within 1 year of enactment and provide an updated report within 5 years. SEC. 3. LINKING MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND PARTS A AND B CLAIMS DATA.
