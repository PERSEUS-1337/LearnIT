The Food for Peace Program under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended by redesignating and inserting sections. The Food for Peace Program is established within the United States Agency for International Development to provide emergency assistance for food needs during disasters, including famines. The Administrator is authorized to provide assistance through agricultural commodities, funds, and vouchers. The Food for Peace Program allows the Administrator to provide nonemergency assistance for food security programs in foreign countries to combat malnutrition, especially in infants, children, and mothers. Assistance can be provided through agricultural commodities, funds, and vouchers. The Food for Peace Program aims to address hunger needs, mitigate food crises for vulnerable populations, and promote resilient food security through various interventions such as improving agricultural productivity, diversifying incomes, enhancing community development activities, and improving environmental practices. The Food for Peace Program aims to improve environmental practices and provide assistance to eligible organizations, including private voluntary organizations, cooperatives, and intergovernmental organizations like the World Food Program. Additionally, a minimum of 20-30% of funding is allocated for nonemergency assistance programs. The Food for Peace Program requires a minimum of $375,000,000 for each fiscal year for food assistance. The Administrator can waive this requirement in urgent humanitarian situations if other funds are not available. The Food for Peace Program allows the Administrator to waive the minimum funding requirement in urgent humanitarian situations if necessary, with funds from the Agricultural Act of 1980. If the need continues beyond the fiscal year, the President's budget request for the following year must include emergency food assistance funding to address the ongoing need. The Agricultural Act of 1980 allows for funds to be used for nonemergency food assistance programs. Eligible organizations must submit a proposal describing the program, how it addresses objectives, the requested funds, and the agricultural commodities to be used. The proposal for the program must include a description of how the organization will collaborate with indigenous institutions and communities, the proposed output impact and indicators for monitoring progress, baseline data collection, and a plan for measuring and reporting progress towards achieving program objectives. The Food Aid Consultative Group is established to review and address issues concerning the effectiveness of regulations and procedures governing food assistance programs. The Food Aid Consultative Group is composed of the Administrator, Under Secretary of Agriculture, Inspector General, representatives of private voluntary organizations and cooperatives, indigenous NGOs from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and agricultural producer groups in the United States. The Food Aid Consultative Group includes representatives from the United States agricultural processing sector, maritime transportation sector, and nutrition science experts from academia and NGOs. The Administrator serves as the chairperson of the Group. Consultations must be held before implementing regulations or guidelines under this section. The Administrator will work with the Food Aid Consultative Group to improve coordination and oversight of food assistance programs, focusing on quality control and cost effectiveness by exploring options for better packaging and storage of products. The Administrator will work with the Department of Agriculture to reform commodity acquisition and supply chain management for food aid, focusing on vendor selection, quality assurance, supply chain management, and auditing. They will also develop partnerships to promote private sector innovation in food aid products, packaging, and delivery. The Administrator will provide guidance on using food aid commodities effectively, strengthen monitoring of commodity quality, and establish system-wide processes. The Administrator will establish protocols for monitoring and evaluating impact, improving program design, and enhancing cost-effectiveness. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the Group. The Administrator will assess the quality of agricultural commodities for food aid and adjust products and formulations as needed. The Administrator will adjust products and formulations, test prototypes, adopt new specifications, and develop program guidance to meet nutrient needs cost-effectively and improve micronutrient fortified food aid products. The curr_chunk focuses on developing improved guidance for implementing partners on addressing nutritional deficiencies in emergency programs that extend beyond 1 year. It also includes evaluating the performance and cost-effectiveness of specialized food products and program approaches designed to meet nutritional needs. The curr_chunk discusses approaches to meet the nutritional needs of vulnerable groups like pregnant and lactating mothers and children under 5 years old. The Administrator is required to consult with experts, enter contracts for services, and collaborate with the Food Aid Consultative Group. The curr_chunk discusses the procurement of ocean transportation for the Food for Peace Program, allowing competitive procedures for contracts. The Administrator must ensure that providing agricultural commodities does not hinder domestic production. The Food for Peace Program under this section aims to avoid disrupting domestic agricultural production or sales of United States agricultural commodities. $2.4 billion is authorized for fiscal year 2015 and beyond for this program. Repeal of Title II of Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.) established under this section.
