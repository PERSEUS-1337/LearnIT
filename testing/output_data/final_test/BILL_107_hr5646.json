    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Taking Our Health Privacy (STOHP) Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that people in the United States are deeply concerned about the confidentiality of their health information. A survey showed that 1 in 6 people has taken steps to keep their health information private. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 established medical privacy regulations in December 2000. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 established privacy protections for health information, including prohibiting unauthorized use or disclosure, providing individuals with rights to access and correct their health records. These regulations took effect in April 2001, with compliance required by April 2003. In April 2003, the Bush Administration weakened medical privacy protections by eliminating the requirement for patient consent before using and disclosing health information. This change allows for the use and disclosure of medical records without patient permission for various purposes, including non-treatment related business activities. The Bush Administration weakened medical privacy protections by eliminating the requirement for patient consent before using and disclosing health information. This compromised the confidentiality of physician-patient relationships, allowing for the sharing of patients' information without their knowledge or consent for activities that consumers typically consider marketing. Providers can use a consumer's medical information without consent to send unsolicited drug recommendations, without disclosing fees or allowing consumers to opt-out. The Bush Administration also allowed disclosure of medical information to FDA-regulated entities for marketing purposes, undermining patient privacy protections. The December 2000 medical privacy rule should be restored to ensure medical privacy protection for consumers and maintain access to quality healthcare in the US. This includes reinstating patient consent requirements for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations while allowing essential healthcare activities like filling prescriptions and making referrals. Restoring the December 2000 medical privacy rule involves reinstating patient consent requirements for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. This includes essential healthcare activities like filling prescriptions and making referrals, as well as ensuring that marketing activities involving patient health information are protected under privacy regulations. The broad \"public health\" exemption created by the August 2002 rule would be eliminated. The Act aims to restore patient privacy protections that were weakened by the Bush Administration in 2002. It involves reinstating patient consent requirements for healthcare activities and eliminating the broad \"public health\" exemption. The modifications made to section 164.506 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, by the August 2002 medical privacy rule shall have no force or effect. Health care providers may use or disclose protected health information without obtaining prior consent in certain circumstances. Health care providers can use an individual's protected health information for prescription-related purposes with written consent. They can also use the information for treatment if in-person communication is not possible and obtaining consent is impracticable. Health care providers can use an individual's protected health information for prescription-related purposes with written consent. They can also use the information for treatment if in-person communication is not possible and obtaining consent is impracticable. The health care provider may infer consent from circumstances like an order or referral from another provider, but written consent must be obtained promptly. The modifications to the definition of \"marketing\" in the medical privacy rule from August 2002 will not be enforced. The December 2000 medical privacy rule states that oral communications related to marketing shall have no force or effect. Section 164.508 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, requires authorizations for marketing to specifically mention \"marketing\" and describe the marketing uses and disclosures authorized. Protected health information may be used internally, disclosed to business associates, or to any other entity. Marketing use of this information must result in remuneration to the covered entity. The modifications to section 164.512(b)(1)(iii) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, by the August 2002 medical privacy rule will have no force or effect. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE.
