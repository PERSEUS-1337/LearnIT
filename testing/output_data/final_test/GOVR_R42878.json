    "content": "The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) was passed by Congress in 2002 to address improper payments made by federal agencies. The Recovery Audit Act of 2002 required agencies with over $500 million in contracts to recover overpayments. Reports from FY2004 to FY2008 showed uneven progress in reducing improper payments, with an increase in total improper payments and the government-wide improper payment rate. Between FY2004 and FY2008, the government-wide improper payment rate increased. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found weaknesses in agencies' recovery audit programs during this time. In response, Congress passed the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), which replaced previous legislation and expanded reporting requirements for recovery audit programs. IPERA defines improper payments as payments made in error, including overpayments and underpayments. Under IPERA, improper payments are defined as payments made in error, including overpayments and underpayments. This definition includes payments to ineligible recipients, duplicate payments, payments for goods or services not received, and payments without accounting for applicable discounts. The law applies to federal funds transferred to nonfederal entities, such as grantees, contractors, and loan recipients. Agencies are required to identify and reduce improper payments by conducting risk assessments and targeting programs susceptible to significant errors. IPERA defines \"significant\" improper payments as exceeding $10 million and 2.5% of program outlays for FY2011 and FY2012, or exceeding $100 million. Starting in FY2013, the threshold drops to 1.5%. Agencies must conduct initial risk assessments in 2011 and subsequent assessments every three years, considering factors like program complexity and payment volume. The agency must assess programs for improper payments exceeding set thresholds. They are required to estimate and report on actions taken to reduce improper payments, including causes and planned actions. Through risk assessment, agencies must describe causes of improper payments, actions taken to correct issues, target dates for reductions approved by OMB, annual performance criteria for accountability, evaluation of internal controls, and resources needed for developing controls. OMB is required to establish criteria for agencies to demonstrate effective internal control systems and submit a report to congressional committees on government-wide efforts to reduce improper payments. The report includes reduction targets, agency compliance status, progress towards targets, and actions taken to reduce improper payments. OMB also provides guidance on timing and format of improper payments reports. The OMB provides guidance on the timing and format of improper payments reports required by IPERA. Agencies must determine compliance with IPERA and report findings to various entities. Compliance includes publishing financial statements, conducting risk assessments, publishing improper payment estimates, corrective action plans, and reporting no improper payment rate exceeding 10%. An agency must report all programs have an improper payment rate under 10% to comply with IPERA. Noncompliant agencies must submit a plan to Congress with milestones, a responsible official, and an accountability mechanism. If noncompliant for two years, additional funding may be required for intensified compliance efforts. IPERA requires agencies to report improper payment rates under 10% and submit plans to Congress for noncompliance. Noncompliant agencies may need additional funds for intensified compliance efforts. OMB has the authority to conduct compliance pilot programs and recovery audits to identify overpayments. Recovery auditing, also known as payment recapture audit, is a process to identify and recapture overpayments. Senator Tom Carper highlighted the need for better recovery of improper payments in government agencies. IPERA mandates agencies to conduct recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually. The legislation mandates recovery audits on programs with expenditures over $1 million annually. It establishes procedures for recovery audits, prioritizing recent and high-risk payments, and allows for audits to be conducted by agencies, other departments, or private sector services. Reporting requirements on actions to recover improper payments are also imposed. IPERA allows contractors to conduct recovery audits on behalf of agencies but limits their authority. Contractors need agency head's consent to notify entities of overpayments, respond to questions, and take administrative action. They cannot make final decisions on overpayments or adjudicate claims. Contractors must report all overpayments found to the agency, regardless of where they occurred. Nongovernmental entities are prohibited from disclosing information. The legislation directs agencies to collect overpayments identified in recovery audits promptly. Agency heads have discretion on how to distribute collected amounts, with limits on the maximum percentage that can be applied to certain programs. The legislation directs agencies to promptly collect overpayments identified in recovery audits. Agency heads have discretion on how to distribute collected amounts, with limits on the maximum percentage that can be applied to certain programs. Up to 25% can be credited back to the appropriation or fund, 5% for inspector general activities, and the remaining 45% (up to 100% based on agency allocation) is deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. IPERA specifies reporting requirements for improper payment recovery actions. The legislation requires agencies to promptly collect overpayments identified in recovery audits and report on actions taken to address conditions promoting overpayments. Agencies must submit reports to OMB and Congress, and the Director of OMB must provide a government-wide report on improper payments information and recovery actions. The Chief Financial Officers Council must conduct a study on the implementation of recovery audit provisions within two years of IPERA's enactment. The study will assess the costs and benefits of agency recovery audit activities, including the effectiveness of service provision by private contractors, agency employees, and cross-servicing from other agencies. A report on this study was due by July 22, 2012 to specific committees and the Comptroller General. OMB circulars operationalize implementation for agencies, detailing procedural requirements and potentially imposing its own. OMB details the legislation's procedural requirements and may impose additional requirements, consistent with IPERA. Implementation guidance was issued on April 11, 2011, through the revision of OMB Circular A-123. The guidance clarifies definitions of improper payments and programs, including grants, procurements, and regulatory activities. OMB's guidance, outlined in A-123, requires agencies to review programs for improper payments, develop estimates, implement reduction plans, and report progress. A-123 and IPERA share the same definition of \"significant\" improper payments for agencies to follow. The guidance in A-123 outlines steps for identifying programs at risk of improper payments, with specific thresholds for different fiscal years. OMB may require risk assessments for programs below the threshold. A-123 also requires OMB approval of agency sampling methodologies to accurately reflect improper payment amounts. A-123 allows agencies to sample transactions at high-risk steps in the payment lifecycle to reduce improper payments. If a payment lacks documentation, the entire amount is considered improper. Agencies must develop a plan to reduce improper payments, following guidelines similar to IPERA. The A-123 guidance requires agencies to develop a plan to reduce improper payments by identifying root causes, setting reduction targets, and ensuring accountability. Agencies must assess infrastructure and identify barriers, with the option to request waivers for non-risk-susceptible programs. A-123 guidance requires agencies to estimate improper payments for all programs, publish annual reports with prevention plans, and implement best practices to reduce improper payments over time. A-123 guidance requires agencies to implement best practices to reduce improper payments, including predictive modeling, forensic accounting, data mining, and training staff. Agencies with expenditures of $1 million or more per fiscal year must conduct payment recapture audits, implementing overall plans for risk analysis and recovery activities. The agency head has discretion over payment recapture activities, but they must be cost-effective, with benefits exceeding implementation costs. Payment recapture activities under A-123 guidance should aim to recoup costs through a management improvement program targeting internal control issues. A-123 specifies the types of programs requiring recovery audits, such as grants, benefits, loans, and contracts. Agencies must prioritize recent and high-risk payments for recapture audits to maximize financial benefits. Payment recapture audit contractors may be excluded if deemed not cost-effective. Audits must correct underpayments and overpayments, but cannot render final decisions on overpayment claims. Agencies must perform recovery audits if cost-effective, considering factors like likelihood of overpayment recapture. Payment recapture audit contractors can notify entities of potential overpayments and respond to questions, but cannot adjudicate claims. The agency must establish annual payment recapture targets for their programs based on the rate of recovery, which is the amount of improper payments recovered divided by the amount identified. Agencies may set their own targets for OMB review and approval. A-123 guidelines require agencies to aim for annual recapture targets of at least 85% within three years. If unable to meet this target by FY2013, agencies must justify a lowered target to OMB for approval. Coordination between federal agencies and state/local governments is essential for payment recapture audits and financial management improvement efforts. Grant programs are subject to IPERA's recovery audit provisions, necessitating collaboration with grant recipients for cost-effective payment recapture audits. Agencies must coordinate to form partnerships with grant recipients for cost-effective payment recapture audit implementation. Information from these programs should be used to enhance financial management and internal controls, reducing errors and waste. Recovery audit services can be conducted by the agency itself, other government entities, private sector, or nonfederal entities. IPERA allows flexibility in procurement methods for these services. The use of contingency contracts for recovery audit services requires agencies to establish alternative payment arrangements for certain types of recovered payments. Contractors must adhere to specific requirements and provide regular reports to the agency on identified overpayments. Contractors must follow recommendations for mitigation of conditions, report overpayments to the agency, and notify of fraud. They should be familiar with agency policies, protect financial information, and cannot compel records from contractors. Collection activities are carried out by federal agencies or nonfederal entities, not by payment recapture audit contractors. A-123 outlines the rules for recapturing overpayments from discretionary funds, specifying that overpayments must be returned to the appropriate fund or account. The distribution of expired discretionary funds is at the agency head's discretion, with certain limits under IPERA. Under IPERA, agency heads have the authority to determine the percentages for reimbursing expenses related to payment recapture audit programs and services. Agencies are required to report annually on their payment recapture audit programs in their Performance and Accountability Reports or Agency Financial Reports, including details on total payments reviewed, amounts identified for recapture, and amounts actually recaptured. The reports should also include a breakdown of payments excluded from recapture. Under IPERA, agencies must report annually on their payment recapture audit programs, including details on total payments reviewed, amounts identified for recapture, and amounts actually recaptured. Agencies have 10 years to implement improper payment legislation, with core requirements established by IPIA in 2002 and expanded responsibilities under IPERA. Additionally, agencies must submit an annual report to OMB, Congress, and inspectors general with recommendations from payment recapture auditors on mitigating overpayments and actions taken in response. The government's improper payment rate has fluctuated over the years, ranging from a low of 2.81% in FY2007 to a high of 5.42% in FY2009. Despite efforts to reduce error rates, agencies continue to make billions of dollars in improper payments annually. Since the implementation of reporting requirements, agencies have made over $688 billion in improper payments, with $108 billion in FY2012 alone. The inability to significantly reduce the overall improper payment rate is attributed to agencies' failure to reduce error rates. The improper payment rate remains high due to agencies' failure to reduce error rates for federal programs with multi-billion dollar annual outlays. Some programs have seen an increase in error rates over time, and the full extent of the problem is not known. Agencies have yet to develop improper payment rates for certain programs, estimated to have annual improper payments of at least $750 million. The annual dollar amount of improper payments reported has more than doubled from $45 billion in FY2004 to $108 billion in FY2012. The improper payment rate has more than doubled, rising from $45 billion in FY2004 to $108 billion in FY2012. Some multi-billion dollar programs have shown little improvement in their error rates, with examples like the Medicare Fee-for-Service program and Unemployment Insurance program experiencing increased improper payment rates and amounts over time. The improper payment rate has more than doubled, rising from $45 billion in FY2004 to $108 billion in FY2012. Error rates and improper payment amounts have increased over time for programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicare Advantage (Part C). The full scope of improper payments is not yet determined as agencies are still developing estimates for their risk-susceptible programs. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is re-estimating error rates for CHIP and FCC for the High-Cost Program component of USF. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lacks a valid improper payment error rate. The improper payment rate for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in FY2004 was 24.5%, resulting in $9.7 billion in improper payments. OMB estimates the FY2011 improper payment rate for EITC was between 21% and 26%, with estimated improper payments exceeding $15 billion. Many agencies lack effective internal controls to reduce improper payments, with the main causes being administrative errors like failure to verify recipient information and ensure valid payment requests. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended agencies implement preventive controls, including sharing data to validate recipient eligibility and using predictive analytic technologies to detect fraudulent activity in medical service claims. For example, HHS shares information from its New Hires database with the Department of Labor to confirm employment status for Unemployment Insurance benefits. Predictive analytic technology is used by HHS to screen all claims under the Medicare program. GAO is evaluating the effectiveness of technology used by HHS to screen Medicare claims for fraud. They recommend tailored training for agency staff, beneficiaries, and service providers on detecting improper payments and program requirements. GAO also emphasizes the need for agency managers to promptly resolve audit findings showing deficiencies in internal controls. The implementation of IPERA in agencies aims to address deficiencies in internal controls and resolve them within a specific time frame. IPERA has led to an increase in recapturing overpayments, with agencies recovering over $1.2 billion in FY2011, compared to $688 million in FY2010. Some agencies face barriers in recouping overpayments due to statutory or regulatory constraints. Some agencies, like OPM and USDA, face barriers in performing recovery audits due to statutory or regulatory constraints. For example, OPM mentioned restrictions on financial institutions providing information for overpayments, while USDA cited Section 281 of the Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 as hindering recovery audits for FSA and CCC. Other agencies, like HUD, also encounter similar challenges in certain programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Education (ED) face challenges in recovering improper payments due to various barriers. The cost-effectiveness requirement of IPERA limits the funds recovered through recovery audits, with agencies required to conduct audits only if deemed cost-effective. For FY2011, agencies like the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration (SBA) determined that recovery audits would not be cost-effective. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Treasury Department did not perform recovery audits due to low risk and immateriality. SBA cited low error rates and program complexity as reasons for not conducting payment audits. Despite exceeding the $1 million threshold for recovery audits under IPERA, SBA did not provide a justification for this decision. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Audit Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA) aims to expand data verification for accurate payments to eligible recipients. Lack of clear criteria for cost-effectiveness in recovery audits could lead to missed opportunities for recouping overpayments and limit congressional oversight. IPERIA, signed into law in 2013, is in the early stages of implementation. IPERIA, signed into law by President Obama on January 10, 2013, aims to reduce improper payments and increase recovery amounts. The law requires OMB to identify high-priority federal programs for oversight based on dollar value or error rate. Agencies with high-priority programs must submit annual reports on prevention efforts. The IPERIA law requires agencies to submit annual reports on steps taken to prevent improper payments, which will be reviewed by the inspector general and posted publicly. OMB must issue new guidance to improve payment estimates and agencies must follow new sampling standards. IPERIA requires agencies to include all improper payments in their estimates, verify recipient eligibility before issuing payments, and establish a \"Do Not Pay Initiative\" similar to the one by President Obama. Agencies must review various databases to verify eligibility, and OMB has the authority to enforce these requirements. The IPERIA legislation gives OMB the authority to expand the \"Do Not Pay Initiative\" by including additional databases, with public notice and opportunity for comment. OMB must report annually to Congress on agency efforts to implement the initiative and its impact on reducing improper payments. OMB is also required to submit a plan for integrating data across agencies, including maximizing access to databases and developing agreements for data sharing among agency inspectors general. Guidance on IG agreements must include standards for cost reimbursement, record retention, and privacy. IPERIA requires OMB to establish a data-sharing system within 30 days, involving three agencies initially. By June 1, 2013, all agencies must review payments. The Attorney General must assess using incarceration status to prevent improper payments. SSA must enhance death data accuracy. Agencies must set annual payment recapture targets under IPERA. IPERIA expands on provisions for recovering improper payments, setting targets for recovery audit contractors. It aims to improve accuracy in estimating improper payments, including payments to federal employees. OMB is required to determine current and historical recovery amounts and rates, and list agency recovery audit programs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reported that federal benefit programs are susceptible to high rates of improper payments, potentially exceeding $1 billion annually. In FY2008, improper payments totaled over $1 billion across various federal programs. Agencies accessing data from multiple sources could help prevent payments to ineligible recipients, but the cost of integrating and improving data sources should be compared to potential savings. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs discussed eliminating improper payments to deceased individuals on May 8, 2013. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on eliminating improper payments to deceased individuals. The Government Accountability Office found flaws in the Death Master File data, leading to undetected payments to decedents. Senator Carper emphasized the need for accurate information from the DMF to prevent improper payments. Daniel Burtoni from the GAO testified that the accuracy of the DMF is uncertain due to SSA not verifying all death reports received. The SSA receives death reports from various sources, categorized as \"highly accurate\" and \"less accurate.\" They review files from \"less accurate\" sources before recording deaths in the DMF, which include post offices, financial institutions, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Reports from \"highly accurate\" sources like states through the EDRS, family members, and funeral directors are not verified before recording. Deaths reported for non-beneficiaries are not verified by the SSA. The SSA receives death reports from various sources, categorizing them as \"highly accurate\" and \"less accurate.\" They review files from \"less accurate\" sources before recording deaths in the DMF, including post offices, financial institutions, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. SSA must determine eligibility for agencies to access the full DMF on a case-by-case basis. As of May 8, 2013, only six federal agencies have been granted full access, all of which make benefit payments. Agencies are required to reimburse SSA for sharing the DMF data, but SSA is not always reimbursed. Burtoni noted that SSA is not always reimbursed by all agencies for access to the full DMF. The VA and OPM do not reimburse SSA at all, while CMS and DOD do reimburse SSA at different amounts. Some federal agencies only purchase the partial DMF, excluding state-provided data. Benefit-paying agencies may be eligible for full DMF access but have not requested it. Chairman Carper introduced S. 1360 in response to issues raised at a hearing on May 8, 2013. Chairman Carper introduced S. 1360, the Improper Payments Agency Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2013, during a hearing on May 8, 2013. The bill aims to improve the accuracy of DMF data by establishing a National Deaths Registry. This registry would allow federal agencies to access death data to prevent, identify, and recover improper payments under federally funded programs. Agencies would need to reimburse the SSA for the cost of accessing this data. The bill introduced by Chairman Carper aims to establish a National Deaths Registry for federal agencies to access death data and prevent improper payments. It would require governments to reimburse the Commissioner for access and implement procedures for error correction and data sharing with certified contractors. The Commissioner would have authority to share information with federal agencies, superseding the Social Security Act. S. 1360 would establish a National Deaths Registry for federal agencies to access death data and prevent improper payments. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget would identify agencies with data for matching in the Registry, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Agencies would be required to submit data on federal beneficiaries and annuitant recipients regularly for comparison and research. S. 1360 would require the U.S. Postal Service to provide agencies access to delivery addresses, including commercial mailbox locations, with reimbursement authority. Federal agencies must share data on federal beneficiaries. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to Congress on the \"Do Not Pay Initiative\" within 180 days of enactment. S. 1360 mandates data matching to reduce improper payments, requires the OMB Director to form a task force to address payments to deceased federal annuitants, and includes provisions to enhance death data accuracy for reducing improper payments. The task force must include representatives from DOD, SSA, VA, OPM, and other relevant agencies. Expanding data matching with state, local, and tribal governments can help reduce improper payments to deceased individuals. Participation in data sharing comes with a cost, as seen with the Department of Defense paying $40,000 a year for access to the Registry. Implementing the Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS) nationwide could improve the quality and quantity of death data in the Registry. Implementing EDRS nationwide could enhance death data quality. Questions about funding and state capacity arise. S. 1360 aims to allow data sharing with federal agencies. Agencies may face statutory obstacles in formalizing agreements. S. 1360 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report on data analytics within 180 days of enactment, including a description of agencies and programs where data comparison could reveal payment duplication. The Secretary may need to work with agencies to address any statutory barriers to data sharing. Another option is for the OMB Director to include statutory barriers in the annual report on the implementation of S. 1360, due within one year of enactment."
