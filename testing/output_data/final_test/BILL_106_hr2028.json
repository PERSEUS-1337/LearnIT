The under-5 mortality rate in least developed countries is significantly higher than in industrialized nations. Diarrheal dehydration is a leading cause of child deaths worldwide. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) at home could prevent 90% of child deaths from diarrheal diseases, costing just 7 cents per dose. Despite 80% vaccination coverage, 2 million children still die annually from major diseases. $30 million could immunize 2 million children against these diseases. Malaria kills over 1 million children yearly. Malaria kills over 1 million children yearly, but for less than $15 million, bed nets could protect them. 2.9 billion lack sanitation, leading to diseases like diarrhea. $5.50 can provide safe sanitation for a family, and $150 can benefit up to 250 people with a well. 2.2 million children die annually from acute respiratory infections in developing countries. In developing countries, appropriate treatment of acute respiratory infections (ARI) could prevent 30 to 60 percent of ARI-related child deaths. About 100,000,000 children under 5 suffer from vitamin A deficiency, contributing to nearly 25 percent of under-5 deaths. A global immunization campaign is close to eradicating polio through childhood vaccination efforts. Increased breast-feeding can save up to 1,500,000 children annually by reducing diarrheal and respiratory infections. However, the urgent need for safe alternatives to breast-feeding in HIV-positive mothers is highlighted by the high rate of Mother To Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV in Africa. Authorization of appropriations for child survival programs. Authorization of appropriations for infant and child health programs under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for fiscal year 2000 is set at $345,000,000, with a requirement that at least 25 percent be allocated to United States-based private voluntary organizations. Additionally, there is a limitation on population planning assistance not exceeding $285,000,000. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2000 limits population planning activities to $285,000,000."
