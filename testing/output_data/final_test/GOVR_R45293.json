    "content": "Justice Felix Frankfurter and Justice Harry Blackmun both surprised early supporters with their judicial approaches after their appointments to the Supreme Court. Frankfurter, initially seen as a progressive, became a voice for judicial restraint, while Blackmun, considered a strict constructionist, authored the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade. Justice Harry Blackmun, known for his liberal views, authored the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, recognizing the right to terminate a pregnancy. Predicting a nominee's approach as a Justice is challenging, especially when they have a lengthy judicial career. Federal judges on courts of appeals are bound by precedent and hear many routine cases. Unlike the Supreme Court, they do not have discretion in selecting cases. The vast majority of federal appellate opinions are unanimous, indicating the nature of federal appellate work. While Judge Kavanaugh's work on the D.C. Circuit may offer some insight into his general approach to legal issues, the bulk of opinions may not reveal his views on specific areas of law or how he would approach them as a Supreme Court Justice. Supreme Court Justice nominees may join opinions authored by other judges without necessarily fully agreeing with them, as a way to promote consensus on the court. Silent acquiescence in joining a majority opinion does not always indicate complete agreement, but rather acceptance of the outcome. This can provide unique insight into a circuit judge's judicial approach. Silent acquiescence in joining a majority opinion may not indicate complete agreement but rather acceptance of the outcome. Caution is needed when interpreting a judge's vote isolated from a written opinion, especially on procedural matters. Votes on procedural issues, such as granting extensions or rehearing cases en banc, may not necessarily reflect agreement with the legal reasoning presented. A judge may vote to rehear a case en banc to correct errors or resolve conflicts between panel decisions. En banc review is rare and typically reserved for important cases with conflicting precedent within the circuit. Voting on procedural matters may not always reflect agreement with legal reasoning. Despite serving on the federal appellate bench for over a decade, Judge Kavanaugh has not extensively discussed certain areas of law due to the D.C. Circuit's docket. Legal commentators agree that the D.C. Circuit handles a higher percentage of nationally significant legal matters compared to other circuits, particularly in administrative and environmental law cases. Voting on procedural matters, such as rehearing a case en banc, may not indicate a judge's stance on a specific legal position. The D.C. Circuit focuses on administrative and environmental law cases, avoiding \"hot-button\" social issues like abortion and the death penalty. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record is limited in certain areas due to the court's docket. Predicting a nominee's future behavior is challenging, but three key considerations can help assess their approach as a Supreme Court Justice. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to the role of a Supreme Court Justice is influenced by his judicial philosophy, judicial heroes, and general approach to judging. These factors provide clues on how he views the proper role of a Justice. Judge Kavanaugh, a well-known jurist with a robust record of judicial opinions and writings, has clear views on the law and the role of a judge. His approach to judging, writing style, working with colleagues, and judicial philosophy are discussed. He has identified judicial role models who influence his approach to the craft of judging. Judge Kavanaugh is known for his diligent judicial philosophy, requiring his law clerks to compile extensive binders for cases. Colleagues and attorneys praise him for being well-prepared, careful, and thorough in his work. Judge Kavanaugh is highly praised for his clear and effective writing style, employing various mechanical techniques in crafting his judicial opinions. He is known for using strong lead-in sentences, lists, summaries, pointed questions, informal expressions, and repetition in his writing. Judge Kavanaugh's writing style is characterized by the use of bulleted lists, mathematical expressions, and logical sequences, along with introductory ordinals. He also incorporates witticisms and colloquialisms to enhance accessibility. In his dissenting opinions, he provides extensive background and history on issues. Additionally, he heavily relies on academic scholarship in his writings. Judge Kavanaugh's writing style incorporates bulleted lists, mathematical expressions, and logical sequences, along with witticisms and colloquialisms. He heavily relies on academic scholarship, such as law review articles and treatises, to research and write extensively on legal issues. Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and drawing from scholarly works to make informed judicial decisions. Judge Kavanaugh's prolific writing style includes separate opinions, indicating the quality of his work. He authored more separate opinions than his colleagues on the D.C. Circuit, showing a tendency to write separately to express his views on the law. This approach provides insight into his broad judicial perspective. Judge Kavanaugh's tendency to write separately, as shown by his prolific writing style, indicates his focus on \"getting the law right\" rather than consensus. He values dissent and believes it is beneficial for a court. His frequency in authoring majority opinions for divided panels suggests consensus is not a priority in his approach to opinion writing. Judge Kavanaugh's tendency to write separately, as indicated by his prolific writing style, suggests a focus on independence and consistency in his judicial approach over consensus building. This preference for clear rules in adjudication may reflect his value for candor and clear decision-making. Judge Kavanaugh's writing style indicates a focus on independence and consistency in his judicial approach, reflecting a preference for clear rules in adjudication. Legal commentators have noted his reputation for promoting collegiality and working across ideological lines. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial approach emphasizes independence, consistency, and clear rules in adjudication. He promotes collegiality and works across ideological lines, as seen in his interactions with colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. His record on appeal to the Supreme Court shows minimal reversals of his opinions, indicating a high level of scrutiny and quality in his work. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions are notable and serve as a metric to gauge his work. The Supreme Court has adopted his reasoning in several cases, even when dissenting in lower court judgments. The Court has cited his opinions more frequently than other judges, showcasing his influence. The Supreme Court has cited Judge Kavanaugh's separate opinions more frequently than other judges, indicating his influence. Quantitative data and qualitative assessments suggest that Judge Kavanaugh is an influential lower court judge respected by Supreme Court Justices. Legal commentators describe him as serious and commanding respect. His judicial philosophy is described as conservative or pragmatic, with clear writings on his approach. Insights into his judging approach come from a speech at Notre Dame Law School focusing on two central visions. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy is described as conservative or pragmatic, focusing on two central visions for adjudication: the \"rule of law as a law of rules\" and the judge as an \"umpire.\" Embracing legal formalism, he values clarity over flexibility in legal opinions, aiming to increase stability and confidence in judges. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of establishing stable rules of the road for interpreting law to increase confidence in judges as impartial arbiters of the rule of law. He believes that judicial decision-making should be grounded in clear rules to prevent personal feelings from dictating case resolutions and maintain the neutrality of the judiciary. Additionally, he criticizes binaries in statutory interpretation that depend on whether the text is ambiguous or clear. Judge Kavanaugh criticizes the use of ambiguity as a trigger in statutory interpretation, arguing that judges should strive to find the best reading of the statute based on text, context, and established rules of construction to maintain judicial legitimacy. Judge Kavanaugh criticizes the use of vague and amorphous standards in constitutional interpretation, particularly the tiers of scrutiny, which he believes lead to subjective judgment calls rooted in policy rather than law. Judge Kavanaugh criticizes the tiers of scrutiny in constitutional interpretation, aligning with Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia's views. He emphasizes focusing on a provision's \"text, history, and tradition\" for a more stable approach, as seen in his dissent in Heller II. Judge Kavanaugh advocates for a categorical approach in interpreting the Second Amendment, emphasizing reliance on text, history, and tradition rather than balancing tests. While he acknowledges the need for judicial discretion in certain areas of the law, he cautions against a purely mechanical vision of judging. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the need for judicial discretion in certain cases, such as determining what is 'reasonable' under the Fourth Amendment or a 'compelling government interest' under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. He believes ambiguity in the law exists in fewer places than commonly thought and judges should avoid injecting ambiguity into interpretation. Judge Kavanaugh embraces the role of judges as \"umpires,\" emphasizing the importance of neutral and impartial judges who apply the law rather than making it. He believes in the analogy Chief Justice John Roberts used, comparing a judge's job to that of an umpire in baseball. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of judges being neutral and impartial, deciding cases based on settled principles rather than personal preferences or political affiliations. This vision is reflected in his non-judicial writings, speeches, and judicial opinions, highlighting his belief in avoiding judicial activism and sticking to interpreting the Constitution within its proper bounds. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes judicial restraint and the importance of interpreting the Constitution as written, informed by history and precedent, to maintain neutrality and avoid judicial activism. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to judicial philosophy emphasizes textualism, history, tradition, and adherence to precedent to ensure judges remain neutral umpires in interpreting the law. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy emphasizes textualism in interpreting the law, focusing on the precise wording of statutes and the Constitution to promote a neutral judiciary. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes textualism in interpreting the law, focusing on the precise wording of statutes and the Constitution. He instructs judges to read the text of the Constitution as written and not create new constitutional rights. However, he acknowledges that in some cases, judges may need to consider policy and perform a common law-like function. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial opinions are guided by textualism and a belief in interpreting the law based on the precise wording of statutes and the Constitution. He also considers \"history and tradition\" in his legal interpretations, not limiting himself to a narrow view of what informs legal interpretation. Some commentators have labeled him an originalist in the Scalia tradition. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial opinions are guided by textualism and a belief in interpreting the law based on the precise wording of statutes and the Constitution. While some commentators have labeled him an originalist in the Scalia tradition, he does not explicitly call himself an originalist and his opinions suggest he uses less originalist analysis than Justices Thomas or Gorsuch. In a 2017 speech, he expressed concerns about the indeterminacy of constitutional interpretation and has not openly endorsed constitutional interpretations based on the Constitution's \"original public meaning.\" In Heller II, he embraced originalism in his dissenting opinion. In his dissenting opinion in Heller II, Judge Kavanaugh argued that laws inconsistent with the original meaning of the Constitution cannot alter that text. He emphasized the enduring nature of the Constitution's principles, which must be applied to modern conditions while remaining faithful to the original principles. Applying constitutional principles to novel situations can be challenging but is essential in judicial decision-making under the enduring Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of historical practice in judicial decision-making under the Constitution, as seen in his dissenting opinion in PHH Corp. v. CFPB. He argues that historical practice helps define constitutional limits on the Legislative and Executive Branches, citing the nation's post-ratification experience with independent agencies. Judge Kavanaugh's departure from historical practice is significant for separation of powers analysis. He prioritizes a textualist approach over an originalist philosophy, suggesting that the Constitution is not perfect and may need to be changed. He also questions the reliability of source materials used by originalists. Judge Kavanaugh has endorsed the originalist concept of the \"enduring constitution\" and relies on originalist principles, despite not being a strict originalist like Scalia. He emphasizes sticking close to the text during compromise and believes in a Constitution that lives and endures. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of original meaning and textualist approach in his opinions, highlighting the significance of the enduring Constitution. He believes in following Supreme Court precedent strictly and absolutely, advocating for a neutral and impartial judiciary composed of judges applying stable rules of law. Judge Kavanaugh stresses the importance of adhering to Supreme Court precedent strictly, emphasizing the need for lower courts to follow it faithfully for stability. He believes in absolute vertical stare decisis and insists on following Supreme Court precedent in both letter and spirit. This philosophy is evident in his written opinions in high-profile cases, such as Garza v. Hargan. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of lower courts strictly adhering to Supreme Court precedent for stability, stating that their job is to apply precedents and principles from Supreme Court decisions to new situations. He believes judges should follow Supreme Court cases in both letter and spirit, without re-litigating or expanding on them. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of lower courts strictly adhering to Supreme Court precedent for stability, stating that their job is to apply precedents and principles from Supreme Court decisions to new situations. He believes judges should follow Supreme Court cases in both letter and spirit, without re-litigating or expanding on them. Judge Kavanaugh more colorfully stated that lower courts must \"follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court opinions.\" It is difficult to predict how he would apply the doctrine of stare decisis if elevated to the Supreme Court, given the unique nature of that position. His previous judicial writings as a D.C. Circuit judge provide some clues on how he might approach overturning existing precedent. Judge Kavanaugh expressed doubts about the Supreme Court's test for overturning precedent, stating that it lacks a principled, restraining standard. He criticized the current approach, suggesting that a set formula for overruling prior decisions may not work in all cases. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the Supreme Court's test for overturning precedent, stating it lacks a principled standard and does not provide predictability or guidance. He emphasized the importance of setting clear rules in advance and following them, even in cases where judges have discretion. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes stability, predictability, and consistency in decision-making. He may be reluctant to overturn well-established precedent but is willing to do so if prior decisions are undermined or inconsistent with prevailing doctrine. For example, he has questioned the viability of Supreme Court decisions in certain cases. Judge Kavanaugh has questioned the viability of the Supreme Court's decision in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, suggesting that the factual foundation for the case has changed since 1994. He believes that future courts could reach a different result and that stare decisis should only apply to the constitutional principles underlying the original decision. This implies that in certain circumstances, a court may depart from established precedent. Judge Kavanaugh has criticized Supreme Court decisions that restricted the President's power to remove executive officers, arguing for a narrow interpretation of these cases. He believes that courts can depart from precedent if it remains true to underlying principles, as seen in his opinions on Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the Morrison v. Olson case, suggesting it should be overturned. He values judicial formalism and looks up to Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Roberts as role models. Judge Kavanaugh views Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Roberts as judicial role models, praising Scalia for his focus on statutory interpretation and Roberts for his leadership style. He has also admired other jurists like former Chief Justice Rehnquist. Judge Kavanaugh has praised former Chief Justice William Rehnquist as his \"first judicial hero\" and attributes many of his judicial principles to him. He admires Rehnquist's impact on modern constitutional law and found frequent agreement with his opinions since his law school days. Judge Kavanaugh views Justice Jackson as a role model for his interpretation of the law, particularly citing his framework for assessing executive wartime powers in the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer case. He considers Justice Jackson's approach to the separation of powers as influential on his own views. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed admiration for Justice Jackson as a role model for executive branch lawyers turned judges. He has also shown approval of Justice White's judicial restraint approach and suggested an affinity with Justice Kagan based on their similar backgrounds. The relationship between Kavanaugh and Kagan has been noted by commentators as one to watch, especially considering their shared teaching roles at Harvard. Judge Kavanaugh, a textualist, favors interpreting statutes based on their text rather than their purpose. He admires Justice Scalia's influence on statutory interpretation and has praised Justice Kagan for her textualist opinions. Judge Kavanaugh, a textualist, interprets statutes based on their text rather than their purpose. Justice Kennedy, although not strictly adhering to textualism, also emphasized the importance of the text's ordinary meaning in statutory interpretation. Kennedy would sometimes consider the statutory scheme as a whole and the practical consequences of different interpretations. Judge Kavanaugh, a textualist, may bring a more textualist approach to statutory interpretation if confirmed, but he could still consider pragmatic considerations like Justice Kennedy. Judge Kavanaugh's theory of statutory interpretation is based on his views about separation of powers. He believes judges should serve as neutral umpires who interpret the law based on the text of statutes, leaving legislative decisions to Congress and the President. Judge Kavanaugh believes in interpreting statutes based on the text itself, using ordinary language understanding. He favors text-based tools for statutory interpretation and avoids relying on legislative history. Judge Kavanaugh, a proponent of textualism, cautions against using interpretive tools that rely on ambiguity. He argues that determining ambiguity is subjective and can lead to judges injecting their own policy views into their decisions. Kavanaugh calls for a careful examination of doctrines dependent on ambiguity findings to ensure impartiality in interpreting statutes. Judge Kavanaugh, a proponent of textualism, emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutes based on their plain meaning and surrounding context, using dictionaries as evidence. In United States v. Papagno, he applied this textualist approach to interpret the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. Judge Kavanaugh, a proponent of textualism, interpreted the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) in a case involving the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). He concluded that restitution for an internal investigation conducted by the NRL was not authorized under the MVRA, as the NRL was not \"participating in the investigation or prosecution of the offense.\" This decision was based on dictionary definitions, Supreme Court cases, and a comparison to other federal statutes governing restitution. Judge Kavanaugh's opinion in Papagno relied on textualist tools like ordinary meaning and statutory context to interpret the disputed provision of the MVRA. He compared it to a different restitution statute and concluded that Congress did not intend to authorize restitution for internal investigations conducted by the NRL. This interpretation differed from other courts of appeals that took a broader view of the restitution provision. In Lagos v. United States, the Supreme Court adopted a narrow view of the MVRA, resolving a split among courts of appeals. Judge Kavanaugh utilizes canons of construction, particularly semantic canons, to interpret statutes but calls for reforms in their use. Textualists generally favor traditional linguistic canons. Judge Kavanaugh advocates for using semantic canons that reflect how people understand English language. He argues against canons that cannot be consistently applied. For example, he questions the rule against surplusage in statutes, noting that redundancy in language is common. Judge Kavanaugh supports using semantic canons that align with common understanding of language. He opposes canons that lead to difficult policy judgments. Kavanaugh questions the use of substantive canons unless justified by constitutional values. He upholds the presumption of mens rea in criminal cases, emphasizing its importance in law and justice. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutes based on the text and context before resorting to substantive canons or legislative history. He argues that courts should only use legislative history if the text is ambiguous, as clarity should be the trigger for its use. Kavanaugh's textualist approach aligns with his broader concerns about the use of tools that may lead to subjective interpretations in the pursuit of law and justice. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kavanaugh criticized the use of legislative history in interpreting statutes, arguing that it should only be used if the text is ambiguous. He rejected committee reports as unreliable expressions of statutory intent, emphasizing the importance of relying on the statutory text and context. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the use of legislative history in interpreting statutes, arguing that it should only be used if the text is ambiguous. He rejected committee reports as unreliable expressions of statutory intent, emphasizing the importance of relying on the statutory text and context. The nominee concluded that the term 'employee' in the NLRA excludes an illegal immigrant worker, citing the need to interpret it in conjunction with immigration laws. Despite concerns about judges relying on personal assessments of meaning, Judge Kavanaugh acknowledged that in some cases, considering policy and common law-like functions is unavoidable. He often relies on his own assessments of interpretation aligning with common meaning or practice, invoking pragmatic concerns about how a statutory scheme functions. Judge Kavanaugh rejects using legislative history in interpreting statutes, emphasizing reliance on text and context. He interprets statutory terms based on common sense and common practice, considering pragmatic concerns about statutory schemes. In a case, he argued against a reading that would hinder the Department's discretionary authority. In another case, he criticized the EPA for not considering costs in issuing regulations. Judge Kavanaugh interprets statutes based on common sense and common practice, using legislative history to support his understanding of congressional compromise. He invokes substantive canons like the absurdity doctrine and the \"elephants in mouseholes\" canon to interpret statutes. Judge Kavanaugh has criticized the modern approach to severability and has employed canons like the absurdity doctrine and \"elephants in mouseholes\" to interpret statutes, despite concerns about consistency and textualism. Severability is a doctrine related to statutory interpretation. When a statute is found unconstitutional, courts may need to decide which provisions to strike down. The Supreme Court recognizes that in some cases, it is impossible to separate unconstitutional parts from the rest of the statute, leading to the entire statute being struck down. This issue can arise in complex statutory schemes like the Affordable Care Act. Severability is a doctrine related to statutory interpretation, particularly in complex statutory schemes like the Affordable Care Act. Courts determine if unconstitutional provisions can be separated from the rest of the statute. Justice Thomas and Judge Kavanaugh have criticized the modern severability inquiry for not following basic principles of statutory interpretation. Judge Kavanaugh has criticized the modern severability inquiry, suggesting a new default rule to sever offending provisions from statutes to the narrowest extent possible unless Congress indicates otherwise. He expressed concerns about speculating on congressional intent and questioned whether unconstitutional provisions should invalidate entire statutes. Judge Kavanaugh criticizes the modern severability inquiry, proposing a new default rule to sever offending provisions from statutes to the narrowest extent possible unless Congress indicates otherwise. He questions whether unconstitutional provisions should invalidate entire statutes, favoring a narrow view of a court's role in striking down unconstitutional legislation. It remains uncertain if other Supreme Court Justices share his concerns, potentially leading to a reevaluation of the severability doctrine. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record includes a focus on the severability doctrine and administrative law, questioning the extent of authority granted to federal agencies by Congress. Justice Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh may replace, played a key role in administrative law cases. Kavanaugh proposes a new default rule for severability, advocating for minimal invalidation of statutes unless Congress specifies otherwise. This could lead to a reevaluation of the current severability doctrine. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination may lead to a reconsideration of the Chevron doctrine on agency deference, potentially reshaping administrative law. His robust record in administrative law aligns with the D.C. Circuit's focus on such cases. This shift, influenced by Justice Kennedy's retirement, could impact foundational administrative law doctrines. Judge Kavanaugh's extensive experience in administrative law cases on the D.C. Circuit Court includes writing numerous concurring and dissenting opinions on agency actions. He has shown skepticism towards agencies expanding their regulatory power and may be willing to limit the Chevron doctrine in certain circumstances. This could potentially reshape administrative law doctrines. Judge Kavanaugh's past opinions suggest he may limit courts' deference to federal agencies under the Chevron doctrine. His views on agency actions, statutory authority interpretations, and discretionary review differ somewhat from Justice Scalia's. Judge Kavanaugh's views on standing in federal courts differ from those of Justice Scalia, who emphasized the importance of standing as a limitation on court jurisdiction. While Kavanaugh has applied Supreme Court case law on standing, he does not take as restrictive a view as Scalia, especially compared to his colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Kavanaugh has often voted in favor of allowing individuals to challenge agency actions in court, even when his colleagues ruled to dismiss the suit. In a specific case, he dissented in a ruling where an attorney challenged the constitutionality of a CFPB enforcement action, arguing that courts make standing law more complicated than necessary. Judge Kavanaugh has a tendency to challenge agency actions in court, arguing that standing law is unnecessarily complicated. In a case involving a CFPB enforcement action, he dissented, stating that the attorney had established standing and her suit should not have been dismissed. In another case, he disagreed with the majority panel's decision to deny a food group's petition to review an EPA decision due to lack of prudential standing. Judge Kavanaugh dissented in cases involving standing law complexities. In one case, he argued that an entity has standing to challenge agency regulations if it harms their interests. In another case, he argued for standing in a lawsuit seeking removal from the No-Fly List. Judge Kavanaugh has written opinions clarifying standing issues, including Article III standing and prudential standing questions. He argued for standing in cases involving agency regulations and lawsuits seeking removal from the No-Fly List. In Grocery Manufacturers Ass ' n v. EPA, he addressed prudential standing by emphasizing the \"zone of interests\" protected by the relevant statute. Judge Kavanaugh has written opinions clarifying standing issues, including Article III standing and prudential standing questions. He argued that the zone of interests test is not jurisdictional but simply asks whether a statute provides a cause of action to bring suit. The Supreme Court later cited his opinion favorably on this point. In White Stallion Energy Center v. EPA, the majority panel denied petitions challenging an EPA regulation on emission standards for air pollutants. The majority panel found that the party had standing to challenge in federal court but was not within the zone of interests protected by the Clean Air Act. Judge Kavanaugh expressed concern about the \"zone of interests\" test and noted a presumption in favor of allowing suit unless there is clear congressional intent to preclude review. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the D.C. Circuit's restrictive approach to the zone of interests test, urging alignment with Supreme Court precedent. He highlighted inconsistencies in allowing competitors to sue and called for a reconsideration of the court's stance. Judge Kavanaugh criticizes the D.C. Circuit's approach to reviewing administrative agency legal interpretations, advocating for alignment with Supreme Court precedent. Chevron's two-step analysis is typically used, with courts deferring to agency interpretations if statutes are silent or ambiguous. Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co. provide additional guidance on deference to agency interpretations. Judge Kavanaugh questions the Chevron doctrine and Auer v. Robbins deference, arguing that they incentivize federal agencies to overstep their authority. He criticizes the imprecise mechanics of applying Chevron and the uncertainty in determining statutory clarity. Judge Kavanaugh has a higher threshold for finding ambiguity in a statute compared to other judges, leading him to be more likely to find clarity rather than ambiguity in statutory provisions. He questions the Chevron doctrine and Auer deference, expressing concerns about federal agencies overstepping their authority. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to statutory interpretation differs from other judges as he has a higher threshold for finding ambiguity in a statute. He questions the Chevron doctrine and Auer deference, expressing concerns about federal agencies overstepping their authority. In a specific case, he disagreed with the majority opinion's finding of ambiguity in the Medicare statute, stating that the statute was clear and the agency's interpretation contradicted the law. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to statutory interpretation involves a higher threshold for finding ambiguity in a statute. He questions the Chevron doctrine and Auer deference, expressing concerns about federal agencies overstepping their authority. In a specific case, he disagreed with the majority opinion's finding of ambiguity in the Medicare statute, stating that the statute was clear and the agency's interpretation contradicted the law. Judge Kavanaugh's penchant for finding clarity in statutory terms makes him more likely to resolve a case at Chevron's first step rather than at step two. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to statutory interpretation involves a higher threshold for finding ambiguity in a statute, questioning the Chevron doctrine and Auer deference. He is more likely to independently analyze an agency's authority at Chevron's first step rather than defer to their interpretation at step two, reflecting a similar approach taken by the Supreme Court in Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States. This approach may also indicate his agreement with concerns about the elision of law and policy at Chevron's second step. Judge Kavanaugh aims to distinguish between questions of law and policy in statutory interpretation, emphasizing that agencies need clear authorization from Congress for regulations with major significance. He questions the Chevron doctrine and Auer deference, advocating for a higher threshold for ambiguity in statutes. In FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., Judge Kavanaugh criticized the EPA for exceeding its statutory authority in regulations to curb global warming. He argued that the EPA chose a broad interpretation of its power, imposing permitting requirements on more entities, and effectively \"re-writing\" aspects of the statute. Kavanaugh rejected this approach, emphasizing the need for clear congressional authorization for significant regulations. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the EPA for its broad interpretation of statutory authority, arguing that it would increase regulation on numerous entities, imposing significant costs on businesses and the economy. He emphasized the need for clear congressional authorization for major regulations, citing previous cases to support his stance. In SeaWorld of Florida, LLC v. Perez, the D.C Circuit panel upheld a citation against SeaWorld for violating OSHA's \"general duty\" clause by exposing animal trainers to recognized hazards. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that the DOL lacked authority to regulate these activities. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the DOL's decision to regulate the normal activities of participants in sports events or entertainment shows, stating that hazards intrinsic to an industry's normal activities should not be subject to penalties under OSHA to avoid potentially eliminating dangerous industries. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the DOL's authority to regulate activities in sports and entertainment industries under OSHA, arguing that Congress did not intend to implicitly authorize such regulation when passing OSHA. Judge Kavanaugh dissented in a case involving the FCC's net neutrality rule, arguing that the agency lacked authority to issue the regulations. He referenced the \"major rules doctrine\" to support his position. Judge Kavanaugh referenced the \"major rules doctrine\" in a case involving the FCC's net neutrality rule, arguing that agencies must have clear authorization from Congress to issue major rules of great significance. He stated that while the Chevron framework allows for ordinary rules based on statutory ambiguity, major rules cannot rely on such ambiguity. Judge Kavanaugh considered the FCC net neutrality rule a major rule due to its significant impact on companies and consumers, leading to a loss of control over the Internet. He found the rule invalid as Congress did not clearly authorize it. His approach to the major rules doctrine differs from his colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh's approach to major rules could limit the application of the Chevron framework and require a more stringent analysis of agency rule authorization. This contrasts with his colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to major rules could limit the application of the Chevron framework and require a more stringent analysis of agency rule authorization, placing a \"thumb on the scale\" for clear statutory authorization to support regulations. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to agency actions, including Auer deference, may require a heavy burden to prove legality. In cases like Howmet Corp. v. EPA, he has upheld agency interpretations of regulations as reasonable, similar to his approach in statutory review cases. Judge Kavanaugh dissented in a case involving the EPA, arguing that the agency's interpretation of its own regulation was not valid as it expanded its regulatory authority. He believed the regulations were clear and declined to defer to the agency, unlike his views on Chevron and Auer deference. The nominee is comfortable upholding agency policy choices within statutory authority but has invalidated decisions deemed arbitrary and capricious. In a case involving the FCC, Judge Kavanaugh dissented from remanding a rule on broadband Internet access, arguing it should be upheld. Judge Kavanaugh supported the FCC's ruling, stating that the agency's decision was within its expertise and discretion. He emphasized the importance of not substituting the court's judgment for that of the agency when Congress has delegated policymaking authority. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the judicial application of procedural requirements on federal agencies not expressly required by statute. In the American Radio case, the FCC was asked to explain its reasoning on broadband access rules and release redacted internal staff studies. Kavanaugh argued that the court's decision was consistent with precedent but inconsistent with the APA, citing a 1978 opinion requiring invalidation. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. invalidated additional procedural requirements imposed by the D.C. Circuit on agencies, ruling that the APA sets the maximum procedures required for agency rulemaking. Judge Kavanaugh's views on administrative law, including Article III standing and deference to federal agencies, are significant for his nomination to the Supreme Court. His opinions suggest how he may approach such matters if confirmed. Judge Kavanaugh's views on administrative law, including Article III standing and deference to federal agencies, are significant for his nomination to the Supreme Court. He may limit Chevron deference and prioritize statutory language in resolving disputes independently. Kavanaugh is likely to play a key role in business law cases. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court is significant for his views on administrative law and business law cases. If confirmed, he could influence the Court's business law jurisprudence, particularly in cases related to arbitration agreements, antitrust law, and foreign corporations. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court could impact business law jurisprudence. His views on various business law issues, such as class action litigation and federal preemption of state tort law, remain unclear. However, his rulings on cases like PHH Corp. v. CFPB suggest potential implications for business regulation. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions on business-related cases, such as corporate liability under the ATS and the President's removal power, raise concerns about separation of powers and national security rather than specific views on business regulation. His decisions on substantive business law, including antitrust and labor law, remain open to debate. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions on business-related cases, such as antitrust law, labor law, and securities law, show his skepticism towards broad administrative power over business entities and a narrower view of federal antitrust law. These views suggest a cautious approach to federal statutes and rights not explicitly stated in the text. His decisions in these areas may impact how he approaches business law cases. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions on antitrust law suggest a cautious approach to federal statutes, emphasizing economic efficiency. The evolution of antitrust doctrine reflects changes in economic thought, with some advocating for a broader consideration of goals such as consumer choice and market entry opportunities. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions on antitrust law emphasize economic efficiency and caution, with a focus on ensuring open markets for new businesses and limiting the political power of large firms. In a critical dissenting opinion in United States v. Anthem, Inc., he opposed a merger between Anthem and Cigna, indicating a reluctance to prioritize social and political goals over economic efficiency in antitrust jurisprudence. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined a merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, citing anticompetitive effects in the health insurance market for \"national accounts.\" Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that the merger could generate efficiencies benefiting customers through lower rates negotiated with healthcare providers. Judge Kavanaugh criticized a portion of the majority opinion suggesting that efficiencies resulting from a merger may not offer a viable legal defense. He argued that the Court had shifted away from a strict anti-merger approach in the 1970s. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the majority opinion for not considering efficiencies resulting from mergers as a viable defense. He preferred the modern approach to antitrust law, focusing on efficiencies and consumer benefits. In a dissent in FTC v. Whole Foods Market, he argued for a broader view of the relevant product market in merger cases. In the FTC v. Whole Foods Market case, the FTC argued that the merger would decrease competition in the premium, natural, and organic supermarkets market in eighteen cities where Whole Foods and Wild Oats were the only competitors. Whole Foods, on the other hand, claimed that the relevant market was broader, including non-PNOS grocery stores. The debate centered around whether the merger would harm competition in the specific PNOS market or the broader grocery market. The district court sided with Whole Foods and denied the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction, but the D.C. Circuit reversed this decision on appeal. Judge Brown concluded that the FTC had presented strong evidence showing that PNOS constituted a distinct \"submarket\" catering to a \"core group\" of customers who would continue to shop at the merged firm even if prices were raised. The D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision, remanding the case for further consideration on whether the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with his colleagues, arguing that Whole Foods competed with a range of non-PNOS grocery stores and questioning the market definition analysis. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with his colleagues on the market definition analysis, emphasizing the importance of formal rules in antitrust law. He criticized the loose antitrust standards of Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, advocating for more rigorous approaches that focus on quantitative assessments of market concentration and price elasticities. His approach aligns with Justice Kennedy's opinions, which limited antitrust laws based on insights from the \"Chicago School\" of antitrust analysis. The \"Chicago School\" of antitrust analysis heavily emphasizes economic reasoning, rejects non-efficiency values, and believes in market efficiency without government intervention. Justice Kennedy and Judge Kavanaugh's antitrust decisions are influenced by Judge Robert Bork's book, The Antitrust Paradox, which criticizes broad antitrust interpretations and non-efficiency values in antitrust cases. This book has had a significant impact on antitrust policy since the Sherman Act. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions suggest that he is sympathetic to the Chicago School's core principles in antitrust law, similar to Justice Kennedy. His vote may be crucial in maintaining the Court's current balance in antitrust cases, as seen in recent divided decisions. Additionally, Judge Kavanaugh has been involved in labor law cases, where some argue the Roberts Court has shown pro-business tendencies. The Roberts Court has displayed pro-business tendencies, especially in labor law cases. Judge Kavanaugh has shown a deferential approach to reviewing decisions by labor arbitrators and is hesitant to find legal rights not explicitly stated in federal labor statutes. The NLRA gives the NLRB discretion to defer to arbitration decisions if they are not \"clearly repugnant\" to the NLRA. In Verizon New England Inc. v. NLRB, Judge Kavanaugh reversed an NLRB order overturning an arbitration panel's decision regarding employees' rights in a collective bargaining agreement with Verizon. The NLRB overturned an arbitration panel's decision regarding employees' rights to display pro-union signs in cars at Verizon facilities. Judge Kavanaugh of the D.C. Circuit reversed the NLRB's decision, stating that the arbitrator's decision was not \"palpably wrong\" as it did not clearly define \"picketing\" to exclude displaying pro-union signs in cars. Judge Kavanaugh upheld the right to display pro-union signs in employees' cars at Verizon facilities, ruling that it was not considered \"picketing\" and deferring to a labor arbitrator's decision in a similar case involving postal workers' unions. In a 1992 agreement between unions and the Postal Service, Judge Kavanaugh upheld an arbitrator's decision based on Supreme Court precedent. He showed hesitance in finding legal rights not explicitly stated in federal labor laws, as seen in his dissent in a case involving the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Judge Kavanaugh rejected the court's conclusion that the LMRDA established a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty by unions. He argued that the statute only allows union \"members\" to sue, not the unions themselves. This was based on the Act's requirement for union members to bring lawsuits after their union fails to do so under state law, not the LMRDA. In SeaWorld of Florida v. Perez, Judge Kavanaugh dissented from a decision affirming the DOL's citation of SeaWorld for violating OSHA by exposing animal trainers to hazards during performances. He argued that the DOL lacked authority under the General Duty Clause to issue the citation. Judge Kavanaugh dissented in SeaWorld of Florida v. Perez, arguing that the Department of Labor lacked the authority to penalize dangerous activities intrinsic to SeaWorld's business, such as close contact between trainers and whales. He criticized the Department's distinction between this contact and other forms of entertainment, stating that allowing the citation would give the Department excessive regulatory power over sports and entertainment activities. Judge Kavanaugh's potential confirmation to the Supreme Court could have a significant impact on labor law cases and federal securities law. His textualist approach to statutory interpretation and skepticism towards administrative authority may play a crucial role in future decisions. If confirmed, he would likely address issues related to disclosure and anti-fraud requirements in federal securities laws to ensure accurate pricing of securities and efficient capital allocation. The Roberts Court has addressed various securities law issues, including anti-fraud liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed clear views on this topic, which could have implications if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court. SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibits fraudulent activities in connection with securities transactions, including employing deceptive devices or making false statements. Private plaintiffs cannot bring Section 10(b) claims against those who aid and abet violations without personally engaging in the prohibited conduct. Justice Kennedy interpreted Section 10(b) to only prohibit material misstatements or manipulative acts, ruling that private plaintiffs cannot sue those who aid and abet such conduct. The Court further clarified this in Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., where vendors and customers accused of facilitating accounting fraud were not held liable under Rule 10b-5 for participating in a \"scheme to defraud.\" In 2011, the Court ruled in Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders that an investment adviser assisting in preparing false statements in prospectuses did not violate Rule 10b-5(b) as they were not considered the \"maker\" of the statements. The Court defined the \"maker\" as the entity with ultimate authority over the statement's content and communication. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Lorenzo v. SEC sheds light on his views regarding \"secondary\" liability under federal securities laws. The case involved an investment banker charged by the SEC for sending misleading emails to investors about a securities offering, violating anti-fraud provisions. The D.C. Circuit panel determined that the banker was not the \"maker\" of the statements, reversing the SEC's decision. In Lorenzo v. SEC, the court reversed the SEC's determination that the banker violated Rule 10b-5(b) based on Janus Capital Group but affirmed the violation of other anti-fraud provisions. The court found that the banker knowingly sent misleading statements to investors, rejecting the argument that he was not the \"maker\" of the statements. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, disagreeing with the majority's conclusion. In Lorenzo v. SEC, the court reversed the SEC's determination that the banker violated Rule 10b-5(b) but affirmed other anti-fraud violations. Judge Kavanaugh argued that the SEC rewrote factual findings to support the legal conclusion of guilt, disregarding mens rea principles essential for individual liberty. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the majority's conclusion on anti-fraud provisions, arguing that the SEC should not rewrite factual findings to support guilt and that aiding and abetting should not be considered primary violation. Judge Kavanaugh pushed back against the SEC's efforts to broaden primary anti-fraud liability in cases like Central Bank of Denver, Stoneridge Investment Partners, and Janus Capital Group. He disagreed with holding a banker liable for forwarding misstatements in a fraudulent scheme and expressed skepticism towards judicial deference to SEC administrative adjudications. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Lorenzo to address the issue of repackaging misstatement claims as fraudulent schemes. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism towards broad views of the powers in cases involving the SEC's efforts to broaden primary anti-fraud liability. If confirmed, he could shape the Supreme Court's business-related decisions, including cases on arbitration, products liability, federal preemption, class actions, and antitrust law. His views on antitrust law, labor law, and securities law provide insight into his stance on federal economic regulation. Judge Kavanaugh's skepticism towards broad views of administrative agency powers and preference for modern antitrust law suggest his approach to business law aligns with Justice Kennedy's. Kennedy was pivotal in civil rights cases involving voting rights, affirmative action, and discrimination based on sexual orientation. Judge Kavanaugh's potential influence on civil rights jurisprudence is uncertain due to his limited record in civil rights law. His stance on constitutional civil rights claims, especially regarding affirmative action, remains unclear. The panel decision rejected the plaintiff's arguments regarding equal footing in business development program. Judge Kavanaugh's civil rights record is limited, with significant cases involving Title VII and ADA. His stance on issues like discrimination based on sexual orientation remains unclear. Judge Kavanaugh has adjudicated limited civil rights cases, including a voter identification law under the Voting Rights Act. He has authored opinions on Title VII racial discrimination claims and dissenting opinions on conflicts between antidiscrimination protection and other statutes. In Ayissi-Etoh v. Fannie Mae, Judge Kavanaugh concurred in favor of the plaintiff in a Title VII case involving a racially hostile work environment. He emphasized that a supervisor's use of a racial slur alone could establish a hostile work environment under federal anti-discrimination laws. Judge Kavanaugh's position on racially hostile work environments goes beyond precedent by stating that a supervisor's one-time use of a racial slur can establish a Title VII violation. In another case, Ortiz-Diaz v. Department of Housing & Urban Development, he considered whether the denial of a Latino employee's transfer request based on race was actionable under Title VII. The panel held that the transfer denial could be a Title VII violation as it would have removed the plaintiff from a race-biased supervisor and offered potential career advancement. Judge Kavanaugh supported the narrowing of precedents to make some lateral transfers actionable under Title VII, suggesting that all discriminatory transfers based on race should be considered violations. Transfers and denials of transfers based on an employee's race are considered discrimination under Title VII. Judge Kavanaugh has interpreted Title VII broadly, sometimes ruling in favor of plaintiffs but also against them. He has differed from some colleagues in finding that certain legal doctrines or governmental interests can bar antidiscrimination claims from proceeding. In cases like Rattigan v. Holder, he filed dissenting opinions disagreeing with the majority's decision. In Rattigan I and II, Judge Kavanaugh dissented on allowing a plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim to proceed, focusing on the interpretation of Department of Navy v. Egan regarding a retaliatory referral for security clearance. The MSPB lacked authority to review a security clearance decision that led to a plaintiff's termination from a job at a Navy facility, as discussed in Egan. The Court emphasized the President's authority in national security, executive branch discretion in protecting classified information, and MSPB's lack of expertise in national security matters. In Rattigan I, the FBI's decisionmaking process and clearance decision were deemed not reviewable under Egan, but the plaintiff's retaliation claim could proceed based on challenging a supervisor's referral as retaliatory. The panel allowed the plaintiff's retaliation claim to proceed without reviewing the agency's security clearance process, citing Egan as a narrow ruling. Judge Kavanaugh, however, interpreted Egan more broadly to preclude court review of any referrals, criticizing the majority for not doing so. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the majority for narrowing the security clearance process in connection with Title VII claims, citing the President's executive orders as support for Egan's bar to reviewability. He noted concerns about deterring false reports but stated that there are other sanctions in place. The panel decision in Rattigan II further limited the type of Title VII claims that could proceed in relation to security referrals. Judge Kavanaugh dissented on the limitation of Title VII claims related to security referrals, arguing that it could still allow courts to review unreviewable security clearance decisions. He also disagreed on whether privileges from the Speech or Debate Clause barred discrimination claims against a congressional employer. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed on whether privileges from the Speech or Debate Clause could bar discrimination claims against a congressional employer, emphasizing the practical difficulty of challenging personnel decisions without delving into protected legislative activities. He suggested using internal administrative procedures to address discrimination allegations. In Miller v. Clinton, the dissenting nominee argued that the State Department could avoid a federal antidiscrimination lawsuit by interpreting the Basic Authorities Act broadly. The majority rejected this, stating that the Act did not exempt the agency from complying with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The majority in Miller v. Clinton rejected the State Department's argument that the Basic Authorities Act allowed them to ignore antidiscrimination laws based on age. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, believing the Act gave the State Department discretion to negotiate contracts without regard to such laws. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the majority in Miller v. Clinton, stating that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act was clear and should be applied. He dismissed concerns about exempting the State Department from workplace discrimination laws, pointing to constitutional protections. Kavanaugh emphasized the court's role in enforcing existing laws rather than changing them. Judge Kavanaugh's positions in statutory civil rights cases show a preference for legal formalism, textualism, and separation of powers. He favors clear rules in civil rights matters and is reluctant to expose executive or legislative branches to liability under antidiscrimination laws without precedent or statutory language dictating otherwise. Judge Kavanaugh's positions in statutory civil rights cases show a preference for legal formalism, textualism, and separation of powers. He favors clear rules in civil rights matters and is reluctant to expose executive or legislative branches to liability under antidiscrimination laws unless binding precedent or statutory language dictate otherwise. However, his involvement in civil rights cases is limited, making it challenging to predict his approach to other civil rights issues. In a notable voting rights decision, South Carolina v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh authored a unanimous opinion before the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. In South Carolina v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh granted preclearance of Act R54, a voter ID law, under the VRA's Section 5 despite DOJ's prior denial. The law was challenged for potentially denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized the significance of the VRA in American history. Judge Kavanaugh granted preclearance of Act R54, a voter ID law, for the election following 2012 under Section 5. The law included provisions for expanding acceptable photo IDs and providing free voter ID cards. Voters could still cast ballots without a photo ID by presenting a non-photo voter registration card and completing an affidavit. Judge Kavanaugh granted preclearance of Act R54, a voter ID law, for the election following 2012 under Section 5. The law included provisions for expanding acceptable photo IDs and providing free voter ID cards. Voters could still cast ballots without a photo ID by presenting a non-photo voter registration card and completing an affidavit at the polling site stating the reason for not obtaining a photo ID. The DOJ denied preclearance in part due to the ambiguous and unclear application of the affidavit requirement mandating the voter to identify a \"reasonable impediment.\" Officials in South Carolina confirmed they would accept any reason asserted on the reasonable impediment affidavit. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of South Carolina's broad interpretation of the \"reasonable impediment\" provision in granting preclearance of the voter ID law. He warned that without this interpretation, the law could have discriminatory effects on African-American voters and raise questions under Section 5. The nominee concluded that South Carolina's voter ID law, R54, would not have a discriminatory retrogressive effect under Section 5 as every voter with a non-photo voter registration card could still use it to vote. Judge Kavanaugh also found that the state did not have a discriminatory purpose in enacting the law, justifying it as necessary to deter voter fraud. Judge Kavanaugh upheld South Carolina's voter ID law, stating that deterring voter fraud was a legitimate purpose, even without recorded incidents of fraud in the state. He referenced a Supreme Court decision recognizing the validity of such interests, despite lack of evidence. Additionally, he noted that the legislature took steps to address disparities in photo ID possession rates by including a reasonable impediment provision. Judge Kavanaugh upheld South Carolina's voter ID law, citing the addition of a reasonable impediment provision. He compared it to other state laws, noting it was less stringent than laws in Georgia and New Hampshire. The Texas voter ID law, which was denied preclearance, was deemed more stringent than South Carolina's. Judge Kavanaugh upheld South Carolina's voter ID law, stating it did not have discriminatory effects or purposes under Section 5. This decision aligns with recent legal challenges to voter laws, showing consistency in rulings across different courts. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit invalidated North Carolina's voter ID law under Section 2 and the Equal Protection Clause due to discriminatory intent. The state legislature in South Carolina selectively introduced provisions to eliminate voting mechanisms disproportionately used by African-American voters, targeting them with precision. In Wisconsin, a legal challenge to a voter ID law is ongoing, with the Seventh Circuit staying a preliminary injunction that would have allowed registered voters to cast a ballot without a photo ID. This litigation is based on the VRA and the Equal Protection Clause. Judge Kavanaugh's limited opinions in civil rights cases offer little insight into his judicial approach in this area. If confirmed, he could play a significant role in addressing civil rights issues, including affirmative action and statutory civil disputes. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could have a considerable impact on the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in criminal law and procedure, particularly in cases involving the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. Despite writing relatively little on this area of law, his voting record on the D.C. Circuit suggests he may influence the doctrine significantly. Judge Kavanaugh has written separate opinions on various areas of criminal law and procedure, including Fourth Amendment search and seizure, constitutional aspects of criminal sentencing, and substantive criminal law. His writings reveal strongly held views rather than a clear overarching philosophy. On Fourth Amendment issues, he has a limited view of constitutional protection against unreasonable searches. Judge Kavanaugh has a circumscribed view of constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, showing skepticism of advisory sentencing schemes and favoring mental state requirements in criminal law statutes. He generally takes a more restrictive view on Fourth Amendment issues compared to his D.C. Circuit colleagues. Judge Kavanaugh has a more restrictive view on Fourth Amendment issues compared to his D.C. Circuit colleagues. In Klayman v. Obama, he supported the NSA's metadata collection program under the USA Patriot Act, deeming it consistent with the Fourth Amendment due to national security needs. Judge Kavanaugh has authored separate opinions on Fourth Amendment issues, including dissenting in cases like National Federation of Federal Employees -IAM v. Vilsack, where he supported random drug testing on employees for national security reasons. He also wrote a dissent in another case regarding Terry stops. Judge Kavanaugh dissented from an en banc opinion, allowing police to manipulate or unzip a suspect's clothing during a Terry stop for identification. He criticized a panel decision in Wesby v. District of Columbia for affirming a false arrest judgment, arguing that damages liability should only apply if officers are \"plainly incompetent\" and knowingly violate the law. Judge Kavanaugh criticized a panel decision for not understanding the challenges police officers face when making arrest decisions. The Supreme Court later agreed with his conclusions that the arrests were lawful. In another case, he dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, supporting the FBI's use of a GPS device without a warrant to track a suspect's vehicle. Judge Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, supporting the FBI's warrantless use of a GPS device to track a suspect's vehicle. He argued that the installation of the device may have violated the Fourth Amendment due to constituting a physical invasion of a constitutionally protected space. Judge Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, supporting the FBI's warrantless use of a GPS device to track a suspect's vehicle. He argued that the installation of the device may have violated the Fourth Amendment by physically intruding upon the suspect's private property. This dissent in Jones suggests Kavanaugh favors a property-based approach to determining Fourth Amendment searches. In Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that cell phone users have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their location information held by third-party service providers, breaking new ground in Fourth Amendment protection. Dissenting Justices argued that lack of property rights in the information undermined Fourth Amendment interests. Carpenter v. United States established Fourth Amendment protection for cell phone users' location information held by third-party providers. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Jones may limit Carpenter's reach, but his views may have been influenced by past Supreme Court precedent. In a 2017 speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Judge Kavanaugh praised Chief Justice Rehnquist's jurisprudence, particularly his view on the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. Kavanaugh acknowledged the rule's entrenched status in American law but highlighted Rehnquist's efforts in creating exceptions to it, such as the good faith exception in United States v. Leon. Rehnquist also expanded the special needs doctrine, allowing searches without probable cause in certain circumstances. Judge Kavanaugh has supported special needs searches in Fourth Amendment opinions, including the NSA metadata collection program and U.S. Forest Service drug testing policy. He has also rejected challenges to certain law enforcement activities. In sentencing cases, he believes it is unfair to increase a defendant's sentencing guidelines based on acquitted conduct. However, he acknowledges that this practice does not violate the Fifth or Sixth Amendment under current Supreme Court precedent. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions suggest he interprets the Sixth Amendment to prohibit judicial determination of key sentencing facts, even under advisory sentencing guidelines. He disagrees with considering acquitted or uncharged conduct at sentencing and encourages judges to exercise discretion in this regard. This stance may differ from Justice Kennedy's views on sentencing issues. Judge Kavanaugh's views on sentencing differ from Justice Kennedy's, as he tends to defer to legislative judgments and rejects Sixth Amendment challenges. He has not addressed custodial interrogations but has praised limitations on Miranda warnings. In his interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, Kavanaugh takes a more expansive view. Judge Kavanaugh's views on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are more expansive. In United States v. Nwoye, he held that the failure to present expert testimony on Battered Woman Syndrome prejudiced the defendant's case. In criminal cases on due process, he typically sides with the government position. Judge Kavanaugh supports assigning the burden of proof to defendants when challenging the constitutionality of prior convictions for sentencing purposes. He criticized exceptions to this baseline under the Due Process Clause. In recent cases, he upheld the enforceability of appeal waivers in guilty plea agreements, emphasizing their role in efficiently resolving criminal cases. Justice Alito made a similar point. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of high levels of proof of mens rea in interpreting criminal statutes to prevent unjust criminal punishment. This is in contrast to Justice Alito's criticism of the majority's handling of guilty pleas and their consequences in criminal cases. In an en banc case, Judge Kavanaugh argued for applying the mens rea presumption to require proof of knowledge in a robbery case involving the use of an automatic weapon. This contrasts with Justice Alito's criticism of the majority's approach to guilty pleas in criminal cases. Judge Kavanaugh has emphasized the importance of accurate instructions on mens rea requirements in his opinions and publications. However, his judicial record does not provide much insight into his views on the Eighth Amendment, including issues like the death penalty and conditions of confinement. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial record lacks insight into his views on the Eighth Amendment, including the death penalty and conditions of confinement. In a 2017 speech, he praised Chief Justice Rehnquist for his stance on capital punishment cases, aligning with the Supreme Court's \"proper and limited role in the constitutional scheme.\" Confirmation hearing questioning may provide clarity on Judge Kavanaugh's Eighth Amendment views. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court comes at a crucial time for criminal procedure jurisprudence. Recent decisions like Carpenter v. United States have potential implications for Fourth Amendment protections. The Court is set to revisit the \"separate sovereign\" exception to the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause. Additionally, upcoming cases will address Eighth Amendment issues related to cruel and unusual punishments. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is crucial for criminal procedure jurisprudence, especially regarding Fourth Amendment protections. His views align with a minority of Justices on expanding Fourth Amendment protections. His record offers limited insight into other major criminal law issues. The Supreme Court has been closely divided on environmental law, with Justice Kennedy often the deciding vote. If elevated to the Court, Judge Kavanaugh could play a critical role in environmental law cases. Judge Kavanaugh's potential role on the Supreme Court is crucial for environmental law cases. His record on the D.C. Circuit shows involvement in various environmental issues, indicating a robust understanding of the subject. If confirmed, he could be a critical vote on matters such as climate change, air and water quality, nuclear energy, chemical bans, and endangered species. Judge Kavanaugh's potential role on the Supreme Court is crucial for environmental law cases. His record on the D.C. Circuit shows involvement in various environmental issues, indicating a robust understanding of the subject. If confirmed, he could be a critical vote on matters such as climate change, air and water quality, nuclear energy, chemical bans, and endangered species. Environmental law statutes and cases can prompt questions of administrative law, such as standing to sue and standards for judicial review. This section discusses Judge Kavanaugh's record on environmental justiciability issues and his views on substantive aspects of environmental law. The outcome of an environmental case often depends on procedural issues like establishing standing under Article III of the Constitution. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions on environmental law cases show a willingness to grant standing to regulated entities like business industry groups to challenge environmental regulations based on alleged economic harm. In a 2012 case, he dissented from a majority opinion that denied standing to petroleum and food industry associations to challenge EPA waivers. He argued that their claims of damages were not too conjectural. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in a 2012 case argued that food and petroleum industry petitioners had standing to challenge EPA waivers due to potential economic harm. He believed that increased demand for ethanol would raise corn prices for food products and cause economic costs for refining ethanol-based fuel. This aligns with his views in a 2015 case where he granted standing to ethanol producers challenging EPA regulations on test fuels for new vehicles. Judge Kavanaugh granted standing to ethanol producers challenging EPA regulations on test fuels for new vehicles, as the EPA's actions effectively prohibited the use of E30 fuel containing 30% ethanol. He concluded that the EPA's regulation caused harm by preventing the petitioners' ethanol product from being used as test fuel, thus supporting their standing to challenge the regulation. Removing the \"commercial available\" requirement would allow their products to compete in the marketplace. Judge Kavanaugh has seldom addressed the standing of public interest or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in environmental law. Some argue he sets a high bar for public interest groups to show harm from government actions for standing. However, it is unclear if this trend applies to environmental litigation. In Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, Judge Kavanaugh granted standing to an environmental NGO challenging the EPA's adoption of an affirmative defense limiting civil penalties for air pollutant emissions violations. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism towards federal agency actions that interpret environmental statutes to expand their authority, particularly in the context of climate change. He granted standing to an environmental NGO in a case involving civil penalties for air pollutant emissions violations. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism towards federal agency actions expanding their authority in addressing climate change. He argued that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in regulating GHGs under the Clean Air Act's PSD permitting program. In a dissenting opinion, he disagreed with the court's decision to uphold the EPA's \"tailoring\" rule to avoid subjecting smaller sources to the program due to their GHG emissions. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that the EPA's broad interpretation of \"any air pollutant\" to include GHGs was legally impermissible and would greatly expand its authority, setting a precedent for other agencies to adopt unreasonable interpretations of statutory provisions. He cautioned against undue deference to agencies, warning of systemic costs if courts allow agencies to exceed statutory limits. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA highlighted the threat of shifting power from the Legislative Branch to the Executive Branch due to agencies exceeding statutory limits. He emphasized the importance of the EPA acting within the bounds set by Congress or judicial precedent in addressing climate change. In a 2013 case, Judge Kavanaugh concurred that the EPA lacked authority to distinguish biogenic CO2 from other forms for Clean Air Act permitting programs, despite acknowledging the agency's policy reasons. He warned against agencies substituting their policy choices for Congress's, citing separation of powers principles. Judge Kavanaugh concurred with the majority in vacating the EPA's biogenic CO2 deferral rule, stating that the EPA must regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act permitting programs and had no authority to delay regulating biogenic CO2. He expressed concerns about the Clean Air Act not covering CO2, whether biogenic or not, which were validated by the Supreme Court in 2014. In Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, Justice Scalia's 5-4 opinion cited Judge Kavanaugh's dissent to rule that the Clean Air Act does not allow the EPA to mandate permits for stationary sources based solely on GHG emissions. Judge Kavanaugh has questioned the EPA's authority in addressing climate change, notably in the case challenging the Clean Power Plan. He argued that the EPA exceeded its authority by imposing rules that significantly impact industries, stating that addressing global warming does not give the President unlimited power to regulate GHG emissions. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed frustration with Congress in addressing climate change, emphasizing that Congress is best tasked to devise a balanced policy approach to regulate GHG emissions from power plants. The D.C. Circuit has not issued a decision in the CPP litigation as the court continues to hold the case in abeyance. In a 2012 case, Judge Kavanaugh wrote the majority decision challenging the EPA's rule on interstate transport of air pollution. Judge Kavanaugh's majority opinion concluded that the EPA's method to allocate emission reductions among upwind states that contribute to downwind air pollution had \"transgressed statutory boundaries.\" In a 2013 decision, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that Congress delegated authority to the EPA to determine how to allocate emission reduction requirements among neighboring upwind states. In environmental cases, Judge Kavanaugh often found agency interpretations lacking support from the statute's plain language, avoiding the need to defer to Chevron doctrine. He emphasized that courts must ensure agencies comply with the plain statutory text, as seen in his dissent in Sierra Club v. EPA. In his 2017 majority opinion in Mexichem Fluor, Inc. v. EPA, Judge Kavanaugh vacated a rule that would have prohibited manufacturers from using hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances. He argued that the EPA's interpretation of the Clean Air Act was inconsistent with the statutory text and exceeded its authority. Kavanaugh reiterated that Congress's failure to enact climate change legislation does not authorize the EPA to regulate non-ODSs under the Act. Judge Kavanaugh has consistently argued that congressional inaction on climate change does not give the EPA the authority to regulate non-ozone-depleting substances under the Clean Air Act. He has criticized the EPA's interpretation of the statute as unreasonable and exceeding its authority, particularly in cases where cost considerations were excluded from regulatory decisions. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the EPA for excluding cost considerations in regulating electric utilities under the Clean Air Act, arguing that it was unreasonable and exceeded the agency's authority. The Supreme Court later reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision in Michigan v. EPA in a 5-4 opinion authored by Justice Scalia. In a 5-4 opinion authored by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's majority decision in Michigan v. EPA. The Court held that the EPA's refusal to consider costs before regulating was unreasonable. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Mingo Logan Coal Co. v. EPA also criticized the agency for not accounting for costs in revoking waste discharge sites for mining operations. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the EPA for not considering costs in its actions, arguing that the terms \"acceptable\" and \"unacceptable\" require a balancing of costs and benefits. He emphasized the importance of evaluating costs to humans, such as coal miners and local businesses, before revoking permits. This aligns with his previous dissent in White Stallion Energy Center, where he stated that the EPA must consider costs before exercising its Clean Water Act authority. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism regarding judges deferring to agencies' interpretations of environmental regulations. In a dissent in Howmet Corp. v. EPA, he disagreed with the EPA's interpretation of its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations, arguing it was inconsistent with the text of the regulations. He emphasized the importance of considering costs before revoking permits under the Clean Water Act. Judge Kavanaugh has been critical of agencies' interpretations of environmental regulations, particularly in cases like Howmet Corp. v. EPA where he disagreed with the EPA's expansion of regulatory authority. He tends to narrowly construe agency authority to preserve separation of powers, but has also upheld agency actions when granted discretion by Congress. This approach may limit agencies' ability to regulate activities impacting the environment. Judge Kavanaugh's formalist approach and commitment to textualism have led him to limit agency authority in environmental regulations. There is debate over his stance on environmental law, with concerns raised about his skepticism towards agencies broadening their authority under existing statutes to address new environmental issues like climate change. Judge Kavanaugh's skepticism towards administrative agencies like the EPA has sparked debate. Some view his stance as a way to curb federal overreach and ensure all branches of government act within their constitutional roles. However, predicting the impact of his nomination on environmental law is limited, as he has not addressed certain environmental issues during his time on the D.C. Circuit. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could potentially hear important environmental cases. The Supreme Court could soon consider an Endangered Species Act case involving private land designation as critical habitat. Judge Kavanaugh has previously addressed a similar case regarding the designation of private lands as critical habitat for endangered species. Judge Kavanaugh previously addressed a case involving the ESA and critical habitat designation for endangered species, questioning the evidence of \"occupied\" habitat for fairy shrimp. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Weyerhaeuser case may provide guidance on FWS's authority to designate critical habitat not actually occupied by listed species. The Supreme Court's federalism revolution, led by Justice Kennedy, began with the Rehnquist Court restricting Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause, reviving the Tenth Amendment, and expanding state sovereign immunity. The Roberts Court continued this trend, with the 2012 NFIB v. Sebelius decision challenging the ACA. The 2012 NFIB v. Sebelius case challenged the ACA's individual mandate as exceeding Congress's Commerce Clause authority. The Court also extended Tenth Amendment cases to strike down a provision allowing the Secretary of HHS to withhold Medicaid payments from non-participating states. The Supreme Court invalidated a condition attached to federal spending as unconstitutionally coercive, impacting Medicaid payments to states. Justice Kennedy played a key role in this \"federalism revolution,\" and his successor will shape the Court's federalism jurisprudence. Judge Kavanaugh's record on federalism issues is limited, with no significant opinions on the Tenth Amendment or state sovereign immunity. In Seven-Sky v. Holder, a Commerce Clause challenge to the ACA, Judge Kavanaugh declined to consider the case's merits. Judge Kavanaugh declined to consider the merits of the case in Seven-Sky v. Holder, a Commerce Clause challenge to the ACA, due to lack of jurisdiction. He disagreed with the majority's decision upholding the mandate, citing the Anti-Injunction Act as the reason for lack of jurisdiction. Judge Kavanaugh concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act deprived the court of jurisdiction over a pre-enforcement lawsuit challenging the penalty for non-compliance with the individual mandate in the ACA, as it was to be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes. He did not take a stance on the constitutionality of the mandate under the Commerce Clause, deeming it a complex and contentious issue. Judge Kavanaugh, in his dissent, highlighted the complexity and significant implications of the constitutional questions surrounding the Commerce Clause in the case. He argued for caution in making a decision, pointing out that the government's defense of the mandate could have far-reaching implications for Congress's powers, potentially allowing for mandates on various financial products beyond health insurance. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of safeguarding the constitutional structure and individual liberty while also urging caution in prematurely rejecting the government's defense of the mandate. He noted that striking down a federal law based on Commerce Clause authority is a rare and significant act for a federal court. Additionally, he highlighted the shift in how the Federal Government provides social safety net benefits, specifically through privatized social services. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of safeguarding the constitutional structure and individual liberty while cautioning against interfering with the elected Branches' determination to update how the National Government provides social safety net benefits. He suggested that courts should not prematurely decide on difficult constitutional questions regarding the individual mandate under the ACA, as Congress may still alter the language or eliminate the penalty. In a 2017 speech, Judge Kavanaugh expressed agreement with Chief Justice Rehnquist's Commerce Clause decisions, which he viewed as crucial in limiting Congress's power. While there is limited information on his views on federalism issues like state sovereign immunity and the Tenth Amendment, he has shown support for the federalism revolution led by the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts. Judge Kavanaugh, a key figure in the \"federalism revolution\" of the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts, supports the judiciary's role in policing federal authority boundaries. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, he could influence decisions on religious freedom, including the Constitution's Religion Clauses and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Despite few opinions on religious liberty while on the D.C. Circuit, his writings and comments indicate his views on the matter. Judge Kavanaugh's views on religious liberty are similar to Justice Kennedy's. His writings focus on the Establishment Clause and the concept of standing in Establishment Clause cases. The Supreme Court sometimes treats standing differently in these cases, allowing certain suits to proceed even if the alleged injury would not create standing in other legal contexts. The Court has continued to hear Establishment Clause challenges despite arguments that plaintiffs' injuries may not qualify as constitutionally sufficient for standing. Judge Kavanaugh has authored opinions on standing in Establishment Clause claims. Judge Kavanaugh rejected an Establishment Clause claim on standing grounds in In re Navy Chaplaincy, where Protestant Navy chaplains argued discrimination in the retirement system favoring Catholic chaplains. He held that the plaintiffs lacked standing as they did not suffer employment discrimination based on religion, dismissing the claim of being subjected to a religious message as insufficient for standing. In the case of Newdow v. Roberts, Judge Kavanaugh found that litigants had standing to challenge aspects of the presidential inaugural ceremony that violated the Establishment Clause, such as prayers and the phrase \"so help me God\" in the oath of office. Judge Kavanaugh concurred with the court's rejection of the suit on standing grounds, stating that the plaintiffs had standing but their claims failed on the merits. He argued that the plaintiffs' allegations of witnessing government-sponsored religious expression they objected to demonstrated a concrete injury. Kavanaugh disagreed with the majority's analysis of the causation and redressability elements of standing in cases involving government-sponsored religious displays or speeches. Judge Kavanaugh concurred with the court's rejection of the suit on standing grounds, stating that the plaintiffs had standing but their claims failed on the merits. He cited Lee v. Weisman to argue that it was likely the next Inaugural ceremony would resemble past ones, similar to how a high school graduation prayer would likely resemble past prayers. Judge Kavanaugh concluded that the plaintiffs had standing in Newdow and considered the merits of their claim regarding inaugural prayers and the use of \"so help me God\" in the presidential oath. He believed that these traditions did not violate the Establishment Clause, citing their deep roots in history and tradition. Judge Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of history and tradition in upholding prayers before government meetings, citing Supreme Court precedents. He believed that while public prayers should not promote a specific faith, sectarian prayers could still be permissible. Judge Kavanaugh cited a Tenth Circuit standard on inaugural prayers, stating that non-sectarian references to God are permissible. His opinion in Newdow was set against a backdrop of legal debate on the Establishment Clause, which is often seen as creating a separation between church and State. The Supreme Court's view on the Establishment Clause is debated, with some cases approving government-sponsored religious practices. Justice Kennedy cautioned against a formalistic interpretation of government neutrality towards religion. Judge Kavanaugh also questioned the \"wall\" metaphor and the idea of state neutrality towards religious groups. Judge Kavanaugh, like Chief Justice Rehnquist, criticized the \"wall\" metaphor and supported a view that the First Amendment does not demand strict neutrality between religion and irreligion. He opposed a strict separationist view of the Establishment Clause and wrote a significant dissenting opinion on RFRA in Priests for Life v. HHS. Judge Kavanaugh, in a significant dissenting opinion on RFRA in Priests for Life v. HHS, criticized the ACA's requirement for closely held corporations to provide health insurance covering certain contraceptive methods, stating it violated RFRA. The Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores also highlighted RFRA's role in controversies surrounding the ACA. The Court found that the contraceptive mandate imposed a substantial burden on the beliefs of corporations like Hobby Lobby and Priests for Life, as it required them to provide contraceptives against their religious beliefs. The government failed to show that the mandate was the least restrictive means of achieving its compelling interest, as required by RFRA. Hobby Lobby's case set a precedent for religious nonprofit organizations like Priests for Life to challenge the ACA's contraceptive requirement. Religious nonprofit organizations could opt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement by submitting certain documents to insurers. Insurers would then offer separate coverage for contraceptive services directly to insured women. A three-judge panel rejected the plaintiffs' RFRA claim, stating that the opt-out requirements did not substantially burden their religious exercise. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, believing the plaintiffs should prevail on their RFRA claim. Kavanaugh believed the plaintiffs should prevail on their RFRA claim, acknowledging a substantial burden on their religious beliefs due to the opt-out procedure. He referenced the Hobby Lobby case, emphasizing that judges in RFRA cases can only question the sincerity of a plaintiff's religious belief, not its correctness or reasonableness. Judge Kavanaugh concluded that the government has a compelling interest in providing access to contraception for employees of religious organizations, citing the significant social and economic costs of unintended pregnancies. He found that the opt-out requirements violated RFRA as they were not the least restrictive means to further this interest. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Priests for Life mirrored Justice Kennedy's approach in Hobby Lobby. The Supreme Court granted review in the case but ultimately vacated the opinion without reaching the merits of the claim. The Court requested supplemental briefing on whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to employees without notice from the organizations. The Supreme Court remanded combined cases to lower courts to find a solution accommodating both parties. Speculation arose due to the Court's difficulty in reaching a decision, indicating a close division on religious liberty issues. A new Justice could have influence on future cases. First Amendment cases, especially regarding freedom of speech, have been prominent on the Roberts Court. In recent years, the Roberts Court has shown skepticism towards laws restricting political or commercial speech, compelling speech, or regulating speech based on content. Justice Kennedy played a key role in cases like Citizens United v. FEC, invalidating a ban on corporate political expenditures. He also supported invalidating public-sector union fees and state disclosure requirements for pregnancy centers. Judge Kavanaugh has similar views on the First Amendment but recognizes limitations, especially regarding government employee speech. Judge Kavanaugh has a strong record on free speech, with opinions on various First Amendment issues. He has tackled cases involving campaign finance, media regulation, and commercial speech. His approach shows a recognition of limitations, especially in the context of government employee speech. Judge Kavanaugh has applied key Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance in cases involving political spending, recognizing limits on the First Amendment's reach. He believes political spending is a form of speech deserving strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. Judge Kavanaugh believes that limits on political speech should be subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. In a 2016 event, he emphasized the importance of raising money for effective communication. In a 2009 case, Emily's List v. FEC, he authored an opinion challenging FEC regulations on political spending by nonprofit groups. Judge Kavanaugh authored the panel opinion in a case involving campaign finance laws, emphasizing key principles from Supreme Court's First Amendment cases. These principles include campaign contributions as speech, government's interest in combating corruption, and greater regulation of contributions compared to expenditures on electioneering activities. Judge Kavanaugh analyzed the applicability of First Amendment principles to EMILY's List, concluding that limits on a nonprofit's expenditures are unconstitutional. He distinguished the Supreme Court's decision in McConnell v. FEC, allowing nonprofits to make expenditures from a general treasury account without limits. Judge Kavanaugh upheld restrictions on campaign spending, rejecting challenges to limits on contributions by political parties and nonprofits. He suggested that Congress could address any perceived asymmetry by adjusting contribution limits. In a separate case, he also rejected a challenge to a statutory ban on \"soft money\" contributions by the Republican National Committee. Judge Kavanaugh upheld restrictions on campaign spending, rejecting challenges to limits on contributions by political parties and nonprofits. In a separate case, he also rejected a challenge to a statutory ban on \"soft money\" contributions by the Republican National Committee. In another case, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a First Amendment challenge to a statute barring political contributions by foreign nationals temporarily living in the United States, citing the U.S. government's compelling interest in limiting foreign citizens' participation in elections. Judge Kavanaugh upheld restrictions on campaign spending, rejecting challenges to limits on contributions by political parties and nonprofits, as well as a ban on \"soft money\" contributions by the Republican National Committee. He also rejected a First Amendment challenge to a statute barring political contributions by foreign nationals temporarily living in the United States, citing the U.S. government's interest in limiting foreign citizens' participation in elections. However, he noted that the court's decision only applied to political contributions and certain expenditures by foreign nationals, not their right to engage in issue advocacy and speaking out on public policy issues. Judge Kavanaugh's support for political spending as a form of political speech suggests he may not be inclined to expand government regulation on political contributions and expenditures. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed concerns about government regulation in campaign finance, particularly the treatment of different speakers. He believes Congress or the Supreme Court should address leveling the playing field for speakers. While considering historical context in First Amendment cases, he looks at recent developments in evaluating the constitutionality of telecommunications and Internet regulations, focusing on a speaker's \"market power\" as seen in Supreme Court decisions authored by Justice Kennedy. In Turner Broadcasting I, the Court examined the constitutionality of \"must-carry provisions\" in a 1992 law that required cable television systems to allocate channels for local broadcast stations. Justice Kennedy argued that these provisions restricted speech by limiting the number of channels available for cable programmers, justifying them based on the unique characteristics of the cable medium. The Court examined the constitutionality of \"must-carry provisions\" in a 1992 law that required cable television systems to allocate channels for local broadcast stations. Justice Kennedy argued that these provisions restricted speech by limiting the number of channels available for cable programmers, justifying them based on the unique characteristics of the cable medium. The case was remanded for further fact-finding to determine if the provisions burdened more speech than necessary. In Turner Broadcasting II, the Court concluded that the must-carry provisions did not violate the First Amendment. Thirteen years later, the applicability of the Turner Broadcasting cases was considered in Cablevision Systems Corp. v. FCC. In Cablevision Systems Corp. v. FCC, two cable companies challenged an FCC decision to extend an exclusivity provision. Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that the market had changed since previous cases, and restrictions on cable operators' speech rights were no longer justified. Judge Kavanaugh argued that the market had changed significantly since the mid-1990s cases, with cable operators no longer having monopoly power. He pointed out the wide range of video programming options available to consumers, including through cell phone companies and the Internet. Judge Kavanaugh concluded that the FCC's exclusivity ban was no longer necessary to promote competition and did not meet the Supreme Court's standard for content-neutral restrictions on speech rights. Judge Kavanaugh discussed the changing market in telecommunications, stating that Congress and regulatory agencies have more leeway in adjusting to market realities in ordinary economic regulation cases. He argued for a more laissez-faire regulatory regime in communication markets, suggesting that the First Amendment may permit content-neutral regulation in noncompetitive markets but not in competitive ones. Judge Kavanaugh argued that in competitive markets, direct interference with First Amendment free speech rights is typically unnecessary and constitutionally inappropriate. He cited the FCC's \"Viewability Rule\" as an example, where the FCC replaced it due to constitutional concerns. Kavanaugh emphasized the need to evaluate the constitutionality of regulations in the context of a changing marketplace. Judge Kavanaugh believes that cable regulations from the past are not suitable for today's marketplace, where cable operators no longer have market power. He argues that the government should not dictate which video programming networks cable operators must carry. This view is also reflected in his dissent on the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rule, where he emphasized the importance of market power in regulatory decisions. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the net neutrality rule for imposing common-carrier obligations on ISPs, restricting their editorial control over content. He argued that without demonstrating market power, such regulations violate the First Amendment. Kavanaugh compared ISPs to cable television operators, stating they perform similar functions in transmitting content. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions suggest that he believes the First Amendment should apply with the same rigor to restrictions on Internet speakers and content providers as to other purveyors of speech in the communications industry. If confirmed, he could be a key voice on the Supreme Court in refining First Amendment law in the Internet age. Technological advancements and increased competition may reduce the need for government regulation in the communications market. Judge Kavanaugh has argued that the outcome of a case may depend on the First Amendment test applied by the court. Debates often arise regarding the appropriate test for commercial speech regulations, as seen in the Central Hudson case. The Court's test for evaluating commercial speech regulations has evolved since Central Hudson, with some questioning the need for different treatment of commercial and political speech. The scope of doctrines for commercial disclosure requirements is also debated, with some likening it to rational basis review. Judge Kavanaugh has offered a way to reconcile the current tests for commercial speech. In American Meat Institute, the court considered the constitutionality of a federal regulation requiring country-of-origin information for meat products. Two First Amendment standards were evaluated: the \"general test for commercial speech restrictions\" from Central Hudson and the Zauderer standard for government-mandated disclosures to prevent consumer deception. The en banc court in American Meat Institute upheld the country-of-origin labeling requirements as constitutional under the Zauderer standard, stating that the disclosure is reasonably related to preventing consumer deception. Judge Kavanaugh agreed with the majority but explained how the Central Hudson requirements apply, noting that the government's interest in preventing deception and ensuring consumer health justifies commercial disclosures. Judge Kavanaugh found that country-of-origin labeling is justified by the government's interest in supporting American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers in competition with foreign counterparts. He concluded that the labeling requirement satisfies the Central Hudson standard regarding the fit between the disclosure and the government's interest. Judge Kavanaugh interprets Zauderer as an application of the Central Hudson test for compelled commercial disclosures. He emphasizes that disclosures must be factual, uncontroversial, not burdensome, and related to the government's interest. He suggests that cases like Zauderer may justify compelled disclosure for reasons other than preventing consumer deception, which is an open question for the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh interprets Zauderer as an application of the Central Hudson test for compelled commercial disclosures. He emphasizes that disclosures must be factual, uncontroversial, not burdensome, and related to the government's interest. He suggests that cases like Zauderer may justify compelled disclosure for reasons other than preventing consumer deception, which is an open question for the Supreme Court. However, Judge Kavanaugh's interpretation raises concerns about the level of scrutiny applied to compelled disclosures and the historical basis required for such mandates. Judge Kavanaugh's alignment with a more rigorous form of review for commercial speech and compelled speech is evident in his interpretation of Zauderer as an application of the Central Hudson test. He upholds government actions in cases involving national security, government speech, or regulations directed at conduct. In al Bahlul v. United States, he supported the government's prosecution of an assistant to Osama bin Laden for his political speech, including producing propaganda videos for al Qaeda. In al Bahlul v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh supported the government's prosecution of an assistant to Osama bin Laden for producing propaganda videos for al Qaeda, arguing that the appellant had no First Amendment rights as a non-U.S. citizen in Afghanistan. He also stated that the videos aimed at inciting imminent lawless action were not protected speech under relevant Supreme Court precedent. Judge Kavanaugh supported the government's prosecution of an assistant to Osama bin Laden for producing propaganda videos for al Qaeda, arguing that the appellant had no First Amendment rights as a non-U.S. citizen in Afghanistan. In Bryant v. Gates, a former civilian employee challenged the military's denial of his requests to publish advertisements in Department of Defense newspapers on First Amendment grounds. The court upheld the military's restriction on political advertising as reasonable. Judge Kavanaugh supported the government's prosecution of an assistant to Osama bin Laden for producing propaganda videos for al Qaeda, arguing that the appellant had no First Amendment rights as a non-U.S. citizen in Afghanistan. In a separate concurrence, Judge Kavanaugh applied the \"government speech\" doctrine to speech restrictions concerning DOD newspapers, allowing the military to exercise viewpoint-based editorial control. He also proposed an alternative analytical approach in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a D.C. law prohibiting defacement of public and private property. Judge Kavanaugh concurred with the majority's decision on a First Amendment issue regarding sidewalk chalk messages in front of the White House, stating that defacing government property is not protected speech. He has shown a recognition of political spending as protected speech and has questioned speaker-based distinctions in election law jurisprudence. Judge Kavanaugh has applied First Amendment principles to new media forms and viewed regulations of the communications industry as suspect under the First Amendment. He has taken a middle ground on commercial disclosure tests and recognized limitations on the First Amendment's reach. Judge Kavanaugh has authored opinions related to national security due to the unique docket at the D.C. Circuit. Judge Kavanaugh frequently argues for courts to defer to political branches on national security, citing lack of judicial competency. He believes in limits to deference when statutes or the Constitution require a judicial role. Unlike Justice Kennedy, he is less likely to consider international law in his interpretations. Judge Kavanaugh's non-judicial writings focus on analyzing the constitutional limits on the Executive's power to declare war without congressional authorization, a topic not extensively addressed by the Supreme Court. Both Justice Kennedy and Judge Kavanaugh show deference to the political branches in national security cases, with concerns about implied constitutional causes of action. Judge Kavanaugh has shown deference to political branches in national security cases, emphasizing that Congress, not the judiciary, decides on causes of action against U.S. officials for alleged torts committed abroad in connection with anti-terrorism operations. In a case concerning military commissions' jurisdiction, Judge Kavanaugh argued against dissenting judges who questioned the government's military exigency reasoning. He believes courts should not interfere with executive branch decisions in national security matters, such as security clearances and foreign detainee transfers. Additionally, he has shown deference to Congress in national security cases involving alleged torts committed abroad. Judge Kavanaugh has shown deference to national security concerns in cases involving government action, such as dismissing a suit due to potential adverse effects on U.S. foreign relations. He also supported the intelligence community's bulk collection of telephony metadata to prevent terrorist attacks, prioritizing national security over privacy concerns. He advised those with concerns about the program to focus on Congress and the Executive. Judge Kavanaugh believes federal courts should play a role in national security cases where the Executive oversteps statutory or constitutional restrictions. He emphasizes that courts should not create new rules but should ensure the Executive follows existing laws and principles, especially in cases involving detainees, torture victims, or surveillance. Judge Kavanaugh supports strict enforcement of constitutional principles in national security cases, such as challenging military detention of American citizens. In El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. v. United States, he disagreed with dismissing claims against the U.S. over a bombing, showing his views on the judicial branch's role in such cases. Judge Kavanaugh challenges the court's reliance on the political question doctrine in national security cases, arguing that federal courts should not decline to resolve a case solely based on national security concerns. He believes courts have a role in addressing the substance of claims related to military authority. Kavanaugh's national security jurisprudence contrasts with Justice Kennedy's views on Guantanamo detainees. Kavanaugh ruled against detainees in cases involving evidentiary rules for habeas cases, often finding sufficient evidence for military detention. He believes the standard of proof for military detention can be less rigorous than in criminal prosecutions. In contrast to Justice Kennedy, Judge Kavanaugh believes the standard of proof for military detention can be less rigorous than in criminal prosecutions. Kavanaugh's national security jurisprudence diverges from Kennedy's views on Guantanamo detainees, particularly on the extent to which international law may inform judicial decisionmaking. Kennedy has previously considered international law in cases involving military commissions and the interpretation of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Judge Kavanaugh has been critical of arguments that international legal principles should influence judicial analysis in the absence of a clear statutory reference. He expressed the view that the 2001 AUMF did not incorporate judicially enforceable international law limits on the President's wartime authority. Kavanaugh argued that constitutional principles and 20th-century judicial developments make construing federal statutes to avoid conflicts with international law inappropriate in some cases. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed criticism towards the influence of international legal principles on judicial analysis without a clear statutory reference. He believes that federal courts should not enforce international law limits on the President's wartime authority without explicit incorporation in governing statutes or regulations. However, Judge Kavanaugh has acknowledged the importance of international law and has interpreted and enforced it when expressly incorporated into U.S. domestic law. Judge Kavanaugh has explored legal protections for medical personnel on the battlefield and analyzed international law in relation to criminal offenses. He has also delved into the constitutional question of the president's power to declare war without congressional authorization, emphasizing the shared war-making power between the legislative and executive branches. Judge Kavanaugh believes that the legislative branch has broad authority to control the United States' war efforts and regulate aspects of military operations. He notes that the President's war powers are unclear in terms of exclusivity and regulation by Congress. Kavanaugh suggests that a statute regulating the President's \"short-term bombing of foreign targets in the Nation's self-defense\" may not be constitutional. Judge Kavanaugh believes that constitutional questions on war and national security will face heated debate, with all branches of government involved. The Roberts Court, divided on Second Amendment interpretations, saw Justice Kennedy as a key vote. His replacement will shape future Second Amendment jurisprudence. Kennedy's pivotal votes in landmark Second Amendment cases, such as District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago, are significant. In McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has not provided clear guidance on the full scope of the Second Amendment right, leading lower courts to determine the appropriate standard of review for firearm restrictions. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Heller II offered a different interpretation of Heller I, contributing to the ongoing debate on Second Amendment jurisprudence. In Heller II, the D.C. Circuit evaluated the Firearms Registration Amendment Act's provisions regarding firearm registration, semi-automatic rifles, and large-capacity magazines in relation to the Second Amendment. The court largely upheld these provisions in a 2-1 ruling, following a two-step framework used by federal circuit courts post- Heller I. The D.C. Circuit upheld the challenged requirements of the Firearms Registration Amendment Act, including the registration of guns with the government. The ban on semi-automatic rifles and large-capacity magazines was deemed lawful under intermediate scrutiny for protecting police officers. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the D.C. Circuit's decision to uphold the Firearms Registration Amendment Act, arguing that it was unconstitutional under Heller I as it was an outlier in gun regulation and went beyond traditional laws. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the D.C. Circuit's decision to uphold the Firearms Registration Amendment Act, stating that it was unconstitutional under Heller I. He argued that the FRA provisions are outliers in gun regulation and should be evaluated based on the Second Amendment's text, history, and tradition. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with the D.C. Circuit's decision to uphold the Firearms Registration Amendment Act, stating that it was unconstitutional under Heller I. He argued that the FRA provisions should be evaluated based on the Second Amendment's text, history, and tradition, rejecting judicial interest balancing. In his Heller II dissent, he would have invalidated two of the three challenged FRA provisions, including the gun registration law. Judge Kavanaugh argued against the constitutionality of the Firearms Registration Amendment Act, stating that gun registration requirements were not traditionally required in the US. He also supported the legality of semi-automatic rifles and questioned the ban on large-capacity magazines. His views on the Second Amendment could influence future Supreme Court decisions. Judge Kavanaugh's views on the Second Amendment could impact the evaluation of firearm legislation at all levels of government. His proposed history and tradition test may lead to challenges to existing firearms laws, although outcomes could still align with previous approaches. His approach may offer more flexibility to government bodies compared to the strict scrutiny test. Judge Kavanaugh's proposed history and tradition test for Second Amendment analysis offers more flexibility than the strict scrutiny test. This could potentially lead to changes in the Court's docket regarding Second Amendment cases. The Supreme Court has reviewed Second Amendment challenges in McDonald v. City of Chicago and Caetano v. Massachusetts. In Caetano, the Court vacated a decision upholding a state law prohibiting stun guns, citing conflict with Heller I. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch have dissented from denial of certiorari in Second Amendment cases, but the Court has not granted certiorari in any such matter since Caetano. Judge Kavanaugh, if confirmed, could play a crucial role in deciding whether the Supreme Court takes on another Second Amendment case. Separation of powers is a key aspect of his jurisprudence, viewing it as fundamental in every case. This doctrine was also important to Justice Kennedy, whom Judge Kavanaugh may succeed. Judge Kavanaugh, like Justice Kennedy, views the separation of powers as essential in protecting the public from governmental abuse. He takes a formalist approach, emphasizing the text and history of the Constitution in shaping the federal government's design. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of the separation of powers in enforcing the Framers' structural choices, viewing it as essential in various legal controversies. This approach shapes his views on topics such as the judiciary's role in checking violations. Judge Kavanaugh's distinct doctrinal approach to implementing and enforcing the Constitution's balance of power between Congress, the courts, and the President is evident in his views on separation of powers. While some commentators suggest a predisposition towards a strong Executive, it does not appear that a desire for a powerful Executive solely drives his views. Judge Kavanaugh's views on separation of powers are influenced by his experiences as an executive branch lawyer. While he has written in favor of executive power in some cases, he has also expressed positions that favor Congress. His approach to separation of powers cases focuses on the constitutional text. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to separation of powers cases is influenced by his history-focused approach, where he looks to the constitutional text and historical practice for guidance. He views laws and actions without historical analogues as suspect and is guided by the principles of liberty, accountability, and governmental effectiveness in his analyses. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to separation of powers is rooted in protecting individual rights by enforcing the structural provisions of the Constitution. He believes that an accumulation of power in any branch could lead to government abuse and threaten individual freedoms. His focus is on preventing government oppression and unfair legislation that restricts individual actions. Judge Kavanaugh's focus on separation of powers aims to prevent government abuse and protect individual liberties. He believes accountability is essential for maintaining individual freedom and opposes government imposition on private entities. Kavanaugh believes in the President's ability to supervise officials exercising executive power, viewing laws that limit this as a threat to accountability and separation of powers. He criticizes single-Director independent agencies like the CFPB for lacking accountability. His focus on separation of powers aims to maintain effective government rather than solely prioritizing liberty and accountability. Judge Kavanaugh believes in a unitary head of the Executive to enhance efficiency in government administration. He views the legislative branch as effective but not necessarily efficient, designed to protect individual liberty. Kavanaugh supports legal immunity for government officials to maintain effectiveness by limiting distractions of litigation. He advocates for a robust role for judges in enforcing the separation of powers. Judge Kavanaugh believes judges should actively interpret statutory delegations of authority to federal agencies, enforcing the separation of powers. He opposes deferring to Congress or the President on constitutional matters, stating it would be abdicating the judiciary's responsibility. This view is reflected in his opinion in El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries v. United States. Judge Kavanaugh opposes applying the political question doctrine to avoid judicial review for statutory violations, emphasizing the need for direct analysis of separation-of-powers issues instead of favoring the Executive branch over the Legislative Branch. Judge Kavanaugh's dissent in Sissel v. HHS highlights his opposition to using the political question doctrine to avoid judicial review for statutory violations, emphasizing the importance of direct analysis of separation-of-powers issues. He argued that the backdoor use of this doctrine could expand executive power in an unprincipled manner. Judge Kavanaugh disagreed with a panel's ruling on the ACA's Origination Clause, arguing that the law did originate in the House as a revenue-raising bill. He criticized the panel's purpose-focused approach and emphasized the importance of a traditional separation-of-powers analysis. Judge Kavanaugh criticized a panel decision on the ACA's Origination Clause, arguing that the Framers intended to protect against excessive federal taxation by giving the House exclusive power to originate tax bills. He warned that the panel's reasoning could create a loophole in the Origination Clause, undermining the judiciary's role in upholding it. Judge Kavanaugh played a critical role in preserving the constitutional structure, arguing against courts outsourcing this responsibility to political branches. In a 2013 ruling, he addressed the executive branch's obligation under the Take Care Clause to enforce federal law, shedding light on his views on executive power. Judge Kavanaugh's position in the legal debate over the President's Article II powers provides some flexibility in executing federal statutes. In re Aiken County case involved the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's obligation to review a license application despite inadequate funds, with Judge Kavanaugh ruling that the NRC must comply with the law and use available funds for the task. Judge Kavanaugh addressed the President's authority to disregard a statutory provision deemed unconstitutional, despite the NRC's violation of its obligation to comply with the law. The discussion of constitutional principles was considered unnecessary by a concurring judge. Judge Kavanaugh's opinion concluded that the President has the authority to unilaterally declare a statute unconstitutional and not follow it until a final court order dictates otherwise. This view favors the President's determinations over the constitutionality of a law over those of Congress. Judge Kavanaugh's opinion supports the President's authority to declare a statute unconstitutional and not enforce it until a court ruling contradicts this. This view prioritizes the President's determinations over Congress regarding the constitutionality of laws. Additionally, Judge Kavanaugh discussed prosecutorial discretion, allowing the executive branch flexibility in enforcing federal laws. Judge Kavanaugh's opinion emphasizes the President's broad discretion in enforcing federal laws, citing the power to pardon and constitutional concerns. He believes in the President's ability to under-enforce statutes to protect individual liberty but acknowledges that prosecutorial discretion has limits. Judge Kavanaugh believes in the President's broad discretion in enforcing federal laws, citing the power to pardon and constitutional concerns. He acknowledges that prosecutorial discretion has limits, stating that laws imposing mandates on the Executive Branch must generally be followed unless there is a constitutional objection. His views on prosecutorial discretion have evolved over time, as seen in his 2013 Aiken County opinion and a 2016 article in the Marquette Lawyer. In 2015, he questioned the logic of forcing the executive to prosecute someone only to then pardon them. Judge Kavanaugh's views on the scope of the President's power of prosecutorial discretion have evolved over time, with recent experiences showing that it is not fully settled. He previously believed in a broad presidential discretion matching the power to pardon, but now expresses uncertainty on the issue. This suggests that his views on maintaining an effective government may not be fully settled. Judge Kavanaugh's views on maintaining an effective government, particularly regarding civil and criminal litigation for Members of Congress and the President, are influenced by his belief in the importance of the Speech or Debate Clause for congressional immunity. While Congress's immunity is well-established, presidential immunity is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution. This distinction is crucial for the separation of powers and ensuring freedom of speech and debate for Members of Congress. The DOJ Office of Legal Counsel has concluded that indicting or prosecuting a sitting President would interfere with their constitutional duties. The Supreme Court has ruled on immunity from civil claims but not on criminal investigations of a sitting President. Judge Kavanaugh supports a broader view of legislative immunity. Judge Kavanaugh supports a broader view of legislative immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, expressing concerns about existing D.C. Circuit precedent that he believes weakens protections for Members by distinguishing between official and personal conduct in congressional ethics committee testimony. Judge Kavanaugh supports a broad view of legislative immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, emphasizing protection for any speech by a Member in an official congressional proceeding. He believes the Clause shields legislative independence from both the executive branch and the courts, as seen in his dissent in Howard v. Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives. Judge Kavanaugh supports broad legislative immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, protecting congressional independence from the executive branch and courts. He disagrees with the majority's view in Howard v. Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, arguing that requiring evidence of legislative activities would violate the Clause. Kavanaugh's academic writings suggest he believes a sitting President should have immunity from criminal prosecution, based on his experiences investigating and advising Presidents. In a 2009 article, he proposed legislative changes for a more efficient government. Judge Kavanaugh proposed deferring civil suits, criminal prosecutions, and investigations involving a sitting President to maintain governmental effectiveness and credibility. He argued that indicting and trying a sitting President would cripple the federal government, causing unwanted burdens and distractions. The article does not address the legal protections for the President under the Constitution directly. Judge Kavanaugh's 1998 article in the Georgetown Law Journal discussed the question of presidential immunity in the context of an independent counsel investigation. He opined that there is a serious constitutional question about whether a sitting President can be criminally indicted and tried while in office. Judge Kavanaugh's 1998 article in the Georgetown Law Journal suggests that indicting a sitting President may be constitutionally impermissible, advocating for investigation, impeachment, and removal by Congress before prosecution. He argues that the Framers intended for congressional investigation to precede criminal prosecution of a President. Judge Kavanaugh's 1998 article suggests that indicting a sitting President may be constitutionally impermissible, advocating for investigation, impeachment, and removal by Congress before prosecution. He implies that if Congress does not act, there can be no criminal prosecution of the President until after their term expires. This immunity would only apply temporarily and does not mean the President is above the law. The role of executive privilege in a potential indictment of the President was addressed in United States v. Nixon, where the Supreme Court rejected Nixon's claim of executive privilege in a criminal trial subpoena for Oval Office recordings. In United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court rejected Nixon's claim of executive privilege in a criminal trial subpoena for Oval Office recordings, recognizing executive privilege as an implied constitutional principle but determining that the President's interest in confidentiality was outweighed by the need for evidence in a criminal trial. The Court ordered the tapes to be turned over for review. In United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court rejected Nixon's executive privilege claim related to \"military or diplomatic secrets.\" Judge Kavanaugh expressed skepticism about the Nixon decision, questioning if it was wrongly decided due to his views on separation of powers and the President's authority over executive branch information. Judge Kavanaugh expressed skepticism about the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon, questioning if it was wrongly decided and suggesting it may have been a nonjusticiable intrabranch dispute. Legal commentators have debated the significance of his remarks, with some viewing it as a radical critique of Nixon. Judge Kavanaugh's view of Nixon is seen as a significant critique of presidential power, with some interpreting it as a radical critique of Nixon. He has characterized Nixon as a case where the Judiciary stood up to the President and a great moment in American judicial history. In his 1998 article, he discussed Watergate and the Nixon case, acknowledging that Nixon defined the boundaries of executive privilege. His interpretation of Nixon establishes a strict rule that courts may not enforce a President's executive privilege claim, except for national security reasons. Judge Kavanaugh rejected the idea of balancing the President's confidentiality against the need for evidence in criminal investigations. He believes any executive privilege claim not based on national security must fail under Nixon principles. However, he noted a President could protect confidential information outside the courts by asserting control over executive law enforcement. Judge Kavanaugh believes a President can protect confidential information by asserting control over executive law enforcement, preventing a judicial dispute over presidential communications. He suggests the President should order the federal prosecutor not to seek information and fire the prosecutor if he refuses, as Nixon did with Archibald Cox. This would force the President to take political responsibility for his privilege claim, imposing significant costs if he wishes to shield his communications from a criminal investigation. Judge Kavanaugh's statement on executive privilege, particularly regarding the justiciability question and the accountability of executive officials to the President, aligns with his belief that Congress, not the courts, should address presidential misconduct. In a 2009 opinion, he discussed similar justiciability issues in a case involving a dispute between executive branch officials. In a 2009 concurring opinion, Judge Kavanaugh argued that judicial resolution of intra-Executive disputes raises concerns under Article II and Article III. He stated that such disputes should be resolved by the President, not the courts, and that executive branch agencies may lack the necessary adverseness for court jurisdiction. However, he acknowledged that courts can hear intra-branch disputes involving independent agencies. Judge Kavanaugh's 2009 concurring opinion raised concerns about judicial resolution of intra-Executive disputes, arguing that they should be resolved by the President, not the courts. He acknowledged that courts can hear disputes involving independent agencies with substantive autonomy from the President. Judge Kavanaugh's views on presidential immunity and executive privilege may raise questions about his stance on presidential compliance with subpoenas in criminal proceedings. While the President is not immune from all judicial processes, past cases like Nixon and Clinton v. Jones have established that the President can be compelled to comply with certain judicial orders, such as providing documents or facing civil suits for unofficial acts. The issue of compelled presidential testimony remains unresolved. The Court assumed that the President's testimony could be taken at the White House to accommodate his schedule, and there may be no need for the President to attend a trial in person. The executive branch believes that sitting Presidents are not required to testify in criminal trials. Judge Kavanaugh has not written extensively on whether a President can be compelled to provide testimony in a criminal proceeding. Judge Kavanaugh's views on presidential immunity suggest he may be hesitant to enforce a subpoena requiring the President to testify, citing concerns over the burdens and distractions of litigation and investigations involving the President. Judge Kavanaugh's views on presidential immunity may suggest sympathy towards the argument that compelling the President's \"personal attendance\" could hinder his ability to carry out official functions. He has influenced the judiciary's recognition of the President's removal power and the need for effective supervision over subordinate officers to maintain accountability within the executive branch. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes the importance of the President's authority to remove subordinate executive officers, stating that it ensures executive power is exercised by the President. The Supreme Court has recognized removal as a key tool for control, with debates over the scope of this power and Congress's ability to restrict it through statute. The Supreme Court has addressed the President's authority to remove executive officials in several cases. In Myers v. United States, the Court ruled that the President has exclusive removal power to maintain control over those executing the laws. However, in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Court held that Congress could limit the President's authority to remove members of independent agencies for specific reasons. This \"for-cause\" removal protection was upheld in Morrison v. Olson in 1988. In 1988, the President's control over executive officials was upheld in Morrison v. Olson for the Independent Counsel. Judge Kavanaugh later dissented in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB in 2008, where the D.C. Circuit upheld provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act creating the PCAOB with \"for-cause\" removal protections. This limited the President's direct ability to remove Board members. The panel majority upheld the law allowing for the removal of Board members with \"for-cause\" protections, while Judge Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that the structure limited the President's control over the Executive Branch. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the structure of the Executive Branch, describing it as \"fragmented, inefficient, and unaccountable.\" He argued that the dual layers of removal protections in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were unprecedented and restricted the President's authority over executive officers. Kavanaugh believed that upholding this structure would extend previous rulings that intrude on the President's executive power. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the structure of the Executive Branch, arguing that the dual layers of removal protections in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act restricted the President's authority over executive officers. He warned that upholding this law would allow Congress to create similar entities, splintering executive power. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, invalidated the PCAOB's structure, citing Judge Kavanaugh's dissent that the for-cause removal scheme impaired the President's ability to hold subordinates accountable. In PHH Corporation v. CFPB, Judge Kavanaugh criticized the structural design of the CFPB, arguing that it violated the separation of powers and the President's authority under Article II. He issued two opinions, both concluding that the agency's single Director format was unconstitutional. Despite an en banc review affirming the agency's structure, Judge Kavanaugh dissented, maintaining his stance that it was impermissible under existing legal precedents. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the CFPB's structure in PHH Corporation v. CFPB, arguing it violated separation of powers. He highlighted the novelty of a single director agency, stating it posed a constitutional defect and a threat to liberty. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the CFPB's structure in PHH Corporation v. CFPB, arguing it violated separation of powers by limiting the President's control over the agency head. He highlighted the unique single director agency as a constitutional defect that hinders the President's influence on the agency's direction. Judge Kavanaugh has expressed discomfort with traditional independent agencies, questioning their effectiveness and legal foundations. He has criticized the independent counsel system and believes it poses a threat to individual liberty. Judge Kavanaugh has concerns about the independence of executive branch officials and their potential threat to individual liberty. He questions the effectiveness and legal foundations of traditional independent agencies but has not called for their overturning. Kavanaugh acknowledges the precedent set by Humphrey's Executor and Morrison but may have reservations about their constitutional framework. If confirmed, Justice Kavanaugh may face decisions on Congress's authority to insulate executive branch officials from presidential control. Fundamental rights protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are crucial in interpreting the Constitution, as stated by Justice Kennedy in Obergefell v. Hodges. The Court interprets the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to protect fundamental rights, including unenumerated rights like the right to marry and privacy in intimate decisions. Justice Kennedy's legacy includes recognizing these rights in closely divided cases. Justice Kennedy's legacy includes recognizing unenumerated rights such as a woman's right to abortion, the right of consenting adults to engage in private sexual conduct, and the right of same-sex couples to marry. However, he has also declined to recognize due process protections in cases like physician-assisted suicide. This has brought attention to Judge Kavanaugh's decisions in this area and his broader judicial philosophy. Commentators have focused on Judge Kavanaugh's opinions in a Supreme Court case involving an unaccompanied alien minor seeking an abortion in U.S. immigration custody. His approach to analyzing substantive due process questions remains limited, with only a few cases during his time on the D.C. Circuit. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to substantive due process questions may be more narrow than Justice Kennedy's, particularly regarding future rights and protections. His opinions on abortion have garnered significant attention, with concerns about how he may handle related cases. The Casey decision established the right to abortion before fetal viability without government interference, allowed states to restrict abortions after viability with exceptions, and recognized states' interests in protecting women's health and fetal life. The Court replaced Roe's trimester framework with an \"undue burden standard\" to evaluate abortion regulations. Judge Kavanaugh's approach to substantive due process questions, including abortion, has raised concerns about how he may handle related cases. In Garza v. Hargan, Judge Kavanaugh considered applying Casey's undue burden standard in a case involving an unaccompanied minor seeking an abortion while in U.S. custody. The court issued a temporary restraining order requiring the government to transport the minor for pre-abortion counseling and the procedure. The court issued a temporary restraining order on October 19, 2017, allowing the minor to obtain pre-abortion counseling and the procedure on October 20 or 21, 2017. The government was restrained from interfering with the minor's access to abortion services for fourteen days. The government appealed, arguing it did not impose an undue burden as the minor could leave the U.S. or obtain an abortion after custody transfer. Judge Henderson and Judge Millett issued a non-precedential order vacating the TRO that required the government to release J.D. for abortion counseling or the procedure. The order allowed the government 11 days to secure a sponsor for J.D. to transfer custody, ensuring her lawful ability to obtain an abortion. The government was given 11 days to secure a sponsor for J.D. to transfer custody for her abortion, with the option for the district court to re-enter a TRO if the deadline was not met. Judge Millett rejected the government's arguments regarding facilitating the abortion and conditioning J.D.'s right to an abortion on voluntary departure. Judge Millett argued that requiring J.D. to relinquish her legal claims to stay in the United States would be an undue burden, as the sponsorship process could proceed simultaneously with the abortion. She emphasized that further delay would make it harder for J.D. to access abortion services and increase health risks. The full circuit granted J.D.'s petition for rehearing en banc, reinstated the TRO, and remanded the case to revise compliance dates. Three judges\u2014Judges Henderson, Kavanaugh, and Thomas B. Griffith\u2014dissented from the en banc order regarding J.D.'s constitutional right to an abortion. Judge Kavanaugh did not address this right but focused on the panel decision's emergency nature. Judge Kavanaugh argued that the panel decision in emergency proceedings prudently accommodated the parties' interests by providing a limited time for the government to find a sponsor for J.D. He believed the order aligned with the Supreme Court's abortion cases, recognizing the government's interests in favoring fetal life and protecting the minor's best interests. Kavanaugh also stated that transferring J.D. to a sponsor would be better than making her decide in isolation, and completing the sponsorship process quickly would not impose an undue burden. Judge Kavanaugh supported the government's efforts to expedite the sponsorship process without imposing an undue burden, citing Supreme Court precedents on abortion regulations. He emphasized the lower court's duty to follow existing law and criticized the en banc court's decision as a radical extension of abortion jurisprudence. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the en banc court's decision as a radical extension of the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence, granting unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention immediate abortion rights. The Supreme Court vacated the D.C. Circuit's order as the minor had already obtained an abortion, making her claim moot. Kavanaugh has authored other substantive due process opinions on determining fundamental unenumerated rights, referencing the standards set in Washington v. Glucksberg. In 2015, the Court stated that fundamental rights are not limited by history and tradition. In Doe v. District of Columbia, Judge Kavanaugh addressed a due process challenge to a 2003 policy allowing surgeries for intellectually disabled persons without considering their wishes. Judge Kavanaugh rejected the plaintiffs' claim that consideration of the wishes of intellectually disabled patients in medical decisions violates their substantive due process rights. He argued that accepting the wishes of patients lacking mental capacity could lead to harmful consequences. Judge Kavanaugh rejected the plaintiffs' claim that considering the wishes of intellectually disabled patients in medical decisions violates their substantive due process rights. He noted the lack of evidence supporting a historical basis for recognizing a right to consultation in such cases and highlighted the rarity of the plaintiffs' suggested rule in state laws. In a case involving Cubaexport's trademark renewal, Judge Kavanaugh cited Glucksberg to reject the argument that the 1998 law violated substantive due process, emphasizing deferential scrutiny unless a fundamental right is infringed. Judge Kavanaugh applied highly deferential judicial scrutiny under the substantive due process doctrine in a case involving Cubaexport's trademark renewal. He concluded that the legislation was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, specifically isolating Cuba's Communist government and hastening a transition to democracy. Any unfairness resulting from retroactive application of the law was mitigated by clear government warnings about exceptions to trademarks being revocable. Judge Kavanaugh criticized the Glucksberg decision on substantive due process, noting its inconsistency with the approach in abortion cases like Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Judge Kavanaugh views the Court's pre-Glucksberg due process decisions as part of a \"general tide of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated rights.\" He sees Glucksberg as an important precedent that limits the Court's role in social policy and ensures it operates more as a court of law. Judge Kavanaugh emphasizes judicial restraint and adherence to Supreme Court's test for unenumerated rights rooted in history and tradition. Commentators speculate on potential impact of his judicial philosophy on abortion jurisprudence due to lack of abortion cases in his portfolio. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy emphasizes restraint and adherence to the Supreme Court's test for unenumerated rights based on history and tradition. Speculation arises on how this philosophy may affect abortion jurisprudence given his limited involvement in abortion cases. The government's assumption of J.D.'s constitutional protections and Judge Kavanaugh's stance on stare decisis factors make it difficult to determine his position on Roe or Casey. He has shown skepticism towards discovering new rights within the Due Process Clauses but remains open to new insights into liberty. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy emphasizes restraint and adherence to the Supreme Court's test for unenumerated rights based on history and tradition. He appears to share Chief Justice Rehnquist's approach to defining due process rights, showing skepticism towards discovering new rights within the Due Process Clauses but remaining open to new insights into liberty. Judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy emphasizes restraint and adherence to the Supreme Court's test for unenumerated rights based on history and tradition. While he has not extensively addressed takings claims in eminent domain cases, it is due to the limited jurisdiction of the D.C. Circuit and the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims over such claims. Judge Kavanaugh has either joined the majority opinion or summarily disposed of takings issues in the few cases that have arisen during his time on the court. Judge Kavanaugh's views on the Takings Clause and private property rights are not fully known due to limited jurisdiction of the D.C. Circuit. However, with pending takings cases before the Supreme Court, if confirmed, he may have the opportunity to consider the issue. Questions about his views could be explored in a confirmation hearing."
