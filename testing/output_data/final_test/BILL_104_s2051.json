    "content": "The \"Pharmacotherapy Development Act of 1996\" is focused on the development of drugs for treating addictions to illegal drugs. It includes recommendations for investigating drugs and designating specific drugs for this purpose. Section 526(a) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include treatment of addiction to illegal drugs in the criteria for drug development. The amendment to Section 526(a) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes defining the term 'treatment of an addiction to illegal drugs' as any pharmacological agent that reduces craving or blocks effects for individuals endangering public health or unable to control addiction. The amendment defines 'treatment of an addiction to illegal drugs' as using pharmacological agents to block effects, reduce craving, or prevent drug abuse in high-risk individuals. Illegal drugs refer to controlled substances listed in the Controlled Substance Act. SEC. 103 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include protection for the treatment of addiction to illegal drugs. This involves using pharmacological agents to block effects, reduce craving, or prevent drug abuse in high-risk individuals. SEC. 104 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include protocols for investigations of drugs for the treatment of addictions to illegal drugs, specifically cocaine and heroin. This involves the development, manufacture, and procurement of drugs to address these addictions. Criteria for an acceptable drug treatment for cocaine and heroin addictions are outlined in Subchapter D. The Secretary will establish criteria for acceptable drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addictions through the Institute of Medicine. These criteria will be used for contracts or licensing agreements under section 552, including requirements for drug application approval and performance-based testing. The study on drug effectiveness for treating cocaine and heroin addiction involved a randomly selected test group receiving the drug and a control group receiving a placebo. It compared long-term addiction levels between the two groups. Performance-based testing showed that a significant number of participants with addiction were willing to take the drug. The study found that participants with cocaine or heroin addiction were willing to continue taking the drug for treatment. A significant number refrained from drug use for 3 years after treatment. The drug must have a reasonable production cost. Criteria for drug effectiveness must be reviewed by the Committee before publication. The Secretary must submit criteria for drug effectiveness to specific committees for review before publishing them in the Federal Register within 90 days. \"SEC. 552. PURCHASE OF PATENT RIGHTS FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT.\" The patent owner of a drug to treat addiction to cocaine or heroin can submit an application to the Secretary to sell patent rights or enter into an exclusive licensing agreement for manufacturing and distributing the drug. The application must meet requirements set by the Secretary. The Secretary must contract or license with a patent owner who meets requirements for a drug treating addiction to cocaine or heroin. Only one contract or exclusive licensing agreement per drug type is allowed. The Secretary must contract with a patent owner for a drug to treat cocaine or heroin addiction. The payment amount for cocaine addiction treatment is $100,000,000, and for heroin addiction treatment is $50,000,000. The contract transfers patent rights to the Secretary. The Secretary gains exclusive rights to patented drugs for treating cocaine or heroin addiction, including foreign patent rights, manufacturing process patents, and confidential information. Licensing agreements for manufacturing and distributing addiction treatment drugs also transfer to the Secretary. The Secretary gains exclusive rights to patented drugs for treating cocaine or heroin addiction, including manufacturing processes and confidential information. SEC. 553 outlines a plan for the manufacture and development of drugs for treating cocaine or heroin addiction. The Secretary must develop a plan for manufacturing and distributing drugs for treating cocaine or heroin addiction within 90 days of acquiring patent rights. The plan includes procedures for licensing agreements, drug availability for entities, establishing sale prices, and guidelines for the use of Federal funds. The Secretary must develop a plan for manufacturing and distributing drugs for treating cocaine or heroin addiction. Federal funds can be used by State and local governments or nonprofit entities to purchase the drug. The plan will be subject to procurement and licensing laws of the United States. Upon completion of the plan, the Secretary will notify relevant committees and publish the plan for public comment. The Secretary will publish a final plan within 60 days after the comment period ends. The plan's implementation will start upon final publication. Any actions related to the plan are not subject to judicial review. The Secretary has the authority to create regulations for this section. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 is granted for the implementation of the subchapter."
