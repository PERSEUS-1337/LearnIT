    "content": "The paper introduces a new perspective on transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing Secret, a method that uses a backward-view credit assignment mechanism based on a self-attentive architecture. Secret learns to assign credit separately from the RL algorithm and modifies the reward function, making it compatible with various RL algorithms. This approach aims to improve sample efficiency by transferring structural invariants in tasks. The coffee test, used to assess general intelligence, involves making coffee in an unfamiliar kitchen. This task requires advanced planning, control, and exploration, making it challenging for current Reinforcement Learning agents. Humans easily solve this task by exploiting the universal structure of coffee-making. Transfer learning is deemed necessary to solve the coffee test effectively. Transfer learning is essential to solve the coffee test effectively. Current methods struggle to reuse structural information about the task, hindering efficient adaptation. Credit assignment in RL involves understanding the task's structure, including the relations between states, actions, and rewards. This work explores how credit assignment can improve transfer learning. The proposed approach involves learning to assign credit through a separate supervised problem and transferring these capabilities to new environments, aiming to recycle structural information for better task performance. SECRET (SElf-attentional CREdit assignment for Transfer) is a transferable credit assignment mechanism that uses a self-attentive sequence-to-sequence model to reconstruct rewards from agent-environment interactions. It assigns credit based on attention to past state-action pairs, allowing for structural knowledge incorporation in the reward function without altering optimal behavior. Unlike existing methods, SECRET does not require additional terms in the loss function or external memory, making it more generalizable for various scenarios. SECRET is a transferable credit assignment mechanism that uses a self-attentive sequence-to-sequence model to reconstruct rewards from agent-environment interactions. It assigns credit based on attention to past state-action pairs, without requiring modifications to the RL algorithm or agent architecture. The method for credit assignment is offline and can utilize various interaction data sources. In the classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) formalism, an MDP is defined by a tuple (S, A, \u03b3, R, P) where S is the state space, A is the action space, \u03b3 is a discount factor, R is a reward function, and P is a transition kernel. This framework is essential for real-world use cases where datasets of interactions exist as a byproduct of experimentation. In a Markov Decision Process (MDP), an RL agent interacts by choosing actions and receiving rewards from the environment. Trajectories are sets of state-action pairs and rewards accumulated in an episode. Performance is evaluated based on expected discounted cumulative rewards. In a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP), the agent receives observations containing partial information about the environment's state. SECRET uses previously collected trajectories for transfer learning with a self-attentive sequence model. A self-attentive sequence model is trained to predict rewards in subtrajectories from observation-action pairs. Credit assignment is based on attention weights from correctly predicted rewards. The model is applied to target environments to create a more informative reward function reflecting the structure of the (PO)MDP. Credit assignment is done through offline reward prediction using saved trajectories of agent-environment interactions. The seq2seq model is used to predict environment rewards based on saved trajectories of agent-environment interactions. It operates offline, allowing for direct interaction with replay memory and the use of expert demonstrations for supervision. The model is equipped with an attention mechanism for reward reconstruction. The seq2seq model uses attention weights for reward reconstruction, focusing on observation-action pairs to reduce uncertainty about future rewards. In Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), states summarize past interactions, hindering credit assignment. To address this, states are transformed into observations to break the Markov assumption and allow for better credit assignment. In gridworlds with visual states, cropping the image to a player-centered view with a specific window size breaks the Markov assumption, encouraging the model to look into the past for predictive signals. Self-attentive models like Transformers have direct computational paths between sequence elements, aiding in long-term credit assignment. The reward prediction architecture utilizes a Transformer decoder with a single self-attention layer and a single attention head. The model processes a sequence of observation-action pairs, with observations going through convolutional and feed-forward layers before being combined with positional encoding and fed into a self-attention layer. This approach simplifies credit assignment by directly accessing the initial observation's value. The reward prediction architecture uses a Transformer decoder with self-attention and feedforward layers. Positional encoding encodes sequence element positions, and self-attention computes similarity scores between elements. A causal mask restricts each element's computational window to previous information for credit assignment. The reward prediction architecture utilizes a Transformer decoder with self-attention and feedforward layers. It applies a causal mask to restrict each element's computational window to previous information for credit assignment. The input sequence is represented as matrices, with linear projections of queries, keys, and values. The resulting observation-action representation is a linear combination of previous element values. The reward prediction architecture uses attention weights for credit assignment. Regression on rewards tends to converge to poor local optima, so the sign of rewards is predicted instead. The sign is chosen for its invariance to reward scale, and a weighted sequential cross-entropy loss function is used for classification targets. Class weighting is crucial for maintaining prediction metric variance low across various datasets of trajectories. Trajectories for training SECRET are generated with a mix of successful and random policies or RL agents, with potential benefits of exploratory methods over RL agents. Credit assignment is used to enhance sample efficiency in learning. Reward shaping is a technique in reinforcement learning that aims to densify sparse rewards to improve sample efficiency. By adding a shaping function to the original environment rewards, without changing optimal policies, it can design more informative reward functions. This method requires good priors for the task and potential function knowledge. Reward shaping in reinforcement learning involves designing a shaping function to densify sparse rewards for improved sample efficiency. The SECRET method uses observation-action pairs to derive a shaped reward based on future reward potential, weighted by model attention. The potential function is computed by redistributing returns from trajectories, with attention weights on observation-action pairs and manually constructed states. This approach enhances reward functions without altering optimal policies. The potential function in reward shaping is computed by redistributing returns from trajectories, with attention on observation-action pairs. It encourages agents to stay within the data distribution unless encountering high-reward states. SECRET relies on reward shaping to provide an incentive for agents to stay within the data distribution and learn faster. The augmented reward function densifies the learning signal, biasing agents towards behaviors that lead to future rewards. Transfer capabilities of SECRET to new environments are supported by the success of similar models in other fields. In transfer scenarios, credit assignment is an interesting alternative to weight transfer due to the varying optimal control sequences in different environments. In transfer scenarios, credit assignment is a valuable alternative to weight transfer as it adapts well to changes in the environment dynamics and preserves optimal policies. Keeping credit assignment separate from control representations aids in efficient learning of target tasks. In transfer scenarios, credit assignment is crucial for adapting to changes in environment dynamics and preserving optimal policies. The Total Target Time Scenario metric is used to assess transfer efficiency, with SECRET trained on episodes sampled from the source distribution. The attentional potential function is computed by estimating the redistributed reward. The key questions addressed are whether SECRET improves sample efficiency for RL agents, generalizes or transfers, and how it compares to transfer baselines. The Triggers environment is introduced as an interpretable and customizable environment to assess credit quality. The agent's goal is to activate switches and collect prizes in a bounded grid, with rewards given based on specific conditions. The Triggers environment introduces a system where rewards are based on specific conditions, such as activating switches and collecting prizes. In a modified setting, picking up keys no longer provides rewards, and agents navigate a visually rich environment with extended episode lengths and movement capabilities. This setup challenges agents to understand the relationship between keys and doors for effective credit assignment. In the Triggers environment, rewards are based on specific conditions like activating switches and collecting prizes. Agents navigate a visually rich environment with extended episode lengths and movement capabilities. Credit assignment is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using trajectories generated with trained agents. Different algorithms are used for in-domain and out-of-domain experiments, with a focus on evaluating credit assignment accuracy. In the Triggers environment, credit assignment is optimized by targeting state-action pairs causally linked to future rewards. Precision-recall analysis shows near-optimal redistribution of attention, with an average precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.94. Experiments in keys_doors_puzzle also demonstrate effective credit assignment strategies.

Precision-recall analysis shows near-optimal redistribution of attention, with an average precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.94. Experiments in keys_doors_puzzle also demonstrate effective credit assignment strategies. The granularity of the state space allows for off-by-one prediction errors without hindering the credit mechanism. Leveraging inferred credit and transfer representations can help agents train faster in new scenarios. Agents trained in different environments show improved learning speed when using the attentional potential function. In the Triggers environment, RL agents are tabular Q-learners, while in the DMLab environment, PPO agents are used with a modified task. The shaped reward helps agents focus on key positions, leading to faster task-solving. Transfer learning experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attentional potential function in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. In out-of-domain transfer scenarios, the SECRET mechanism is effective for transferring to bigger environments and environments with inverted dynamics. Weight transfer may not work in bigger settings due to larger spatial dimensions, but SECRET can be used. Inverted dynamics make transfer methods challenging, and shaping is beneficial while transferring weights can hinder learning. Comparison is made with representations learned by agents using deep function approximation like DQN. In transfer learning, shaping rewards helps agents learn tasks efficiently. Credit assignment capabilities are not explicitly transferred in existing approaches. Previous works focus on using pretrained models as teachers to improve sample efficiency. Our method learns credit assignment as a parallel task without modifying the agent's representations. In transfer learning, shaping rewards aids task learning efficiently without altering agent representations. Our method redistributes rewards from the environment to maintain consistency with the original reward function, avoiding the need to modify the agent's architecture. Transfer is seen as sequential task learning, suggesting the introduction of inductive bias to neural architectures to reduce catastrophic forgetting. Our approach focuses on learning from an initial distribution of environments rather than multitask learning or meta-learning. Meta-learning aims to train agents on a distribution of tasks for fast adaptation without modifying the RL algorithm. Previous works explored attention mechanisms for credit assignment, with RUDDER proposing an online method for credit assignment in RL. SECRET is a lightweight method focused on transfer learning, while RUDDER proposes an online credit assignment method for RL agents. Hung et al. (2018) use external memory for value transfer, while SECRET utilizes a non-autoregressive approach. SECRET is a novel transfer learning method that utilizes self-attention and transfers credit assignment instead of policy weights, leading to improved sample efficiency in generalization and transfer scenarios. In experimental setups, episodes stop after a certain number of timesteps in different grid sizes. Hyperparameters remain consistent across all experiments with slight variations. The model includes convolutional filters, dropout regularization, self-attention mechanism, and positional encoding for sequence elements. In DMLab experiments, two convolutional layers with 16 filters each are used. In DMLab experiments, two convolutional layers with 16 filters each are used. The class weights in the loss function are typically set to w(1) = w(\u22121) = 0.499, w(0) = 0.02. The attention vectors from the reward prediction model are compared to ideal credit assignment using binary metrics. Precision and recall are measured based on a binary vector of the size of the attention vector. A heuristic is used to binarize the attention scalars above a threshold \u03b1 for credit assignment evaluation. In various scenarios with different triggers and rewards on an 8x8 grid, the model is trained on 40000 trajectories and tested on 5000 trajectories. Attention weights are collected during positive reward timesteps using a fixed \u03b1 of 0.2. Tabular Q-learning is used with a learning rate of 0.1 and a constant greediness factor of 0.1. For out-of-domain transfer experiments, a smaller version of the DQN architecture is utilized. The DQN architecture used in the study has modified dynamics with smaller convolutional layers and feed-forward layers. The greediness factor decays linearly during training and remains constant during testing. RMSProp is used as an optimizer with a base learning rate of 0.00025. The target network is updated every 2000 steps, and the replay buffer is filled with 5000 transitions initially. The maximum size of the replay buffer is 1000000. The model is trained using 10000 trajectories sampled from a distribution of mazes. After training the model with 10000 trajectories sampled from randomly generated mazes, attentional potential function is computed over a fixed maze using the trained model. 1000 trajectories are sampled on the fixed maze, and positive reward predictions within 5 frames of actual rewards are considered correct. Agents trained with the original reward function are compared to those trained with the new approach. In the study, agents were trained using a shaped reward function based on the agent's position and keys possessed. The state used for computing the potential function was constructed by concatenating the discretized position and key identifier. Although this manually constructed state may limit the approach's generality, future work could address this limitation by estimating the true state. The agents mentioned were PPO learners with specific parameters. In additional experiments, PPO learners with specific parameters were evaluated on the influence of window size in transforming states into observations in Triggers. The goal was to study the impact of partial observability on credit assignment and reward shaping. Different window types were considered, including 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7, as well as the full state, in an in-domain setting with 8x8 mazes and triggers. In an experiment with PPO learners, different window sizes were evaluated in 8x8 mazes with triggers. Bigger window sizes negatively affected credit assignment quality, despite improving reward prediction accuracy. Even with low credit precision, shaped rewards accelerated the learning process. In an experiment with PPO learners in 8x8 mazes with triggers, different class weights for reward prediction models were studied to keep variance low. Evaluation was done on held-out environments with 3 triggers and 1 prize. Displayed metrics include reward prediction, credit assignment, and average return of tabular Q-learning agents. In a study on the influence of data amount in a Triggers task, the impact of misclassification penalties on credit and RL performance was analyzed. Different numbers of trajectories were used to train a self-attentive reward predictor in an in-domain setting with 8x8 mazes. The evaluation included reward prediction and credit assignment metrics for each window size. Increasing the dataset size improves the efficiency of the reward predictor and transfer results. Having too few data can slow down learning but does not prevent solving the task. Different numbers of trajectories were considered for building the potential function. In the in-domain setting, the potential function is built using different numbers of trajectories sampled from the target environment. Evaluation of SECRET is done on 8x8 mazes with triggers and a prize. The number of episodes in the target distribution is crucial for SECRET, but less impactful than in the source domain. Attention weights distribution is measured in out-of-domain scenarios, showing similar results. The attention distribution in out-of-domain scenarios is similar, with focus on triggers as shown in Fig. 10."
