    "content": "The \"Clean Airport Bus Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title. It establishes a pilot program. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a pilot program for awarding grants to eligible entities for using natural gas buses at public airports. Grant requirements will be published within 3 months, and proposals will be solicited within 6 months. Grants will only be awarded to public agencies responsible for bus service at airports. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a pilot program for awarding grants to eligible entities for using natural gas buses at public airports. Grants may be used for replacement or fleet expansion of airport buses. Replacement bus grants require retiring older buses when acquiring new ones. New buses will replace buses manufactured before model year 1977, with the older buses being crushed. If all pre-1977 buses have been replaced, new buses will replace diesel-powered buses manufactured before model year 1991, which will either be crushed or exchanged for pre-1977 buses from another fleet, with the exchanged bus then being crushed. Exchanges must be made without profit to the grant recipient. The Secretary prioritizes grants for replacing buses made before 1977. Grant conditions include operating buses for 5 years and using funds for new natural gas airport buses. The grant recipient may receive up to 10-15% of the price of natural gas buses for necessary infrastructure, depending on availability to other bus fleets. For replacement buses made before 1977, the recipient must provide 10% of the total cost, not exceeding $10,000. In the case of acquiring new airport buses, funding from a grant can cover a percentage of the total cost based on specific criteria. This includes 10% of the cost, up to $10,000, for replacing diesel-powered buses manufactured before 1991 with buses made before 1977. Additionally, for replacing diesel-powered buses manufactured before 1991, 25% of the total cost, up to $25,000, can be covered. The new buses must have a gross vehicle weight exceeding 14,000 pounds. New airport buses eligible for funding must have a gross vehicle weight exceeding 14,000 pounds, be powered by a heavy-duty engine emitting specific levels of pollutants based on model year, and run on electricity, liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, or fuel cell technology. The Secretary aims for nationwide deployment of natural gas airport buses, with a diverse distribution of grant awards among states. The Fuel Cell Bus Development and Demonstration Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program for cooperative agreements with private sector fuel cell bus developers to develop fuel cell-powered airport buses. Non-Federal contributions for activities funded under this program must be at least 20% for fuel infrastructure development and 50% for demonstration activities. Up to $25,000,000 may be used for this program from fiscal years 2004 through 2008. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a program for cooperative agreements with private sector fuel cell bus developers to develop fuel cell-powered airport buses. Reports to Congress are required to evaluate the process of converting natural gas infrastructure for fuel cell buses and assess the development and demonstration program. An updated report must be transmitted by October 1, 2006. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"airport bus\" as a bus operated by a public agency for airport transportation and \"public airport\" as defined in title 49, United States Code. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2004-2008: $40,000,000, $50,000,000, $60,000,000, $70,000,000, and $80,000,000 respectively."
