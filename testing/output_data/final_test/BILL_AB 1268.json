    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21159.21 of the Public Resources Code is amended to state that a housing project can qualify for an exemption under certain conditions, including consistency with relevant plans and zoning ordinances. The project must meet community-level environmental review requirements, have adequate utility services, no wetlands or wildlife habitat on the site, and not harm protected species under the Endangered Species Act. The project must comply with environmental protection laws, including the Native Plant Protection Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The site should not contain wetlands or wildlife habitat, and must not be listed under Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. The project site undergoes a preliminary endangerment assessment to identify hazardous substance releases and potential health hazards. Any existing releases must be removed or mitigated, and exposure to surrounding hazards must be reduced. The project has no significant impact on historical resources and is not subject to specific site restrictions. The project site must not have wildland fire hazards, high risk of fire or explosion, public health exposure exceeding standards, earthquake fault or seismic hazard zones, landslide hazard, flood plain, or restriction zones, unless mitigation provisions are in place in the general plan or zoning ordinance. The project site is not on developed open space, which is publicly owned land available for public use lacking structural development. This does not include land acquired for housing purposes with public funds."
