    "content": "The Act titled \"Fair Allocation of Highway Funds Act of 2017\" outlines the calculation of amounts for highway funds allocation. Section 104(c)(1)(B) of title 23, United States Code is amended to include a special rule for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 to adjust initial amounts for each State's aggregate apportionment. The amended Section 104(c)(1)(B) of title 23, United States Code includes a special rule for fiscal years 2018 through 2020, where each State receives an aggregate apportionment equal to 95-105% of estimated tax payments from highway users in the most recent fiscal year, plus a ratio of the General Fund transfer amount. The General Fund transfer amount for the applicable fiscal year is specified in the amended Section 104(c)(1)(B) of title 23, United States Code. The General Fund transfer amount is determined based on the aggregate amounts collected in the state under federal internal revenue laws in the most recent fiscal year available. The General Fund transfer amount is based on the aggregate amounts collected in all States under federal internal revenue laws in the fiscal year. After adjusting the amount for each State for fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, a single multiplicative factor is applied to ensure the total apportioned amount remains unaffected by this clause. The term 'General Fund transfer amount' refers to the product obtained by multiplying the amount collected in all States under federal internal revenue laws in a fiscal year. The General Fund transfer amount is calculated by multiplying the amount specified in the Internal Revenue Code by the proportion of the amount authorized for appropriation under the FAST Act for the fiscal year."
