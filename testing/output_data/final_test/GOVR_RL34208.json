    "content": "Several bills in the 110th Congress support comparative clinical effectiveness research. S. 3, sponsored by Max Baucus, would require HHS to develop a list of research studies. H.R. 2184, co-sponsored by Tom Allen and Jo Ann Emerson, establishes a funding mechanism for research. H.R. 3162, the CHAMP Act of 2007, also establishes a funding mechanism for research. The CHAMP Act of 2007 establishes a public-private funding mechanism for comparative clinical effectiveness research, overseen by an independent commission. It includes a trust fund with increasing appropriations over the years. The research is estimated to reduce total spending by $0.5 billion over 5 years and $6 billion over 10 years, with the majority of savings realized by private purchasers. Federal government spending is expected to decrease by $0.1 billion over 5 years and $1.3 billion over 10 years. Net federal expenditures from the research are projected to be $0.5 billion over 5 years and $1.1 billion over 10 years. The Healthy Americans Act, S. 334 and H.R. 3163, and the Josephine Butler United States Health Service Act, H.R. 3000, propose incentives for research and the creation of a National Health Board with a focus on clinical effectiveness research. More details on these bills and others in the 109th and 110th Congress can be found in the Appendix. Comparative effectiveness research compares the effectiveness of different health care services or treatments, providing information on their relative effectiveness. It is a form of health technology assessment that examines outcomes from various treatments. The report discusses past and current comparative clinical effectiveness research in the United States, as well as the potential role of a new research entity. The research on comparative effectiveness raises questions about how to measure effectiveness and include costs in the study. Factors like population variations and extrapolating clinical trial results are crucial in quantifying benefits and effectiveness. Researchers have debated how to extrapolate benefits observed in clinical trials to the general population, leading to an expert consensus on best research methods. These methods include conducting sensitivity analyses to assess how study results would change with different parameters. Clinical trials for FDA approval typically compare the efficacy of a treatment to a placebo, rather than another treatment. Efficacy and effectiveness research compare investigational treatments to placebos, with effectiveness research being more inclusive of diverse patient populations and real-world conditions. In clinical practice, patients may have multiple illnesses, varying doses, and different treatment administration methods, which can affect research outcomes. Efficacy trials often exclude certain patient groups to create a more uniform study population, potentially limiting the generalizability of results. Post-marketing studies, also known as phase IV studies, focus on assessing ongoing safety concerns of drugs or devices rather than their effectiveness. These studies rarely compare the relative effectiveness of different treatments and often only evaluate the sponsor's product for equivalence or superiority. Costs are challenging to define and measure in these studies. The total treatment costs in comparative effectiveness research can vary significantly depending on the perspective and costs included. Controversy arises on when and how research results including costs should be used for decision-making, especially in insurance reimbursement and pricing. The inclusion of costs in research is less controversial when not directly linked to medical policy decisions. Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis are techniques used in health technology assessments to compare costs to health benefits. Cost-benefit analysis monetarizes health benefits, while cost-effectiveness analysis measures benefits in non-monetary units like life years. Policymakers may disagree on cost measurement and which costs to include in research, leading to controversy not directly linked to medical policy decisions. The health benefits are often measured in non-monetary units like life years or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with the end result being a ratio of costs and benefits. Cost-effectiveness analysis compares alternatives, while cost-benefit analysis can assess a single option or multiple options. Understanding the scope and scale of current comparative effectiveness research is crucial to determine the need for further research. A survey of medical literature and research initiatives provides insight into the funded and conducted comparative effectiveness research. The section provides a survey of literature and reviews health technology research initiatives in the U.S., discussing comparative effectiveness research and the potential role of a new entity. A search of published medical literature compared the effectiveness of treatments/services from 2004 to 2007, aiming to summarize completed studies. The section surveys health technology research initiatives in the U.S. and discusses comparative effectiveness research. Studies compared treatments/services from 2004 to 2007, categorizing research entities as academic, private institute, pharmaceutical companies, or government. Private institutes included for-profit or non-profit research groups not affiliated with universities or pharmaceutical companies. Examples include hospitals and private practices like Kaiser Permanente Medical Center and Black Hills Regional Eye Institute. VA hospital research was categorized as government research. The research conducted at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals was categorized as government research. Studies primarily focused on treatments for mental health disorders and cardiovascular disease, with academic researchers producing most comparative clinical effectiveness studies. Pharmaceutical companies and government-affiliated researchers published relatively few comparative clinical effectiveness studies, especially in sub-populations like children, elderly, and non-white races. Research including sub-populations like children, elderly, and non-white races may inform clinical practice due to physiological differences in drug metabolism and anesthesia safety. Studies involving patients with comorbidities are crucial as a significant percentage of hospitalizations involve multiple diseases. Health technology assessments, including comparative effectiveness and cost analysis, have been ongoing in the United States through public and private initiatives, some of which have been terminated due to funding issues. More details on these initiatives can be found in the Appendix. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are the largest federal funders of health technology assessments. They primarily provide funding for academic and private sector researchers to conduct research on technology assessments and comparative effectiveness. AHRQ has ongoing programs such as CERTs, DEcIDE Program, EPCs, and RICE for conducting these assessments. The AHRQ and NIH fund health technology assessments through various programs and centers. AHRQ's programs differ in clinical focus and funding mechanisms, while the VHA and DOD conduct assessments in-house. The AHRQ and NIH fund health technology assessments for public use, while the VHA and DOD focus on aiding decision makers within their agencies. AHRQ previously sponsored the Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program (MEDTEP) which included funding for the Patient Outcomes Research Teams (PORTs). The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) also conducted technology assessments for Congress. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment conducted technology assessments for Congress, using in-house researchers and external experts. It was disbanded in 1995 due to controversy over its assessments. Health technology assessments are used for various purposes such as aiding decisions by insurers, healthcare providers, and consumers. Many organizations have utilized existing technology assessments for healthcare decisions. The organizations mentioned in the curr_chunk, including the AMCP and Consumer Reports' Best Buy Drugs, use technology assessments for insurers' coverage and pricing decisions. Pharmaceutical companies have adopted guidelines for formulary assessments, with managed care organizations having dossiers for 40% of drugs under review. Best Buy Drugs provides comparative effectiveness and pricing information as a non-profit project of Consumer Reports. The DOD PEC combines comparative effectiveness and drug pricing information to select \"Best Buy picks\" for health care consumers and providers. The PEC monitors drugs' use, cost, and pharmacoeconomics within the Military Health System, credited with improving patient safety and decreasing costs. Both Medicare and the Oregon Health Plan faced opposition when incorporating cost-effectiveness analyses into policy decisions. The VHA PBMSHG compares drug effectiveness to establish clinical guidelines, formulary, pricing, and contracts. More details can be found in the Appendix. Researchers and policy makers have tested various methods to change physicians' prescribing habits, including one-to-one educational outreach and participatory clinical guideline development. Factors like the management structure of the private insurer employing the physician can also influence prescribing habits. Optimal strategies for changing clinical practice have been explored. Changing clinical practice is a complex and costly process that goes beyond just disseminating information. Some countries use technology assessment for cost containment, global budgeting, and value-for-money purposes. Federal agencies in ten countries are responsible for processing or conducting assessments. Some countries appoint consultants with no links to pharmaceutical manufacturers for assessments, while others only appoint consultants with no links to the manufacturer of the drug under review. Assessments may be completed by the payer or the product manufacturer. Technology assessments in Belgium reduced total drug expenditures, while Italy and Portugal noted reduced unnecessary drug use. Australia, Belgium, and Portugal reported improved cost-effectiveness of drug prescribing. Lack of cooperation from pharmaceutical companies was not mentioned by any country. Three countries frequently cited for their use of health technology assessments are the U.K., Australia, and Canada. The U.S. has numerous comparative effectiveness research entities, but there is a lack of centralization and accessibility of results for healthcare decision makers. This raises the question of the need for a new entity to improve efficiency in conducting comparative clinical effectiveness research. A new research entity could enhance efficiency, coordination, independence, and integrity of research. Factors like structure, funding, mission, and authority would impact its success. Input from stakeholders like insurers or decision makers may be crucial depending on the entity's goals. Establishing a new research entity, potentially as a congressional agency, could improve efficiency and collaboration with existing agencies like AHRQ or NIH. Key factors for success include determining which treatments to study, research methods to use, oversight of studies, required expertise, and maintaining political support. The timing of research can impact its effectiveness, as conclusions may need to be adjusted as more information becomes available. Waiting for perfect information may limit impact, while analyzing imperfect information may lead to changes in conclusions. Finding a middle ground is crucial for improving clinical decision making. The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) introduced guidelines in 2001 for formulary assessments, aiming to ensure evidence-based decisions on pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Pharmaceutical manufacturers were encouraged to submit clinical and economic data for evaluation. The dossier includes economic data, an economic model, and comparative pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic data for drugs. Managed care organizations use dossiers for drug coverage decisions, with budget-impact models and cost-effectiveness analyses included in some. However, P&T committees often find economic models inadequate and may modify them. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHCPR) was established in 1989 within the Department of HHS. It focused on outcomes research, clinical practice guidelines development, and cost-effectiveness information in technology assessments. Controversy arose over the use of cost-effectiveness and the development of clinical practice guidelines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHCPR) faced criticism and controversies from various groups, leading to a 20% budget cut in 1995 and the end of funding for MEDTEP. Congress reauthorized and renamed the agency as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 1999, which now conducts research on health care treatments through various programs and centers. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts research on health care treatments through various programs and centers, including the CERTs, DEcIDE Program, EPCs, and RICE. AHRQ funds pharmaceutical outcomes research through the CERTs, which focuses on the optimal use of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices. The program was established in 1997 as part of the FDAMA and is administered in consultation with the FDA. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts research on health care treatments in partnership with private corporations. The research compares health risks, benefits, cost-effectiveness, and interactions of treatments. AHRQ is authorized to conduct research on outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness of pharmaceuticals, devices, and health care services. AHRQ was appropriated $15 million annually since 2004 for research. The DEcIDE program was created to address responsibilities outlined in section 1013, focusing on health outcomes and comparative clinical effectiveness. Unlike EPCs, DEcIDE centers do not assess cost-effectiveness of technologies. AHRQ has funded 15 projects evaluating comparative effectiveness of health care treatments. The EPC program aims to enhance health care quality through technology assessments, evidence reports, and systematic reviews. Reports influence insurers' coverage decisions and inform quality measures, guidelines, and research agendas. The EPC program, funded by AHRQ, involves 13 centers specializing in technology assessments for CMS and supporting the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These centers, affiliated with academic and private institutions in the U.S. and Canada, have published 155 evidence reports as of August 2007. The RICE program, started in 2001, funds research on cost-effectiveness in healthcare interventions. The BlueCross BlueShield Technology Evaluation Center has been assessing technology effectiveness since 1985. The BlueCross BlueShield Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) conducts evaluations on the effectiveness of technologies in healthcare. They focus on health outcomes like length of life, quality of life, and functional abilities. The evaluations compare pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and health services. Cost-effectiveness analyses are mentioned but have not been conducted since 2005. All evaluations follow the same criteria, evidence review approach, and reporting format. Consumer Reports' Best Buy Drugs Project is a non-profit project that provides comparative effectiveness information about drugs to health care consumers and providers. They select \"Best Buy picks\" based on a drug's effectiveness, safety, and price. The summaries are available for free on their website and are regularly updated with new information. The Department of Defense (DOD) PharmacoEconomic Center (PEC) was established in 1992 to improve drug therapy outcomes in the Military Health System. The center conducts cost-effectiveness analyses, collaborates with the DOD P&T committee, and publishes a monthly newsletter to educate healthcare providers on cost-effective drug therapy. The Department of Defense (DOD) PharmacoEconomic Center (PEC) conducts cost-effectiveness analyses to improve drug therapy outcomes in the Military Health System. The center has shown improved patient safety and reduced costs. The Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) was initiated by the Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) to assess the comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of drugs, aiming to provide credible and transparent research. The Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) at Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) conducts reviews on drug effectiveness, safety, and adverse effects for state Medicaid programs. DERP's conflict of interest policy prohibits financial ties with evaluated companies. Reviews compare drugs within a class, exclude cost information, and are used to inform Medicaid drug coverage decisions. Topics are chosen at biannual public meetings with state pharmacy and medical directors. The Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) at Oregon Health Science University conducts reviews on drug effectiveness for state Medicaid programs. DERP selects drug classes based on Medicaid expenditures and solicits information from pharmaceutical manufacturers. DERP uses existing information from scientific literature and does not conduct new studies. DERP reports may show no differences between drugs, some differences under certain circumstances, unclear differences, or significant differences. DERP reports do not make recommendations but are used by state decision-making groups in Medicaid programs. The Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) at Oregon Health Science University provides reports on drug effectiveness for state Medicaid programs. DERP reports are used by state decision-making groups to make decisions about coverage, payment, and formulary status. DERP reports are available for free on their website. DERP has been financially supported by 13 states and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health since October 2003. Non-profit organizations like ECRI Institute also conduct health technology assessments for various clients including private insurers, government agencies, and the World Health Organization. For-profit firms like Hayes Inc. and United Biosource Corporation perform technology assessments for clients such as pharmaceutical manufacturers and health insurers. Medicare pays for medically necessary services for elderly and disabled individuals. Pharmaceutical and private health insurance plans also conduct technology assessments in-house. Much of the information produced by these firms is confidential client information. Medicare determines coverage through national coverage determinations (NCDs) and local coverage determinations (LCDs). NCDs are made by CMS nationwide, while LCDs are made by local contractors for limited areas. Cost-effectiveness has been inconsistently considered in Medicare coverage decisions, with a proposal in 1989 to include it for the first time. In 1989, HCFA proposed to include cost-effectiveness in coverage decisions for the first time, but faced opposition and the proposal was withdrawn in 1999. In 2000, Medicare issued new guidelines for coverage determination based on demonstrable medical benefit and \"added value,\" with medical benefit determined using evidence-based medicine and added value defined as greater benefit at lower cost. Opposition to the notion of \"added value\" was noted in the 2000 notice of intent. Since 2006, CMS has excluded treatment costs from its NCDs and stated that cost effectiveness is not a factor in making national coverage determinations. A 2006 MedPAC report discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using cost-effectiveness analysis in Medicare, noting that study results may vary due to methodological differences and patient characteristics. The report highlighted the importance of considering clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments to maximize society's investment in healthcare. CMS utilizes evidence-based medicine to evaluate treatment benefits, including studies from AHRQ's EPCs. The Coverage with Evidence Development program allows CMS to collect data on treatment effectiveness by requiring data collection on patient outcomes. CMS believes their contractors have the authority to use cost and cost-effectiveness for LCDs, specifically with regard to \"least costly alternative\" policies. These policies state that a Medicare contractor will not pay the additional cost of a more expensive item if a clinically comparable item costs less. Such policies have been proposed for nebulizers used for respiratory conditions and implemented for treatments for advanced prostate cancer. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was a nonpartisan agency providing scientific and technical information to Congress. Controversy surrounded its inclusion of costs in health technology assessments and perceived lack of timeliness and usefulness. Disbanded in 1995 due to budget cuts, the OTA had less than 200 employees, an annual budget of $22 million, and released about 50 reports annually. Its nonpartisanship and scientific integrity were carefully protected. The OTA was governed by the Technology Assessment Board (TAB) composed of six Senators and six Representatives from each party. The TAB appointed the Director for a six-year term and reviewed all proposed studies and final reports. The agency's studies presented different policy options and their consequences, taking 1-2 years to complete with input from stakeholders and experts. The Oregon Health Plan aimed to expand Medicaid coverage to all Oregonians below 100% of the federal poverty level by managing costs through covering fewer services. Despite controversy over service selection, the plan helped reduce Oregon's uninsured rate from 18% in 1992 to 11% in 1996. The Oregon Health Plan utilized cost-effectiveness analysis to prioritize medical services, creating a list based on community values, health state desirability, and medical professionals' judgment. Critics questioned the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios, suggesting they did not reflect societal values accurately. Critics questioned the Oregon Health Plan's prioritization of medical services, suggesting that cost should not determine treatment priorities. The controversy led to a re-ranking of treatments by the health commissioners, resulting in a more subjective list that was not necessarily based on relative costs and benefits. The revised list included 709 disease-treatment combinations, with the state Medicaid budget covering combinations 1 through 587. However, the Department of HHS rejected Oregon's waiver application in August 1992 due to concerns about possible discrimination against disabled people. The Oregon Medicaid program revised its list of treatments in 1992, moving away from cost-effectiveness ratios. Critics raised concerns about the new list being influenced by advocacy groups and commissioners' judgments. The revised plan was implemented in 1994, comparing treatments for different diseases, unlike traditional analyses that compare treatments for the same disease. The Oregon Medicaid program revised its treatment list in 1992, moving away from cost-effectiveness ratios. Critics raised concerns about advocacy group influence. The revised plan in 1994 compared treatments for different diseases, unlike traditional analyses. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) was established in 1984 to develop clinical practice guidelines based on clinical evidence, not expert consensus. The task force incorporated cost-effectiveness analysis in its reviews in 1998. The USPSTF sponsors cost-effectiveness studies to inform clinical practice guidelines focused on disease prevention methods. The guidelines compare screening, preventative medications, and surgical options. The Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group within the Veterans Health Administration analyzes drug effectiveness, produces guidelines, and manages drug formulary and pricing. The Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group within the Veterans Health Administration analyzes drug effectiveness, produces guidelines, and manages drug formulary and pricing. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidizes outpatient prescription medicines for residents, ensuring timely access to affordable drugs. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia covers over 650 drugs on the formulary, evaluated by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for clinical and cost-effectiveness. The committee recommends drugs to the Minister of Health and Ageing for inclusion, with pricing advice provided by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. The formulary includes drugs for various medical conditions, and the addition of similar drugs is possible. The formulary in Australia allows for the addition of similar drugs, with the number of available drugs not limited. A positive recommendation from PBAC is necessary but not sufficient for inclusion on the formulary. The Minister can add drugs that receive a positive recommendation, but not all recommended drugs are automatically included. In 2002, the Minister chose not to include Viagra due to budget concerns, also removing Caverject, the only impotence treatment on the PBS at the time. Sponsors, usually pharmaceutical manufacturers, must submit to PBAC for drug consideration. Sponsors submitting to the PBAC must conduct a literature review, identify relevant trials, assess trial quality, and aggregate data. They must also perform a cost-effectiveness analysis following PBAC guidelines. The sponsor selects the drug price for analysis and a comparator drug, which may be changed by PBAC if deemed inappropriate. Trials evaluating drug efficacy or effectiveness are submitted, with head-to-head randomized trials preferred but not mandatory. If direct comparisons are unavailable, two sets of randomized trials or non-randomized trials with the same reference drug can be submitted. The PBAC guidelines require statistically significant and clinically important differences between comparison treatments. If a drug is not recommended, the manufacturer can resubmit with additional data or seek an independent review. CADTH in Canada assesses drug effectiveness and efficiency. CADTH in Canada provides assessments of drugs and health technologies to decision makers. It was established by the Canadian government in 1990 and became permanent in 1993. The agency is funded annually by the government. One of its programs is the Canadian Expert Drug Advisory Committee (CEDAC), which makes recommendations on new drug inclusion in formularies. CEDAC is independent and accountable to the CADTH Board of Directors, informed by evaluations from the Common Drug Review (CDR) on safety, efficacy, and therapeutic advantages. CADTH in Canada assesses drugs and health technologies for decision makers. It includes safety, clinical efficacy, therapeutic advantages, and disadvantages, as well as cost-effectiveness. Another program, COMPUS, critiques and rates guidelines from others. Factors influencing COMPUS's research priorities include practice variations, patient population size, outcome data availability, and approval by Canadian deputy ministers of health. NICE in the UK expanded its responsibilities to include guidance on health promotion and prevention. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK advises healthcare providers on resource use and quality care for NHS patients. It is an independent organization funded by the Department of Health and is accountable to the British Parliament. NICE produces guidance on technologies and treatments, with a budget of \u00a331 million for recurring programs in CY2007. NICE produces guidance on new and existing technology and treatments based on clinical and cost-effectiveness. Cost, utilization, uncertainty, and variation in product use are critical factors in topic selection. NICE has published 119 guidelines for technologies and 46 for treatments. The guidelines influence drug cost reimbursement by the NHS and are important to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Concerns about negative NICE guidelines have led some manufacturers to reduce product prices. Investors and analysts are also worried about the impact of negative NICE guidelines on NHS coverage and manufacturer revenues. NICE does not fund new research but relies on existing research for analysis. NICE produces guidance on technology and treatments based on existing research by academics affiliated with universities or professional organizations. Multidisciplinary committees review assessments and consult with stakeholders to produce determinations and guidelines. Draft recommendations are subject to public appeals before NICE releases final guidance to the NHS. All guidance is publicly available and subject to public consultation. NHS managers are responsible for funding the mandatory implementation of technology. NHS managers are expected to fund the mandatory implementation of technology appraisals within three months. Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on public decision makers and compares treatments. Guidelines specify cost-effective populations. NICE does not consider budget impact, leading to disagreements on prioritizing guidance within a fixed budget. Researchers and policymakers have disagreed on the role cost-effectiveness should play in the NICE appraisal process, which aims to prioritize guidance within a fixed budget for NHS costs."
