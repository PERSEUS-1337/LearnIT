In contrast, President G.W. Bush had the most nominees (67) with the lowest confirmation rate (68.7%). President Clinton had the lowest number of nominees confirmed (44).

This section compares the pace of Senate confirmation of U.S. circuit and district court nominees during each President's sixth year in office. The figures report the number of nominees confirmed per six-month period in each President's first and second term combined up to June 30 of his sixth year. The pace of confirmation of judicial nominees is calculated over a six-month period up to June 30 of the President's sixth year. This period provides insight into the number of judicial nominations confirmed by the Senate. Factors such as Supreme Court nominations can affect the confirmation pace. Notable confirmations include President Obama's appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in his first term. The pace of confirmation of judicial nominees is influenced by various factors, including the timing of nominations, processing speed, Senate availability, and focus on other matters. For example, President Obama's appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed in his first term, while President G.W. Bush's nominees were confirmed in the first half of his second term. The Senate's changes to cloture rules for judicial nominations may have impacted the pace of confirmation for President Obama's nominees.

The number of vacancies that exists during a presidency might also affect the pace of nominations and confirmations. Table 2 compares the percentage of vacant U.S. circuit and district court judgeships for Presidents Obama, G.W. Bush, and Clinton during their fifth and sixth years in office, showing the change in vacancy rates. Negative values indicate a decline in vacancies. Table 2 shows that the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships was highest during Clinton's presidency at the beginning of his fifth year and also during his sixth year. The vacancy rate decreased the most for Obama, dropping from 8.9% to 5.6%. As of June 30, 2014, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships is at its lowest since August 2008. During President G.W. Bush's fifth year in office, the percentage of vacant district court judgeships increased from 3.1% to 8.9%. In contrast, the vacancy rate decreased during both the Clinton and Obama presidencies. The G.W. Bush presidency is the only one where the percentage of vacant circuit and district court judgeships increased. During President Obama's second term, the Senate confirmed 78 district court nominees, compared to 32 and 53 nominees confirmed during the second terms of Presidents G.W. Bush and Clinton. However, the district court vacancy rate only decreased slightly from January 1 of Obama's fifth year to June 30 of his sixth year, due to new vacancies occurring in 2014. Out of the 49 vacant district court judgeships as of June 30, 2014, 16 became vacant after January 1 of that year."
