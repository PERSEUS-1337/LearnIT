    "content": "The Act titled \"NOAA Ocean Exploration and Undersea Research Program Act of 2009\" establishes the national ocean exploration and undersea research programs within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Act establishes a national ocean exploration program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to promote collaboration with other federal research programs. The Administrator is tasked with coordinating data management, outreach programs, technology development, and improving public understanding of ocean resources. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to conduct interdisciplinary voyages and scientific activities to explore little known marine areas, prioritize deep ocean regions for important scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to conduct interdisciplinary voyages and scientific activities to explore marine areas, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. Additionally, they will develop a transparent, competitive process for merit-based peer-review of proposals, enhance technical capabilities of the marine science community, and establish an ocean exploration forum to encourage partnerships and communication among experts and stakeholders. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may accept donations of property, data, and equipment for exploring and increasing knowledge of the oceans. SEC. 104. OCEAN EXPLORATION AND UNDERSEA RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will convene an ocean exploration and undersea research technology task force with various organizations to develop strategies for technology transfer, improve communication infrastructure, and establish a data management system. The ocean exploration and undersea research technology task force aims to develop a data management system, conduct public outreach activities, and encourage partnerships for technology transfer. The task force will also coordinate agency budgets to support these activities. The budget will support activities identified in the strategy developed under subsection (a). SEC. 105. OCEAN EXPLORATION ADVISORY BOARD. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appoints an Ocean Exploration Advisory Board to advise on survey priorities, develop a strategic plan, review proposal processes, and provide assistance as needed. The Board is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary of the Interior's authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is not superseded or limited by this title. Authorization of appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $33,550,000 for 2009, $36,905,000 for 2010, $40,596,000 for 2011, $44,655,000 for 2012, $49,121,000 for 2013, $54,033,000 for 2014, and $59,436,000 for 2015. Undersea Research Program established. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish an undersea research program to increase scientific knowledge for the management and preservation of oceanic, marine, and coastal areas. The program director will have specific powers within the program. The program director of the undersea research program will cooperate with educational organizations, partner with the private sector for technological advancement, and coordinate agency budgets to support research efforts. The undersea research program will be conducted through a national headquarters, a network of regional undersea research centers, and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. The Director will develop the program's direction in coordination with a Council of Center Directors and publish a draft program direction document for public comment. The program director will update the program direction every 5 years with public comment opportunities within 90 days after the close of the comment period. SEC. 204. RESEARCH, EXPLORATION, EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS. The network of regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology conduct research, exploration, education, and technology programs including core research, advanced technology development, science-based education, and testing of undersea technology. The program focuses on the discovery and development of natural resources from ocean systems through partnerships with academia and private industry. SEC. 205. COMPETITIVENESS. The Program allocates up to 10% of its budget to a discretionary fund for administration and priority research projects. Regional centers are selected through a competitive process every 5 years based on relevance and feasibility. SEC. 206. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorized appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for fiscal years 2009 to 2011 include funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute, with specific allocations for West Coast and East Coast regional centers. For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, authorized appropriations include $18,301,000 and $20,131,000 respectively for regional centers, with 50 percent allocated to West Coast and 50 percent to East Coast centers. Additionally, $7,321,000 is allocated for the National Technology Institute in 2012. For fiscal years 2014 and 2015, $22,145,000 and $24,359,000 are allocated for regional centers, with 50 percent for West Coast and 50 percent for East Coast centers. $8,859,000 and $9,744,000 are allocated for the National Technology Institute in 2014 and 2015 respectively."
