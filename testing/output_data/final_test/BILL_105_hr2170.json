    "content": "CHAPTER 90--MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: This section introduces reimbursement for adoption expenses under Subpart G of part III of title 5, United States Code. \"Sec. 9001. Adoption benefits define terms like agency, employee, and adoption expenses related to the adoption of a child, including fees charged by adoption agencies, placement fees, and legal fees.\" The regulations establish a program for reimbursing adoption expenses incurred by agency employees, including legal, counseling, medical, foster-care, and transportation fees. Reimbursement is provided after the adoption is finalized. The regulations provide reimbursement for adoption expenses for agency employees, up to $2,000 per child if other benefits do not cover the full amount. Adoption must be finalized, child under 18 and unmarried, and both adopting parents must be employees. The regulations allow reimbursement for adoption expenses for agency employees, with each parent eligible for a determined amount. No payment will exceed the total adoption expenses or $5,000. Guidelines for interagency cooperation will be included, and payments will come from the appropriate fund. The Office of Personnel Management may issue guidelines for uniform administration of reimbursement for adoption expenses for agency employees. Executive agencies must follow these guidelines, and the Office can provide assistance upon request. The analysis for part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended to include \"SUBPART G--ANNUITIES, INSURANCE, AND MISCELLANEOUS BENEFITS\" and \"90. Miscellaneous Employee Benefits\" under chapter 89. Section 1005 of title 39 is also amended to apply section 9001 of title 5 to the Postal Service. The Act will be effective on October 1, 1997, and will apply to adoptions finalized on or after that date."
