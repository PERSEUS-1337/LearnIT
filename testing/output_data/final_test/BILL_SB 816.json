    "title": "SB 816",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Equalization is required to analyze the impact of lowering the monetary threshold triggering the Quentin L. Kopp Conflict of Interest Act from $250 to $100 by January 1, 2018. Section 15626 of the Government Code is amended to reflect this change. Prior to making any decision in a State Board of Equalization proceeding, members must disclose receiving contributions over $100 from involved parties or their agents within the past year. Members of the State Board of Equalization must disclose receiving contributions over $100 from involved parties or their agents within the past year to avoid influencing decisions in adjudicatory proceedings. Members of the State Board of Equalization must disclose contributions over $100 from involved parties within the past year to avoid influencing adjudicatory proceedings. If a member returns a contribution within 30 days of knowing about it, their participation in the proceeding is considered lawful. Close corporations involved in proceedings must also adhere to the disclosure requirements. For disclosure purposes, a deputy to the Controller must reveal contributions and abstain from voting if they vote on behalf of the Controller at a board meeting. \"Contribution\" and \"party\" are defined as per Section 82015 for adjudicatory proceedings before the board. In adjudicatory proceedings before the board, a \"participant\" actively supports or opposes a decision with a financial interest, while an \"agent\" represents a party or participant in the proceeding. An adjudicatory proceeding pending before the board refers to a contested matter scheduled for an administrative hearing before board members. Consent calendar items are excluded unless previously discussed or removed for separate consideration. After a board meeting notice, a member must disclose any contributions received from parties involved in a specific adjudicatory proceeding before the board. Contributions totaling $100 or more within the past 12 months require disqualification. Members must provide campaign statements to board staff when filed. The notice of contribution form prescribed by the board requires inquiry into any contributions made to a member within the past 12 months before an adjudicatory proceeding. Staff must report on whether any party is a close corporation, the majority shareholder's name, and if any agent has made contributions. Violating this provision is a misdemeanor. No person convicted of a misdemeanor under this section can run for elective office or be a lobbyist for four years after exhausting all legal appeals, unless the court decides otherwise. A plea of nolo contendere counts as a conviction. In addition to other penalties, a fine of up to $10,000 or three times the undisclosed amount may be imposed for each violation. Prosecution must begin within four years of the violation. No reimbursement is required for this act as it pertains to governmental decision-making by board members and the creation, elimination, or change of penalties for crimes or infractions."
