    "content": "The \"Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005\" aims to regulate the production, storage, sale, and distribution of ammonium nitrate to prevent its misuse in creating explosives for terrorist attacks. The Act recognizes the importance of ammonium nitrate in agriculture but highlights the need for security measures due to its potential for misuse. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"facility\" refers to any site where solid ammonium nitrate is produced, stored, or held for distribution, sale, or use. The term includes buildings or structures used for these purposes at a single site or multiple contiguous or adjacent sites. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the handling and distribution of ammonium nitrate, including \"handle,\" \"handler,\" \"purchaser,\" \"terrorism,\" and \"Secretary.\" These terms are crucial for understanding regulations regarding the production and sale of this substance. The curr_chunk focuses on the regulation of handling and purchase of ammonium nitrate. The Secretary may regulate the handling and purchase of ammonium nitrate to prevent terrorism. Regulations may include registration requirements for handlers and purchasers, as well as maintaining records of sale. Prior information submission is required before new registration. The Secretary may request information from the Attorney General and use existing licenses for registration. Consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture is required to ensure access to ammonium nitrate for agricultural producers is not overly restricted. Data confidentiality is maintained. The Secretary is prohibited from disclosing certain information obtained from facilities, handlers, or purchasers regarding the secure handling of ammonium nitrate, including purchase details. Exceptions to this confidentiality rule allow disclosure to certain government officials. Exceptions to the confidentiality rule regarding information on the secure handling of ammonium nitrate include disclosure to specific government officials, the public if deemed in the public interest, or as required by a Federal court order in which the Secretary is involved. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary can inspect places handling ammonium nitrate without a warrant to ensure compliance with the Act. If non-compliance is suspected, the Secretary can issue an order to prevent sale or distribution. Appeal procedures allow for contesting the order through administrative adjudication, with successful appeals resulting in order rescission. The Secretary can seize and confiscate ammonium nitrate in violation of the Act through in rem proceedings in the district court. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture or State agencies to enforce the Act. The Secretary can delegate authority to States for administration and enforcement, upon request from the Governor. Funding is provided for delegated functions. The Secretary can delegate functions to States under this subsection, providing adequate funds for implementation. However, this subsection does not authorize States to carry out certain functions related to facilities or handlers that make specific elections. SEC. 7. CIVIL LIABILITY. Unlawful Acts under this Act include failure to perform duties, violation of registration terms, failure to keep records, and violation of sale orders. Penalties for violations may include a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. Civil penalties can only be assessed after notice and a hearing in the person's residence jurisdiction. The district courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction over civil damages actions against a handler for harm or damage resulting from the unlawful use of ammonium nitrate. SEC. 8 of the Act preempts any State law regulating the handling of ammonium nitrate to prevent its misuse in acts of terrorism."
