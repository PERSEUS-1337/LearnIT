    "content": "Before livestock mandatory price reporting was enacted by Congress in 1999, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price information from meat packers on a voluntary basis. AMS market reporters collected prices from livestock auctions, feedlots, and packing plants to provide accurate market information to buyers and sellers. The livestock industry had undergone significant changes by the 1990s, including increased concentration in meat packing and more vertical integration. The livestock industry saw increased concentration in meat packing and more vertical integration. Fewer animals were sold through negotiated sales, with more sold under alternative marketing arrangements. Some producers called for mandatory price reporting to ensure fair market prices. USDA estimated significant underreporting in livestock transactions. Opponents of mandatory price reporting argued it would impose costly burdens on the industry and compromise confidential information. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (LMR, P.L. 106-78 , Title IX; 7 U.S.C. \u00a71635 et seq.) was enacted in October 1999 to mandate price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, live swine, and potentially lamb sales. This law aimed to address low prices in the late 1990s and prevent a patchwork of state reporting laws that could impact competition between meat packers. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 mandated price reporting for various livestock products. USDA implemented regulations within 180 days of the law's enactment. Mandatory price reporting was authorized until September 30, 2004. USDA established mandatory reporting for lamb in the final rule, which was delayed until April 2, 2001, for testing purposes. The AMS voluntary price-reporting program continued alongside mandatory reporting. In October 2004, Congress extended mandatory price reporting until September 30, 2005. USDA requested packers to voluntarily submit required information after the authority for Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) lapsed. Around 90% of packers complied, allowing USDA to publish most reports. In October 2006, Congress reauthorized reporting through September 30, 2010, amending swine reporting requirements. USDA issued a final rule on May 16, 2008, to reestablish and revise the mandatory reporting program, incorporating swine reporting. The Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2010 reauthorized and revised the mandatory reporting program, including swine reporting changes. A study conducted in 2009 found benefits in requiring packers to report wholesale pork prices. This led to the enactment of the act on September 27, 2010. The Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-239) reauthorized mandatory price reporting through September 30, 2015. It included provisions for mandatory reporting of wholesale pork cuts and established a committee to develop regulatory changes. The final rule was released on August 22, 2012, and implemented on January 7, 2013. The House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture initiated the reauthorization process. The House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture began the reauthorization process for the Mandatory Price Reporting Act by holding a hearing on April 22, 2015. Producer representatives from various associations voiced support for mandatory reporting and suggested changes to specific reporting requirements. The stakeholders agreed that the loss of reporting during the October 2013 government shutdown was disruptive and advocated for LMR to be deemed an essential service. The Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 (H.R. 2051) was introduced in the House on April 28, 2015. H.R. 2051, the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015, reauthorized LMR through September 30, 2020. The bill addressed hog and lamb market issues raised by livestock stakeholders. The House passed H.R. 2051 on June 9, 2015, and the Senate passed it on September 21, 2015. The Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54) extended mandatory price reporting until September 30, 2020. It made changes to swine reporting, revised lamb reporting definitions, and required a USDA study on LMR. The provisions on swine and lamb were proposed by industry stakeholders to improve LMR. The cattle industry did not propose changes to cattle LMR requirements. The House-passed Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 (H.R. 2051) included swine and lamb industry proposals, but the emergency authority for USDA during a government shutdown was not included in the final law. The legislation established a new negotiated formula purchase reporting category for swine, requiring reporting of low and. The enacted legislation amends swine and lamb reporting requirements, including reporting low and high range of net swine prices, number of barrows and gilts, total number and weighted average price of barrows and gilts. Importers are now defined as entities importing an average of 1,000 metric tons of lamb meat per year. The Secretary may determine an entity as an importer even if they do not meet the volume limit. Lamb packers are defined as entities with 50% or more ownership in facilities that slaughter and process an average of 35,000 head per year. The threshold was originally 75,000 head. Other facilities may be considered packers based on processing plant capacity. USDA is required to conduct a study on the price-reporting program for cattle, swine, and lamb. The USDA is directed to conduct a study on current marketing practices and legislative recommendations for producers, packers, and market participants. The study includes analyzing USDA reporting services and was included in the House-passed bill with a deadline of March 1, 2018. Livestock industry stakeholders have suggested changes to improve mandatory reporting and address emerging issues since the last reauthorization. During the 15 years of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) program, industry stakeholders have relied on the AMS data for marketing decisions. The government shutdown in October 2013 disrupted the publication of daily and weekly reports, impacting producers and the futures market. The CME Group uses LMR data to settle hog and cattle contracts, noting the lack of public alternatives to the trusted LMR data. LMR price data is crucial as few public alternatives exist. Livestock stakeholders urged USDA to deem mandatory reporting essential to prevent loss of price information during government shutdowns. The NPPC recommended adding a new purchase category for swine called negotiated formula purchase. The NPPC recommended adding a new purchase category for swine called negotiated formula purchase to increase price discovery by boosting the volume of negotiated purchases. This could potentially increase reported negotiated hog sales by 50-100%. Some hog sales occur after the reporting deadline, which are not included in daily reports but are believed to be delivered to packing plants the next day. The NPPC recommends reporting late-day hog trades in the next day's reports to improve market transparency and increase trade volume. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry faces price-reporting challenges and believes LMR is crucial for a transparent market. The ASI worked with AMS to improve lamb reporting, but the effort did not result in rulemaking. The ASI recommended lowering the reporting threshold for lamb imports to capture prices for a greater share of imports. They also suggested reducing the threshold for packer reporting to include pricing data from mid-size lamb processors. The ASI recommended lowering reporting thresholds for lamb imports and packers to capture more pricing data. The sheep and lamb industry faces challenges with few participants in processing, leading to non-reporting issues. Additionally, a significant portion of lamb processing is done on a \"custom slaughter\" basis, not reported under LMR. The ASI recommended flexibility in packer definitions for reporting under LMR, as granted by P.L. 114-54. The cattle industry supported LMR reauthorization, but no specific cattle proposals were included. Various stakeholders raised concerns, but no consensus was reached on amending LMR cattle provisions. NCBA suggested AMS have flexibility in requesting additional information to report industry standards as cattle marketing changes. NCBA recommended adding a new category for fed-cows in LMR reporting to provide more price and marketing information. R-CALF expressed concerns about new types of cattle purchases not captured in LMR, including negotiated basis trade-type contracts, extended delivery cash sales, and \"Tops\" trades. They also raised issues about late-day transactions. R-CALF and NFU support reauthorization of mandatory reporting for cattle, addressing concerns about late-day transactions and market concentration. NFU proposed changes to LMR, including confidentiality rules and reporting on imported cattle. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (LMR) requirements, confidentiality rules, reporting by Agricultural Marketing Service, and enforcement are discussed. Definitions for selected terms used in LMR are provided. Packers subject to mandatory reporting must have slaughtered a minimum annual average of specified numbers of cattle, swine, sows, boars, and lambs. They are required to report prices for various categories of livestock multiple times daily, along with premiums and discounts. Packers subject to mandatory reporting must provide detailed daily and weekly reports on livestock purchases, including quantity, type of purchase, weight basis, quality characteristics, and carcass details. Swine packers also report on premiums, discounts, and some carcass characteristics. Swine packers must report premiums based on noncarcass characteristics and provide a list of such premiums to producers. Packers are also required to report sales data for boxed beef, wholesale pork, and carcass and boxed lamb, including price, quantity, quality grade, and type of cut. Sales for beef and pork are reported twice daily, while lamb sales are reported once daily. Packers must also report beef and pork domestic and export sales, as well as domestic boxed lamb sales. Lamb importers meeting specific criteria must report weekly lamb prices, quantities imported, type of sale, cuts of lamb, and delivery information. The LMR law requires confidentiality in price reporting to protect packers' identity and proprietary information. Initially, a \"3/60\" guideline was used, but it resulted in data gaps. A \"3/70/20\" guideline was adopted in August 2001 to address these gaps. AMS adopted a \"3/70/20\" guideline in August 2001 to address data gaps in reporting. This guideline required a minimum of three entities to report 50% of the time over a 60-day period, with no single entity accounting for more than 70% of volume. The Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News Division (LPGMN) of AMS is responsible for compiling and disseminating information collected under LMR, publishing daily and weekly reports for various livestock categories. According to AMS budget documents, mandatory reporting provides data for a significant percentage of slaughtered cattle, hogs, and sheep. LMR covers a high percentage of boxed beef production, wholesale pork, and lamb meat. AMS market news operates on an annual appropriation of about $34 million, with the LMR program accounting for $5 million to $6 million of that amount. AMS enforces LMR through audits every six months, issuing warning letters for non-compliance. AMS enforces mandatory reporting through audits every six months. If packers do not correct issues, AMS may issue warning letters and impose fines of $10,000 per violation. Quarterly compliance reports were published until September 2014, followed by a six-month report from October 2014 to March 2015."
