    "title": "SB 1294",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing climate adaptation strategies. The state's investment in natural infrastructure, such as urban forests, is at risk due to drought conditions, highlighting the importance of sustainable water management. Improved water retention and infiltration can reduce reliance on long-distance water imports, lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon sequestration through natural and working lands management and organic waste diversion is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas levels. California has a strategy to increase organic waste diversion for composting and mulch production, which can be cost-effective in reducing greenhouse gases and improving soil health and water retention. Composting provides environmental and agricultural cobenefits by reducing volatile organic compounds and ammonia. California is amending the Public Resources Code to divert organic waste from landfills by promoting compost use statewide. The California Environmental Protection Agency aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting compost use on working lands. Coordination between agencies is essential to achieve this goal. The California Environmental Protection Agency is assessing progress towards developing organic waste processing infrastructure to meet state goals. They will consult with stakeholders regularly and hold public workshops annually to inform the public and receive feedback. Develop recommendations for promoting organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide, to be posted on the California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s website by January 1, 2017, and updated annually. Assess state programs to increase compost use for carbon sequestration in urban and rural areas. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 42649.89 of the Public Resources Code requires the implementing agency to develop a program promoting compost use, prioritizing projects involving community conservation corps or local non-profit entities employing underprivileged youth. Division 45 establishes the Community Climate and Drought Resilience Program of 2016 with the intent to promote organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide. In enacting this division, the Legislature aims to establish a natural resource management program to improve carbon sequestration, drought preparedness, and address climate change effects through urban forest canopy, soil sequestration, stormwater management, waste diversion, and community greening. It also seeks to create employment opportunities for at-risk youth in climate-friendly landscape management. The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery will promote policies to help communities adapt to climate change, improve water management, and enhance drought preparedness. The legislation aims to improve carbon sequestration, drought preparedness, and address climate change effects through urban forestry, workforce training in disadvantaged communities, and composting organic waste. Definitions for CalFire, CalRecycle, and disadvantaged communities are provided. CalFire will review and potentially revise the urban forestry program to prioritize funding for carbon sequestration projects, including mulching, watering, pruning, water capture, and drought response measures to maintain tree health and climate resilience. Establish local or regional targets for urban tree canopy in disadvantaged communities vulnerable to urban heat island effect, including diversity and adaptability to climate change. CalFire to provide planning assistance and guidance for maintaining urban forest health. By July 1, 2017, CalRecycle, in consultation with relevant state agencies, shall develop a program to incentivize the use of compost from organic waste in farming and landscaping practices to increase drought resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. CalRecycle will work with state-certified conservation corps for community outreach and urban greening projects. Regulations will be developed and updated for program implementation."
