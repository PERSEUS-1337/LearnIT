    "content": "Electric power generation in the United States is mainly fueled by coal, which has environmental costs due to emissions of nitrogen, sulfur oxides, and carbon dioxide. Renewable energy technologies offer a cleaner alternative using solar, wind, water, and geothermal sources. Renewable energy development in the United States was spurred by the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, leading to a focus on national security and energy independence. This resulted in the establishment of renewable energy research programs at the U.S. Department of Energy to address concerns over reliability, environmental impacts, and global climate change. Calls for a national strategy focusing on renewable energy as a key component for economic development and job growth are increasing. Congress is considering legislation for a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) and Clean Energy Standard (CES) to address concerns over climate change and energy security. The RES would require retail electric providers to use a minimum percentage of renewable energy sources, while the CES would include advanced coal and nuclear energy technologies. The goal of the report is to discuss these concepts. The report aims to explore how RES policies could increase renewable electricity generation in the US, considering the influence of fuel costs on power generation technology. Fossil fuels currently dominate electricity generation, contributing significantly to carbon dioxide emissions. Growing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs drive the need for renewable energy development. Growing concerns over GHG emissions and environmental costs are leading utilities to deploy more renewable energy technologies. As of 2009, hydropower represented 7% of US electric power generation, with other renewables totaling 4%. Renewable energy technologies are at different stages of maturity and face barriers to achieving a greater market share. Biomass is a key renewable energy source in the US, representing 53% of all renewable energy used. The Department of Energy estimates that 29 GW of domestic biomass generation could be available by 2030. Sustainable management of biomass resources, especially forests, will be crucial for future growth. Biomass combustion technology is mature but underutilized, with potential for higher efficiency in combined heat-and-power applications. Co-firing biomass with coal is a cost-effective option, while biomass gasification technologies offer even greater efficiency for producing synthesis gas or hydrogen. Wind power capacity in the US was second only to natural gas in 2009, with significant potential for growth. The total installed wind power capacity in the United States reached 35 GW in 2009, with a potential to reach 68 GW by 2030. Wind turbines are increasing in capacity, generating electricity competitively with fossil fuels. Integration of wind power into the grid faces challenges due to intermittency, with natural gas turbines as backup and energy storage solutions suggested. The development of transmission facilities is discussed as a prerequisite for wider wind energy development in the United States. The Department of Energy projects that wind energy could provide 20% of the nation's electrical supply by 2030, requiring a capacity of 300 GW. Offshore wind power is a fledgling industry in the U.S., with the first offshore wind farm authorized in 2010. The Cape Wind project, authorized in 2010, is the first U.S. offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound with 130 turbines from Siemens AG totaling 420 MW capacity. Permits for over 2,476 MW capacity for offshore projects are pending. U.S. offshore wind power potential was estimated at 908 GW in 2005. Solar photovoltaic cells are being researched to reduce costs and improve efficiency, with technologies to increase sunlight concentration for better electricity conversion efficiency. The efficiency of solar PV cells can be increased by optimizing the amount of sunlight. Solar PV is widely used in off-grid and peaking power applications, with battery storage extending usage hours. Solar PV installations are projected to reach almost 12 GW by 2030 in the US. The technology is most effective in sunny regions and lower latitudes, but Germany's success with 8.9 GW capacity in 2009 shows wider applicability. Solar thermal technologies use mirrors to concentrate sunlight for steam production, which is then used for electricity generation or industrial processes. Large land areas and water access are required for steam generation. Some applications directly heat air to produce electricity. Costs in the US are higher than fossil-fuel power generation, but advancements in absorbers, reflectors, and heat transfer fluids are being made. Advances in solar thermal systems could reduce costs to six cents per kilowatt-hour by 2015. Concentrating solar power plants with heat storage are being considered for large generating plants in the western US. Improved energy storage benefits conventional power generation and off-grid applications. Utility-scale solar facilities will likely be in the southwestern US, where water resources may be limited. EIA projects slow growth in domestic power generation. EIA projects slow growth in domestic power generation from solar thermal technologies and geothermal energy, with capacities expected to increase by 2030. Solar hot water heaters are gaining popularity in the United States, while geothermal energy can be used for electricity generation or heating. Research and development investment may be necessary to improve energy conversion efficiencies and reduce costs for smaller solar thermal systems to become mainstream choices domestically. Geothermal energy has seen growth with Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) creating man-made reservoirs for energy production almost anywhere. Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP) are used in residential applications for heating and cooling by utilizing temperature differences between the ground and air. Improved drilling technology and fluid flow techniques can lower costs and increase power generation. Energy efficiency standards for home heating and cooling could lead to wider deployment of these technologies. The focus on home heating and cooling could lead to improved technologies and wider deployment of GSHP in new construction. Building new hydroelectric power plants is expensive and can face opposition due to environmental concerns. DOE does not expect much growth in large conventional hydroelectric capacity, but there are opportunities for small and \"low head\" hydroelectric technologies. Hydrokinetic energy technologies also have potential for power generation. Hydrokinetic energy technologies harness power from water movement in rivers and dams. Wave energy and tidal flow technologies are emerging for coastal waters. Various renewable energy technologies tap into different resources like wind and solar. Investment levels vary based on potential and economic readiness. Development stages of technologies impact their potential. The costs of generating electricity from renewable energy technologies vary based on their development stages and suitability for different applications and locations. Local incentives and renewable resource quality influence deployment potential. Renewable energy electricity production costs are generally higher than fossil fuels when considering capacity factor and O&M costs. Transmission costs depend on the distance from the power plant to the consumption point. EIA recently estimated the average costs. The EIA estimated the levelized cost of power generation for various energy technologies in 2016. Costs ranged from $83.1 for natural gas-fired power to $396.1 for solar PV. Some renewable energy technologies are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, while others require technological improvements. Many states have implemented Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) to promote renewable energy, with requirements or goals established in 29 states and the District of Columbia. These standards oblige electric utilities to increase the use of renewable energy sources over time. Some states have mandatory requirements, while others have voluntary goals or incentives for meeting renewable energy targets. Many states have Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) to promote renewable energy deployment. Some states have provisions expiring by 2015, while others have provisions expiring by 2020. The minimum renewable energy requirements and eligible technologies vary. The US traditionally relies on market forces and tax incentives for technology development, but other forces question this approach. Investment dollars play a role in the innovation and deployment of renewable energy technologies. The need for wide deployment of renewable energy technologies on a national scale is at the heart of policy discussion for a Renewable Energy Standard (RES). Advocates argue that a federal RES can drive market growth by creating a compliance requirement nationally, bridging the gap of expiring state RPS standards. Legislation can impact energy markets through specific compliance requirements. Policy initiatives can drive market changes by mandating compliance or providing incentives. The US's current energy system limits short-term market opportunities, but there are potential long-term opportunities. Tax incentives may not be true market drivers, but can enable projects. Renewable energy tax credits shifting to cash grants have been beneficial. Recent policies have shifted renewable energy tax credits to cash grants, aiding new energy projects. However, the long-term sustainability of taxpayer-subsidized facilities without continued support is uncertain. Non-hydro renewable electricity accounted for about 4% of U.S. electric power production in 2009. To increase renewable energy's role in the U.S. electricity future, federal action may be necessary. Governmental support is advocated to accelerate U.S. renewable energy activities for energy security and independence. Renewable energy sources, such as biofuels and electricity, can improve the reliability of power systems and potentially lower electricity prices by replacing fossil fuels. Opponents of a national Renewable Energy Standard (RES) argue mainly about costs, as coal has been the cheapest fuel for electricity generation. Replacing even a portion of coal generation with renewables would be a significant challenge. Replacing a portion of coal generation with renewable energy would be a massive task due to the challenges of harnessing variable renewable sources like wind and solar. Upgrading electric transmission lines and installing backup power would be necessary for large-scale deployment of wind power. The design of a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) policy includes factors like the target level of requirement, time span, and technologies involved. Recent proposals aim to lower greenhouse gas emissions and promote job creation or economic development. RES proposals traditionally focus on advancing renewable energy resources. Recent legislative proposals have sought to expand eligible technologies for Renewable Energy Standard (RES) policies to include \"clean energy\" technologies like mine-mouth methane or clean coal. The implementation of a national RES policy can have varying impacts on states, regions, and customers' income levels due to differences in renewable energy resource quality across the United States. Certain states and regions may find it easier to comply with RES requirements at a lower cost than others. Some electric utilities in the southeastern United States argue that renewable energy resources in the region may not be enough to meet RES goals, leading to higher electricity prices. Forest-based biomass is considered a primary source for renewable energy in the southeast, but competition for biomass raises concerns about resource sustainability. In western states with abundant solar energy, the development of large-scale solar thermal plants could strain water resources if water-saving alternatives are not implemented. Plans for developing solar thermal plants are being considered with water conservation in mind, as governors in the eastern United States express concerns about the cost of high-voltage transmission lines for importing wind power. Some suggest focusing on local renewable energy resources to avoid high costs. Compliance with a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) may lead to decisions on cost-effective use of renewable resources and incorporation of demand-side management technology for energy efficiency. These issues could impact the development of new renewable generation. Plans for infrastructure development could impact the need for new renewable generation and its location. Most communities in the US are served by local electric utilities connected to power plants via transmission lines. These plants mainly use coal or natural gas for electricity generation, resulting in cheap power but high emissions. Nuclear power is also used. Nuclear power, with minimal GHG emissions, is generated from centralized plants, allowing for cost-effective power distribution to multiple communities. Renewable technologies like geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric dams can also serve as base load capacity. Wind and solar power are intermittent due to weather conditions, but storage solutions can improve power generation reliability. Distributed generation schemes like wind power and solar PV improve dispatchability by generating power at or near the point of consumption. On-site generation, combined heat and power, and stand-alone generation are options for communities seeking independent power supplies. The Smart Grid is being considered for future U.S. electricity networks to enhance transmission and distribution systems with interactive intelligence. Energy efficiency is also a key focus for the future of electricity systems. The aging electricity transmission infrastructure in the United States is not keeping up with current and future needs, leading to power interruptions and congestion issues costing the economy billions annually. Modernizing the grid could cost $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion to address projected future needs, national cyber security, and other grid challenges. Aggressive deployment of a Smart Grid, enabled by smart meters and energy storage projects, could enhance energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18% by 2020, and provide options for peak load management. The system aims to address future needs, national cyber security, and grid vulnerabilities. A recent study estimated that upgrading the national transmission system for renewable electricity generation by 2025 could cost $40 billion to $130 billion. Renewable energy projects in the western and southwestern US are often far from population centers, making transmission line siting a lengthy process. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established national interest energy transmission corridors (NIETCs) to address transmission constraints. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified DOE's mission for NIETCs to include areas where renewable energy access is limited. The Smart Grid development could integrate intermittent renewable electricity generation by monitoring and shifting power as needed. The North American Electric Reliability Council ensures grid reliability. The North American Electric Reliability Council focuses on ensuring grid reliability and acknowledges the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources. Renewable Energy Standards (RES) policy aims to drive jobs growth in the clean energy sector and bridge the gap left by expiring Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). However, modest RES requirements may not be enough to stimulate domestic manufacturing opportunities in the short term. Additionally, embedded energy efficiency requirements could reduce the need for new renewable electricity generation facilities. The domestic design and manufacture of renewable energy equipment in the United States is crucial for green jobs growth. Incentives to locate production domestically are necessary. Government investment on a large scale may be needed to build a clean energy manufacturing future. Asian governments are investing more in clean energy manufacturing clusters. Investments in Asia-Pacific aim to replicate Silicon Valley's success with clusters, fostering relationships for competitive advantages. Supporters advocate for public-private partnerships to establish manufacturing clusters for clean energy innovation, with federal funds potentially awarded competitively. The Advanced Projects Research Agency-Energy program aims to support the next generation of clean energy technologies through competitively awarded public-private partnerships. Projects should focus on leap-frog advances in renewable technologies to gain market share, with a target horizon for replacing old technologies estimated at 25 years. The new technologies must be disruptive enough to make decommissioning and replacement cost-effective in the future global clean energy market. The future global clean energy market is estimated to reach $2.3 trillion by 2020, making it one of the world's largest industries. Nations are vying for a share of the market, but there are no guarantees that the United States' investment in clean energy manufacturing will lead to desired results. Trade policies will play a significant role in determining market access for U.S. products. incentives are needed to attract manufacturing to specific locations. Establishing incentives for manufacturing in the United States could create a strong export-focused industry. A recent study suggests that a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) could lead to higher costs for consumers if wind and solar replace coal-fired generation. Ratepayer Protection provisions aim to limit compliance costs, but potential rate increases may disproportionately affect lower-income customers. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's report highlights the effectiveness of Feed-in Tariff (FIT) policies in promoting renewable energy deployment. FITs require electric utilities to purchase electricity from renewable energy developers, providing guaranteed payments. This strategy can complement a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) by focusing incentives on specific technologies. In the United States, various states and municipalities have implemented Feed-in Tariff (FIT) programs to incentivize specific technologies like solar PV. A national FIT program is unlikely due to the country's diverse renewable energy resources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a ruling in 2010 regarding FIT concepts under current U.S. law. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) proposed a FIT program for cogeneration systems under 20 MW, but faced objections from investor-owned utilities claiming FERC's authority. FERC determined that the program fell under federal jurisdiction if it set wholesale rates in interstate commerce. However, FERC stated that as long as cogenerators met PURPA requirements and rates did not exceed the utility's \"avoided cost,\" the proposal would not be preempted by federal regulations. California revised its FIT plans to support 1 GW of renewable electric capacity through competitive auctions for projects ranging from 1 MW to 20 MW. FERC's decision suggests that FIT policies can apply to facilities over 20 MW under PURPA while still being subject to FERC regulations and avoided cost pricing requirements. The price of renewable electricity is becoming more competitive with fossil generation, and setting FIT rates at attractive levels within avoided cost requirements could further support renewable energy. Enacting a clean energy strategy employing a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) or similar policy is crucial for achieving green job creation and reducing environmental impacts from traditional power generation. However, a long-term national energy policy that considers current and future energy needs, costs, and benefits is still missing. Recent technological advancements in natural gas production from tight shale gas formations could impact the development of renewable electricity. The development of renewable electricity could be affected by the emergence of shale gas formations if they can be economically produced in an environmentally acceptable manner. A well-defined U.S. national energy policy may provide the transparency needed to finance the modernization of the electricity sector. Proposed bills in the 111th Congress aim to establish requirements for electric utilities to use renewable or clean energy sources. The pending legislation before the 111th Congress, S. 3813, the Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010, includes provisions for a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) based on integrated renewable electricity and energy efficiency requirements. Retail electric suppliers with annual sales over 4 million megawatt-hours would need to earn or acquire renewable electricity or energy efficiency credits. Certain exemptions and incentives are included, such as double RECs for renewable energy from facilities on Indian Lands and triple RECs for small distributed generation and energy from algae. DOE would establish a federal REC trading program to certify utility compliance with the RES. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 (S. 3813) includes provisions for a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) where retail electric suppliers must earn or acquire renewable electricity or energy efficiency credits. One Renewable Energy Credit (REC) is issued for each associated kilowatt-hour of renewable energy or energy efficiency, and can be traded or carried forward for up to three years. The RES includes various renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and excludes certain sources like hydroelectric, nuclear, and fossil power generation. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 includes provisions for a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) where retail electric suppliers must earn or acquire renewable electricity or energy efficiency credits. Energy efficiency improvements would be limited to 26.67% of the annual compliance requirement. Compliance with other energy efficiency standards would not count toward the RES requirements. An \"alternative compliance payment\" of 2.1 cents per kwh is also included. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 includes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) where retail electric suppliers must earn or acquire renewable electricity or energy efficiency credits. An \"alternative compliance payment\" of 2.1 cents per kwh is allowed, with 75% of the payment going into state funds for renewable energy development. A civil penalty for non-compliance with RES requirements is also included, along with the option for utilities to petition for a waiver of compliance for rate protection reasons. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) requiring retail electric suppliers to meet renewable energy or energy efficiency targets. States can petition for a variance from compliance due to transmission constraints. DOE may provide loans to utilities for RES projects and review the program's impact on electric rates every five years. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) requiring retail electric suppliers to meet renewable energy or energy efficiency targets. The Department of Energy (DOE) is tasked with analyzing the program's economic benefits for the United States and determining if new technologies and clean renewable sources would advance the program's goals. Recommendations will be made on adjusting energy efficiency and renewable electricity percentages, expanding the definition of renewable energy, and modifying the definition of biomass. Sustainability in biomass harvesting will be emphasized, with a mandatory interagency report to Congress assessing the impacts. The Renewable Electricity Promotion Act of 2010 establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) requiring retail electric suppliers to meet renewable energy or energy efficiency targets. S. 3813 would exclude fossil electric power generation in proportion to the GHG emissions captured and geologically sequestered for energy production. The bill does not address the eligibility of captured, non-sequestered but usefully applied GHGs for the same exemption. Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives below 4 million mwh electricity sales would not have to comply with the RES. Energy from algae would be eligible to receive triple RECs. The RES focuses on producing electrical energy. The legislation focuses on producing electrical energy from algae and other renewable sources. It addresses transmission constraints and the possibility of states seeking variances for compliance. The term \"clean energy\" is mentioned but not defined in the bill. The legislation focuses on producing electrical energy from algae and other renewable sources. It addresses transmission constraints and the possibility of states seeking variances for compliance. The term \"clean energy\" is mentioned but not defined in the bill. Nuclear and advanced coal technology projects are eligible for ACP funds set up by states. S. 1462 proposed an RES provision which served as a model for S. 3813. Differences between the two proposals include the treatment of incinerated municipal solid waste and the distribution of ACP funds. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010 aims to promote clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and decrease reliance on foreign oil. It includes requirements for a federal Clean Energy Standard and excludes certain power sources from qualifying retail sales. The bill also amends PURPA and defines clean energy broadly. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010 promotes clean energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It includes various clean energy technologies qualifying for the Clean Energy Standard, such as nuclear energy, advanced coal generation, and retired fossil fuel generation. Clean energy credits are issued for compliance and can be traded or banked for future use. Eligible retired fossil fuel generation is included to encourage facility retirement. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010 incentivizes retiring power plants with high carbon dioxide emissions by offering clean energy credits. These credits are based on the quantity of electricity generated prior to retirement and the carbon dioxide emissions reduction achieved. Advanced coal generation can also earn credits based on carbon capture and sequestration efforts. Double credits are given to advanced coal plants sequestering at least one million tons of carbon dioxide. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010 incentivizes retiring power plants with high carbon dioxide emissions by offering clean energy credits. Advanced coal plants can earn double credits for geologically sequestering at least one million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The definition of eligible biomass in the Act differs from previous legislation and includes biomass removed from specific public lands to aid healthy forests or reduce forest fire risks. Combined heat and power facilities are rewarded with additional clean energy credits for higher efficiencies. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2010 incentivizes retiring power plants with high carbon dioxide emissions by offering clean energy credits for facilities that exceed efficiency improvements. Systems achieving a 90% improvement qualify for 1.5 credits per kwh. Energy efficiency can count for up to 25% of the annual compliance requirement. Alternative compliance payments are allowed at a rate of 3.5 cents per kwh. No amendment to federal purchase requirements is made in the Act. The CES in S. 20 is more aggressive than the RES in S. 3813, with higher annual target percentage requirements and a longer compliance period. It aims to address retiring older fossil energy plants and balance renewable electricity deployment with other clean energy technologies. The goal for advanced coal retrofits is unclear in terms of power production capacity. Sec. 132 of S. 1462 and H.R. 2454 establish a federal renewable electricity standard for electric utilities, requiring them to obtain a percentage of their electricity supply from renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass. The standard starts at 3% in 2011 and increases to 15% by 2021. Other innovative renewable technologies may also qualify. Under S. 1462, RES requirements are met through federal renewable energy credits (RECs) and up to 26.67% can be fulfilled by energy-efficiency credits (EECs) with approval from a state's governor. Alternative compliance payments (ACPs) of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour can be made instead of meeting the standard, with payments going to the state of the electric utility. RECs can be traded and banked for up to three years, and EECs are awarded for verifiable electricity savings. The Secretary of Energy will provide guidelines for EEC awards, excluding compliance with conservation or energy-efficiency programs. The Renewable Electricity and Energy Efficiency provisions in S. 1462 are similar to H.R. 2454, with some differences. S. 1462 requires compliance to begin in 2011, one year earlier than the House version. The Senate bill exempts Hawaii from compliance and sets a maximum of 15% renewable electricity, with energy efficiency accounting for up to 26.67%. The implementing agency is DOE in the Senate bill. The Senate bill designates DOE as the implementing agency for renewable electricity and energy efficiency provisions. Retail electric suppliers may receive RECs for complying with a state RES by generating or buying renewable electricity. The Senate bill allows the use of ACP funds for non-renewable energy deployment or energy efficiency, including nuclear, coal with carbon sequestration, and electric vehicle deployment. Direct grants to customers to offset higher costs from the RES are also permitted. The Senate bill allows for waivers of RES requirements due to weather or transmission constraints, while the House bill does not. The House bill increases the federal renewable energy purchase requirement to 20% by 2020, while the Senate bill sticks with the requirements in the Energy Policy Act 2005. Both bills define one renewable energy credit as representing one megawatt-hour of renewable electricity. The Senate energy bill allows for trading of both renewable energy and energy-efficiency credits, while the House bill only allows for trading of renewable electricity credits. Triple credits are granted for distributed generation systems, with differing definitions between the two bills. The Senate bill defines DG as providing electric energy to customers for purposes other than resale to a utility, while the House version defines it as a facility generating renewable electricity without combustion. Biomass or municipal solid waste combustion is not eligible under the House bill. The Senate and House bills differ in their provisions for distributed generation (DG) systems. The Senate grants triple Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to DG systems smaller than 1 MW, while the House gives triple RECs to all eligible DG systems. The bills also differ in the exclusions allowed from the calculation of a utility's total annual electricity supply. Both bills exclude existing hydro, post-enactment nuclear capacity, and the quantity of electricity in a CCS. The Senate energy bill excludes capacity of a municipal solid waste facility owned by an electric utility, nuclear power plant efficiency improvements made after enactment, and sets a federal Diverse Energy Standard for electric utilities. Utilities must obtain minimum annual percentages of electricity from diverse energy sources like advanced coal generation, biomass, and energy efficiency. S. 1462 establishes a federal Renewable Electricity Standard for electric utilities, requiring them to obtain a percentage of their supplies from renewable energy sources or energy efficiency. Renewable sources include wind, solar, geothermal, and ocean energy, biomass, landfill gas, and qualified hydropower. The bill aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting various clean energy sources. Federal Clean Energy Standards S. 1462 and S. 3464 propose Renewable Electricity Standards and a Clean Energy Standard for electric utilities, requiring a percentage of energy to come from renewable sources or energy efficiency measures. S. 1462 starts at 3% in 2011, increasing to 15% by 2021, while S. 3464 starts at 15% in 2015, rising to 50% by 2050. Exclusions from the base quantity include certain energy sources like hydropower and incineration of waste. S. 3464 excludes hydropower from the base quantity for the Clean Energy Standard. S. 1462 promotes renewable energy development on federal lands and sets a minimum 5 cents per kilowatt-hour for alternative compliance payments, higher than S. 1462's 2.1 cents per kwh. The bills S. 1462 and S. 3464 do not clearly define the basis for issuance of federal renewable energy credits or diverse energy credits. Both bills associate these credits with a specific amount of electricity used for compliance purposes."
