    "content": "The Act of 2013 is titled the \"Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act\" or the \"ConTACT Act\". Congress acknowledges the long-term effects of concussions, with an estimated 173,285 sports-related mild traumatic brain injuries treated in the US annually among children and adolescents. Repeat concussions can slow recovery and increase the risk of long-term problems. Repeat concussions can lead to second impact syndrome, causing brain swelling, permanent damage, and even death. Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are preventable, but many schools lack resources for proper concussion management. SEC. 317U. GUIDELINES ON BEST PRACTICES FOR DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND MANAGEMENT OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. The Secretary will establish guidelines for States on best practices for diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs) in school-aged children. The Pediatric MTBI Guideline Expert Panel will issue a final report on these best practices by March 15, 2015. The guidelines and report will also address MTBIs in student athletes returning to play. Grants to States will be provided for implementation. The Secretary may make grants to States for adopting and disseminating guidelines on mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs) in school-aged children, including implementing pre-season baseline and post-injury neuropsychological testing for student athletes. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information, including strategies for disseminating guidelines on mild traumatic brain injuries to schools and ensuring their implementation. The Secretary requires States to form strategic partnerships and provide data on MTBIs among student athletes. States must utilize expertise from high school sports associations and brain injury organizations. Coordination of activities is essential for implementing guidelines on MTBIs in schools. The Secretary must coordinate with other federal agencies regarding MTBIs. A report to Congress is due in 4 years, detailing state adoption of guidelines, schools implementing testing for student athletes, and data on MTBIs among students. Definitions for this section are provided. Definitions for this section include terms such as MTBI (mild traumatic brain injury), school-aged child (ages 5-18), second impact syndrome, Secretary (of Health and Human Services), State (each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia), and student athlete (grades 6-12 participating in school sports). Authorization of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and additional funding for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 is provided for sports programs in elementary and secondary schools."
