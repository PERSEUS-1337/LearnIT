    "content": "In this Act, definitions are provided for terms like \"coastal Louisiana ecosystem,\" \"Governor,\" \"Plan,\" and \"Task Force.\" The Plan refers to the report for ecosystem restoration for the Louisiana Coastal Area dated January 31, 2005. The Secretary of the Army is required to submit reports to Congress recommending modifications to the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, restoration plans for the Barataria-Terrebonne Estuary and Chenier Plain in Louisiana, and a long-term comprehensive framework for ecosystem restoration within specified timelines. The Secretary of the Army must submit a recommended framework to Congress for a long-term program that protects and restores coastal Louisiana ecosystems from natural disasters. This framework should integrate other federal or state projects and be completed within five years. The Secretary of the Army must submit a feasibility study to Congress recommending a long-term plan for the protection, conservation, and restoration of the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. The plan should integrate ongoing federal and state projects, including those under various acts and plans related to coastal wetlands and conservation. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force is established. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force is established with members including various Secretaries, Administrators, Directors, and Advisors. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force includes members such as the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and a representative of the Louisiana Governor's Advisory Commission on Coastal Restoration and Conservation. The Task Force is responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary of the Army on policies, strategies, plans, and financial plans for agencies involved in protecting, conserving, and restoring the coastal Louisiana ecosystem. The Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Protection and Restoration Task Force is required to submit a biennial report to Congress summarizing its activities and progress. The Task Force must also implement procedures for public participation and establish working groups to assist in its duties. Members of the Task Force and associated working groups cannot receive compensation for their services. Travel expenses for Task Force members will be covered by the agency or entity they represent. SEC. 4. INVESTIGATIONS. The Secretary of the Army will conduct feasibility studies for future authorization and large-scale studies in accordance with the Plan at a total cost of $130,000,000. The Secretary will review existing federally authorized water resources projects in coastal Louisiana to determine their consistency with the purposes of this section and their potential contribution to ecosystem restoration. $10,000,000 is authorized for this subsection. The Secretary of the Army will carry out a coastal Louisiana ecosystem program with a total cost of $50,000,000. The program aims to identify uncertainties and improve knowledge of the coastal Louisiana ecosystem, as well as develop technologies for ecosystem restoration. The Secretary may establish working groups to assist in carrying out the subsection and enter into contracts with experts for coastal restoration. The Secretary may also carry out projects to resolve scientific uncertainties related to the comprehensive plan. The Secretary is authorized to implement a comprehensive plan with a maximum total cost of $100,000,000 for all demonstration projects. Individual projects must not exceed $25,000,000. Initial projects include Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Environmental Restoration ($105,300,000), Small Diversion at Hope Canal ($68,600,000), and Barataria Basin Barrier Shoreline Restoration ($242,600,000). The curr_chunk discusses various projects in the coastal Louisiana ecosystem with total costs of $133,500,000, $278,300,000, and $100,000,000 for Small Bayou Lafourche Reintroduction, Medium Diversion at Myrtle Grove, and Beneficial Use of Dredged Material programs respectively. SEC. 6. NON-FEDERAL COST SHARE. The Secretary of the Army can credit the non-Federal share of project costs in coastal Louisiana for work done by the non-Federal interest if deemed integral. Credits can be transferred between projects. Periodic monitoring ensures non-Federal contributions match project costs. After the commencement of construction of the first project under section 5(c), the Secretary will monitor and manage the non-Federal provision of cash, in-kind services, materials, land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas for each project authorized. The Secretary will conduct separate monitoring for the construction phase, preconstruction engineering and design phase, and planning phase for each project authorized on or after the date of enactment. Credit for land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas provided under this section, and the cost of work, shall be audited by the Secretary for projects authorized on or after the date of enactment. SEC. 7. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION.\n\nThe Secretary of the Army may determine that a project for the coastal Louisiana ecosystem is justified by environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness, without needing further economic justification. This does not apply to elements unrelated to ecosystem protection.\n\nSEC. 8. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION. Existing Authority: This Act does not affect any authority in effect before its enactment, including requirements for participation in coastal Louisiana ecosystem projects by various federal and state agencies. New Authority: This Act does not grant any new regulatory power to any entity. The Act does not grant new regulatory power to any entity carrying out projects authorized by or under it."
