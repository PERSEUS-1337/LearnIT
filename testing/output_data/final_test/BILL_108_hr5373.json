Excess water storage capacity of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project can only divert nonproject water if certain conditions are met, including having a prior decree and no need for new infrastructure. Charges for using the excess capacity must include an interest component determined by the Secretary. The diversion of water out of the natural basin must meet specific conditions, such as having an agreement in place, either existing or newly executed, between the beneficiary and the water conservation district within whose boundaries the waters are proposed for diversion.
