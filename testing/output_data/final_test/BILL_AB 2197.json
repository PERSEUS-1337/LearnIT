    "title": "AB 2197",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1253.3 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to ensure that certain unemployment benefits are payable based on specific service criteria outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. Benefits based on service in educational institutions are not payable during breaks between academic years or terms if the individual has a contract or assurance to work in the following year. Benefits specified by subdivision (a) for service in educational institutions are not payable during breaks between academic years if there is a reasonable assurance of continued service in the following year. Retroactive benefits can be claimed within 30 days after the start of the second academic year if benefits were denied due to certain reasons. Individuals with a reasonable assurance of reemployment can fulfill the work search requirement by registering for work between academic terms. Employees of public schools are eligible for increasing weeks of benefits between academic years, starting with two weeks in 2017 and reaching eight weeks in 2020 and beyond, provided funds are allocated in the annual Budget Act. Benefits based on service in a nonprofit organization are not payable during vacation or holiday periods if there is a reasonable assurance of continued service. (e) Compensation may be denied to individuals who performed services in an educational institution while employed by an educational service agency. An educational service agency is a governmental entity providing services to educational institutions. (f) Benefits based on service for a nonprofit organization are not payable if the services are provided to an educational institution. Reasonable assurance for this section includes an offer of employment or assignment by the educational institution, not contingent on enrollment, funding, or program changes. If an individual is notified of replacement without an offer of employment, they do not have reasonable assurance. For academic contracts, if an individual works half or more of their time for an employer during a term, all their services for that period are subject to benefit payment restrictions. Entities must inform individuals performing non-contractual services for educational institutions about reemployment assurance at least 30 days before the end of the academic term. When working for an academic institution, individuals need to be informed about reemployment assurance before the end of the term. If there is reasonable assurance of reemployment, the employee should still file a claim for benefits, as eligibility is determined by the Employment Development Department, not the employer. If an individual has reasonable assurance of reemployment at an educational institution, they may be entitled to retroactive payment of benefits if not offered a job for the following academic term, as long as they meet eligibility criteria and file a claim within 30 days."
