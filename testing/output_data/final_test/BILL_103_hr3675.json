    "content": "The Defense Alternative Use Committee Act, also known as the \"Act,\" includes sections on the establishment of alternative use committees at defense facilities, their functions, administrative provisions, conversion plans, and penalties. The Act starts with a short title and table of contents, followed by findings and purpose. The Congress finds that heavy economic, scientific, and technical commitments for defense have led to specialized skills and practices not directly applicable in the civilian sector. Careful preparation is necessary to avoid economic dislocations as these commitments are modified. The purpose of this Act is to provide the means for the nation to adjust to changing national security needs. The purpose of this Act is to promote orderly economic adjustment in the United States to minimize worker and industry dislocations, prevent recessionary trends, and encourage the conversion of defense technologies and skills to civilian projects. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"defense agency\" as specific government departments and agencies involved in defense activities, and \"defense contract\" as contracts for providing defense material or services to defense agencies or foreign countries under certain laws. The term \"defense contractor\" refers to individuals providing defense material or services under a defense contract, including subcontractors, manufacturers, suppliers, and service providers. A \"defense facility\" encompasses private establishments or government-owned facilities engaged in the production, repair, or storage of defense material. The term \"defense materials or services\" includes weaponry, equipment, and specialized supplies for defense agencies or foreign military use. \"Displace\" refers to the separation of workers in defense-related roles. The term \"displace\" refers to the separation of workers from defense-related roles. Establishment of alternative use committees at defense facilities. The head of each defense agency must require defense contractors to establish alternative use committees at defense facilities with at least 100 employees. Private defense contractors exporting materials must also establish these committees. For government defense facilities, the head of the facility must ensure compliance. The head of defense agencies must ensure that defense contractors establish alternative use committees at facilities with at least 100 employees. These committees, composed of both management and labor representatives, are responsible for economic conversion planning in the event of facility reduction or closure. The head of defense agencies must ensure that defense contractors establish alternative use committees at facilities with at least 100 employees. These committees, composed of management and labor representatives, plan for economic conversion in case of facility reduction or closure. Local government executives can appoint nonvoting community representatives to advise the committee, with a limit on the number of representatives. Discrimination against unorganized civilian worker representatives on the committee is prohibited. Workers on alternative use committees cannot be discriminated against for their participation. Funds for planning and reporting requirements will be paid from defense contract funds or facility operating accounts. Office space will be provided to the committee without charge. This section applies to defense contracts entered into after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. FUNCTIONS OF ALTERNATIVE USE COMMITTEES. The alternative use committee for a defense facility evaluates assets, resources, and community needs. They develop conversion plans for nondefense-related activities and arrange for retraining and reemployment. The alternative use committee arranges retraining and counseling for displaced employees. Upon completion of the conversion, the committee dissolves and returns assets to facility management. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The alternative use committees may hire staff and specialists as needed. They can obtain inventory and information on land, buildings, equipment, and employee skills from defense agencies or contractors. SEC. 7. ELEMENTS OF CONVERSION PLANS. Conversion plans developed by an alternative use committee must maximize personnel with similar skills to those employed at the defense facility before conversion. They should identify civilian personnel whose continued employment is not efficient for the converted facility and determine the new positions needed due to skill mismatches. The alternative use committee must detail the new plant and equipment required for the converted facility, estimate financing needs, and provide a financial plan. The conversion process must be completed within two years. Plans must also include extending wage, labor contract provisions, and benefits to workers until the conversion is finished. If a defense contractor fails to establish an alternative use committee or refuses to carry out a conversion plan, they will lose eligibility for defense contracts, contract termination payments, and tax credits for three years."
