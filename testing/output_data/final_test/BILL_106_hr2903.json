To receive a grant, participants must submit an application, and the Secretary consults with the Marine Mammal Commission and designated representatives. The John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program involves representatives from designated stranding regions and organizations involved in marine mammal rescue, rehabilitation, research, and conservation. Grants are limited to $100,000 with a 25% matching requirement for non-Federal costs. The section outlines the amount of funds and fair market value of property and services provided by non-Federal sources for the activity.
