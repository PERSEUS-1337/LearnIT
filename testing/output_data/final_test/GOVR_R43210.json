    "content": "The Hostage Relief Act of 1980 provided benefits to the 52 Americans held hostage in Tehran, including an interest-bearing salary savings fund, reimbursement of medical expenses, and tax relief. The Hostage Relief Act of 1980 provided benefits to hostages, including tax relief, educational expenses, and medical benefits. The cost of additional benefits was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. A proposal to pay hostages $1,000 per day from frozen Iranian assets was objected to by the State Department. The U.S. government sought Algeria's help to secure the release of hostages from Iran, leading to the Algiers Accords. These agreements included the release of hostages, unfreezing of Iranian assets, and the creation of an international tribunal to settle claims. The Algiers Accords resulted in an agreement that bars the prosecution of Iran by the United States for claims related to the 1979 hostage crisis and subsequent events. President Carter issued an Executive Order to fulfill this commitment. President Carter issued Executive Order 12283, using the IEEPA to prohibit U.S. jurisdiction from filing court claims against Iran related to the hostage seizure. The OFAC amended regulations accordingly. President Carter also established the President's Commission on Hostage Compensation to consider financial compensation for the former hostages. The President's Commission on Hostage Compensation recommended a \"token\" payment of tax-exempt detention benefits of $12.50 per day of captivity for former hostages, considering governmental obligations and existing benefits received. The commission concluded that \"compensation in the tort sense\" was not appropriate, mindful of the Algiers Accords preventing lawsuits against Iran for damages. The President's Commission on Hostage Compensation recommended compensation for former hostages, including health restoration costs, disability compensation, material losses compensation, and protection of employment rights. Despite the Algiers Accords barring lawsuits, some hostages sued Iran for damages. Many former hostages sued Iran for damages, but lawsuits failed due to lack of jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act or the Algiers Accords. In Persinger v. Islamic Republic of Iran, the court initially found jurisdiction based on the non-commercial tort exception to the FSIA, but the President's order implementing the Algiers Accords extinguished any claim the plaintiff may have had. The U.S. government petitioned for rehearing on the foreign sovereign immunity question, and the court agreed that the tort exception to sovereign immunity applies only to injuries within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The court held it could not reach the question regarding the legitimacy of the President's action in Belk v. United States. The United States Claims Court entered summary judgment in favor of the government, stating that the signing of the Algiers Accords did not constitute a \"taking\" of private property. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed this decision. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed that the extinguishment of the plaintiffs' claims was not unexpected and did not interfere with investment-backed expectations. The matter was deemed non-justiciable as a political question involving a policy decision made by the President during a crisis. The President's decision to enter into the Algiers Accords to settle the dispute with Iran over the hostages was within his foreign relations role and not subject to judicial review. The court deemed the matter non-justiciable as a political question involving a policy decision made by the President during a crisis. Any compensation for the plaintiffs would have to come from another branch of government. Congress later provided compensation through the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 provided compensation for civilian captives, with the committee considering various factors in determining the cash compensation amount. The recommended per diem rate of $12.50 per day for hostages was seen as underestimating their ordeal, with suggestions for higher compensation rates. The chosen per diem rate was considered a reliable measure of the government's obligation. The committee recommended a per diem rate of $66 per day for former hostages, which was later amended to $50 per day for Iran hostages. In 1996, the FSIA was amended to include an exception for acts of terrorism, leading to a lawsuit against Iran by former hostages in 2000. In Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, the U.S. government intervened to vacate a default judgment sought by the plaintiffs for damages. The government argued that the suit did not meet the requirements of the terrorist State exception to the FSIA and was barred by the 1981 Algiers Accords. Congress later included Roeder in the Hollings amendment to the FY2002 Appropriations Act. The provision specified that Roeder should be included in the terrorist State exception to the FSIA, excluding suits against terrorist states from immunity. The amendment directed courts to decline cases if the state was not designated as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time of the act, unless later designated as a result of the act or related to a specific case in the United States District Court. The conference report quashed the State Department's motion to vacate a judgment obtained by plaintiffs in a specific case in the District of Columbia. President George W. Bush signed an appropriations act into law on November 28, 2001, noting a provision that removed Iran's immunity from a lawsuit by the 1979 Tehran hostages in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The government pursued a motion to dismiss the case, citing the Algiers Accords as a defense. The judge expressed concerns during the proceeding. The judge expressed concern about the lack of clarity in a recent congressional enactment regarding the Algiers Accords. In response, the 107th Congress made a technical correction in the fiscal 2002 appropriations act for the Department of Defense, reaffirming the validity of a claim in the Roeder case. The provision in Section 626(c) of P.L. 107-77 acknowledges American citizens' claim against Iran for the 1979 hostage situation. President Bush clarified that a technical correction in Section 208 of Division B did not alter the provision's effect. The executive branch has been encouraging courts to act in accordance with this provision. The executive branch has encouraged courts to act in accordance with Section 626(c) of P.L. 107-77, which acknowledges American citizens' claim against Iran for the 1979 hostage situation. A judge granted the government's motion to vacate a default judgment against Iran and dismiss the suit, citing lack of jurisdiction and the provision of the Algiers Accords. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the lower court's decision regarding Iran's substantive law in the case. Congress's enactments on the Roeder case were deemed ambiguous and potentially interfering with separation of powers. Executive agreements, like contracts, are expected to be honored by the parties involved. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision on Iran's substantive law in the Roeder case. Executive agreements, like contracts, are expected to be honored, and Congress can abrogate them with clear legislation. The appellate court's interpretation did not render any act of Congress futile. In response to the Roeder case decision, efforts were made in Congress to pass legislation abrogating the provision of the Algiers Accords barring the hostages' suit. The Senate proposed an amendment to the FSIA allowing US citizens held hostage in Iran after November 1, 1979, to claim money damages against the government of Iran, overriding any international agreements like the Algiers Accords. The Algiers Accords provision barring hostages' suits was abrogated retroactively by Congress. Efforts to pass legislation abrogating the provision were made in response to the Roeder case decision. The Senate proposed an amendment to allow US citizens held hostage in Iran to claim damages against the Iranian government, overriding international agreements like the Algiers Accords. Efforts were made by Congress to provide compensation for former hostages without violating the Algiers Accords. Legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to give up to $500,000 to victims of hostage-taking, including the Iran hostages from the Roeder case. Recipients would have been eligible for additional compensation from frozen Iranian assets, with a provision prohibiting them from suing a foreign state in U.S. court. Similar bills were introduced in subsequent Congresses. In the 110th and 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to address compensation for former hostages without violating the Algiers Accords. The bills aimed to allow liquidation of property to pay compensation to hostages, but none received committee action. In the 113th Congress, a similar bill was introduced as H.R. 904. In 2008, Congress amended the FSIA but did not clearly address the Algiers Accords or the refiling of suits. The 2008 amendment to the FSIA did not clearly address the Algiers Accords or the refiling of suits. The former hostages and their families tried to revive their suit based on a new exception allowing pending suits against state sponsors of terrorism to be refiled under certain conditions. They argued that the amendment conflicted with the terms of the agreement. The district court disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that the 2008 amendment to the FSIA conflicted with the Algiers Accords, stating that Congress did not provide them with a cause of action against Iran. The appellate court affirmed this decision, citing that the language in the amendment did not clearly permit the revival of the lawsuit. The statute was found to be too ambiguous to overcome the legal barrier. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in May 2012 for the ambiguous statute that failed to provide a cause of action against Iran, as per the Algiers Accords. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported favorably on a bill to compensate former American hostages in Iran, but no further action was taken. The proposed compensation fund would have paid each former hostage $150,000 plus $5,000 per day of captivity, totaling $2.37 million per hostage, with recipients required to waive all claims against Iran and the United States. The bill proposed a compensation fund for former American hostages in Iran, with each hostage potentially receiving $150,000 plus $5,000 per day of captivity. The Secretary of State would have had discretion to deny or reduce claims, with no option for legal challenge. Funding for the fund would come from a 30% surcharge on fines or penalties related to law violations. An annual report to Congress on fund status would be required. The bill proposed a compensation fund for former American hostages in Iran, funded by a 30% surcharge on fines or penalties related to law violations. Another bill introduced in the Senate, S. 868, also aimed to establish a similar fund through surcharges on violators of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The 2015 bill proposed a compensation fund for former American hostages in Iran, funded by a 30% surcharge on fines or penalties related to law violations. Payments from the fund would be administered by the plaintiffs' representative under the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury. The surcharge would apply to sanctions administered by various government departments, with the purpose of making payments to former hostages and settling their claims against Iran. The Roeder I compensation fund is for Americans taken hostage in Iran in 1979, their families, and representatives of diplomatic and military personnel seized from the US Embassy. It is unclear who qualifies for payments and how class members will be identified. Payments would be $10,000 per day for each living former hostage. The proposed bill offers compensation to former hostages and their families, with $10,000 per day of captivity for the hostage, $10,000 per day for deceased hostages' estates, and $5,000 per day for spouses and children. The bill does not cover hostages released before 1981. Recipients who accept payments from the fund cannot sue Iran for related claims. The fund would be closed out and all remaining amounts returned to the Treasury's general fund once all payments are made or five years after the bill's enactment. The Secretary of State would report to Congress within 60 days after relevant sanctions law suspension or if fund amounts are insufficient for required payments within 444 days after enactment. The Department of State Operations Authorization and Embassy Security Act, Fiscal Year 2016, includes Section 122 which limits compensation for former hostages to $6,750 per day of captivity and creates the \"American Hostages in Iran Compensation Fund\" to compensate former hostages and their families. Payments from the fund would be administered by the Secretary of State and funded by a 30% surcharge on fines imposed on Iran sanctions violators. Section 122 of the Department of State Operations Authorization and Embassy Security Act, Fiscal Year 2016, establishes the \"American Hostages in Iran Compensation Fund\" to compensate former hostages and their families. It includes provisions for monetary penalties on Iran sanctions violators and limits compensation for former hostages. The section also contains a provision to preclude judicial or administrative review of decisions made under it, raising concerns about due process implications and enforceability. The Justice for Former American Hostages in Iran Act of 2015, H.R. 33 3 8, provides compensation for former hostages and their families, including qualifying children receiving $600,000. It clarifies distribution in cases of deceased hostages without immediate heirs, exempting compensation from income and estate taxes. The bill provides compensation for former hostages and their families, exempt from income and estate taxes. Heirs may not contest decisions under the bill, which precludes judicial or administrative review. Data from various sources was used to estimate revenue from penalties related to violations of regulations with Iran from 2005-2014. The Department of Justice identified 373 penalties related to violations of sanctions against Iran, totaling $1,958,030,478.00 in forfeitures and fines in 2015. The data sets are incomplete, making it an estimate only. It is unclear which laws and regulations are included in the penalties and settlements. OFAC and the Department of Justice reported $1,958,030,478.00 in forfeitures and fines related to violations of sanctions against Iran. Large penalties, primarily against banks, accounted for the majority of the total amount. A 30% surcharge could lead to restructuring of future settlement agreements to isolate Iran-related violations. For example, the case against Credit Agricole in October 2015 involved factors that might reduce expected penalties subject to surcharge. The case against Credit Agricole in October 2015 involved factors that might reduce expected penalties subject to surcharge, such as only 16 out of 4,055 transactions violating federal economic sanctions laws involved Iranian transactions. Sanctions relief under the JCPOA could potentially decrease future penalties, especially for foreign banks."
