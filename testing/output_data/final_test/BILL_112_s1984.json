    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protect our Kids Act of 2011\". Deaths from child abuse and neglect are preventable and significantly underreported. In fiscal year 2009, approximately 1,770 children in the United States died from child abuse and neglect, with experts believing the actual number to be higher. Nearly half of these children were under the age of 1, and over 80 percent were under the age of 4. Neglect accounted for nearly 36 percent of these deaths, while physical abuse caused 23 percent. Approximately 6,000,000 children in the United States are referred to child protective services each year due to allegations of abuse and neglect. More than 36 percent of deaths from child abuse and neglect are caused by multiple forms of maltreatment. Understanding these deaths can help improve agency systems to protect children.

The Commission will review current research and documentation to identify lessons and solutions for reducing fatalities from child abuse and neglect, including tracking instances to improve child welfare.
