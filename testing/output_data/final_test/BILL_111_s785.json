    "content": "The \"Southeast Alaska Timber Industry Retooling and Restructuring Act\" aims to help entities in the timber industry in Alaska cope with the negative effects of Federal timber policy, support economic adjustment, and preserve jobs in affected communities. The Act defines \"Federal timber policy\" as any U.S. law or regulation related to the timber industry, including policies of the U.S. Forest Service and land management plans. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The Act allows the Secretary to provide grants for retooling projects to eligible entities in the timber industry in Alaska. Eligible entities include sawmills, logging companies, and road construction companies that have operated in the timber industry in Alaska for at least 10 years. SEC. 6 describes retooling projects for eligible entities in the timber industry to improve competitiveness or shift to a different business. An additional requirement is to commit to maintaining employee levels post-project. SEC. 7 outlines the application process. An eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, including a description of the retooling project, a business plan and budget, and a demonstration of project success likelihood. The Secretary will decide on grant approval within 30 days of receiving the application. If denied, the entity can reapply. After submitting an application for a grant, the eligible entity will have a chance to address any deficiencies in the application. The Secretary determines the grant amount for an eligible entity based on the approved business plan and budget for the retooling project. The grant covers 75% of the budget cost, excluding debt reimbursement, and may cover up to 100% based on community unemployment levels. The grant funds are used as determined by the Secretary based on the approved business plan and budget for the retooling project. An eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act can use it for start-up costs like equipment and training, and to reimburse debt. The grant cannot be used for ongoing operational costs. The entity can use the grant to reimburse debt regardless of whether it is held by Federal or private lenders. The eligible entity can use the grant to reimburse debt incurred for timber industry infrastructure or equipment between 1998 and 2009. The lender must certify the unamortized debt amount. Proceeds from selling the infrastructure or equipment will reduce the grant amount for debt reimbursement. The grant program under this Act will last for 2 years after the Secretary prescribes regulations. Eligible entities receiving a grant will be considered small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals for 3 years after approval. The Secretary must create regulations within 120 days of the Act's enactment for the grant program. $40,000,000 is authorized for the program in fiscal years 2010 and 2011."
