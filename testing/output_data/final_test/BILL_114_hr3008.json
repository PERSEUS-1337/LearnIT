    "content": "The Act is named the \"Sandra Day O'Connor Civic Learning Act of 2015\" and it amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by introducing Civic Learning Grants. The Secretary may award grants to promote civic learning, American history, geography, and economics. Funds must be used for programs that promote equity and access for diverse student populations. The grants aim to provide innovative and scalable programs for underserved student populations in civics, history, geography, and economics. This includes interactive online learning, service learning, and cost-effective implementation utilizing technology to meet educational standards. The grants focus on expanding active students and teachers through low-cost models, assessing program effectiveness, identifying successful techniques for underserved students, and evaluating teachers' knowledge and teaching facilities. Eligible entities are defined as nonprofit educational organizations. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of an \"eligible entity\" as a nonprofit educational organization and the redesignation of certain sections. It also mentions the amendment of section 2342 to include organizations experienced in developing curricula and programs in civics, government education, and economic education for students in countries other than the United States.
