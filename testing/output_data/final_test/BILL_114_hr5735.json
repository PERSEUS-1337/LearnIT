    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act\". Congress acknowledges that the number of people displaced by conflict in 2016 is the highest since the end of the Second World War, with almost 60 million affected. This displacement is a result of armed conflicts in various countries, leading to internal displacement, refugees, and statelessness. The majority of displaced individuals are survivors of human rights abuses, violence, and conflict, with deprivation and discrimination identified as root causes by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The crisis of displaced people is caused by poor governance, lack of access to economic benefits, conflicts, urbanization, and discrimination based on various factors. Half of the displaced population is under 18, with one in four children not receiving primary or secondary education. Displaced people spend an average of 17 years away from their home countries, leading to children growing up without access to quality education. Despite a global secondary school enrollment rate of 67%, displaced children have lower access to education. Education is crucial for displaced people, offering socioeconomic opportunities, stability, and protection. Each additional year of secondary education increases earnings by ten percent. Displaced children face barriers like cost, distance, and safety concerns in accessing education. Despite recent conflicts in Syria and Somalia, humanitarian aid for education has decreased, with less than two percent of global emergency aid allocated to educational services in 2016. Lack of education among women and girls can worsen their ability to seek employment, participate in civil society, or own assets. Girls with secondary education are less likely to marry as minors compared to those with little or no formal education. Girls not attending primary or secondary schools are vulnerable to human trafficking, sex trafficking, and sexual violence. Congress emphasizes the importance of ensuring displaced children, especially girls, have access to education and quality schooling. Women and girls' educational needs should be considered in US foreign assistance policies and programs. The United States policy aims to support displaced children's access to quality education, enhance training for governments hosting displaced people, and collaborate with international organizations and NGOs to address barriers to education. The United States policy aims to support displaced children's access to quality education, evaluate programs impact on girls regarding child marriage and gender-based violence, and coordinate with host countries to promote educational inclusion and develop innovative solutions for displaced children. The United States aims to provide assistance for educational services for displaced children. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to support programs that provide safe, quality education for displaced children, prevent discrimination in accessing education, and increase access to educational and economic opportunities for displaced children, especially girls. Coordination with multilateral organizations is also emphasized. The Secretary and the Administrator can coordinate with multilateral organizations, the private sector, and civil society to collect data on displaced people and promote safe education for displaced children. During the five-year period after this Act is enacted, reports to Congress on foreign assistance programs must include beneficiary demographics, benefits for displaced people, and educational services for displaced girls."
