The \"Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act\" defines terms like low-income family, naturally occurring contaminant, nonprofit small public water system, and poverty line. It exempts nonprofit small public water systems from standards on naturally occurring contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The \"Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act\" exempts nonprofit small public water systems from national primary drinking water regulations for naturally occurring contaminants if they demonstrate that compliance is economically infeasible or has a disproportionate impact on low-income families. The \"Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act\" exempts nonprofit small public water systems from national primary drinking water regulations for naturally occurring contaminants if compliance is economically infeasible, has a disproportionate impact on low-income families, or is unnecessary due to low health risks. Nonprofit small public water systems receiving an exemption for arsenic must comply with decreasing arsenic standards in drinking water by specific deadlines. The \"Rural Community Arsenic Relief Act\" exempts nonprofit small public water systems from national primary drinking water regulations for naturally occurring contaminants if compliance is economically infeasible, has a disproportionate impact on low-income families, or is unnecessary due to low health risks. Nonprofit small public water systems receiving an exemption for arsenic must comply with decreasing arsenic standards in drinking water by specific deadlines, with limits set at 30 parts per billion by January 1, 2011, 20 parts per billion by January 1, 2013, and 10 parts per billion by January 1, 2015. SEC. 3. UNIVERSITY-BASED ARSENIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a university-based arsenic research consortium, which will include specific universities such as the University of Nebraska, University of New Mexico, University of Texas, Johns Hopkins University, and Georgetown University. Georgetown University Medical School is part of the consortium tasked with conducting health effects studies on low levels of arsenic in various locations and developing recommendations on safe levels of arsenic in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Administrator may provide grants to the Consortium for conducting health effects studies on cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and vascular toxicity. $4,000,000 is authorized for this purpose in fiscal year 2005. The Administrator must submit an annual report to Congress on the Consortium's findings and recommendations."
