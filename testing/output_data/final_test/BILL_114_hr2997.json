These units will be part of the project-based rental assistance program or the supportive housing for persons with disabilities program. Payments under the agreement will be contingent on achieving energy or water cost savings as determined by the Secretary. The pay-for-success provision in the agreement requires payments to be contingent on documented utility savings and not exceed the utility threshold.

The agreement with an entity covers costs for third-party verification of utility consumption and savings. Performance-based agreements are limited to a maximum of 12 years. The Secretary will establish a competitive process for agreements with entities that demonstrate eligibility, including performance measures, audit protocols, cost-saving requirements, and other terms as determined appropriate. The Secretary will establish a competitive process for agreements with entities that demonstrate significant experience in financing or operating properties receiving assistance under specific programs, oversight of energy or water conservation programs, and raising capital for conservation improvements. Each agreement will include properties with regional and State variance.

The Secretary will provide a detailed plan to Congress for the implementation of the section, conduct evaluations annually, and use appropriated funds for program renewal contracts. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 14, 2015, as confirmed by Clerk Karen L. Haas."
