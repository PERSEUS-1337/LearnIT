The \"Expanding Exemptions to Enable More Public Trust Act\" or the \"EXEMPT Act\" includes amendments to Section 30113 of title 49, United States Code, allowing for easier development or field evaluation of features in highly automated vehicles providing a safety level equal to the standard for which exemption is sought. The \"EXEMPT Act\" amends Section 30113 of title 49, United States Code to allow for easier development and testing of highly automated vehicles that meet or exceed the safety standards of nonexempt vehicles. The \"EXEMPT Act\" amends Section 30113 of title 49, United States Code to allow for easier development and testing of highly automated vehicles that meet or exceed safety standards. The Act defines an \"automated driving system\" as hardware and software capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis. The \"EXEMPT Act\" amends Section 30113 of title 49, United States Code to allow for easier development and testing of highly automated vehicles that meet or exceed safety standards. It defines an \"automated driving system\" as capable of performing the dynamic driving task, including lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control, monitoring the driving environment, and more. The \"EXEMPT Act\" defines a \"highly automated vehicle\" as a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial motor vehicles. It also introduces the concept of an \"operational design domain\" as specific conditions for driving automation systems to function. The \"EXEMPT Act\" defines a \"highly automated vehicle\" as a motor vehicle with an automated driving system, excluding commercial vehicles. SAE International must notify the Secretary of any revisions to defined terms in Recommended Practice Report J3016, with the Secretary having the authority to reject definitions that do not meet safety needs or are inconsistent with the chapter's purposes. The Secretary may update definitions in subsection (a) if necessary, without following the requirements of section 553 of title 5. If the Secretary approves a revised definition by SAE International, conforming amendments will be promptly made to regulations and standards. The Secretary can update definitions in subsection (a) due to changed circumstances regarding highly automated vehicles impacting motor vehicle safety."
