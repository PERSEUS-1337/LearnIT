    "content": "The \"Military Tribunals Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of the Act. Congress finds that the al Qaeda terrorist organization has committed attacks against the United States, including the bombings of embassies and the USS COLE, and has threatened further attacks and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Taliban of Afghanistan provided a safe haven for al Qaeda to operate from. The United Nations Security Council declared the Taliban's actions as a threat to international peace and security. Following the September 11 attacks, the US was authorized to use necessary force against those involved. The United States and its allies are in armed conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban. Military trials of terrorists may be necessary to protect public safety, use classified information as evidence, and safeguard national security interests while ensuring fairness under international law. Guarantees of fairness, consistent with international law and human rights treaties, must be upheld in military tribunals. Due process, including habeas corpus and appeals, should be provided. Preliminary proceedings should determine tribunal jurisdiction. Congress, not the President, has the power to establish tribunals and define offenses against international law. Without protections and reporting requirements, detainees could be held indefinitely without recourse, risking evasion of due process. Congressional authorization is needed for extraordinary tribunals to adjudicate offenses from the 9/11 attacks and provide a legal foundation for trials. Judicial review of individual detentions is best handled by a court with a clear legal foundation, avoiding the need for special masters or magistrates for fact-finding. Establishment of extraordinary tribunals. The President is authorized to establish tribunals for non-US persons or residents who are members of al Qaeda or other terrorist organizations involved in terrorist acts against the US. Tribunals can adjudicate violations of war laws and crimes against humanity targeting US persons or residents. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall establish procedural rules for tribunals targeting crimes against humanity and violations of war laws against US persons or residents. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall establish procedural rules for tribunals targeting crimes against humanity and violations of war laws against US persons or residents. Additionally, procedural requirements will be implemented. The rules for tribunals under section 3(c) ensure a fair hearing for the accused, including independence, notification of charges, translation for non-English speakers, disclosure of evidence, presence at trial, right to counsel, and opportunity to participate. The rules for tribunals ensure a fair hearing for the accused, including the opportunity to respond to evidence, obtain exculpatory evidence, confront witnesses, present evidence, have an expeditious proceeding, apply reasonable rules of evidence, have necessary means of defense, and be convicted based on individual responsibility. The rules for tribunals guarantee a fair hearing for the accused, including the right to respond to evidence, confront witnesses, and be convicted based on individual responsibility. This includes the presumption of innocence, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, no compelled confession, open and public trial, and informing the convicted person of remedies. The rules for tribunals ensure a fair hearing for the accused, including informing them of remedies and appeals, holding a preliminary proceeding within 30 days of detention, protecting the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and requiring a tribunal comprised of a military judge and at least five members for cases involving the death penalty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The tribunal established under section 3 may impose the death penalty, with public proceedings accessible unless necessary for safety reasons. Evidence from a Federal agency can be kept confidential if it poses harm to military objectives or intelligence sources. The Secretary of Defense shall ensure prompt review of convictions by tribunals to meet procedural requirements and support evidence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will review tribunal proceedings, convictions, and sentences. The decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces regarding tribunal proceedings shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court. SEC. 5. DETENTION. The President may direct the Secretary of Defense to detain individuals subject to a tribunal under section 3, following rules consistent with international law of armed conflict. Detention is limited to periods when the US Armed Forces are in armed conflict with al Qaeda or Taliban forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere, or during investigation, prosecution, or post-trial proceedings. The President may certify ongoing circumstances under this Act for 180 days, with the ability to make successive certifications. Evidence that could prove an accused is not covered by the Act must be disclosed, unless it poses harm to military objectives, capture of individuals, or prevention of future terrorist acts. The President can certify ongoing circumstances under this Act for 180 days, with the ability to make successive certifications. Evidence must be disclosed to prove an accused is not covered by the Act, unless it poses harm to military objectives, capture of individuals, or prevention of future terrorist acts. Detainees must be treated humanely without discrimination based on various criteria. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has exclusive jurisdiction to review determinations for detaining an accused. Detainees must be treated humanely without discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria. They should be provided with adequate food, water, shelter, clothing, medical treatment, and hygiene. They must also be allowed to freely exercise their religion in detention. Congress believes the President should involve US allies and other nations in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, utilizing multilateral institutions. SEC. 7. REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The President must report to Congress every 12 months on the use of authority under this Act, detailing individuals detained under military tribunals or for acts of terrorism post-9/11 not yet tried. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The term \"September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States\" refers to the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, including the hijackings of American Airlines and United Airlines flights. The term \"United States person or resident\" includes U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The authority granted by this Act will end on December 31, 2005."
