    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Water Research and Development Initiative Act of 2008\". It establishes the National Water Research and Development Initiative. The President will implement a National Water Research and Development Initiative to improve federal water research, development, and technology transfer activities. An interagency committee will be established to oversee the Initiative, chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The interagency committee, chaired by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will include representatives from agencies conducting water-related research. Its functions include developing a National Water Research and Assessment Plan, coordinating federal water activities, and ensuring cooperation among agencies. The President will establish a National Water Initiative Coordination Office within 3 months of the Act's enactment to ensure cooperation among Federal agencies, avoid duplication of effort, facilitate technology transfer, and promote information exchange with various stakeholders. The National Water Initiative Coordination Office will provide support to the interagency committee, serve as a point of contact for water activities, and communicate findings to the public. The Office's funding will come from contributions from each agency on the interagency committee. The National Water Research and Assessment Plan will establish priorities for federal water research and assessment for a 4-year period, considering recommendations from reports like the 2007 SWAQ report. The plan, guided by the National Water Research and Assessment Plan, will identify current federal agency programs, funding levels, and strategies to achieve specific outcomes related to the Initiative. The plan, guided by the National Water Research and Assessment Plan, will outline outcomes for agencies to achieve, including the implementation of a National Water Census to collect data on national water resources. The plan will be subject to a 90-day public comment period and must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The plan aims to create a database with information on water resources, develop new monitoring techniques, technologies for reliable water supply, innovative tools for water-use efficiency, conflict resolution tools, understanding of ecosystem services, improvement of hydrologic prediction models, and analysis of energy requirements. The President will establish an advisory committee to advise the Interagency Committee on analyses of energy and water supplies in the United States. The President will provide guidance to Federal agencies on budget coordination for activities related to the plan. The President will also include descriptions of budget items in each agency's budget that are part of the plan in the annual budget request to Congress. Additionally, an annual report will be submitted. The President will submit an annual report to Congress concurrent with the budget submission, detailing the activities and outcomes of the Initiative from the previous fiscal year and outlining objectives for the next fiscal year. The report will include a comprehensive analysis of all programs and activities under the Initiative, tracking progress towards achieving the specified outcomes."
