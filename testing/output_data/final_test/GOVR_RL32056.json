    "content": "The Air Force is considering replacing 133 old Boeing KC-135E aerial refueling tankers with 100 new Boeing KC-767 tankers through a proposed lease authorized by the FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act. Congress must decide whether to approve this lease, which could impact aerial refueling capabilities, Air Force funding, and DOD acquisition practices. The report examines the lease proposal for replacing old Boeing KC-135E tankers with new Boeing KC-767 tankers. It analyzes potential oversight issues for Congress regarding the urgency of replacement, the suitability of the KC-767, industrial base concerns, cost comparison between lease and purchase, and implications for DOD acquisition oversight. The Air Force's draft Tanker Roadmap proposes to replace aging KC-135E tankers with 100 leased Boeing 767 tankers, starting in late FY2006. The roadmap also includes plans to retire 58 KC-135s in FY2004-FY2005 and another 68 in FY2006-FY2008. The draft roadmap proposes replacing aging KC-135E tankers with 100 leased Boeing 767 tankers starting in late FY2006. It also includes plans to retire 58 KC-135s in FY2004-FY2005 and another 68 in FY2006-FY2008. Additionally, a new tanker requirements study and analysis of alternatives are planned to determine future fleet needs. The current tanker fleet is unable to meet the projected requirement of 500 to 600 KC-135R tankers by 2005. The Air Force study found that the current tanker fleet is unable to meet the projected requirement of 500 to 600 KC-135R tankers by 2005 due to maintenance issues. The Economic Service Life Study (ESLS) forecasted significant cost increases for the KC-135 fleet between 2001 and 2040, but stated that there is no economic crisis on the horizon and the fleet is structurally viable until 2040. The ESLS projected that the number of available KC-135 aircraft would increase from FY2001 to FY2004 due to maintenance improvements, but then gradually decline until 2040. Three potential trends were forecasted: the most optimistic trend showed 350-375 aircraft available from 2005 to 2039, the most likely trend predicted 300-350 aircraft available from 2005 to 2035, and the worst-case trend showed a decline below 300 by 2040 if no action was taken to address availability issues. The ESLS projected a decline in KC-135 aircraft availability from approximately 330 in 2004 to 190 in 2040. The Boeing 767 has military applications, with Boeing exploring the idea since 1992. Military missions based on the old Boeing 707 design are being considered for the 767. Boeing began exploring military applications for the 767 aircraft in 1992, with missions such as airborne early warning, aerial refueling, and electronic reconnaissance being considered. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Australia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, have studied using new or used 767s as military tankers. Boeing established a business unit in 2000 to market the 767 tanker globally, leading to contracts for new tankers with Italy and Japan. In 2001, Boeing offered to sell thirty-six 767 tankers to the Air Force as a temporary solution to bolster tanker capabilities. Boeing offered to sell thirty-six 767 tankers to the Air Force as a temporary measure to bolster tanker capabilities. General Michael Ryan mentioned the offer during a hearing, and Representative Norman Dicks planned to insert an amendment to jump-start the Air Force's purchase of Boeing tankers. Air Force Secretary James Roche expressed support for leasing. Air Force Secretary James Roche supported leasing 100 767s to address the critical need for a multi-mission aircraft. The proposed lease would involve leasing each of the 100 aircraft for six years in groups starting from late FY2006 to FY2011. The Air Force planned to lease 100 aircraft in groups starting from FY2008 to FY2011. The total program cost would be $29.8 billion if all aircraft were purchased at the end of the leases. If not purchased, Wilmington Trust would sell the aircraft to pay off bondholders. The Air Force planned to lease 100 aircraft in groups from FY2008 to FY2011. If the Air Force sells the planes for more than needed to pay off bondholders, they would receive a rebate of $800 million. The number of leased aircraft grows to 100 by FY2011 and then declines to zero. Boeing would start building each group of aircraft three years before the start of the lease. Boeing would finance the construction of aircraft by drawing on a bank line of credit. The aircraft would be sold to a Special Purpose Entity, which would raise funds by issuing bonds on the commercial bond market. The entity would then lease the aircraft to the Air Force, with lease payments covering the entity's costs. The Special Purpose Entity (SPE) plans to offer three tranches of bonds secured by different assets to cover the costs of purchasing 767s for the Air Force. The \"G\" tranche, secured by lease payments, is low-risk, while the \"A\" bonds, secured by the aircraft's value, cover half of the borrowing. The Air Force plans to secure half of the borrowing with the aircraft's value, making it the second claimant in case of termination. The bonds would require a 1% interest rate above the projected Treasury rate from 2006 to 2011. The \"B\" bonds, covering 15% of the lease cost, would be backed by the potential sale of the aircraft to the Air Force at the end of the lease, making it a riskier proposition. The Air Force plans to secure half of the borrowing with the aircraft's value, making it the second claimant in case of termination. The bonds would require a 1% interest rate above the projected Treasury rate from 2006 to 2011. A more risky proposition is the purchase of the aircraft, requiring Congressional approval and an additional $4.4 billion in funding. The Air Force would have already paid 90% of the cost in lease payments, with the aircraft only used for a quarter of their normal service lives. The Air Force projects a 10% interest rate compounded to the end of each lease to attract bondholders. The SPE's main purpose is to relieve Boeing from directly leasing the 767s to the Air Force. Boeing may face financial strain from carrying construction-related debt for an extended period due to leasing 767 tankers to the Air Force. The Air Force has the option to return the planes or purchase them for an additional $44 million per plane. Legislation authorizing the lease of 100 767 tankers was provided in various defense acts. The legislation authorizing the lease of 100 Boeing 767 tankers to the Air Force departs from normal procedures for major DOD acquisition programs by specifying the acquisition method, number and type of aircraft, and exempting the lease from certain requirements and limitations. The legislation authorizing the lease of 100 Boeing 767 tankers to the Air Force departs from normal procedures for major DOD acquisition programs by specifying the acquisition method, number and type of aircraft, and exempting the lease from certain requirements and limitations. Section 8159 establishes a special congressional approval process for the lease, allowing approval through authorization and appropriation language or a new start notification approved by the four congressional defense committees. This provision is not the first allowing DOD to lease aircraft, as previous acts have permitted similar arrangements for operational support purposes. The Air Force must obtain authorization and appropriation of funds or submit a reprogramming notification approved by congressional defense committees before entering into a lease for tanker aircraft under Section 8159 of P.L. 107-117. This approval process is unique for a major procurement program, as reprogramming is typically used for minor adjustments. The lease cannot proceed until a report is submitted to the relevant committees and a 30-day period has passed. The Air Force must obtain approval from congressional defense committees before implementing a lease for tanker aircraft. A report was submitted on July 10, 2003, detailing operational requirements, costs, and basing plans for the 767s. A reprogramming notification for the lease was also submitted. Three of the four defense committees had reviewed the information by late August 2003. Three of the four congressional defense committees approved the KC-767 new start reprogramming by late August 2003. The Senate Armed Services Committee has yet to signal its approval. Key questions for policymakers include the urgency to replace KC-135s, suitability of KC-767, industrial base concerns, cost projections, and long-term budget implications. The Air Force argues for leasing 100 KC-767s to replace aging KC-135s due to high costs, low availability, premature wear, and vulnerability. Leasing may result in faster deliveries within funding limits, but policymakers must decide if the urgency to replace the fleet justifies the higher costs of leasing over purchasing. Critics suggest delaying action on new aircraft if the need is not urgent. The Air Force argues for urgent replacement of aging KC-135s with new aircraft due to rising costs, low availability, and vulnerability. Critics suggest delaying action on new aircraft to conduct a more accurate analysis of alternatives. The KC-135 is vulnerable to catastrophic problems that could ground the fleet due to rising costs and low availability. Tanker requirements and usage rates have increased post-9/11, impacting future costs projections. Air Force and DOD officials highlight higher than expected costs, especially in depot labor rates. The cost of repairing the engine struts on the KC-135Es increased from $1 million per aircraft in 2001 to $3 million per aircraft in 2002. The Air Force actually spent $2.26 billion in 2001, higher than the ESLS projected costs of $2.1 billion. Revised projections now estimate annual KC-135 O&S costs to escalate to $3.4 billion in 2040, with a 1.5% real cost growth per year and 64% cumulative cost growth by 2040. Many opponents of the KC-767 lease do not dispute the higher O&S costs incurred in 2001. Opponents of the KC-767 lease question the Air Force's linear extrapolation of costs from 2001 to 2040, arguing that the increased costs in 2001 may be a one-time anomaly. They believe the ESLS cost projections to 2040 are more reliable, as the Air Force has not provided evidence that costs will continue to rise consistently. The increased costs in 2001 were likely due to efforts to repair the KC-135 depot, and it is not guaranteed that costs will continue to increase at the same rate. Opponents of the KC-767 lease dispute the Air Force's claim that the ESLS study was overly optimistic. They argue that the ESLS took a conservative approach in projecting future KC-135 costs, including identifying necessary structural investments and accounting for potential repairs. The ESLS estimates included notional repairs that may not be needed, such as upper wing skins, fuselage skins, and unknown structures. The Air Force re-evaluated ESLS projections for KC-135 O&S costs in a 2003 study, updating data and using analytical tools to project future costs. They accepted all ESLS assumptions except for PDM estimates, aircraft modifications, and military personnel estimates. By utilizing compound growth modeling and discounting constant-year dollars into net present-value dollars, the Air Force projected O&S costs. The Air Force projected KC-135 O&S costs to be considerably higher than previously anticipated, supporting the argument for re-capitalizing the fleet sooner. The newer cost estimates suggest ongoing cost exceedances and have not yet been widely disseminated for reaction. Opponents could express dissatisfaction with the higher cost projections. The Air Force's newer cost projections for KC-135 O&S costs have raised concerns among opponents. They question the rationale behind changes in ESLS assumptions and data, as well as the credibility of the new projections due to the significant differences from previous studies. The Air Force officials argue that as KC-135 aircraft age, their mission capable rates will decline, leading to reduced availability. They advocate for the recapitalization of the fleet to meet mission requirements, with a goal of an 85 percent mission capable rate. Testimony shows that current MCRs for KC-135Rs and KC-135Es are below the target rate. The 2002 Air Force study showed that KC-135Rs had mission capable rates above 80 percent for several years, while KC-135Es had rates in the low 60s to high 70s. Despite some claims that rates are worsening, the General Accounting Office stated that mission capable rates for KC-135s are holding steady, with active duty forces generally meeting the 85 percent goal. The Air Force study in January 2003 showed that both the KC-135E and KC-135R had an 85% mission capable rate. There is debate on the reliability of short-term MCR estimates for long-term applicability, with examples like the KC-135's performance during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Lease supporters argue that the KC-135's 86.4% MCR during the conflict was not sustained over the long term. Lease opponents argue that the KC-135 fleet achieved and exceeded MCR goals during the Iraq war, with an 86.4% MCR higher than many other aircraft. They claim that the fleet's availability can be on par with or superior to other aircraft, suggesting that low MCR is not a compelling reason for premature retirement. The KC-135's maintenance history shows challenges with aging aircraft, leading to increased effort for scheduled maintenance. In 1999, 32% of the fleet was in depot, prompting the Air Force to improve depot maintenance processes. The Air Force directed efforts to improve depot maintenance for KC-135 aircraft, resulting in a significant increase in aircraft availability. Despite fewer KC-135s in depot, more maintenance work is being done, with added shifts and doubled man-hours. This success story highlights the effectiveness of reducing the number of aircraft in depot for better maintenance outcomes. The Air Force's success in reducing the number of KC-135s in depot has led to improved maintenance outcomes, but at a high cost. Critics question why depot maintenance improvements are considered a dead end when future manufacturing improvements for new aircraft are expected. For example, depot workers found cost-saving measures like conducting fuel filter checks and scrubbing fuel tanks. The Air Force's urgent need to replace the aging KC-135 fleet is due to the aircraft's susceptibility to mechanical and structural issues, potentially leading to a fleet-wide grounding. Critics question why depot workers are not discovering new maintenance improvements to prevent such events. The Air Force is concerned about the aging KC-135 fleet's susceptibility to corrosion, which could lead to a fleet-wide grounding. They lack diagnostic tools to accurately predict the extent or cost of corrosion, raising worries about the fleet's future. The Air Force is concerned about the KC-135 fleet's corrosion issues and lack of diagnostic tools. A recent crash in Germany highlighted problems with stabilizer trim actuators, leading to the grounding of 24% of the fleet for repairs. This grounding could have impacted important operations like Operation Iraqi Freedom, affecting the Air Force's ability to project power. Acquisition chief Marvin Sambur emphasized the need for caution. The Air Force is facing corrosion issues with the KC-135 fleet, causing maintenance problems. Lease opponents question the Air Force's portrayal of the problem, noting that the Navy and Marine Corps have more experience managing corrosion in their aircraft. The Air Force is facing corrosion issues with the KC-135 fleet, causing maintenance problems. Lease opponents question the Air Force's portrayal of the problem, noting that the Navy and Marine Corps have more experience managing corrosion in their aircraft. Critics question why the Air Force struggles to predict corrosion despite knowing about the issue for 40 years. They also challenge the Air Force's claims about the difficulty of predicting corrosion, citing previous statements that were more predictive. Additionally, critics believe the Air Force is exaggerating the risks and consequences of a fleet-wide grounding of the tanker fleet. The Air Force has been facing corrosion issues with the KC-135 fleet, leading to maintenance problems. Critics question the Air Force's ability to predict corrosion despite knowing about it for 40 years. They also challenge the Air Force's claims about the difficulty of predicting corrosion and believe that the risks of a fleet-wide grounding of the tanker fleet are being exaggerated. The Air Force's delay in addressing these concerns has raised questions among lease opponents. The Air Force faced corrosion issues with the KC-135 fleet, leading to maintenance problems. Critics question the Air Force's ability to predict corrosion despite knowing about it for 40 years. They challenge the Air Force's claims about the difficulty of predicting corrosion and believe the risks of fleet-wide grounding are exaggerated. Critics also argue that the Air Force successfully operated during Operation Allied Force with 40% of the fleet unavailable, showing they can manage with diminished assets. The United States participated in stabilization and humanitarian operations in Venezuela and East Timor while engaged in Kosovo. Critics argue that aircraft are frequently grounded for mechanical problems, but the KC-135 fleet is not more prone to catastrophic events than other aircraft. The post-9/11 increase in KC-135 flying hours has led to the urgency of replacing the fleet due to new military strategy and security requirements. The tanker fleet has been crucial for protecting the U.S. homeland since September 11, 2001. The KC-135 tanker fleet has been crucial for protecting the U.S. homeland and supporting global anti-terrorism operations. However, the fleet is showing signs of wear due to increased flying hours post-9/11. Proponents of leasing KC-767s argue that the aging aircraft are wearing out faster than anticipated, while opponents challenge the negative consequences. Corrosion is identified as a limiting problem with the KC-135. Corrosion is a limiting problem with the KC-135 tanker fleet. Increased flying hours may indirectly exacerbate corrosion issues by leading to deferred depot maintenance. The Air Force argues that the fleet faces new, more challenging requirements that the old fleet could not satisfy. The new military strategy outlined in the Defense Planning Guidance FY2004-09 requires the military to defend the US, deter aggression, swiftly defeat aggression in two conflicts, and win decisively against a major adversary. The Air Force emphasizes the importance of a viable tanker fleet to meet these increased requirements. Critics question the assumption that the new strategy will automatically lead to increased tanking needs. Opponents challenge the Air Force's assumption of future tanker requirements due to the lack of analysis. The Air Force believes the need for air refueling will continue to be large, but opponents argue that determining future tanker capabilities requires serious analysis. The Air Force's future tanker requirements are uncertain, with questions about the impact of unmanned aerial vehicles on refueling needs. Some suggest air ships and balloons may replace AWACS for surveillance missions, potentially affecting tanker requirements. Improved targeting and weapon technology may reduce combat needs. Improved targeting and weapon miniaturization are leading to fewer combat sorties and refueling needs. Critics argue that the Air Force can already do \"more with less\" based on past wars. Future air operations effectiveness and tanking needs are uncertain, requiring further study. Critics question the premature retirement of 68 KC-135E models. The Air Force's plan to retire 68 KC-135E models is questioned by lease opponents who argue that new tankers should be acquired in addition to the existing fleet. While Air Force officials acknowledge the risk of reduced tanker capabilities from early retirement, they emphasize the cost savings from retiring the older aircraft due to high maintenance costs. The Air Force plans to retire 68 KC-135E models to save costs and reinvest in the fleet. They consider the KC-767 lease as the most timely solution for recapitalization and improving aerial refueling capabilities for the next 50 years. The Air Force plans to retire 68 KC-135E models to save costs and reinvest in the fleet. They consider the KC-767 lease as the most timely solution for recapitalization and improving aerial refueling capabilities for at least 50 years. Additionally, there is speculation that the Air Force may lease or purchase additional KC-767 aircraft beyond the initial 100, with former defense acquisition chief Pete Aldridge suggesting that DOD plans to purchase more than the initial 100 KC-767s. Boeing officials deny any government commitment beyond the current lease agreement. Comparisons are being made regarding the KC-767's ability to meet operational requirements and how it compares to other aircraft options on the commercial market. The KC-767 is compared to surplus aircraft on the commercial market, re-engining the KC-135Es, and leasing aerial refueling services. Supporters argue that the KC-767 is more flexible and capable than the KC-135, with the ability to carry more patients and refuel aircraft more efficiently. The KC-767's integral drogue allows for quicker refueling compared to the KC-135's temporary drogue attachment process. Additionally, the KC-767 can use both the boom and drogue on the same mission, offering more versatility. The KC-767 has a larger cargo capacity than the KC-135, can operate from shorter runways, and is estimated to be more available for missions. The KC-767 has a larger cargo capacity than the KC-135 and can operate from shorter runways. Despite its modernity, the KC-767 only carries 1 percent more fuel than the KC-135, with opponents stating that maximum fuel capacity is the most important comparison between the two aircraft. The KC-767, despite its larger cargo capacity and ability to operate from shorter runways, only carries 1 percent more fuel than the KC-135. Lease opponents argue that the KC-767 does not meet important Air Force requirements, such as the ability to refuel two aircraft simultaneously with the hose-and-drogue system, which reduces its operational capabilities. The KC-767 is criticized for its inability to offload multiple types of fuel on the same mission, limiting its operational capabilities. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft use a different fuel type than the Air Force, leading to constraints in fueling options for the KC-767. The Air Force's KC-767 is criticized for its limited fuel offloading capabilities and the loss of certain desired features, such as the ability to operate from shorter runways and a \"combi\" configuration for carrying passengers and cargo simultaneously. These omissions raise questions about the aircraft's overall attractiveness compared to older models. The KC-767 is defended for meeting most ORD requirements, with the ability to offload multiple fuel types on a single mission. Supporters argue that it surpasses other aircraft options for aerial refueling, including the 747, 757, 767, 777, and A330. Critics argue that surplus commercial airliners, like the Boeing DC-10, could be converted into tankers instead of leasing the KC-767. They point out that there are over 700 surplus commercial airliners in storage facilities in the American southwest, with the KC-10 Extenders already in operation having almost twice the fuel capacity of the KC-135 and KC-767. The KC-10 Extender has 195% of the KC-135's fuel carrying capabilities, making 50 KC-10s equivalent to 100 KC-135s. It can use both refueling systems on the same mission and has a larger cargo capacity of 170,000 lbs. Buying surplus DC-10s for conversion into KC-10s offers financial advantages over the KC-767, with surplus DC-10s priced between $600,000 to $10.3 million each. The Air Force could replace 100 KC-135s with 50 more capable tankers for $2.5 billion by purchasing DC-10s for $10 million each and converting them for $40 million. Between 42 and 57 DC-10 aircraft were available for sale or lease, with at least twenty-five equipped with CF6-50C2 engines. However, the condition and remaining life of used aircraft vary, raising concerns about their suitability compared to new KC-767 fleet. The Air Force has purchased surplus commercial aircraft before, such as the 20-year-old Boeing 707s for the E-8A JSTARS development. Conversion difficulties led to the need for a more robust inspection program. The DC-10 is considered outdated technology compared to the future potential of the KC-767. The debate over re-engining KC-135E aircraft to improve performance and extend their lifespan is a cost-effective alternative to leasing new KC-767 tankers. Upgrading the engines of the KC-135Es could provide increased takeoff power, cruise speed, and other performance parameters, making it a timely solution for the Air Force's need for improved tanker capabilities. Upgrading the \"E\" fleet to R models may be a quick and cost-effective solution. The estimated cost of re-engining 127 KC-135Es is $3.6 billion, much lower than leasing the KC-767 at $17.2 billion. This approach also saves money by avoiding projected maintenance costs on old engines. Maintenance costs for the KC-135E are 20 times higher than the R-Model, making re-engining a financially sound investment. The Air Force opposes re-engining the KC-135E fleet, citing lack of funding requests since 1993. Congress and DOD have allocated funds to upgrade 2 E Models to R Models annually at a cost of $29 million per aircraft. This move is supported by cost savings, performance improvements, and the elimination of maintenance issues like corrosion of engine struts. The Air Force argues against re-engining the KC-135Es due to limited candidates for upgrade, lack of addressing the aging fleet issue, and decreased availability of air refueling tankers during high demand periods. The Air Force argues against re-engining the KC-135E fleet due to concerns about degraded mission-capable rates, unresolved maintenance issues, limited economic benefits, and exacerbation of the recapitalization problem. Converting E-models to R-models does not satisfy recapitalization requirements, only postpones them with a significant investment. Critics suggest leasing tanker services as an alternative to purchasing or leasing aircraft for the Air Force. The Navy has successfully contracted tanker services without owning or leasing aircraft. The Navy and the United Kingdom are considering leasing tanker services from private firms instead of owning or buying aircraft. This approach would provide quick augmentation of tanking capabilities and avoid certain costs. The RAF would own the services of the fleet for 27 years, but not the aircraft themselves, which are likely to be 767s. The vendor would technically own the aircraft and make them available for third-party usage when not needed by the RAF. The Air Force is considering leasing tanker services to address high operations tempo and crew shortages. Critics question why outsourcing hasn't been applied to aerial refueling like in the Navy. Supporters argue that private refueling services are limited due to insurance challenges. The Air Force is considering leasing tanker services to address high operations tempo and crew shortages. Critics question why outsourcing hasn't been applied to aerial refueling like in the Navy. Supporters argue that private refueling services are limited due to insurance challenges, as companies struggle to get insurance for aircraft flying into war zones and private pilots may be hesitant to fly into contested areas. Additionally, there are concerns about the limited number of companies willing to engage in such business and the inability of most private companies to refuel Air Force aircraft. While there may be niche applications for leasing tanker services, it is not seen as a replacement for fleet recapitalization. Outsourcing and privatization have their applications, but there are limitations in certain dimensions. The Air Force argues for the immediate implementation of the KC-767 lease to prevent the closure of Boeing's production line and support the company during economic hardship. Combat systems like tanker aircraft should be operated directly by the military for effectiveness and reliability. The Air Force urges immediate action on the KC-767 lease to save Boeing's production line. The backlog of 767 orders can sustain production until February 2006. Production rate is currently below the minimum sustainable level. Boeing's production backlog of 31 commercial 767s can sustain production until February 2006 at the current rate of 1 aircraft per month. However, the future viability of the 767 production line is uncertain due to weak market demand and competition from the Airbus A330. Boeing is developing the 7E7 Dreamliner, expected to enter service in 2008, which may impact 767 sales. The production of the civilian 767 is projected to continue at a rate of 12-15 aircraft per year until mid-2008. Lease opponents argue there is no urgency to lease the KC-767 as it could be available to the Air Force until at least 2006 or even 2008. Lease supporters believe the Air Force must move more quickly than planned, as the 767 may not remain in production that long and there is no guarantee the production line will stay open until 2006. Boeing's profit margin from building 767s at a slow rate is small, leading to speculation about shutting down the production line before 2006. Critics view the leasing deal as a financial lifeline for Boeing, highlighting the job creation and preservation benefits of constructing 100 new airplanes. Boeing, a major player in the aerospace industry, employs 166,000 workers and generates over $54 billion in sales, supporting numerous other companies in the supply chain. Boeing, a major player in the aerospace industry, employs many thousands of employees in companies that supply parts, components, and services to its operations. Ranked No. 15 in the Fortune 500 and No. 104 in the Financial Times Global 500 lists, Boeing faces competition from Airbus in the civil aviation industry and Lockheed Martin in the defense sector. Recently, Boeing restructured its corporate organization by moving its headquarters to Chicago and combining its military aircraft and space units into Integrated Defense Systems. Boeing has restructured its organization by integrating its military aircraft and space units into Integrated Defense Systems, focusing on areas such as satellite communications, space imaging, flight services, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The delivery of 100 new 767 Tankers to the United States Air Force is expected to have a positive impact on corporate profits. Boeing delivered approximately $25 billion worth of aircraft in 2002, including 379 airframes with 35 being 767s. The KC-767 program is not critical to Boeing Commercial Aircraft but is important for one of the company's civil aircraft assembly lines. The KC-767 program is important for one of Boeing's civil aircraft assembly lines. A report by Morgan Stanley Research compared the profit of selling a Boeing KC-767 with other commercial jet aircraft, showing that each KC-767 could generate seven times the profit of a Boeing 737. Comparing the KC-767 with a civil 767, it may generate profits equal to approximately three to four 767s. Boeing has agreed to cap its operating profit margin at 15% of the converted tanker sale price. Boeing's actual price for a 767-200ER varies based on configuration and features selected by the customer. Price quotes can be found on their website. Airlines can negotiate prices and often receive discounts. An order for 100 767 aircraft converted to tankers is expected to create jobs at Boeing and its suppliers. Boeing's recent job losses have been significant since 1997, with employment dropping from over 117,500 in 1998 to 89,400 by the end of 2001. However, a new program is expected to create approximately 39,000 new jobs at Boeing and its component makers. By the end of 2001, Boeing announced layoffs of around 30,000 workers due to the post-September 11 impact on the airline industry. In 2002, the Commercial Airplanes unit had 66,500 employees, a decrease of 22,900 from the previous year and a total loss of over 59,000 jobs since 1998. This decline in employment represents a significant loss in wages and jobs nationwide. If the anticipated 11,000 positions had been filled in 2002, only half of the lost jobs would have been reinstated. Boeing's Commercial Airplanes unit had 66,500 employees in 2002, a decrease of 22,900 from the previous year. The addition of 11,000 hypothetical jobs would only reinstate slightly less than half of the positions lost in that year. It is uncertain if all these jobs will be new, or if some may come from the 747 production line. If the 747 production line is shut down, skilled labor could be transferred to the 767 production line, potentially reducing the need for new workers. The Air Force report compares the cost of acquiring aircraft through leasing versus purchasing. Leasing the 767s would be about $150 million, or 1%, more expensive than purchasing them. The difference in cost is presented as a single answer in the report. The Air Force report highlights the $150 million cost difference between leasing and purchasing 767s. Various key variables and assumptions impact the cost comparison, such as the use of a multi-year procurement arrangement, discount rate, payment schedule, inflation consideration, and interest rates for bonds. The Air Force report discusses key factors affecting the cost analysis of leasing vs. purchasing 767s, including the use of multi-year procurement, interest rates for bonds, and imputed government self-insurance costs. These factors could significantly impact the NPV analysis results. The Air Force chose annual contracting over multi-year procurement for the 767s due to the lack of a stable design and Congress not authorizing MYP for the program. This decision potentially cost the government several hundred million dollars according to NPV analysis. Supporters of the idea that the Air Force should have used a multi-year procurement (MYP) approach for the 767s argue that it would have been more cost-effective. They believe that the leasing option approved by Congress should have been compared to an MYP option to ensure a fair comparison of costs. Supporters of the lease view it as an innovation in defense acquisition, while opponents argue that the 767 lease sets a precedent due to the larger number of aircraft involved and the high total cost. The lease for the 767s involved a large number of aircraft and a high total cost. Congress exempted the Air Force from full funding liability in case of cancellation and established a special process for lease approval. Opponents argue that Congress's approval of the lease signals a willingness to consider novel acquisition approaches. Using a multi-year procurement (MYP) for the 767s could be seen as less irregular than the leasing arrangement. Congress's approval of the lease for the 767s suggests openness to novel acquisition approaches. Congress has granted DOD multi-year contracting authority for major acquisition programs in the past, such as the special block-buy authority for Virginia-class submarines. This authority allowed the Navy to sign a single contract for four submarines over a five-year period, with a combined estimated cost of over $10 billion. The Navy requested multi-year procurement authority for Virginia-class submarines before the completion of the first boat, showing a precedent for such requests. The Navy requested multi-year procurement authority for Virginia-class submarines before the completion of the first boat, showing a precedent for such requests. The Navy argues that the relatively small number of design changes during the lead ship's construction is sufficient to demonstrate the stability of the Virginia-class design. The Navy assumed the use of MYP in the Virginia-class program cost calculation, which would have triggered the Nunn-McCurdy provision if not approved by Congress. This decision was made despite the program not yet completing the first boat. The Navy requested MYP authority for a new version of the Tactical Tomahawk cruise missile, which is more cost-effective and different from the older version. Production began in FY2002, with construction starting at the subcontractor level in 2003. Construction of the Tactical Tomahawk missiles is set to begin at the subcontractor level in 2003, with assembly scheduled for 2004. The Navy requested MYP authority for the program despite ongoing testing and delays in production. The 767 tanker design is based on the Boeing 767 commercial airliner, offering design stability comparable to the Virginia-class submarine and Tactical Tomahawk cruise missile. Boeing has extensive experience building the 767 airliner and is converting it into a tanker for Italy and Japan. The MYP arrangement may be delayed, and Congress could wait until the 21st plane to grant authority. The Air Force officials stated that using MYP for procurement is not feasible due to budget constraints, as it would require more funding upfront for 767 tanker components. The debate on whether to assume MYP for cost calculations remains unresolved. One argument is that the 767 tanker procurement option could utilize MYP, incremental funding, and possibly delay EOQ purchase to reduce near-term funding requirements and total procurement costs. Deferring the EOQ purchase would impact MYP savings but address the Air Force's need to minimize immediate funding. The use of MYP in the 767 tanker procurement could defer EOQ purchases, reducing near-term funding requirements and total costs. Opponents argue that an incrementally funded MYP would set a precedent and violate defense procurement policies. Congress altered the Air Force's proposed funding profile for the C-17 program in the FY2003 budget request. Supporters argue that Congress reinforced the full funding policy for MYP programs, but the 767 program may be exempt due to novel acquisition approaches considered for leasing. An incrementally funded MYP with delayed EOQ purchase could be seen as less irregular than the leasing arrangement. Supporters of an incrementally funded MYP argue that it could be less irregular than the leasing arrangement. Examples of incremental funding in major DOD acquisition programs include the Navy's use of incremental funding for the procurement of an amphibious assault ship called LHD-8 and a new aircraft carrier called CVN-21. The Navy has used incremental funding for major acquisition programs like the CVN-21 aircraft carrier, which is a very expensive ship. The Department of Defense utilized incremental funding in the 1990s for military sealift ships procured through the National Defense Sealift Fund. Future ships, such as the Navy Lewis and Clark class auxiliary cargo ships, could also be built using a similar funding approach. The procurement of 767s could potentially be moved to a DOD budget account outside the procurement title of the defense appropriations act, avoiding the full funding policy. Congress previously established a National Defense Airlift Fund for C-17 aircraft procurement, indicating a willingness to consider new approaches for the 767s. The Air Force is considering new approaches for the procurement of 767s, such as incremental funding. Using Multiyear Procurement (MYP) could reduce costs by about $900 million on a Net Present Value (NPV) basis. This estimate is based on a 7.4% reduction in cost, derived from a RAND Corporation report on previous uses of MYP in DOD programs. Excluding extreme cases, the average savings rate was 7.4%, with potential savings ranging from 5.4% to 10%. The remaining 10 cases varied between 5.4% and 10%. Applying MYP to the 767 procurement option could reduce costs by as much as $1.2 billion or as little as $660 million on an NPV basis. Using a delayed or no EOQ would result in a smaller cost reduction. OMB Circular A-94 provides guidance on discount rates for NPV analysis based on U.S. Treasury yields. The OMB Circular A-94 instructs agencies to use the Treasury borrowing rate on marketable securities of comparable maturity for NPV analysis. The Air Force considered three alternatives for the discount rate: a six-year rate, a nine-year rate, and a 15-year rate. They settled on using a nine-year rate, calculated by interpolating between the seven-year and 10-year rates. The Air Force used a nine-year Treasury bond rate for NPV calculation, but CRS analysis suggests using a Treasury bond rate with an average maturity of 3.5 to 4 years. Using a shorter maturity rate would favor the procurement option by an additional $520 million to $610 million. The interest rates in Table 5 may be too low, favoring the leasing arrangement with higher rates. If government borrowing rates increase, corporate rates would also rise, offsetting some advantages of leasing. The Air Force used a 15/30/30/25 progress payment schedule for the procurement option cost estimation. The Air Force used a 15/30/30/25 progress payment schedule for the procurement option, mirroring the schedule used in discussions of the lease option. This ensures a more accurate cost comparison between the two options. The procurement option should be modeled using a progress payment schedule that reflects actual progress payment schedules used in previous Air Force aircraft procurement programs. An alternative \"compressed\" schedule of 10/24.5/43.5/22 would shift progress payments into later years, reducing the NPV of the procurement option compared to the 15/30/30/25 schedule. The Air Force calculated progress payments for the procurement option to include inflation, aligning with the lease option's cost calculation method for a fair comparison. The Air Force calculated progress payments for the procurement option to include inflation, aligning with the lease option's cost calculation method for a fair comparison. This method would favor the procurement option by an additional $500 million. Comparing the costs of leasing and procurement options involves assumptions about interest rates for bonds floated by a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) to purchase 767s from Boeing. Higher or lower interest rates would impact lease payments and total costs. The proposed approach for implementing the 767 lease involves floating three kinds of bonds with different interest rates based on risk levels. The assumed interest rates for the G bonds range from 5.70% to 5.91%, while the A bonds have rates increased by 100 basis points. The interest rates for A bonds were assumed to be 5.84%-6.04% during FY2006-FY2011, while B bonds had a 10% rate based on high-yield corporate bonds. Actual rates will vary, impacting the lease cost shown in the Air Force report. The Air Force report assumed interest rates for different bonds, impacting the lease cost. If actual rates differ by 50 basis points, the cost could be $270 million higher or lower. Congress may question the analytical basis for deriving these rates and consider alternative approaches. Economic changes since 2003 could also affect the projected federal borrowing needs. The Air Force report considered interest rates for bonds, impacting lease costs. Differences in actual rates could result in a $270 million cost variation. Congress may question the rate derivation and consider alternative approaches. Economic changes since 2003 could impact federal borrowing needs. The Air Force report assumes a construction-financing cost included in lease prices for each airplane, with an average lease price of $138.4 million per plane. Actual interest rates for construction loans will impact lease costs, potentially higher or lower than assumed in the report. This sensitivity could affect the NPV cost calculation significantly. The sensitivity of NPV cost calculation to actual interest rates for construction loans can significantly impact the total cost of the lease. The inclusion of Imputed Self-Insurance Cost in the procurement option adds to the 767 lease option's total cost. The government may choose to self-insure the risk of losing one or more 767s if they are procured instead of leased, as per OMB Circular A-94. This incurs no immediate cost, but an imputed self-insurance cost is included in the procurement option to account for potential losses during operation. The government may incur a self-insurance cost if they choose to procure 767s instead of leasing them. The estimated cost is $100 million on an NPV basis, which is included in the procurement option for potential losses during operation. The government's self-insurance cost for procuring 767s could exceed $100 million on an NPV basis due to the risk of losing aircraft. Methodological uncertainties could result in costs higher or lower than $100 million, impacting the comparison between leasing and procurement options. The Air Force's proposed tanker lease with Boeing for 100 aircraft over fifteen years is under scrutiny for its unusual funding method, bypassing traditional approval processes. The lease is seen as a cost-effective way to acquire aircraft upfront, but critics question its unprecedented approach. The proposed tanker lease with Boeing for 100 aircraft over fifteen years is facing scrutiny for its unconventional funding method, which goes against established laws and regulations for defense procurement. The lease raises concerns about locking in significant budget resources without certainty about long-term budgets, potentially leading to necessary trade-offs in the future. The proposed tanker lease with Boeing for 100 aircraft over fifteen years raises concerns about locking in funding with uncertain costs and potential trade-offs in the future. The Air Force's decision to lease rather than purchase adds volatility to the program's cost and may lead to higher overall expenses. Critics question if the lease complies with statutory requirements and OMB rules for operating leases. The K767 tanker proposal raises concerns about categorization as an operating lease versus a capital lease. If classified as a capital lease, DOD would need to budget $11.6 billion upfront. Use of a Special Purpose Entity reduces visibility and masks the government's financial commitment. Critics question the lease's compliance with statutory requirements and OMB rules. The proposed lease for the K767 tanker raises concerns about the government's financial commitment being masked by using a Special Purpose Entity. Critics question the pricing based on \"fair market value\" and lack of competition in the negotiation process. The lease exempts the Air Force from budgeting for potential termination, deviating from full-funding of the government's contractual liability. The tanker lease exempts the Air Force from budgeting for potential termination liability, bypassing the Anti-Deficiency Act. Analysis compares costs using net present value and current year dollars. Locking in substantial resources amid uncertain long-term budgets is discussed. Locking in the tanker lease program over the next 15 years could squeeze other programs due to uncertain long-term budgets and potential Congressional opposition. Budgetary pressures on Air Force programs could be substantial beyond 2008, making future funding decisions challenging. The Air Force's decision to opt for a lease over a buy for the tanker program is more expensive, with the lease costing $3.9 billion or 19% more than a non-multi-year buy. The lease would be over 30% more costly when compared to the non-multiyear buy. The Air Force cites resource constraints as the reason for choosing the lease, as it would only require $5.5 billion from FY2003 through FY2009 compared to $17.0 billion for a non-multiyear buy. The Air Force's decision to opt for a lease over a buy for the tanker program is more expensive, with the lease costing $3.9 billion or 19% more than a non-multi-year buy. The lease would be over 30% more costly when compared to the non-multiyear buy. From FY2009 to FY2017, the lease would require $19.9 billion compared to $3.7 billion for the non-multiyear buy. The Air Force's investment programs are projected to increase sharply beyond 2009, with growing budget pressures due to purchases of new fighter aircraft, intelligence systems, and a tanker lease. Future investments may include a successor to the B-2 bomber and a replacement for the Minuteman missile, with projected annual investment growing from $58 billion in 2009 to an average of $64 billion. Force investment would need to increase from $58 billion in 2009 to an average of $64 billion annually between 2010 and 2020 in 2004 dollars for all planned Air Force programs. Funding such increases could be challenging if defense budget growth slows down. The retirement of the baby boom generation could lead to pressures to limit defense spending in the long term. If the tanker lease is approved, operating leases may become more common. The Air Force's $24.6 billion estimate for program costs may be unrealistic, but they are likely to purchase the plane. Despite needing to request funds from Congress, observers believe a purchase is probable as the Air Force plans to retire older aircraft. The aircraft's useful life extends beyond the lease period, with most of its value already paid for. The Air Force is likely to purchase all 100 planes despite the $29 billion total program cost. Changes in interest rates could significantly impact program costs, with financing costs representing 19% of the total lease cost. Bonds floated in 2006 could see changes in costs in response to economic conditions. When the bonds are floated in 2006 for the 767 Tanker Lease Program, changes in interest rates could impact financing and total costs. A shift of plus or minus .5% or 1.5% could increase or decrease the cost of the lease by $400 million or $1.4 billion in current year dollars. The Air Force's decision to lease the aircraft instead of purchasing it raises concerns about compliance with regulations and the appropriateness of using an operating lease. Critics question if the lease aligns with statutory requirements and whether it meets the criteria for distinguishing between operating and capital leases. The government has guidelines for analyzing the cost trade-offs between operating leases and purchases. The Air Force tanker deal debate focuses on using an operating lease instead of a straight buy, which would require upfront budgetary authority under current rules. The Air Force tanker deal debate revolves around whether the proposal meets the criteria for an operating lease, as outlined in OMB Circular A-11. The ownership of the asset, absence of a bargain-basement purchase option, lease term duration, and present value of the minimum costs are key factors in determining if the deal qualifies as an operating lease. The criteria for an operating lease, as outlined in OMB Circular A-11, include the asset's economic life, lease payments, fair market value, general-purpose nature, and existence of a private-sector market. These criteria aim to prevent federal agencies from using operating leases to eventually purchase assets, limit lease length and fair market value, and ensure leased items have a commercial market. The government prefers leasing items with a commercial market to ensure reasonable prices. The tanker deal in the DOD's 2002 Appropriation Act requires the Air Force to accept and return aircraft in a general-purpose configuration, not authorizing purchase. The lease should not include modifications unless separate authority is granted. This ensures compliance with OMB criteria for a \"general purpose asset.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee intended for the tanker lease to be used for an operating lease, with the statutory language being expanded in conference. Senator Inouye agreed that a general purpose aircraft, capable of various functions and available to both government and private customers, meets the definition of a general purpose asset. This implies that even if the Air Force modified the aircraft for military use, it could still be considered a general purpose asset. The Boeing 767 was modified for military use as an air refueling aircraft, but could still be considered a \"commercial\" item for operating leases. Senator Roberts pointed out that Italy and Japan have purchased modified 767 aircraft as tanker aircraft. Some in the Administration and Congress questioned if the proposed lease meets OMB's criteria for an operating lease, particularly regarding ownership transfer after the lease ends. The Air Force claims that a Special Purpose Entity, Wilmington Trust, owns the asset. The Air Force states that a Special Purpose Entity, Wilmington Trust, technically owns the aircraft under a lease agreement. The lease allows for the return of the aircraft after six years, but the Air Force can buy the planes at any time with authorization and funds. Wilmington Trust is considered a \"governmental\" entity under revised regulations, and the contract allows the government to purchase the aircraft at any point during the lease. The lease price makes buying the aircraft after the lease attractive as the Air Force would have already paid 90% of the fair market value. The Air Force has already paid 90% of the fair market value for the aircraft and will have a continuing need for them. The lease allows the Air Force to purchase the aircraft for $44 million per aircraft or 10% of the fair market value. The lease does not exceed 75% of the economic life of the aircraft and the present value of the lease payments does not exceed 90% of the fair market value. Additionally, the Air Force estimates that the aircraft could be sold as freighters for about $51 million per aircraft at the end of the lease. The Air Force argues that its lease payments for the KC-767 tanker are 89.9% of the initial fair market value, just below the 90% threshold. However, if the price of the aircraft is considered without construction financing, the lease payments would breach the threshold. The 767 was commercially developed and critics question the value of customer-specific equipment added to the tanker configuration in the lease. The Air Force's lease for the KC-767 tanker is priced higher than a commercial 767, with critics questioning the need for customer-specific equipment. The Air Force argues there is a potential market for the tanker in multiple countries and commercial buyers, but critics doubt the demand for 100 aircraft at the high cost. The Air Force's reliance on a special purpose entity (SPE) for the tanker lease has raised concerns about obscuring the total cost and financial risks to the government, making it difficult for decision makers to assess cost-effectiveness. Budget scoring rules did not anticipate government use of SPEs, allowing agencies to argue that full program costs should not be considered government liabilities. Wilmington Trust, the SPE in this case, is considered an \"extension of the government\" by the CBO, with no real distinction between the trust and the government. The Air Force's use of a special purpose entity (SPE) for the tanker lease raises concerns about obscuring total costs and financial risks to the government. Budget rules are ambiguous about identifying government liabilities in public/private ventures, allowing agencies to avoid showing the full cost of obligations. The CBO estimates that federal agencies have launched programs without fully accounting for government liabilities, such as the DOD using public/private ventures for military housing. OMB revised its scoring rules in reaction to the tanker lease, specifying that any public/private partnership benefiting the government through leasing back assets would be considered a capital lease. The CBO and OMB have revised scoring rules for leases, with the net present value of lease payments scored upfront. The Air Force tanker lease would likely be considered a capital lease under these new rules. CBO proposes authorizing all leases individually to ensure budgetary considerations. The Air Force had two options for approval of the lease proposal, choosing the simpler route. Some observers question if the proposed lease is a good deal for the government due to lack of competition. The Air Force's lease price is higher than commercial rates, as highlighted by John Plueger's testimony on commercial leases. The Air Force's proposed lease for the 767 tanker is questioned for being higher than commercial rates, with estimates ranging from $59 million to $95 million per aircraft per six-year lease, which is 35% to 57% of its value. This raises concerns about why the Air Force would negotiate a lease at 90% of the aircraft's market value. The Air Force negotiated a lease for the 767 tanker at 90% of the aircraft's value to minimize loan repayment to bondholders and financing costs. The lease price was not based on usage but aimed to facilitate aircraft purchase at the end of the lease. The proposed contract includes hefty cancellation penalties, potentially complicating lease termination. The proposed contract for the 767 tanker lease includes substantial penalties for cancellation, making it difficult for the Air Force to cancel. The Air Force would be liable for special payment or penalty charges equivalent to an additional year's lease costs, estimated at about $2.7 billion. Additionally, the Air Force would be responsible for unamortized costs incurred by the contractor on aircraft planned but not yet built. The exact costs for these unamortized expenses have not been estimated by the Air Force. The Air Force faces substantial penalties for canceling the proposed 767 tanker lease, including special payment charges equivalent to an extra year's lease costs. Comparing the cost of the lease to a multiyear buy shows a significant gap in present value and current dollars. Various assumptions, such as progress payment rates and inflation calculations, impact the cost comparison. The Air Force would pay a premium of 19% to 27% more for a lease compared to a multiyear buy, resulting in a cost difference of $3.9 billion to $5.7 billion. Opting for a lease allows for lower payments in earlier years but could purchase about 35 more tankers if the lease dollars were spent on aircraft instead. The Air Force's decision to opt for a lease for tanker aircraft involves lower payments and a subsequent purchase of the aircraft with lower inflation, insurance, and progress payments. This choice deviates from the traditional full-funding approach for potential termination liabilities, exempting the Air Force from budgeting for such costs. This exemption is a significant departure from longstanding government policy and poses challenges in ensuring compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act. The proposed tanker lease contract allows the Air Force to make special payments for cancellation, with termination liabilities exceeding $2.7 billion in 2011. Congress authorized an exemption for funding termination liabilities, similar to multiyear procurement statutes. The proposed tanker lease contract allows the Air Force to make special payments for cancellation, with termination liabilities exceeding $2.7 billion in 2011. DOD's multi-year programs require specific authorization and budgetary resources to be set aside, meeting criteria for substantial savings, stable requirements, realistic cost estimates, and funds reserved for future years. These rules aim to balance the loss of budget flexibility and exemption from funding termination liability with benefits to the government. The DOD must ensure low programmatic risks and significant savings to offset the loss of flexibility in long-term commitments. Multi-year procurements require specific authorization and budgetary review, with funds allocated for annual contract portions and efficiency improvements. Congress provided special authorities for the tanker lease, exempting the Air Force from budgeting for termination liability. The Air Force must submit reports outlining contract terms, expected savings, and wait 30 days before signing. The Air Force must adhere to specific requirements for leasing aircraft, including a 30-day waiting period before signing a contract, limitations on total payments, and restrictions on modifications without authorization. The statutory authority for leasing aircraft was provided in various DOD Appropriations Acts. The FY2002 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-117) authorizes the Air Force to lease up to 100 Boeing 767s in a commercial configuration, exempting them from standard lease requirements if a report is submitted to Congress and a 30-day waiting period is observed. The Air Force is authorized to lease Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 aircraft in commercial configuration, with certain terms and conditions specified. The lease term cannot exceed 10 years, and special payments may be provided if the lease is terminated early. The Secretary is authorized to lease aircraft under specific terms and conditions, with the lease term not exceeding 10 years. The lease transactions are subject to certain regulations, and a report outlining the plans for implementing the Pilot Program must be submitted to the congressional defense committees before lease arrangements can commence. The Secretary is authorized to lease aircraft under specific terms and conditions, with the lease term not exceeding 10 years. A report must be submitted to the congressional defense committees describing the status of the Pilot Program annually. The Air Force shall accept delivery of the aircraft in a general-purpose configuration, and the aircraft may be returned in the same configuration at the end of the lease term. The total payments over the lease duration shall not exceed 90% of the fair market value of the aircraft. The authority granted to the Secretary of the Air Force allows for leasing up to 100 Boeing 767 aircraft and 4 Boeing 737 aircraft under specific conditions. No modifications to the commercial configuration are allowed without separate authorization, and ownership transfer to the Air Force is prohibited. This authority is separate from other procurement methods and must not exceed 90% of the fair market value of the aircraft. Title 10 U.S. Code Sections 2401 and 2401a govern DoD leases of aircraft and ships, requiring termination liability, specific authorization, disclosure to defense committees, cost analysis, and guidelines for leasing vs. purchasing ships. The U.S. Code provides guidelines for leasing and purchasing ships and aircraft, with specific rules for unobligated balances and fund availability after account closure. Section 1553(b)(1) allows funds to be drawn for obligations that were properly chargeable before account closure. The FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act exempts aircraft leases authorized by Section 8159 from the Berry amendment, allowing DOD to acquire aircraft from non-U.S. sources if in the public interest. The FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act exempts aircraft leases authorized by Section 8159 from the Berry amendment, allowing DOD to acquire aircraft from non-U.S. sources if in the public interest. Congress enacted Section 308 of P.L.107-206 to clarify Berry Amendment restrictions on the use of foreign sourced specialty metals in commercial aircraft to be leased under the Multi-Year Aircraft Lease Pilot Program. This was done to address the unique financial and time-sensitive requirements of the aircraft lease arrangement and the administrative complexity involved in making Berry Amendment determinations on a plane-by-plane basis for over 100 aircraft built under commercial practices. The FY2003 DOD Appropriations Act, P.L. 107-248, allows the Air Force to make advance lease payments for air refueling tanker replacement aircraft. It also permits the use of operation and maintenance funds for lease payments, exempting the Air Force from budgeting for termination payments. Multiyear procurement is also exempt from budgeting for termination liability. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act allows for advance lease payments for air refueling tanker replacement aircraft. Payments for leases can be made from operation and maintenance funds at the time the lease takes effect, exempting the Air Force from budgeting for termination payments. The FY2003 DOD Authorization Act, P.L. 107-314 Section 133, amends Section 8159 to require approval for the lease of tanker aircraft for the Air Force through either authorization and appropriation of funds by law or approval from congressional defense committees for reprogramming funds. The FY2003 DOD Authorization Act, P.L. 107-314 Section 133, amends Section 8159 to require approval for the lease of tanker aircraft for the Air Force until the Secretary submits a report and funds are authorized or appropriated by law. This is similar to the FY2000 defense appropriations act, P.L. 106-79, which allowed the Air Force to lease aircraft for operational support purposes. Net present value (NPV) analysis is used in these cases. Net present value (NPV) analysis is a method used by businesses and governments to compare costs by considering the time value of money. It adjusts the value of future sums of money to account for the investment value of money over time. Governments, including executive branch agencies, use NPV analysis to compare spending options involving payments in different years. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to use NPV analysis for cost comparisons in leasing and procurement decisions. This guidance is outlined in OMB circular A-94. The OMB circular A-94 provides guidance for executive branch agencies on using NPV analysis to compare leasing and procurement options. NPV analysis considers the time value of money, making it a fairer method for comparison. Other alternatives to NPV analysis include nominal and real cost comparisons. Nominal cost comparisons are least favorable to leasing options, while real cost comparisons tend to be more favorable. Cost comparisons favor leasing options differently depending on the method used: nominal comparisons are least favorable, real comparisons are somewhat more favorable, and NPV comparisons are the most favorable. An example involving procuring or leasing four airplanes illustrates these differences. Under the leasing option, the planes would be leased for five years with annual payments, while under the procurement option, the planes would be purchased with two annual payments. Inflation and rate of return are also considered in the analysis. The cost comparison between leasing and procurement options is affected by inflation and rate of return on investments. In a nominal calculation, the lease option appears $40 more expensive, but in a real calculation adjusting for inflation, the cost difference reduces to $23.83. The cost comparison between leasing and procurement options is affected by inflation and rate of return on investments. In a nominal calculation, the cost difference reduces from $40 to $23.83. When considering the investment value of money over time, the difference further decreases to $2.86. This adjustment accounts for a 5% annual return on investment. The NPV analysis compares the procurement and lease options. NPV values show the financial equivalence of different spending scenarios. Discount rates adjust future money values. Rates can be nominal or real, reflecting inflation. Multi-year procurement (MYP), also known as multi-year contracting, is authorized by Congress for select DoD programs under 10 U.S.C. 2306b. Key differences from annual contracting include the duration of purchases, authority for Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) purchases, and termination liabilities. Multi-year procurement (MYP) allows DoD to sign contracts covering two to five years of planned purchases, including initial year's funding and future years' budgets. For example, DoD may plan to procure 40 airplanes over five years in varying quantities. Under MYP, DoD can sign a contract covering up to 5 years of planned purchases for a total of 40 airplanes in annual quantities. This allows for Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) purchasing authority, unlike annual contracting. EOQ authority under MYP allows for batch purchases of components to reduce costs compared to annual contracting. Programs approved for MYP are expected to take advantage of EOQ purchases to generate savings. In FY2004, funding for 40 sets of landing gear was included in the budget for a program that also procured 4 planes. Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contracts can have larger termination liabilities to protect contractors in case of DoD changes. Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) contracts have larger termination liabilities to compensate contractors for investments in workforce optimization and production equipment. This deters DoD from changing its mind and gives contractors confidence in DoD fulfilling its MYP commitment. MYP programs still adhere to the full funding policy for defense procurement. Multi-Year Procurement (MYP) programs require full funding each year for procurement, including up-front EOQ purchases. This funding structure ensures that all costs for items procured under MYP contracts are covered in the respective fiscal years, reducing overall procurement costs. Using MYP reduces procurement costs by providing the prime contractor with confidence to invest in workforce optimization and production equipment, which would not be justifiable under annual contracting due to uncertainty. This reduces risk for the contractor and allows for cost-saving investments that require producing a minimum number of units over several years. Investments in workforce optimization under MYP involve extra training for workers to improve productivity and retaining highly productive workers. Improved production equipment investments include purchasing new tools for quicker, more accurate, and less wasteful component production. Savings from MYP usage typically reduce procurement costs by 5% to 10%, with a significant portion attributed to utilizing EOQ authority. If MYP is used for a DoD procurement program, the savings in procurement costs may be smaller than the typical 5% to 10%. Congress grants authority for MYP sparingly due to a preference to avoid committing future Congresses to a specific course of action. MYP effectively ties the hands of future Congresses by committing them to procuring a minimum number of units over several years, limiting options for adjustments. Using MYP for DoD procurement programs limits flexibility in adjusting the budget, as downward adjustments incur termination liability costs. This places a heavier burden on non-MYP programs to accommodate changes in military needs or budgetary circumstances. Shifting more programs to MYP would further reduce flexibility for DoD and Congress in future budget adjustments. Congress balances potential savings of using MYP for DoD procurement programs against reducing flexibility in future budget adjustments. Only a few major programs are typically given MYP authority, while most use annual contracting. Congress approves MYP through the Defense Appropriation Act. The Defense Appropriation Act usually grants multi-year procurement (MYP) authority for DoD programs exceeding $500,000,000. This authority is typically provided in Title VIII, Section 8008. Examples include the Air Force C-130, Army's FMTV, and Navy's F/A-18E/F programs. Multi-year contracts for the Department of Defense must be authorized by Congress and are limited to $500,000,000 or more.
