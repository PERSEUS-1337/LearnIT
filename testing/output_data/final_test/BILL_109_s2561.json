    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Bureau of Reclamation Water Conservation, Efficiency, and Management Improvement Act\" and defines terms such as \"non-federal entity,\" \"Reclamation State,\" and \"Secretary.\" It authorizes grants and cooperative agreements. The Secretary may provide grants and agreements with non-Federal entities for water conservation projects in Reclamation States. Eligibility criteria will be published within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary may prioritize requests for assistance under subsection (a) based on factors such as reducing conflict over water, increasing water use efficiency, availability of unallocated water, and involvement in water marketing. The Secretary may prioritize requests for water marketing assistance based on factors such as likelihood of project benefits, non-Federal entity's ability to pay, reasonableness of assistance, stakeholder involvement, relation to Bureau of Reclamation projects, and water conservation efforts. The Federal Facilities Improvement Act allows for grants or cooperative agreements to improve Federal facilities, with the Federal government holding title to the improvements. There is a cost-sharing requirement where the Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 50 percent. The Secretary may include in-kind contributions for project completion and exclude funds from other Federal agencies. Non-Federal share for operating and maintaining improvements is 100 percent. Grants or agreements can benefit both the US and the recipient. The US is not liable under Federal or State law, except as provided. The United States is not liable for monetary damages under Federal or State law related to non-Federal facilities constructed or improved under this title, except for damages caused by acts of negligence. This section does not increase the liability of the United States beyond what is provided in the Federal Torts Claim Act. The Secretary can enter agreements with institutions for water research funding. Existing funding authority is unaffected. State water laws are not affected. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2016."
