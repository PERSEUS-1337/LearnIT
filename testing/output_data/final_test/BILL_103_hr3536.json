    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmentally Advanced Technologies Research and Development Act\" provides financial assistance for technology adaptation to promote exports. The Environmental Technology Export Revolving Fund is established to provide financial assistance for adapting and demonstrating US environmental technologies for export. The Secretary of Commerce can use the Fund for loans, guarantees, or other assistance to US companies, research centers, and educational institutions. Priority is given to environmental technologies needing further research modifications. The Environmental Technology Export Revolving Fund aims to support technologies with potential for international markets, requiring further research and development for commercialization. The Secretary of Commerce will submit an operating plan by January 1, 1995, outlining coordination efforts with other export finance sources and evaluating alternative approaches for effective implementation. The Secretary of Commerce will prescribe terms and conditions for financial assistance, limiting the project amount to 50% of total eligible costs. Financial assistance will be provided under specific terms and conditions. Under this section, the cost should not exceed 15 percent of the credit authority. Repayment on loans made under this section will be credited to the Fund. The loan guarantee agreement may require a portion of royalties from technology developed with financial assistance to be paid to the United States. Interest on loans awarded or guaranteed by the Federal Government will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of Commerce manages the Fund and reports annually to Congress on its financial condition. Technical assistance is provided to awardees upon request, with fees charged if necessary. The Secretary of Commerce may charge fees for technical assistance and services, but can waive them on a case-by-case basis. Fees collected are deposited in a revolving fund. The Secretary also coordinates activities with other federal agencies to avoid duplication and reaches out to businesses in economically depressed areas to inform them of financial assistance opportunities. The Secretary of Commerce encourages qualified business concerns to participate in activities for financial assistance provided under this section."
