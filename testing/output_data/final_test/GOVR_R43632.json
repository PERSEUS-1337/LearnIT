    "content": "Specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and horticulture crops, are a significant part of U.S. agriculture. In 2012, farm-level specialty crop production was valued at nearly $60 billion, accounting for a quarter of U.S. crop production. Despite this, specialty crops only occupy 3% of harvested cropland acres. Retail sales of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables in the U.S. total around $100 billion annually. Additionally, exports of U.S. specialty crops reached about $14 billion in 2013, representing 10% of total U.S. agricultural exports. Specialty crop production is widespread across the U.S., with California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, and Michigan being key states. USDA data shows the distribution of vegetable, fruit, tree nut, and floriculture crop areas. Specialized farms, which focus on these crops for at least half of their production value, account for a majority of specialty crop producers. These farms contribute significantly to the total value of U.S. specialty crop production. Specialized fruit and vegetable farms account for 90-95% of U.S. specialty crop production value, with a concentration in the Western United States. Some farms participate in commodity support programs, mainly in the Midwest. Organic certification is a growing business strategy, with organic fruit and vegetable sales totaling over $1 billion annually, representing about 4% of all fruit and vegetable sales in the U.S. Support for U.S. specialty crops, including certified organic fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts, differs from traditional farm bill support for commodity crops. While commodity crop support dates back to the 1930s, specialty crop support is more recent. Specialty crop producers have advocated for a larger role in farm bill policy discussions and for benefits similar to those received by major commodity producers. Several programs supporting specialty crops were established in the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 and expanded in the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill was the first to include a separate title for specialty crops and organic agriculture. Some programs were also established in the 2002 farm bill and reauthorized in the 2014 farm bill. Farm bill provisions support specialty crop and certified organic sectors, but individual specialty crop producers do not benefit from federal commodity price and income support programs. Instead, programs provide benefits to all specialty crop producers, including marketing, crop insurance, disaster assistance, pest and disease protections, trade assistance, and research. Specialty crop producers benefit from various USDA support programs, including marketing, crop insurance, disaster assistance, pest and disease protections, trade assistance, and research. Despite the wide range of program support, federal spending for specialty crops remains lower than for commodity crops. Total funding sources for specialty crops are challenging to estimate due to the spread of support across various USDA programs. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for specialty crops and organic agriculture, with an average of $773 million annually expected to be spent. Additionally, roughly $302 million in annual appropriations were authorized for certain programs. Total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture is still lower than for commodity crops. Despite increased funding levels, total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture remains small compared to commodity crops under the 2014 farm bill. The bill reauthorized and expanded provisions supporting these sectors, including marketing, organic certification, pest control, and food safety standards. Title X of the 2014 farm bill includes provisions supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture producers such as pest and disease control, food safety standards, and local foods. These provisions benefit certified organic agriculture producers through the National Organic Program, certification cost sharing, crop insurance mechanisms, and data initiatives. Additionally, support for specialty crops and organic agriculture is not limited to the Horticulture title but is spread across various other titles of the farm bill. Title X of the 2014 farm bill supports specialty crop and organic agriculture producers through programs like USDA's Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, Plant Pest and Disease Prevention Programs, Farmer's Market and Local Food Promotion Program, and National Organic Program. It also includes provisions for organic producers such as Organic Production and Market Data Initiatives and National Organic Certification Cost Share Program. Additionally, the bill grants USDA authority to consider a research and promotion order for the organic sector. Title X of the 2014 farm bill includes provisions for specialty crop and organic agriculture producers, with increased funding estimated at $338 million over the next five years. Key programs benefiting specialty crop producers in Title X include the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, plant pest and disease programs, and support for farmers' markets and local foods. Other farm bill titles also support local food systems and beginning farmers and ranchers, including those in the specialty crop and certified organic sectors. The farm bill includes provisions for specialty crop and organic agriculture producers, with programs like the Specialty Crop Research Initiative and Organic Agriculture Research Initiative benefiting them. It also supports research, pest management, and emergency citrus disease programs. The farm bill supports specialty crop producers through programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, and other initiatives under the Nutrition title. The 2014 farm bill supports specialty crop producers through programs like the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive program, Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops, Market Access Program, and Value-Added Producer Grant Program. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program and Supplemental Disaster Assistance Programs. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized programs like the Tree Assistance Program (TAP) and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) under the Supplemental Disaster Assistance Programs. It also supports specialty crop and certified organic producers through crop insurance products and conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and CRP. EQIP provides support for organic producers transitioning to organic through the EQIP Organic Initiative. Various USDA agencies administer programs supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture. For more detailed information, refer to CRS reports on farm bill programs and crop insurance provisions. Various USDA agencies, including NIFA, ARS, NRCS, FAS, and RD, are involved in supporting specialty crops. Other federal agencies like FDA and EPA oversee food safety for these crops, while agencies like the Department of Commerce and U.S. International Trade Commission manage global trade. These programs are not part of the omnibus farm bill and are not covered in this report. For more information, refer to CRS Report R42771."
