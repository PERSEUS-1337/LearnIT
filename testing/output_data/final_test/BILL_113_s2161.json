    "content": "The Act titled \"EPA Employment Impact Analysis Act\" requires an analysis of employment effects under the Clean Air Act. Congress finds that the Environmental Protection Agency has distorted the impact of regulations under the Clean Air Act on job creation by using incomplete analyses, leading to billions of dollars in compliance costs and millions of job losses despite claims of net job creation. The Environmental Protection Agency's analysis of a final rule estimated the creation of temporary construction jobs and new permanent jobs, while a private study by NERA Economic Consulting predicted job losses. Implementation of the final rule would result in a negative impact on worker income, with estimates of 180,000 to 215,000 lost jobs in 2015 and 50,000 to 85,000 lost jobs annually thereafter. The EPA projected the creation of 700 jobs per year, while a private study by NERA Economic Consulting forecasted the elimination of 34,000 jobs starting in 2013. The EPA projected the creation of 2,200 jobs per year from 2013 to 2037 due to final rules on air pollutants, while a private study estimated the elimination of 28,000 jobs. The EPA projected the creation of 2,200 jobs per year from 2013 to 2037 due to final rules on air pollutants, while a private study estimated the elimination of 28,000 jobs. Implementation of certain air pollution rules by the EPA, such as regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, is predicted to have significant negative employment impacts. The full impacts of existing Agency regulations have not been fully studied or disclosed. The Environmental Protection Agency must disclose the adverse impact of its regulations on jobs before issuing final rules. Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act has required evaluations of potential employment loss since 1977. The Environmental Protection Agency is required to analyze the impact of its regulations on jobs before finalizing any major rule under the Clean Air Act. This includes conducting an economy-wide analysis of costs and effects across different industries in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency must analyze the impact of its regulations on jobs before finalizing any major rule under the Clean Air Act. This includes conducting an economy-wide analysis of costs and effects across different industries in the United States. The process also establishes a semiannual update to evaluate potential employment changes resulting from the implementation of major rules under the Clean Air Act."
