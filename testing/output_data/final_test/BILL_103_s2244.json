    "content": "The \"Independent Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Act of 1994\" includes definitions for terms like \"Commission\" and \"Secretary\" as well as findings related to nuclear waste storage. The Congress acknowledges the significant amount of spent nuclear fuel stored at commercial reactors nationwide and recognizes the delay in constructing a deep geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste. This delay hinders the Secretary from fulfilling contracts with waste generators. Since 1982, there have been no new orders for civilian nuclear power plants, leading to a lack of operating facilities. A deep geologic repository for radioactive waste may not be available before 2010, causing a need for additional spent fuel storage capacity at nuclear reactors. Utilities are investing in interim storage facilities like dry cask storage. The technology for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel, including dry cask storage, has significantly improved since the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The existing statutory jurisdiction of the Commission under various acts and orders also plays a role in nuclear waste management. The Regulatory Commission has the authority to assess commercial nuclear utilities' capability for spent fuel storage. These utilities are deemed capable of managing spent nuclear fuel during interim storage periods. Increased radioactive decay is expected in fuel stored before delivery to the Secretary as per the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 aims to facilitate handling, transportation, and disposal of nuclear waste. The estimated cost for nuclear facilities to acquire dry storage facilities is approximately 0.56 mil per kilowatt-hour. AMENDMENTS TO THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1982. After January 31, 1998, if the Secretary does not have a facility available to accept spent fuel from persons holding contracts under this section, those persons may offset storage expenses through fee payment credits until the Secretary's first acceptance of their spent fuel at an authorized facility. The Secretary may provide fee payment credits to persons meeting certain conditions until their spent fuel is accepted at an authorized facility. The credit amount is 0.56 mil per kilowatt-hour for electricity generated by their nuclear power reactor during the eligible period."
