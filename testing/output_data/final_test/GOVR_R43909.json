    "content": "Under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) statute, FY2017 marks the end of federal funding, despite the ACA MOE requirement in place until FY2019. This report discusses the implications of the ACA MOE requirement for children if federal CHIP funding expires, covering program design, financing, and potential coverage implications. CHIP is a federal-state program providing health coverage to uninsured, low-income children and pregnant women. It is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with voluntary participation from all states. There is flexibility in program design within federal requirements, leading to variation across CHIP programs. Established in 1997 under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, CHIP had 5.9 million enrollees and $13.7 billion in expenditures in FY2015. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was established in 1997 under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. Over the years, federal laws like the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have made significant changes to CHIP, including increased funding levels, altered eligibility requirements, and maintaining the current structure through FY2019. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended federal funding for CHIP through FY2017. States have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs in three ways. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) offers flexibility to states in program design, allowing for a CHIP Medicaid expansion, separate CHIP programs, or a combination approach. CHIP benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules vary based on the program design. CHIP Medicaid expansions must adhere to federal Medicaid rules, providing comprehensive coverage and minimal cost sharing. Separate CHIP programs can resemble private health insurance with the option for cost sharing, capped at 5% of annual family income. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) allows states flexibility in program design, with options for CHIP Medicaid expansion, separate CHIP programs, or a combination approach. States must cover emergency services, well-baby and well-child care, dental services, and mental health services meeting federal parity requirements. Approval for program changes beyond Medicaid or CHIP laws can be sought through Section 1115 waivers. CHIP is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with almost 60% of enrollees in CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and 40% in separate CHIP programs. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with the federal government reimbursing states for a portion of every dollar spent on CHIP up to state-specific annual limits called allotments. The federal government's share of CHIP expenditures is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP) rate, which ranges from 88% to 100%. Although FY2017 is the last year states are to receive CHIP allotments, federal CHIP outlays are expected. In FY2017, states will receive their final CHIP allotments before federal CHIP outlays in FY2018. States can access unspent funds from previous years and use CHIP funds to cover Medicaid expenses for children above 133% of the federal poverty level. The ACA provision expanded mandatory Medicaid eligibility for children aged 6 to 18 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. States facing a shortfall in their CHIP programs may receive federal Medicaid matching funds. When Medicaid funds are used for CHIP, states receive the regular FMAP rate instead of the higher E-FMAP rate. Federal CHIP funding is capped, but federal Medicaid funding is open-ended. The ACA established provisions to maintain Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards until specific dates to prevent coverage loss. States must adhere to these standards to receive federal funding. The ACA established provisions to maintain Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards until September 30, 2019. States risk losing federal funding if they do not comply with these requirements. The MOE provisions impact CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and separate CHIP programs differently. When federal CHIP funding is depleted, children transition from CHIP to Medicaid, increasing the state's financial responsibility due to the lower federal matching rate for Medicaid. States may have some Medicaid expenditures financed with federal CHIP funds. When federal CHIP funding is exhausted, states would be responsible for providing Medicaid coverage to these children through September 30, 2019. The financing would switch from CHIP to Medicaid, increasing the state share of expenditures. Only the CHIP-specific provisions of the ACA MOE requirements apply to separate CHIP programs. States may impose waiting lists or enrollment caps to limit CHIP expenditures. States can enroll CHIP-eligible children in qualified health plans in the exchanges certified by the Secretary of HHS as comparable to CHIP. If CHIP funding is insufficient, states must screen children for Medicaid eligibility and enroll them if eligible. The Secretary of HHS must review and certify benefits and cost sharing for children under qualified health plans in the exchanges. The Secretary of HHS must review and certify benefits and cost sharing for children under qualified health plans in the exchanges. In a review released on November 25, 2015, no qualified health plans were certified as comparable to CHIP coverage due to higher out-of-pocket costs and less comprehensive benefits for child-specific services. States are only required to establish procedures to enroll children in certified health plans, and if there are no certified plans, states are not obligated to provide coverage. Some CHIP children may not be eligible for subsidized exchange coverage. If federal CHIP funding is not extended, children in separate CHIP programs may lose coverage and could become uninsured. An estimate suggests that 36% of children with separate CHIP coverage would become uninsured if funding ends in FY2018."
