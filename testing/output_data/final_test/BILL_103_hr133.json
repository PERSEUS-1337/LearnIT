    "content": "The Act titled \"Systematic Application of Value Engineering Act of 1993\" requires federal agencies to implement value engineering. Federal agencies must apply value engineering to reduce costs, improve quality, and maintain efficiency in construction, administrative, program, acquisition, and grant projects. Senior management personnel are required to establish and maintain value engineering procedures that utilize qualified personnel and provide a basis for reporting accomplishments to the Office of Management and Budget. Each Federal agency must designate a senior management official with a background in value engineering to oversee and monitor value engineering efforts. They should develop criteria and guidelines for identifying programs, projects, systems, and products with potential savings and benefits from value engineering methodology. The criteria and guidelines for value engineering should focus on maximizing savings during early phases of development. This includes considering return on investment and setting a dollar threshold for applying value engineering to agency projects. The value engineering manager of an agency may waive the requirement to conduct value engineering on programs, projects, systems, and products below a certain dollar threshold if they share planning elements or are functionally equivalent. The agency's value engineering manager can waive the requirement for value engineering studies on certain programs, projects, systems, and products if they share planning elements or are functionally equivalent. Training in value engineering methodology should be provided to agency staff, funds for value engineering efforts should be included in annual budget requests, and records of programs and projects should be documented and maintained. The agency must adhere to acquisition requirements, including using value engineering clauses for prime and subcontractors. For discretionary grants, value engineering requirements must be established, such as including a clause in grant applications for the use of value engineering methodology. The agency must develop annual plans for using value engineering in projects and report activities to the Office of Management and Budget annually. The agency must submit a report by February 15 each year, including the current value engineering manager's details, the government's return on investment from value engineering, and the potential return on investment achievable through value engineering. The agency must report on the application of value engineering to its top programs, projects, systems, and products, detailing the savings and quality improvements achieved. Additionally, the agency must list the criteria for waiving value engineering requirements and document any waivers granted. The Inspector General of each Federal agency audits reported savings every second year, as defined in the Act. The text chunk discusses the effort directed at analyzing various functions for achieving essential functions at the lowest life-cycle cost. Life-cycle cost includes all relevant costs over the useful life of a program, project, system, product, equipment, building, facility, service, or supply. The Act mentioned in the text will take effect on January 1, 1994. The Act will take effect on January 1, 1994. The Director of Management and Budget will review the policies in the Act 5 years after enactment and report the results to Congress."
