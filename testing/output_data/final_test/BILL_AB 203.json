    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4212 of the Public Resources Code is amended to establish a fire prevention fee not to exceed $152.33 per habitable structure in a state responsibility area. The fee may be adjusted annually by the board. In 2013, 2017, and annually thereafter, the board may adjust the fire prevention fee based on the change in the Implicit Price Deflator. Emergency regulations must be adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act for immediate public safety. Section 4213 of the Public Resources Code is amended to allow for the annual collection of the fire prevention fee by the State Board of Equalization. Determinations regarding the fee can be reviewed under Article 2 and are not subject to a petition for redetermination by the State Board of Equalization. The State Board of Equalization will not accept refund claims based on incorrect fire prevention fee calculations unless set aside by the department or a court. If entitled to a refund, a claim must be made to the State Board of Equalization within 60 days of assessment. The department annually provides the State Board of Equalization with names, addresses, and amounts of fire prevention fees to be assessed. If there are enough funds in the Fire Prevention Fund, the fee may not be collected for that fiscal year. Section 4220 of the Public Resources Code allows a person to petition for a redetermination of the fire prevention fee within 60 days of receiving a notice. If no petition is filed, the fee becomes final. Section 4222 states that if a petition is filed, the department will reconsider and may eliminate the fee if it's determined that the chapter does not apply."
