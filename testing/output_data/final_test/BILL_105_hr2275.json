The \"Genetic Employment Protection Act of 1997\" defines terms such as employee, employer, employment agency, labor organization, and genetic information, which includes details about genes, gene products, and inherited information. Genetic services include evaluation, testing, counseling, and related services for genes, gene products, or inherited characteristics. SEC. 3. EMPLOYER PRACTICES. It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against an individual based on their genetic information, including inquiries about genetic services, in hiring, firing, compensation, or other aspects of employment. This includes actions that limit opportunities or negatively impact an employee because of their genetic information. Employers are also prohibited from requesting or requiring genetic information from employees. Employers cannot request or require genetic information from employees unless certain conditions are met, such as job-relatedness and obtaining the individual's written consent. Employment agencies are prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on genetic information, including inquiries about genetic services. Labor organizations are also subject to similar prohibitions. It is illegal for labor organizations to discriminate against individuals based on genetic information, including inquiries about genetic services, by excluding them from membership, limiting their opportunities, or influencing employers. To prevent discrimination, it is illegal to influence an employer to discriminate against an individual based on genetic information. SEC. 6. TRAINING PROGRAMS. It is unlawful to discriminate based on genetic information in training programs. SEC. 7. CONFIDENTIALITY. If an employer, labor organization, or employment agency has genetic information about an employee, they must keep it separate and confidential in medical files. With the employee's consent, the employer can disclose necessary restrictions or accommodations to supervisors, first aid personnel, and safety personnel. The employer must keep genetic information about an employee confidential, only disclosing it with the employee's consent for necessary restrictions or accommodations. The employer must provide relevant information to a government official upon request, disclose information to the employee upon request, and not disclose the information otherwise. SEC. 8. CIVIL ACTION. An employee or member of a labor organization can sue an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee for violating this Act. The employee can bring the action on behalf of themselves or other similarly situated employees. The court can award appropriate relief. SEC. 9. CONSTRUCTION.
