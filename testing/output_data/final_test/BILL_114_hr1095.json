    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training Practices Act\" or \"BEST Practices Act\". The Department of Defense has made significant progress in medical training and troop protection, resulting in decreased battlefield fatalities. However, they still use over 8,500 live animals annually for training purposes, despite the civilian sector transitioning to more effective human-based training methods. Human-based medical training, like simulators, allows for better practice and data collection. The Department of Defense has made progress in medical training and troop protection, reducing battlefield fatalities. Despite this, they still use over 8,500 live animals annually for training. Human-based training methods, like simulators, replicate human anatomy for practice and data collection. Medical simulation increases patient safety and decreases errors by healthcare providers. The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command is working to replace live animal-based training. High-fidelity simulators are being developed for high-volume or high-value battlefield medical procedures. The Department of Defense has made progress in medical training and troop protection, reducing battlefield fatalities. They are working to replace live animal-based training with human-based methods like simulators. The Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills of the Air Force exclusively uses human-based training methods. The Army and the medical school of the Department of Defense have policies in place to forbid non-medical personnel from participating in training courses involving animals. The Department of Defense has replaced animal use in medical training with human-based methods in various areas, including combat trauma courses and surgical skills development. The Coast Guard also reduced animal use for training but still uses them for Department of Defense personnel. The Department of Defense has transitioned to using human-based methods for medical training, including combat trauma courses and surgical skills development. The Coast Guard has also reduced animal use for training but still utilizes them for Department of Defense personnel. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop human-based training methods for combat trauma injuries by October 1, 2018, with the goal of replacing animal-based methods by October 1, 2020. Annual reports to Congress are mandated starting October 1, 2016. The Secretary must report to Congress on the development of human-based training methods for treating combat trauma injuries, including severe injuries like hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, blast injury amputations, airway compromises, and others. Human-based training methods involve using simulators instead of animals. The Secretary must report to Congress on the development of human-based training methods for treating combat trauma injuries, including severe injuries like hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, blast injury amputations, and airway compromises. These methods involve using simulators, partial task trainers, moulage, simulated combat environments, human cadavers, and rotations in trauma centers. In 2017, there was a requirement to use human-based methods for certain medical training."
