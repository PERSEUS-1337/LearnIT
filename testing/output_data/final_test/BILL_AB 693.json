    "title": "AB 693",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds it necessary to assist low-income utility customers with energy bills and support the long-term ability of the CARE program. Installing solar energy systems in disadvantaged communities can benefit local economic development and advance renewable energy policies. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan aims to allocate funds to projects benefiting disadvantaged communities and install solar energy systems in low-income housing to reduce energy bills. Section 748.5 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require electrical corporations to credit revenues from greenhouse gas allowances directly to residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers. The commission must implement a customer outreach plan for electrical corporations to raise public awareness of greenhouse gas allowance revenues by January 1, 2013. Costs for this plan can be recovered in rates. The commission may allocate up to 15 percent of electrical corporation revenues from greenhouse gas allowances for clean energy projects. A new Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program is added to the Public Utilities Code. The Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program is established for qualified multifamily affordable housing properties with specific income and location requirements. The Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program allows for solar energy systems to be installed in eligible properties, which can help meet the commission's obligation to offer alternatives for residential customers in disadvantaged communities. Electrical corporations can also offer distributed energy resource programs in these communities using approved funds. The commission will allocate $100 million annually or 10% of available funds for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program until June 30, 2020, with a possible extension to June 30, 2026. The program's administration structure will be determined by the commission through a competitive bidding process or by an electrical corporation. The commission will allocate funds for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, with a target of installing 300 megawatts by 2030. The electricity generated must primarily offset usage by low-income tenants. The commission requires contractual restrictions on solar energy systems owned by third-party owners to prevent additional costs for low-income tenants. Third-party owners must provide ongoing maintenance, monitor energy production, and ensure projected kWh levels are met. Actions may include performance guarantees or corrective measures for underproduction. The commission aligns incentive levels for photovoltaic installations with installation costs in affordable housing markets, limits incentives to 100% of total costs, establishes local hiring requirements for economic development in disadvantaged communities, and mandates energy efficiency standards. The commission ensures low-income tenants in the program receive utility bill credits through specific tariffs, maintains economic benefits from solar energy systems, and determines eligibility for tenants of community choice aggregators. The commission is required to submit an assessment of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program to the Legislature every three years, detailing the number of properties with solar systems, bill reduction outcomes, program costs, environmental benefits, progress towards goals, and recommendations for improvement. The commission must report on program commitments, obligations, and projected demands to justify future funding allocations. This includes programs like the Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes Program and the Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program. The commission evaluates program expenditures, performance, and outcomes every three years, making necessary adjustments to ensure program goals are met. If participation is insufficient, uncommitted funds may be credited back to ratepayers. An annual update on the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program is provided, including approved projects, completed projects, pending projects, and geographic distribution. SEC. 4. This act will not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
