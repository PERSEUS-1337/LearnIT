    "content": "Flows of foreign fighters to conflicts in Syria and Iraq have seen tens of thousands travel to the Middle East, North Africa, and elsewhere in the last three decades. In 2015, over 20,000 foreign fighters, including 3,400 Westerners, went to the Syria-Iraq region. The majority are joining ISIL, with Europe having the largest contingents of Western citizens becoming foreign fighters. Some European estimates suggest that thousands of Europeans have traveled to the conflict zone in Syria. Smaller numbers of Americans, Canadians, and Australians have also joined the fighting. U.S. officials estimated that over 150 U.S. persons had traveled to Syria to support armed groups since 2011. There is limited data on the threat posed by foreign fighters, with many affiliations only known after detention or death. U.S. officials are concerned about individuals who have traveled to Iraq, Syria, or elsewhere as foreign fighters, as they may return radicalized and willing to commit violence. Recent terrorist attacks in France and Belgium, carried out by French-born Muslims with ties to terrorist groups, have heightened these fears. The curr_chunk discusses the concerns raised by returning fighters and self-radicalized individuals in Western countries, citing examples of lone wolf attacks and copycat incidents. The prev_chunk mentions U.S. officials' concerns about foreign fighters returning radicalized and willing to commit violence, particularly in light of recent terrorist attacks in France and Belgium. The suspect in a free speech discussion and synagogue attack in Denmark may have been radicalized in prison and had interest in fighting in Syria or Iraq. Western Muslims fighting in Iraq or Syria hold propaganda value for the Islamic State group, which targets potential recruits in Western countries. Intelligence services believe that beheadings of Western citizens were carried out by a British member of the Islamic State organization. The group recruits Americans and other English speakers for their cause. The Islamic State group recruits Americans and Westerners for their ability to reenter the US and Europe with less scrutiny. The US and EU have close law enforcement and intelligence relations, enhancing counterterrorism cooperation. Efforts have been made to prevent radicalization, counter violent extremism, and combat the foreign fighter threat. The White House convened a Summit on Countering terrorism after the Paris attacks. The White House organized a \"Summit on Countering Violent Extremism\" in Washington, DC, following the Paris attacks. The event included discussions with U.S. community leaders, law enforcement officials, and international representatives from over 60 countries to address domestic and online radicalization. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and information-sharing arrangements were emphasized to combat the foreign fighter threat. Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about European fighters in Syria and Iraq due to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, which allows visa-free travel from 38 European countries. Legislation has been introduced to address the foreign fighter threat. The Obama Administration supports the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for trade and tourism, but additional security measures were implemented in response to foreign fighter threats. The report discusses U.S. and European responses to the foreign fighter phenomenon, focusing on Western European countries and EU measures to counter the threat. The report evaluates foreign fighter outflows in the Western Balkans and Russia, discussing U.S.-European cooperation in law enforcement and intelligence. Thousands of individuals from various countries have joined conflicts in Syria and Iraq over the last decade, with Sunni foreign fighters participating in Iraq against U.S. forces. Iran supported Shiite militia groups during this period. Foreigners, including Sunni insurgents, made up a significant portion of the Islamic State of Iraq's personnel, with estimates ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 fighters. Foreigners also accounted for about 1% of detainees in U.S. custody in Iraq. The U.S. accused the Syrian government of facilitating the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq, leading to military action inside Syria to disrupt these flows. The flow of foreign fighters from Iraq to Syria increased in 2008, with governments in the Middle East and North Africa taking various actions to address this issue. The conflict in Syria from 2011 onwards further fueled the influx of foreign fighters, with transnational networks adapting to send recruits to insurgent groups. By February 2014, the insurgency in Syria was estimated to consist of 75,000 to 115,000 insurgents organized into over 1,500 groups. According to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), Syria is a key location for extremist groups to recruit, train, and potentially launch attacks. The NCTC also warns of the threat of Islamic State sympathizers carrying out self-directed attacks in the U.S. homeland. Over 20,000 foreign fighters have traveled to the Syria-Iraq region since 2011. Over 20,000 foreign fighters, including roughly 150 Americans, have traveled to the Syria-Iraq region since 2011. U.S. officials estimate that around 10,000 foreign fighters have joined the Islamic State group. Military operations against the Islamic State group have killed thousands of fighters, including some Americans. As of early 2015, around 20,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Syria and Iraq, with 11,000 from the Middle East, 3,000 from the former Soviet Union, and up to 4,000 from Western Europe. The flow of foreign fighters to Syria since 2011 has been unprecedented in scope and speed compared to other conflicts. Syria has seen a high influx of foreign fighters, with many aligning themselves with armed Islamist groups like Jabhat al Nusra and the Islamic State. Various Syrian opposition groups have called for foreign support and utilized foreign fighters, though there is debate on their effectiveness due to potential language barriers. Foreign fighters, including Americans, may face language barriers and integration difficulties when joining local groups. General Allen mentioned in a 2014 interview that unqualified foreign fighters often become suicide bombers. Syrian government forces receive support from Lebanese Hezbollah, Iraqi Shiite militia members, and possibly Iranian security services. Some Assad regime air strike missions may involve Russian pilots. Various assessments have analyzed the foreign fighter contingents in Syria from different countries, revealing recruitment patterns and engagement in combat. Accounts suggest recruits use various routes to reach the conflict zone, with some masking their intentions while others do not. Many fighters, especially from Europe, are involved in the conflict. Turkey serves as a key transit location for foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq, with many coming from Europe. U.S. officials work to assess and respond to the threats posed by these fighters, coordinating with other countries to strengthen preventive measures. Ambassador Robert Bradtke was appointed as a senior adviser for partner engagement on Syria foreign fighters in March 2014. Ambassador Bradtke leads efforts to counter foreign fighters by encouraging key partners to prioritize the threat and enhance information-sharing and law enforcement cooperation. The United States is engaging with regional partners in seven areas to address vulnerabilities and prevent the influx of foreign fighters. The United States is assisting partner countries in strengthening their infrastructure to combat terrorism through capacity-building, halting external financing, counter-messaging, and countering violent extremism. This includes efforts to bring suspected terrorists to trial and prevent the influx of foreign fighters. The United States is implementing measures to enhance border and aviation security, including increased screening and preclearance at overseas airports. They are also addressing the foreign fighter threat through the United Nations by supporting international sanctions against terrorist groups like the Islamic State, Jabhat al Nusra, and Al Qaeda-affiliated entities. Resolution 2170 emphasizes the need to prevent terrorist travel and limit weapons and financing for groups like ISIL, ANF, and Al Qaeda. President Obama led a U.N. Security Council session on addressing the threat posed by foreign fighters in conflict zones, leading to the adoption of Resolution 2178 requiring member states to prevent and suppress the recruitment and equipping of individuals for terrorist acts. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 calls for member states to prosecute and penalize individuals involved in terrorist acts or receiving terrorist training. Ambassador Bradtke highlighted the importance of countries enacting legislation to address foreign fighter-related crimes. Resolution 2199 reaffirms the need to restrict arms flows, combat financing, and prevent trade in Syrian and Iraqi regions. The EU and European governments are alarmed by the threat posed by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. They emphasize the danger of trained militants returning to Europe. European governments are increasingly concerned about the potential danger posed by trained militants returning from Syria and Iraq, as well as \"lone wolf\" attacks inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda. Recent incidents, such as the 2014 Brussels Jewish Museum attack and the 2015 Paris Charlie Hebdo attack, have heightened these fears. The January 2015 attacks in Paris and Belgium, as well as the February 2015 shootings in Copenhagen, were carried out by French-born Muslims with possible ties to terrorist organizations. The incidents resulted in the deaths of 17 people and multiple arrests of suspects involved in alleged terrorist plots. European officials believe that the number of European Muslims joining rebel or extremist groups in Syria and Iraq is increasing. Estimates suggest that at least 3,000 to 5,000 EU citizens have left Europe to fight in conflict zones. A study indicates that up to 4,000 individuals from Western Europe have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the fighting. Key European countries of origin include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and France. Key European countries of origin for fighters in the Syria-Iraq conflict include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Fighters also come from Turkey, Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo), Muslim communities in Russia and former Soviet Union. Many European fighters are associated with Islamist extremist groups like Islamic State and Jabhat al Nusra. Concerns arise about radicalization, enhanced skills, and potential for violence upon their return. Some studies suggest that returned Muslim fighters are more likely to commit acts of violent extremism than the general population, with more lethal attacks. However, analysts question the widespread threat, noting only a small proportion have committed violence. Many European fighters may have gone to conflict zones due to disaffection with Western societies and may not return home. Some may be killed, traumatized, or disillusioned by the conflict, with no intention of violence at home. European governments are addressing security concerns raised by these fighters. European governments are addressing security concerns raised by European fighters through measures such as increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, detaining returning fighters, and bolstering counterterrorism legislation. Suspected individuals have been arrested in various countries on terrorism charges, with some governments confiscating passports to prevent travel to Syria or Iraq. Additionally, some European governments are considering strengthening anti-terrorism laws for prosecution. European policymakers are focusing on combating radicalization and extremist propaganda, particularly online. Most European governments have developed counter-radicalization initiatives, with Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom leading the way. Efforts to prevent radicalization and promote de-radicalization are seen as crucial in the fight against violent extremism, especially within Muslim communities. These initiatives are carried out at national and local levels in collaboration with community and civil society groups. Some European governments are focused on developing online counter-narratives and working with Internet and social media companies to limit radical content. There is a debate over balancing security measures with de-radicalization and rehabilitation efforts for returning fighters. Experts caution against automatically pursuing criminal charges for all returnees, as prisons can serve as recruiting grounds for extremists. In 2015, Paris and Copenhagen attack suspects were radicalized in prison. EU Counterterrorism Coordinator calls for distinguishing between returning fighters for rehabilitation programs. A program in Aarhus, Denmark, aims to rehabilitate fighters and improve Muslim integration. Efforts have decreased the number of youths leaving for Syria or Iraq. The challenge remains in preventing European fighters from going to the Syria-Iraq region and tracking their movements. Preventing European fighters from traveling to Syria-Iraq region and monitoring their movements is challenging due to resource constraints. Laws in some European countries make it difficult to prosecute individuals preemptively for terrorism-related activities abroad. Participation in the Schengen area hinders national efforts to restrict \"jihadi travel.\" The Schengen system allows for travel without passport checks among participating EU states, posing challenges in monitoring European fighters traveling to conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. Analysts argue for EU-wide measures to enhance intelligence-sharing and harmonize laws on \"jihadi travel.\" EU is working on initiatives like establishing an EU-wide system for collecting airline passenger name records to address the foreign fighter phenomenon. The EU has been focusing on addressing the foreign fighter threat by establishing an EU-wide system for collecting airline passenger name record (PNR) data. Despite efforts since 2013 to prevent the flow of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq, improve information exchanges, and enhance counter-radicalization strategies, some experts have raised concerns about protecting against terrorism. The EU's efforts to combat the foreign fighter threat have been hindered by concerns about national sovereignty, data privacy, and civil liberties. The terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen in early 2015 have increased urgency in EU initiatives. Key goals outlined at a meeting in February 2015 include enhancing information-sharing, finalizing an EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record data, and strengthening external EU border controls. The EU aims to improve information exchanges among member states, strengthen external border controls, prevent radicalization through various strategies, implement rules to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, increase cooperation to curb illicit firearms trafficking, and improve collaboration with international partners, particularly in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. EU established a new Internet Referral Unit in March 2015 to combat radicalization and violent extremism online. The unit monitors terrorist content on the Internet and social media platforms, working with service providers to remove such content. EU leaders have engaged with companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook to address radicalization and jihadist propaganda online. Additionally, a group of EU member states, known as the \"Group of Nine,\" has been meeting since 2013 to share information on the foreign fighter threat. In July 2014, European countries agreed on an \"action plan\" to prevent Europeans from joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq, improve monitoring of returning fighters, and enhance information sharing. Despite efforts, establishing a common EU policy to address the foreign fighter threat has been challenging, with the proposal for an EU-wide PNR system stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Political pressure to adopt the system has increased significantly. Political pressure to adopt an EU PNR system has intensified significantly following the January 2015 attacks in Paris. EU governments argue that an EU-wide PNR system is crucial for identifying unknown suspects. The European Parliament passed a resolution on anti-terrorism measures in February 2015 and aims to finalize a revised PNR proposal by the end of the year. However, some MEPs are concerned about potential privacy infringements. Some MEPs object to the EU PNR proposal due to privacy concerns and advocate for better intelligence-sharing among European law enforcement. They also want to link approval of the PNR proposal to progress on EU data protection reforms. Harmonizing national laws and increasing intelligence-sharing to track extremists are challenging issues for the EU to agree upon and implement. The EU faces challenges in agreeing and implementing measures related to police and judicial issues in the Syria-Iraq region. In December 2014, EU justice and home affairs ministers considered revising the EU's Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism in light of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The EU's common definition of terrorism does not currently criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes or receiving terrorist training, leading to a need for all member states to comply fully. EU officials recognized the need to ensure all member states comply with UNSCR 2178, but some governments hesitated to amend the common terrorism definition, citing national prerogatives. Others argued that explicitly criminalizing foreign fighter-related offenses in the common definition would enhance cross-border law enforcement. Previous attempts to enhance EU-wide intelligence capabilities have faced sovereignty issues. The EU has a small Intelligence Analysis Center (INTCEN) for security, defense, and counterterrorism, but lacks collection capabilities or the ability for clandestine operations. Despite recent attacks, there are no expected changes to INTCEN's mandate. Some member states are hesitant to share information on foreign fighters and returnees, fearing it may compromise national intelligence sources. EU officials are urging the use of common databases like the Schengen Information System to track foreign fighters and returnees. Europol's databases, including the Focal Point Travellers database, rely on information from member states for tracking suspected criminals, forged documents, and stolen property. However, there is a lack of data sharing, with only four EU members contributing 80% of the data. Strengthening EU border controls is controversial as leaders balance security with citizens' freedom of movement. The European Commission is urging member states to increase electronic checks at the EU's external borders to enhance security while preserving the freedom of movement for European citizens. Despite calls from some member states to amend the Schengen Borders Code for more extensive checks, the EU has not yet made changes. EU leaders have agreed to conduct \"systematic\" checks against relevant law enforcement databases for possible terrorist suspects or returning fighters at the external borders. The European Commission and Parliament oppose changes to the Schengen Borders Code to avoid potential re-imposition of internal border controls. Belgium is concerned about European citizens fighting in Syria and Iraq, especially after a 2014 attack at the Jewish Museum. Since the May 24, 2014 attack at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, allegedly perpetrated by a French Muslim with ties to Islamist fighters in Syria, Belgian authorities have been vigilant. In January 2015, a terrorist cell planning an attack on Belgian police officers was dismantled in Verviers, resulting in the deaths of two suspects. Thirteen individuals were detained in connection to the plot, some of whom had traveled to Syria. Belgium deployed 300 troops to guard sensitive locations, including Jewish sites and embassies in Brussels and Antwerp. Belgium has deployed troops in Brussels and Antwerp to protect sensitive locations, such as Jewish sites, embassies, and the EU headquarters. There are over 600,000 Muslims in Belgium, mainly descendants of immigrants from North Africa and Turkey. Around 380 Belgians have attempted to join the conflict in Syria and Iraq, with 330 succeeding. Estimates suggest that 180 Belgians are in the region or en route, with approximately 50 casualties. Some studies indicate that up to 440 Belgians may have traveled to the Syria-Iraq region. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation reports that Belgium has a high number of foreign fighters, with up to 440 Belgians joining the fighting in Syria and Iraq. Belgian law enforcement has focused on Sharia4Belgium as a key recruiter, leading to the conviction of 45 members for terrorism-related offenses in February 2015. The group's leader was sentenced to 12 years in prison for radicalizing and recruiting young men to fight abroad. Belgium has convicted individuals in absentia for terrorism-related offenses, with some believed to be in Syria or Iraq. The country has implemented security measures and updated its criminal code to address terrorism, including incitement and recruitment. Despite challenges in gathering evidence from conflict zones, Belgian officials assert that these laws can be used to prosecute foreign fighters. A proposal to criminalize leaving Belgium to join foreign conflicts was rejected in 2013. Belgian authorities rejected a proposal to criminalize becoming a foreign fighter due to concerns about discouraging families from reporting concerns and potential misinterpretation of support for the Asad regime in Syria. They maintain strong coordination between law enforcement and intelligence services at national and local levels, with a Coordination Unit for Threat Assessment keeping a list of individuals who have traveled or intend to travel to Syria or Iraq. The unit investigates and assesses the threat posed by returning fighters, referring cases lacking evidence for prosecution to local authorities for follow-up. Belgium has focused on prevention and counter-radicalization efforts, including a new strategy to deter individuals from becoming foreign fighters. An anti-radicalization unit within the Interior Ministry works on supporting local strategies and implementing prevention measures at the local level. Belgian authorities are actively engaged in counterterrorism and counter-radicalization efforts, including mentoring programs for at-risk youth and counseling services for families of aspiring foreign fighters. They are also working on developing narratives to counter extremist propaganda and collaborating with Internet and social media companies to reduce radical content online. Plans are underway to expand measures such as stripping dual nationals of citizenship, confiscating identity documents to impede travel, and freezing assets of suspected terrorists. Belgian officials are considering measures to impede travel to conflict zones, freeze assets of suspected terrorists, and tackle radicalization in penitentiary facilities. They are also proposing additional funding for counterterrorism initiatives and have been leading efforts for a Europe-wide response to foreign fighters. French officials have been actively combating Islamist terrorism, focusing on groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Despite their efforts through military operations and domestic policies, the threat has intensified with attacks on French and European soil. The presence of French citizens training and fighting with terrorist organizations in the Middle East and North Africa, particularly with the Islamic State group, has raised significant concerns. France, home to Europe's largest Muslim population, estimates that about 1,400 of the 3,000 Europeans fighting with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq are French citizens. The French government considers their return to France and Europe as the biggest threat in the coming years, especially after the heightened concerns following the terrorist attacks in Paris. The terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out by French-born Muslim brothers and their accomplice, heightened concerns about Islamist terrorism. The attackers had ties to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The Paris attacks were carried out by French-born Muslim brothers and their accomplice, who had ties to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The perpetrators had been under state surveillance and had spent time in French prisons. Previous attacks in France and Europe had already raised concerns about radicalized French Muslims receiving terrorist training and support abroad. Notable incidents include the arrest of Mehdi Nemmouche for killing four people in Brussels after spending time with Islamist militants in Syria, and Mohamed Merah's killing of seven people in France's Toulouse region. French law enforcement and counterterrorism apparatus in France have been challenged by recent attacks, including those carried out by individuals with ties to radical Islamists. Despite broad powers and authority to pursue terrorism cases, French authorities have faced criticism for their apparent inability to prevent attacks by individuals under surveillance with links to violent extremists. The French government has faced criticism for not preventing attacks by individuals previously monitored by authorities. Surveillance on suspects in Paris, Brussels, and Toulouse attacks was reportedly lifted before the incidents. Some analysts suggest that monitoring on the Kouachi brothers was stopped in 2013 and 2014 due to shifting focus on citizens fighting with the Islamic State. The French government has implemented new counterterrorism measures to address perceived shortcomings. The French government implemented new counterterrorism measures in response to perceived shortcomings, including a new anti-terrorism law with expanded authority to impose travel bans and penalties for supporting terrorism. Since the Paris attacks, authorities have aggressively used these measures, seizing passports and arresting individuals for speech supportive of terrorism. In February 2015, the Interior Ministry announced plans to seize passports from individuals suspected of planning terrorist-related travel to Iraq and Syria. In response to perceived shortcomings, the French government implemented new counterterrorism measures, including seizing passports from individuals suspected of planning terrorist-related travel to Iraq and Syria. They also blocked websites promoting terrorism and committed \u20ac736 million in new funding for counterterrorism initiatives, hiring 2,500 new law enforcement personnel and launching new counter-radicalization programs. The French government proposed a new surveillance law in March 2015 to monitor digital and mobile communications of individuals linked to terrorist investigations without requiring judicial approval. Internet service providers and phone companies would be obligated to comply with government data requests. France also advocated for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record system and increased cooperation among law enforcement authorities in EU member states. France planned to implement its own PNR system by the end of 2015. France is implementing its own Passenger Name Record system by the end of 2015, regardless of the EU PNR proposal outcome. The French government is focusing on strengthening EU border controls and counter-radicalization efforts, particularly within the prison system where up to half of inmates are Muslim. Measures include increasing Muslim chaplains in prisons and separating radicalized prisoners to prevent recruitment. France, along with Germany and the UK, is urging U.S.-based technology companies to remove terrorist-promoting content from their platforms. Muslim advocates have raised concerns about the lack of Muslim chaplains in French prisons, with only 180 compared to 700 Christian chaplains. They argue that this disparity may contribute to the radicalization process. Critics suggest that France needs to address socioeconomic disparities to prevent radicalization effectively. Critics question the effectiveness of France's assimilation model, arguing that policies like restricting head scarves and banning face veils alienate Muslims. They also criticize laws targeting speech sympathetic to terrorists. In contrast, French leaders defend offensive speech rights while prosecuting other forms. Germany has strengthened counterterrorism efforts since discovering 9/11 hijackers lived there. In Germany, efforts to counter terrorism and radicalization have intensified due to concerns about German citizens joining rebel and terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. Approximately 680 German fighters have traveled to the region since 2011, with one-third returning to Germany and 85 killed in combat. German officials are particularly worried about the increasing number of Germans joining extremist Salafist groups and fighting in Syria and Iraq. The number of Germans fighting in the region more than doubled between early 2014 and April 2015, rising from about 270 to 680. German intelligence officials report a rise in Germans joining extremist Salafist groups, estimating about 7,300 members in 2015 compared to 3,800 in 2011. Fighters from Germany have formed their own brigade within the Islamic State, with many linked to the banned group Millatu Ibrahim. Denis Cuspert, a former hip-hop artist, is believed to be a key figure in this network. The German government is actively countering terrorism and violent extremism, including through law enforcement measures and social policies. In December 2014, a German court sentenced an individual for joining a militant group in Syria. Passports of suspected terrorists have been confiscated, and religious organizations supporting Islamist terrorists have been banned. Denis Cuspert, also known as Deso Dogg, plays a significant role in the Islamic State propaganda effort by producing German language material. In January 2015, Berlin proposed new laws to address issues with prosecuting suspected terrorists, including \"terror tourism.\" The laws would grant authorities the power to confiscate identity cards and passports from suspected terrorists to prevent travel. Additionally, new surveillance authorities could be established to collect and save communication data from citizens. Since 2015, Germany proposed new laws to combat terrorism, allowing authorities to confiscate identity cards and passports from suspects to prevent travel. The potential new surveillance powers have raised privacy concerns, with some officials suggesting the need for more resources like skilled investigators. Despite successful law enforcement efforts, Germany has not experienced major terrorist attacks like other European countries, with the only deadly Islamist-motivated incident occurring in 2011 at Frankfurt airport. In the past decade, German authorities have thwarted terrorist plots, including one by the Islamic Jihad Union targeting U.S. military installations. Following the Paris attacks in 2015, raids on radical Islamist groups led to arrests of individuals linked to the Islamic State. Germany has also focused on preventing radicalization through various efforts. Germany has devoted significant resources to preventing radicalization, particularly among the 4 million Muslims in the country. While most are moderate, there is a rise in support for extremist views, especially among younger Muslims who feel alienated and identify more with pan-Islamic notions. Despite some progress, Muslim integration into German society remains minimal, with blame often placed on both sides. Many Germans view Muslims as not accepting German norms and values, leading to tensions and social issues. Public debate on the role of Muslims in German society has increased, especially after terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen. Tensions have been fueled by far-right, anti-Islam marches in Dresden. The emergence of the far-right, anti-Islam organization PEGIDA in Dresden led to weekly marches with up to 17,000 participants. The movement sparked debates on Islam's compatibility with democratic values in Germany. German leaders face challenges in promoting tolerance of Islam while condemning violent extremism. The ICSR estimates that Spanish citizens have joined jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. Spanish citizens and Moroccan nationals with Spanish residency cards have joined jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. Moroccan authorities estimate 1,200 Moroccans with Spanish residency cards have joined the Islamic State group. Spanish police have conducted raids to dismantle jihadist recruiting networks in Ceuta, Melilla, and Madrid. A joint Spanish-Moroccan operation dismantled a network recruiting women for the Islamic State. Studies show 11 Spanish citizens and nine Moroccan nationals living in Spain have traveled to join the conflict. In early 2014, 11 Spanish citizens and nine Moroccan nationals living in Spain, mostly in their mid-20s or early 30s, were connected to jihadist activities. One individual, Mouhannad Almallah Dabas, had ties to an Al Qaeda cell in Spain and was involved in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Most others had no known jihadist background but were recruited and radicalized by a Spain-Morocco jihadi network. Spain has experience in confronting domestic terrorism, with a history of dealing with groups like ETA. The country has counterterrorism legislation in place, although it was primarily focused on organized groups. Spain has sought to adapt its penal code to address newer threats, such as loosely organized jihadi networks. Several individuals connected to a Spain-Morocco jihadi network attended a mosque in Ceuta, with some members becoming suicide bombers in Syria. Spain has reformed its penal code to address newer terrorism threats, including recruitment, online incitement, financing, and training. Despite increased resources for anti-terrorist agencies, the conviction rate for terrorism-related charges remains low, with fewer than 100 convictions out of 571 arrests related to radical Islam since 2004. Critics cite strict evidence requirements and high standards of proof as hindrances to prosecutions. In response to the foreign fighter threat, Spain announced plans to strengthen counterterrorism laws, including criminalizing receiving terrorist training and participating in armed conflicts abroad. The government also proposed revoking citizenship for those involved in terrorist activities and allowing for passport seizures. Spain is planning to strengthen counterterrorism laws by criminalizing receiving terrorist training, participating in armed conflicts abroad, and revoking citizenship for those involved in terrorist activities. Additional proposals include passport seizures, accelerated expulsion orders, reentry bans for extremists, and streamlined search warrants for police to arrest fighters traveling to conflict zones. The government also aims to improve evidence collection and witness protection standards for terrorism-related prosecutions. Plans for a national Passenger Name Record system for air travel are underway, with heightened urgency following the terrorist attacks in Paris. The PP and PSOE jointly drafted a new counterterrorism bill in January 2015 to consolidate these measures into a single piece of legislation. The Spanish government consolidated counterterrorism measures into a single piece of legislation in March 2015, criticized for potentially infringing on civil liberties. The proposals include criminalizing planning to train with militant groups abroad and expressing statements on social media that could be perceived as inciting terrorism. In January 2015, a Strategic National Plan to Fight Violent Radicalization was approved. The Spanish government implemented a framework plan to combat radicalization, aiming to detect and intervene in potential outbreaks in a coordinated manner. The plan includes creating a National Group to Combat Violent Radicalization with representatives from various authorities and institutions. Priorities of the initiative include generating counter-narratives online and addressing radicalization in prisons. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) and official British government sources estimate that 500 to 600 people have traveled from the UK to fight in Syria and Iraq, with the actual number potentially as high as 1,000 to 2,000. UK authorities have been actively concerned about this trend since 2011, with identified British fighters appearing in Islamic State propaganda videos since mid-2014. British fighters in Syria have carried out suicide bombings, with 26 confirmed deaths of individuals who traveled from the UK. The actual total could be higher due to monitoring difficulties. Approximately 2.9 million Muslims reside in the UK, with two-thirds having a South Asian background. While most are not involved in extremism, a small fringe community supports radical Islamism and violent extremism. The UK government is concerned about up to 250 individuals who have returned from Syria or Iraq and raised the terror threat level to \"severe\" in 2014. Many British foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq are males in their 20s, of South Asian origin, with ties to higher education and international connections. Many British foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq have criminal pasts, with a high proportion having a history of petty crime, extremist behavior, or being career criminals. Profile analysis of 23 UK fighters shows they were second-generation immigrants from various ethnic backgrounds, with an average age of 23. They had well-paying jobs, higher education, and some had criminal records. The UK's approach to the foreign fighter threat includes preventing travel using passport revocation and other measures. The UK government has taken measures to prevent individuals from traveling to or from the United Kingdom by revoking passports, barring reentry for foreign nationals, and stripping citizenship from dual nationals or naturalized citizens. Since 2010, 27 people have had their British citizenship revoked, mostly due to terrorism-related activities. Additionally, 29 individuals have had their passports refused or cancelled for planning terrorist activities abroad. Home Secretary Theresa May reported that 133 people have been excluded from the UK for reasons of national security or the \"public good,\" including 84 \"hate preachers.\" The UK has implemented a national Passenger Name Record system, collecting advanced passenger information for all commercial flights to the UK from outside the EU. The UK's approach to counterterrorism includes measures to prevent individuals from traveling to or from the country, such as revoking passports and stripping citizenship. The government also implements a national Passenger Name Record system for commercial flights, covering about two-thirds of total arrivals. Additionally, the Home Secretary has the power to impose terrorism prevention measures, and security services have wide-ranging powers to prevent attacks and prosecute offenders. Since 2010, 753 people have been arrested in the UK for terrorism-related offenses. Since 2010, 753 people have been arrested in the UK for terrorism-related offenses, with 148 successfully prosecuted. The UK government's counterterrorism strategy includes the Prevent component to combat Islamist extremism by banning hate preachers, countering radicalization in various settings, and removing extremist material from the Internet. A Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit has taken down over 65,000 unlawful terrorist-related websites. The UK government's Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, adopted in February 2015, broadens police and border officials' powers to confiscate passports of terrorism suspects for up to 30 days. It also introduces Temporary Exclusion Orders banning suspected terrorists with British passports from the country for two years. Individuals wishing to return may face prosecution or de-radicalization programs. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act in the UK allows for the confiscation of passports of terrorism suspects and the introduction of Temporary Exclusion Orders. Suspects wishing to return may face prosecution or de-radicalization programs. The new bill increases the standard of proof for imposing measures and requires mobile phone and Internet service providers to retain data for identifying individuals using specific IP addresses. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act in the UK introduces new provisions for air, maritime, and rail carriers to provide additional passenger information, puts the Prevent strategy on a statutory footing, requires institutions to report extremism, prohibits insurance coverage for terrorist ransom payments, and establishes a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. Critics raise concerns about potential ethnic profiling and the impact of Temporary Exclusion Orders. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act in the UK introduces new provisions for passenger information, Prevent strategy, extremism reporting, ransom payment prohibition, and Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. Critics raise concerns about ethnic profiling and Temporary Exclusion Orders. The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation estimates 800 to 1,500 individuals from Russia joining conflict in Syria and Iraq, mainly from Chechnya and North Caucasus. Some sources suggest up to 2,500 Chechens and North Caucasians fighting with Islamic State or Jabhat al-Nusra. In recent months, many commanders of the Caucasus Emirate have switched allegiance to the Islamic State. Chechen fighters, experienced from battling Russia since the 1990s, may take on leadership roles in extremist groups. Russian authorities are tightening border controls to prevent travel to conflict regions. Efforts are being made in Chechnya and Dagestan to discourage young men from joining armed groups in Syria or Iraq. Russia has implemented measures, such as police operations and legislation, to deter individuals from joining armed groups in Syria or Iraq. Tensions between the United States and Russia have hindered intelligence-sharing on foreign fighters. The ICSR estimates that up to 650 individuals from the Western Balkans have traveled to the conflict, with a majority initially joining Jabhat al-Nusra. Over 80% of fighters from the Western Balkans initially joined Jabhat al-Nusra, with a shift to the Islamic State group in 2013. Approximately 40 to 50 fighters from the region are thought to have been killed, while 70 to 90 are believed to have returned home. Data patterns show clusters of foreign fighters linked to radical communities in Bosnia, Serbia, and Albania. Several countries in the region introduced changes to their criminal codes in 2014 to address foreign fighter-related issues, with Bosnia-Herzegovina notably closing a legal loophole by criminalizing participation in foreign fighting. In September 2014, Bosnian authorities reportedly arrested 16 individuals. In September 2014, Bosnian authorities arrested 16 individuals under a new law criminalizing participation in foreign fighting, with a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Serbia, Albania, and Kosovo also made arrests in 2014 related to foreign fighter facilitation or travel to Syria. The United States has strong law enforcement and intelligence relationships with European countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, assisting in investigations and exchanging information on suspected terrorists and foreign fighters. Since 2001, the United States and the European Union have expanded law enforcement cooperation against terrorism, with increased dialogue on police, judicial, and border control matters. Information-sharing agreements have been established, and efforts to prevent radicalization and counter violent extremism have been made through sharing best practices on CVE measures. In 2010, an expert-level dialogue was convened for the first time on preventing violent extremism, and European governments have worked closely with the United States in the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) was founded in 2011 with the United States and 30 other countries working closely together. Efforts have focused on mobilizing resources for countering violent extremism, strengthening criminal justice capacities, and enhancing international cooperation. Challenges remain in promoting closer U.S.-European counterterrorism cooperation, particularly regarding data privacy and balancing security measures with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Concerns have been raised about European fighters in Syria and Iraq under the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Recently, U.S. and European counterterrorism cooperation has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon in Syria and Iraq. Measures include enhancing counter-radicalization, border security, aviation security, and information sharing to address potential threats posed by foreign fighters. Attorney General Eric Holder attended a meeting with European and North American interior ministers after the Paris attacks to discuss further actions. Holder attended a meeting with European and North American interior ministers to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. U.S. officials have been encouraging the EU to implement its own system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record data and make greater use of the Schengen Information System to counter the threat from returning fighters. Close bilateral law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon. The U.S. and EU have agreements for sharing strategic and personal information, airline passenger data, and financial data to combat threats like foreign fighters. However, differences in data privacy regulations between the U.S. and Europe could hinder cooperation. The EU has concerns about privacy rights and data protection in agreements like SWIFT and PNR with the US. Renewal of these agreements is approaching, but there are doubts about the level of protection for European citizens' personal information. Unauthorized disclosures of US surveillance activities have raised further scrutiny, with potential challenges in securing European Parliament approval for future agreements. Some U.S. officials question European plans to revoke passports of citizens fighting in Syria or Iraq, suggesting monitoring instead for intelligence gathering. Differences in freedom of speech laws could hinder U.S.-European cooperation in countering radicalization and extremist propaganda. In the past, U.S.-European tensions have arisen over racist and anti-Semitic content on U.S. websites, protected by free speech laws in the U.S. European officials are concerned about terrorist content hosted on U.S. servers, leading to calls for preemptive removal. U.S. tech firms resist European demands for filtering, fearing censorship and questioning compliance with local laws. U.S. industry leaders struggle with complying with local laws on online speech, especially regarding terrorism incitement. They oppose broad legal changes and preemptive filtering, fearing negative impacts on global Internet freedom. Law enforcement officials caution against automatically shutting down terrorist websites, citing their usefulness for intelligence gathering. Congressional hearings have addressed these issues in the 113th and 114th Congresses. Several congressional hearings in the 113th and 114th Congresses have focused on the foreign fighter phenomenon, particularly in Europe. Key hearings include discussions on cybersecurity, terrorism threats, ISIS terrorists with Western passports, worldwide threats to the homeland, and the threat posed by Islamist foreign fighters returning to Europe. Several congressional hearings in the 113th and 114th Congresses have addressed the foreign fighter phenomenon, focusing on topics such as cybersecurity, terrorism threats, ISIS terrorists with Western passports, worldwide threats to the homeland, and the threat posed by Islamist foreign fighters returning to Europe. Key hearings included discussions on the Visa Waiver Program and combating terrorist travel. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program is a key focus in congressional hearings addressing the threat of Islamist extremism. Concerns about terrorists entering the U.S. under the program have led to legislation to enhance security measures since the September 11 attacks. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program has been subject to legislative changes, including the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 and the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The latter required VWP countries to meet security standards, submit biographical information through ESTA before traveling, and undergo database checks for approval. This enhanced security measures for individuals entering the U.S. under the VWP. Several pieces of legislation on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) were introduced in the 113th Congress to enhance security measures, including screening at the port of departure and submitting information through ESTA. Some proposed measures aimed to further enhance VWP security, while others suggested temporarily suspending the program or the participation of certain countries. Several pieces of legislation were introduced in the 114th Congress to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program's security elements, including measures to suspend a country's participation if security information is not provided. Senator Dan Coats introduced legislation to improve security controls and increase information-sharing requirements for VWP participating countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) may suspend countries for not cooperating with information-sharing requirements due to recent terrorist attacks. Despite security concerns, many in Congress recognize the program's economic importance for international trade and tourism. In FY2013, 20 million people arrived in the US under the VWP, spending nearly $80 billion. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for its role in facilitating commerce and tourism. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is supported as a key facilitator of transatlantic commerce and tourism, with strengthened security controls through ESTA. Additional biographic information requirements for VWP travelers aim to address security concerns about foreign fighters while preserving trade and travel. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about current European counterterrorism laws. Some Members of Congress question if European counterterrorism laws can combat the foreign fighter threat. EU may amend terrorism definition to criminalize \"jihadi travel\" and related activities. US encourages partners to comply with UNSCR 2178. EU updating terrorism definition would be welcomed. Many experts believe that updating the EU's common terrorism definition to criminalize foreign fighter-related offenses could be controversial in some European countries. Harmonizing member state laws on \"jihadi travel\" at the EU level may face hurdles due to differences in legal systems and implementation delays. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress about European information-sharing and support for an EU-wide proposal on airline Passenger Name Record data to enhance tracking capabilities. Congressional support for U.S.-EU agreements on Passenger Name Record data and SWIFT as crucial tools in counterterrorism efforts. U.S. border control measures and visa policies remain key issues for Congress in addressing the foreign fighter threat. Congressional decisions on intelligence reforms and data privacy could impact U.S.-European cooperation. Members of Congress may influence European responses to foreign fighters through contacts with European lawmakers. The curr_chunk discusses the participation of European countries in the European Union, Schengen area, and the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. It also touches on the dynamics of foreign fighter recruitment patterns in the Syrian conflict, particularly focusing on the appeal of requests for material support based on Islamic religious injunctions. The power of requests to convince individuals to become foreign fighters in Syria may be limited, as flows are small compared to the global Sunni Muslim population. Imbalances in fighter flows suggest differences in social and political conditions. Islamic State issued an appeal to potential foreign fighters in August 2014. The Islamic State organization issued an appeal to potential foreign recruits in August 2014, comparing travel to Iraq and Syria to the hijrah in Islam's foundational story. This appeal urged Muslim professionals to prioritize repentance and answering the call to hijrah. The Islamic State organization urges Muslim professionals to prioritize repentance and answer the call to hijrah, especially after the establishment of the Khilafah. They emphasize the importance of experts, professionals, and specialists in strengthening the structure of the Khilafah. The organization warns recruits of potential challenges and reminds them that the Khilafah is led by human beings who are not infallible. In January 2015, Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani called for supporters to join the group and carry out attacks in their home countries. The group's English-language magazine featured an article praising male and female foreign recruits, with imagery of a traveler in a Western airport heading to \"the land of Islam.\""
