This program will help stabilize the economy, housing market, and neighborhoods in the United States. Additionally, it will preserve assets of government-sponsored mortgage enterprises and reduce taxpayer losses. The \"Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"capital improvement\" and \"covered mortgage\" for the purpose of implementing a principal modification program to reduce foreclosures. This program aims to stabilize the economy, housing market, and neighborhoods by assisting homeowners with underwater mortgages. The \"Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012\" defines terms for a principal modification program to assist homeowners with underwater mortgages. Homeowners must have a mortgage amount exceeding the property value, be delinquent or at risk of default, and have a documented financial hardship. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The \"Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012\" defines key terms for a principal modification program aimed at assisting homeowners with underwater mortgages. Terms include \"enterprise,\" \"homeowner,\" \"investor,\" \"pilot program,\" and \"shared appreciation mortgage modification.\" The \"Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012\" establishes pilot programs for shared appreciation mortgage modifications to assist homeowners with underwater mortgages by reducing loan-to-value ratios. The \"Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012\" establishes pilot programs for shared appreciation mortgage modifications to assist homeowners with underwater mortgages. These modifications include reducing the principal amount of the mortgage by up to 115% immediately and to 95% within 3 years, reducing interest rates if necessary, and adjusting periodic payments to be affordable for the homeowner. The mortgage modification program includes reducing principal amount and interest rates, requiring homeowners to pay a percentage of property value increase to investors after refinancing or selling. The mortgage modification program involves reducing principal and interest rates to ensure a positive net present value for investors. The value of the property securing the mortgage is determined by an independent licensed appraiser or automated valuation model. The value of real property securing a covered mortgage is determined close to the homeowner's participation in a pilot program. The investor is responsible for the initial cost of appraisal, which may be deducted from the homeowner's payment. The cost must be reasonable. The cost of an appraisal or other determination of value under paragraph (1) must be reasonable as determined by the Director and the Federal Housing Commissioner. In the case of refinancing or sale of real property securing a covered mortgage, the investor may request a second appraisal at their expense by an independent licensed appraiser if they believe the sale price is not accurate. Each pilot program for shared appreciation mortgage modification must include eligibility criteria for reducing the principal amount. Homeowners are ineligible for reduction if they are delinquent on more than 3 payments or create additional liens on the property. The Director requires homeowners participating in the pilot program to enter into necessary agreements to ensure compliance. Each pilot program mandates servicers to provide homeowners with clear instructions on maintaining and submitting documentation for capital improvements. The pilot program requires servicers to provide notices to homeowners before accepting a shared appreciation mortgage modification or selling/refinancing the property. Servicers must offer shared appreciation mortgage modifications to a random sample of homeowners with covered mortgages. The Director also oversees negotiations regarding mortgage insurance. The pilot program allows enterprises to negotiate shared appreciation mortgage modifications with mortgage insurance providers without impairing lien status. Annual studies and reports on pilot programs are required by the Director and Federal Housing Commissioner. The pilot program allows enterprises to negotiate shared appreciation mortgage modifications with mortgage insurance providers without impairing lien status. A report must be submitted to Congress at the end of each 1-year period for 3 years. After 2 years from the enactment of the Act, no new agreements can be made under the pilot program for shared appreciation mortgage modifications."
